AB  - We investigated the concordance of taxonomic richness patterns and their environmental correlates for assemblages of benthic macroinvertebrates, riparian birds, sedimentary diatoms, fish, planktonic crustaceans, and planktonic rotifers in 186 northeastern U.S. lakes. Taxon counts were standardized with respect to sampling effort using rarefaction. The degree of concordance among assemblage richness measures was low, but this was at least partly attributable to measurement precision. Aspects of lake morphology (area, depth) superseded other environmental features (climate, human development, water chemistry, nearshore physical habitat) as correlates of assemblage richness and were the strongest source of concordance. The benthic macroinvertebrates, birds, fish, and zooplankton all showed positive associations between richness and lake area. The diatoms showed negligible associations between richness and area and negative associations between richness and depth. Associations with human development were much weaker than with lake morphology and varied from positive (fish, planktonic crustaceans) to negative (diatoms). We conclude that taxonomic richness alone may be of ambiguous value as an indicator of biological integrity in lakes and that its natural drivers must be controlled for prior to assessing anthropogenic effects.

AB  - Human activities have intensively relied on and utilized riparian areas that have led to their substantial degradation. This is the reason why easy-to-use, reliable, inexpensive monitoring tools that describe the ecosystem integrity of riparian areas need to be developed. Bio-indicators are such tools, with many recommending the use of ground-dwelling insects. This study evaluates the use of diversity indices on ground-dwelling insects for three representative riparian habitat types of Greece. The studied areas were along torrents with intermittent flow and natural woody riparian vegetation within a flat or hilly landscape and along a stream with perennial flow with woody monoculture riparian plantation vegetation. Based on the number of different species identified and the diversity indices, the riparian habitats along the torrents presented the greatest diversity due to the natural vegetation with the more complex canopy structure. Overall the significant differences found, indicate the usefulness of insects and particularly Silpha obscura (Coleoptera: Silphidae) for evaluating riparian habitats in agricultural dominated landscapes of Greece and the Mediterranean.

AB  - Methods that provide rapid assessments of changing ecosystems at multiple scales are needed to inform management to address undesirable change. We developed a remote-sensing method in partnership with, and for use by, natural resource managers to predict annually stand condition of floodplain forests along Australia's longest river, the Murray River. A measure of stand condition, which was developed in collaboration with responsible natural resource managers, is a function of plant area index, crown extent, and the percentage live basal area. We surveyed a broad range of spatial and temporal variation in condition, built predictive stand-condition models using satellite-derived variables, and validated predictions with surveys of new sites. A multiyear model using data from 2 drought years and a year following extensive floods provided better predictions of stand condition than did models on the basis of the data for individual years. The model provided good predictions for data collected after the build for 50 sites and for resurveys of build sites in later years (R(2)0.86). There was limited, temporary improvement in stand condition after the extensive flooding (2010 to late 2010) that followed a 13-year (1997 to early 2010) drought. Forest condition can be mapped accurately and annually at medium resolution (25x25m) for large areas (100,000sha) if quantitative ground surveys, satellite imagery, machine learning, and future validation are combined. Regular assessments of forest condition can be related to likely causes of change by using regular, rapid assessments and hence can provide important management information.

AB  - Natural genetic diversity provides a powerful tool to study the complex interrelationship between metabolism and growth. Profiling of metabolic traits combined with network-based and statistical analyses allow the comparison of conditions and identification of sets of traits that predict biomass. However, it often remains unclear why a particular set of metabolites is linked with biomass and to what extent the predictive model is applicable beyond a particular growth condition. A panel of 97 genetically diverse Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions was grown in near-optimal carbon and nitrogen supply, restricted carbon supply, and restricted nitrogen supply and analyzed for biomass and 54 metabolic traits. Correlation-based metabolic networks were generated from the genotype-dependent variation in each condition to reveal sets of metabolites that show coordinated changes across accessions. The networks were largely specific for a single growth condition. Partial least squares regression from metabolic traits allowed prediction of biomass within and, slightly more weakly, across conditions (cross-validated Pearson correlations in the range of 0.27-0.58 and 0.21-0.51 and P values in the range of <0.001-<0.13 and <0.001-<0.023, respectively). Metabolic traits that correlate with growth or have a high weighting in the partial least squares regression were mainly condition specific and often related to the resource that restricts growth under that condition. Linear mixed-model analysis using the combined metabolic traits from all growth conditions as an input indicated that inclusion of random effects for the conditions improves predictions of biomass. Thus, robust prediction of biomass across a range of conditions requires condition-specific measurement of metabolic traits to take account of environment-dependent changes of the underlying networks.

AB  - Environmental disturbance generates changes in local abiotic and biotic conditions, which affect the physiological condition of the organisms. However, most of the studies dealing with environmental disturbance have focused only on species diversity, and often ignore the species' health to evaluate habitat quality. Recently, through tools that evaluate the body condition of individuals, some studies have demonstrated that it is possible to know how species respond to environmental changes. In this study, we evaluated the effect of local and landscape parameters on different indicators of body condition and abundance of three dung beetle species in a fragmented Tropical rainforest in Mexico. We measured beetle's body size and three indicators of physiological condition (body dry mass, lipid and muscle mass) in 15 sites with different vegetation configuration. In general, abundance, body size and physiological condition of all species were sensitive to different landscape features. Onthophagus rhinolophus, a species typically found in conserved forest, unexpectedly showed a positive relation of body condition with landscape diversity and amount of edge, and the presence of altered sites remnants favored its body dry mass, muscle mass and body size. Nevertheless, Onthophagus batesi and Canthon cyanellus, mostly found in disturbed areas, exhibited better body condition when there were conserved habitats nearby. Therefore, we showed that O. rhinolophus is a sensitive species supporting reduced levels of habitat disturbance, while O. batesi and C. cyanellus are tolerant species that need conserved forests nearby. We highlight the importance of understanding the effect of environmental disturbance on the species' body condition in order to maintain not only abundant, but also healthy populations of wild animals in fragmented forests.

AB  - Wild yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were sampled from five lakes in each of two metal contamination gradients in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada (n = 1324) and Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada (n = 1125) in the spring and summer of 2002 and 2003, respectively, in order to examine growth patterns, longevity, and the influences of season and region on fish condition. Fish from Rouyn-Noranda began rapid growth at a young age, whereas fish from Sudbury lakes showed slow growth rates between ages 0-3, after which growth rates improved. Fish from contaminated lakes grew faster and died younger than fish from reference lakes in both contamination gradients. Fish from Sudbury had lower condition than in Rouyn-Noranda, higher condition occurred in summer than spring, and fish from contaminated lakes had lower condition than those from cleaner lakes. Tissue Zn concentrations were correlated with fish condition and showed strong temporal stability. However, it is more likely that Zn covariates, such as Cd or Cu (which were more temporally variable) influenced condition, suggesting that long-term, broad-scale processes are more important than short-term, lake-specific processes for establishing growth patterns, longevity, and fish condition in metal-contaminated systems. Results from this study reveal that fish condition must be interpreted in the light of regional, seasonal, and other factors that can potentially influence fish growth patterns. Ecological risk assessments that fail to take these factors into account may draw erroneous conclusions about risk to indigenous populations.

AB  - Among other regional impact categories in LCA, land use still lacks a suitable assessment method regarding the least developed "soil ecological quality" impact pathway. The goals of this study are to scope the framework addressing soil ecological functions and to improve the development of regionalized characterization factors (CFs). A spatially explicit approach was developed and illustrated for the Canadian context using three different regional scales and for which the extent of spatial variability was assessed.
   A model framework based on the multifunctional character of soil and the ecosystem services defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is suggested. This framework includes land use impacts on soil ecological quality evaluated regarding the change in soil capacity to fulfill a range of soil ecological functions. Four impact indicators, namely erosion resistance, groundwater recharge, mechanical, and physicochemical filtration, proposed by the functional method of Baitz (2002), were used to assess three major degraded regulating services: erosion regulation, freshwater regulation, and water purification. Spatially differentiated CFs were calculated based on the principles proposed by the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative for two Canadian spatial models (15 ecozones, 193 ecoregions) along with a non-spatial one (one generic). Seven representative land use types were tested.
   Using the ecozone-based scale, an overall result comparison between the non-spatial and spatial models indicates significant differences between ranges across land use types and results up to four times larger than what the generic scale can capture. This highlights the importance of introducing a regionalized assessment. When considering the impacts from a specific land use type, such as urban land use, generic CFs fail to adequately represent spatial CFs because they tend to be highly dependent on the biogeographical conditions of the location. When comparing all three resolution scales, CF results calculated using the ecoregions spatial scale generally show a larger spread across each land use type. Interesting variations and extreme scenarios are revealed which could not be observed using a coarser scale-based model such as the ecozone resolution scheme.
   This work demonstrates the accomplishment of developing spatially differentiated CFs addressing impacts of different land use types on soil ecological functions. For a large territorial area spreading over many biomes, such as Canada, accounting for ecological unit boundaries proves to be necessary since the generic scale is not sufficiently representative. An evaluation of the extent of spatial differentiation emphasized the influence on the variability of regionalized CFs.

AB  - The Big Darby Creek watershed, a highly valued ecosystem in central Ohio, USA, threatened by intensive agriculture and suburban encroachment, served as an example of how case specifics can be applied to refine and direct the planning and problem formulation stage of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ecological risk assessment framework. Big Darby Creek was selected as one of five national pilot risk assessments designed to provide specific examples of how to perform an ecological risk assessment and, at the same time, to refine and improve the assessment process. The case study demonstrates how characteristics of the watershed were used to give direction to the components of establishing goals, identifying and characterizing the resource and threats to it, selecting appropriate assessment endpoints, and developing conceptual models. The hypotheses generated in the conceptual model describe expected relationships and interactions between the ecosystem at risk, identified potential stressors, and ecological effects and set the groundwork for the analysis phase that follows problem formulation.

AB  - The scarcity of environmental data means that other sources of information are needed to complement empirical evidence for conservation decisions. By regularly interacting with their local environment, protected area practitioners may generate local ecological knowledge (LEK) that can be used to inform management decisions. However, the accuracy of LEK is generally poorly understood, and no studies have assessed the accuracy of practitioners' personal knowledge, leading to a vital gap in our ability to best use this information to guide management. We measured the accuracy of practitioners' knowledge of the vegetation condition within protected areas, relative to an empirical vegetation condition assessment tool. Despite the vast majority of practitioners having only personal experiences to inform their judgments, we found that almost 60% of practitioners made assessments of vegetation condition that matched the empirical condition estimates. When inaccurate, practitioners tended to be conservative in their estimates of condition. Although underestimating condition in this way may waste resources through unnecessary management actions, this is likely to be preferable to overestimating condition and thus failing to protect biodiversity by prematurely ceasing restoration programs. We found no relationship between the accuracy of practitioners' LEK and their level of experience as a practitioner, their level of education, or their gender. We believe that under many circumstances practitioners can be a valuable and cost-effective source of information about the condition of the protected areas they manage, but that more research is needed to understand the wide range of factors that may contribute to how land managers build LEK and how management agencies can assist practitioners to build a good understanding of the conditions in their reserves.

AB  - Natural landscapes are increasingly subjected to anthropogenic pressure and fragmentation resulting in reduced ecological condition. In this study we examined the relationship between ecological condition and the soundscape in fragmented forest remnants of south-east Queensland, Australia. The region is noted for its high biodiversity value and increased pressure associated with habitat fragmentation and urbanisation. Ten sites defined by a distinct open eucalypt forest community dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora ssp. variegata) were stratified based on patch size and patch connectivity. Each site underwent a series of detailed vegetation condition and landscape assessments, together with bird surveys and acoustic analysis using relative soundscape power. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that the measurement of relative soundscape power reflects ecological condition and bird species richness, and is dependent on the extent of landscape fragmentation. We conclude that acoustic monitoring technologies provide a cost effective tool for measuring ecological condition, especially in conjunction with established field observations and recordings.

AB  - Water treatment is an important ecosystem service in natural systems and wetlands are well-known to have increased functionality in this regard. The rehabilitation of productive wetlands plays an important role in improving this functionality in degraded wetlands, but it is not well-known to what extent these activities improve acid mine drainage impacted waters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of the effect of such interventions on the ecological functioning of a test wetland affected by acid mine drainage. A degraded wetland influenced by acid mine drainage in the Mpumalanga Province of South Africa was identified for the case study. This site was rehabilitated using a variety of hard (e.g., weirs/dams) and soft (e.g., earth berms) structures and examined to determine whether its ecological functioning (i.e., the improvement of water quality) and biotic community structures have improved. From the results it was evident that a substantial improvement in water quality occurred below the rehabilitated area, even though the wetland still continued to receive acid mine drainage. This was observed through the decrease in metal pollution in conjunction with an increase in pH and alkalinity levels. This resulted in increased productivity, reduced toxicity (embryotoxicity and teratogenicity), as well as changes in the biotic community structures which were a reflection of a less polluted environment. The study has shown that the rehabilitation of ecological infrastructure can be used to mitigate the effect of coal mining related pollution such as acid mine drainage. In the face of ever increasing land use activities that occur globally to meet the demands of growing populations, this information can be useful to mitigate negative residual influences resulting from these activities, e.g. acid mine drainage.

AB  - The increased pollution in ecosystems reinforces the importance of both chemical monitoring and biological monitoring of streams and rivers, as an effective water quality-based approach to assess aquatic ecosystem health. In this study, gudgeon (Gobio gobio) and mullet (Mugil cephalus) liver histopathology (biomarker) and some macroinvertebrate community indexes and metrics (bioindicator) were used to evaluate the effect of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Febros (Avintes) in Febros River water quality and ecosystem health. Regarding macroinvertebrate communities, the Belgian Biotic Index (BBI) and Iberian Biological Monitoring Working Party (IBMWP) indexes suggested that Febros water was slightly polluted, even though the worst situation was found downstream the WWTP discharge. Concerning community metrics, upstream percent of individuals in five numerically dominant taxa (80%) was slightly more superior than the downstream (78%). The presence of intolerant or sensible individuals, determined by percent of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera individuals and number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera families metrics, was higher upstream WWTP, reflecting a better water quality. The histopathology shows the presence of hepatic lesions in gudgeon and mullet. The statistical analysis of the lesion gradation showed that only necrosis was significantly higher in gudgeon captured downstream the WWTP, while differences were not observed for mullet. The multivariate analysis of data confirmed the existence of differences in hepatic lesions between gudgeon and mullet and between sampling sites. Regarding macroinvertebrate community, this analysis showed that the organic contamination reflected by the BBI and IBMWP indexes values was a determinant factor in the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrates. This work showed that the study of different biological organization levels can be used for a better assessment of ecosystem ecological integrity and can be used as a tool to reveal anthropogenic activity effects in macroinvertebrate diversity and in fish liver pathology from Febros River.

AB  - Changes in land-uses and cover are strong drivers of stream degradation worldwide. In Mediterranean ecoregions, land conversion from forest with native species to tree plantations, agricultural, and urban areas have drastically increased in recent years. Here, we examined the influence of land-use types on water quality (physical and chemical variables) and biota (benthic algae, macroinvertebrates, and fishes). We conducted field surveys between December-March 2016 (dry season) in 24 sites located across four land-use types including native vegetation (NV), tree plantation (TP), agriculture (Ag), and urban (Ur) within the Chilean Mediterranean ecoregion. We calculated metrics and multivariate statistics to assess correlations between biological and environmental variables. Significant differences between land-uses were found for environmental/physicochemical variables and the three biotic groups (i.e., benthic algae, macroinvertebrates, and fishes). We found higher chlorophyll-a biomass for TP, Ag, and Ur compared to NV streams. The macroinvertebrate diversity of sensitive taxa (i.e., Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) and water quality were lower in land draining streams with human uses, other than NV, with the most evident impact found in Ag and Ur streams. NV and TP streams had a lower Diptera density and lower percentage of non-insect taxa. Fish richness and diversity were not affected by land-use. However, cold-water fishes (both native and introduced) were closely associated with NV and TP streams whereas warm-water fishes (mostly introduced) were closely associated with Ag and Ur streams. Multivariate analysis revealed that both local habitat and catchment-scale variables influenced each biological assemblage. Our findings suggest that benthic algae, macroinvertebrates, and fish populations are good indicators of human land-use disturbances, with Ag and Ur areas being the most detrimental for freshwater biota.

AB  - Urbanisation of riverine landscape is an increasing threat to the functionality of river ecosystems. In this study, we identify and classify macroinvertebrates indicator signature traits and ecological preferences.We hypothesised that urban pollution would differentially influence the distribution of macro invertebrate traits and ecological preferences along a gradient of water quality deterioration. Hence, we identified and classified potential biological indicators traits and ecological preferences that were deemed tolerant of or sensitive to urban pollution gradient in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Physicochemical variables (water temperature, depth, flow velocity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate, phosphate), and macroinvertebrates were collected from 2008 to 2012 seasonally during the wet and dry seasons once in a month in 11 stations in eight river systems. The results based on RLQ, fourth-corner and Kruskal-Wallis analyses indicate that traits/ecological preferences such as tegumental/cutaneous respiration, cased/tubed body armouring, a preference for silty water, bivoltinism, burrowing and a high tolerance for oxygen depletion, were statistically signifi-cantly associated with the heavily impacted stations. These traits were positively correlated with physico-chemical variables such as EC, nitrate and phosphate indicative of urban pollution. On the other hand, traits/ecological preferences such as permanent attachment, crawling, swimming, univoltinism and a moderate sensitivity to oxygen depletion were associated with the least impacted stations and were negatively correlated with physico-chemical variables indicative of urban pollution. Overall, the observed differential responses of traits and ecological preferences to urban pollution along a gradient of water quality impairment suggest that traits and ecological preferences can serve as useful biological indicators and thus supports the growing evidence of the utility of the trait-based approach. 0 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Frogs are in decline worldwide, and are known to be sensitive indicators of environmental change. Floodplains of the MurrayDarting Basin in southeastern Australia have been altered in many ways by livestock grazing, by the introduction of exotic fish, and by changes to flooding regimes. These changes have led to declines in wetland condition and hence to the availability of habitat for wetland frogs. This study examined relationships between frogs, wetland condition and livestock grazing intensity at 26 wetlands on the floodplain of the Murrumbidgee River. Frog communities, species richness, and some individual species of frogs declined with increased grazing intensity. Wetland condition also declined with increased grazing intensity, particularly the aquatic vegetation and water quality components. There were clear relationships between frog communities and wetland condition, with several taxa responding to aquatic and fringing vegetation components of wetland condition. Thus, grazing intensity appeared to influence frog communities through changes in wetland habitat quality, particularly the vegetation. Reduced stocking rates may result in improved wetland condition and more diverse frog communities. River management to provide natural seasonal inundation of floodplain wetlands may also enhance wetland condition, frog activity and reproductive success. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Trait-based approaches may give insights into underlying mechanisms of relationships between biological communities and environmental stressors, and are increasingly used in ecological studies, but are only very recently considered for freshwater riverine microalgae. Here, we i) review the research trend in riverine microalgae during the past 26 years in order to conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis for global trends in the research field, ii) summarize the use of algae traits in riverine biomonitoring and iii) propose future research perspectives. The bibliometric analysis showed that the annual number of publications on microalgae increased significantly from 1991 to 2016, although their proportions to total numbers of scientific articles remained steady. The studies have become increasingly concerned on issues arisen from global environmental changes such as "eutrophication", "pollution", "land use", "biomonitoring", "biodiversity", "functional group", etc. The use of algae traits in biomonitoring has become popular and includes e.g. functional diversity, cell size, guild, life form, eco-morphology, spore formation as well as algal quality. Here we collate all relevant algal traits, their different categories and propose their responses to resource supply and disturbance frequency in a conceptual model, which should be validated in future studies. In order to expand the knowledge and future use of microalgae in biomonitoring research efforts should also include: i) description of relationships between algal traits and ecosystem functions (e.g., nutrient uptake, metabolism, energy transfer across the food web) and underlying mechanisms; ii) selection of robust traits reflecting and disentangling the effects of multiple stressors; iii) water resource management in an interdisciplinary manner linking risk assessment and management scenarios by an integrated modelling system using microalgae.

AB  - We evaluated a simple bioassessment method based on a priori river typology to predict benthic macroinvertebrate fauna in riffle sites of rivers in the absence of human influence. Our approach predicted taxon lists specific to four river types differing in catchment area with a method analogous to the site-specific RIVPACS-type models. The reference sites grouped in accordance with their type in NMS ordination, indicating that the typology efficiently accounted for natural variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages. Compared with a null model, typology greatly increased the precision of prediction and sensitivity to detect human impairment and strengthened the correlation of the ratio of observed-to-expected number of predicted taxa (O/E) with the measured stressor variables. The performance of the typology-based approach was equal to that of a RIVPACS-type predictive model that we developed. Exclusion of rarest taxa with low occurrence probabilities improved the performance of both approaches by all criteria. With an increasing inclusion threshold of occurrence probability, especially the predictive model sensitivity first increased but then decreased. Many common taxa with intermediate type-specific occurrence probabilities were consistently missing from impacted sites, a result suggesting that these taxa may be especially important in detecting human disturbances. We conclude that if a typology-based approach such as that suggested by the European Union's Water Framework Directive is required, the O/E ratio of type-specific taxa can be a useful metric for assessment of the status of riffle macroinvertebrate communities. Successful application of the approach, however, requires biologically meaningful river types with a sufficient pool of reference sites for each type.

AB  - In Canada, there are still extensive tracts of boreal forest consisting of stands that have resulted from natural disturbances. The country's forests are a mosaic made up to a large extent of old-growth forest that is beyond commercial harvesting age, especially in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. As areas of boreal forest under management steadily expand, as demand for forest products continues to grow and as rotation periods become shorter in response to silvicultural practices, the forest cover will inevitably become younger, causing changes to the structure and composition of the mosaic of forest stands that will affect the aspect of entire landscapes. These changes may have an adverse impact on biological diversity. Forest birds are one group of living organisms that may respond quickly to the advent of younger forest landscapes, thereby acting as a biological indicator. In this paper, we discuss some of the problems that birds face as a result of the truncation of the age-class distribution of managed forest landscapes in eastern Canada's coniferous boreal forest, using data obtained from our research in the Clay Belt region of Quebec and Ontario. More specifically, we look at how birds respond to changes in forest structure and composition in terms of time since natural disturbances, and to variation in dead trees availability. We then consider the impact of the prospective rejuvenation of the forest cover in managed forest landscapes, and possible solutions aimed at mitigating that impact through new management strategies based on the maintenance of forest ecosystem diversity. The ability of these new management strategies to maintain the ecological integrity of bird communities provides an indication of their potential as tools for contributing to the maintenance of biological diversity in a broader sense.

AB  - There is an increasing interest in improving energy efficiency in buildings due to the increased awareness about environmental impact and energy cost. Natural ventilation is an environmentally friendly technique which has become more attractive way for reducing energy use while it also provides acceptable comfort conditions. The research shows a case study building in which the natural ventilation effect due to wind-driven forces on indoor comfort conditions is evaluated. Moreover, the architectural solutions selected during the building design phase to improve the natural ventilation behaviour are successfully validated in a full-scale building. The indoor comfort conditions are evaluated through contrasted performance indicators: draught risk (DR), predicted percentage of dissatisfied people (PPD) and predicted mean vote (PMV) indexes. The results show that air movement due to natural ventilation allows increasing indoor air temperature maintaining the initial comfort conditions. Therefore, the mechanical air conditioning use can be postponed until the indoor air temperature is high and would, consequently, reduce the total building energy consumption. Thereby, a proper natural ventilation focus during the initial design stage could improve the building energy efficiency without compromising the indoor comfort conditions.

AB  - Multimetric indices (MMI) are extremely useful indicators of anthropogenic disturbance, but that usefulness is a function of how well they have been calibrated for natural spatial and temporal variability. Nonetheless, there have been very few studies regarding the effects of such natural variability on MMI scores and metric selection, and even fewer studies on the effects of minimizing the mean of metric correlations. To do so, we calibrated and validated several adjusted and unadjusted MMI for natural gradients with different metric compositions via datasets from 161 samples collected at 83 stream sites from 2008 to 2012 across the Li River Basin, China. We used random forests to model the variation of individual metrics with natural gradients, then used their residual distributions as the adjusted response range of each metric, independent of natural environmental influence. To select core metrics for MMI, the candidate adjusted and unadjusted metrics were all screened through reproducibility, sensitivity, and redundancy tests. The adjusted MMI were more precise, less biased, and more sensitive than the unadjusted MMI. Although the unadjusted MMI were as responsive as the adjusted MMI, the unadjusted MMI increased risks of inferring type I land type II errors. Minimizing the mean of metric correlations as well as avoiding biological information redundancy improved the performance of unadjusted and adjusted MMI, but only improved precision for the adjusted MMI. Using multi-season and multi-year samples proved to be an effective and efficient assessment method to diminish natural seasonal variation in adjusted MMI, but not unadjusted MMI. We found that the adjusted MMI with the lowest mean of metric correlations using multi-season and multi-year samples performed best and reduced seasonal variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background. Tropical mountain rivers are strategic sources of water for human development while biological communities are indicators of the status of these ecosystems. However, volcanic basins close to large urban areas are affected by increasing human pressures that threaten the future of these ecosystems and their benefits to society. Goals. This paper analyzes the evolution of the responses of the aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages in the face of increasing pressures in the Birris River basin, which is essential for providing food and energy for the Greater Metropolitan Area of Costa Rica. The hypothesis that volcanic headwater communities are highly vulnerable to human impacts was tested. Methods. Composition and structure of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages were assessed along main river channels over two years. Results. The spatial variability of assemblages was related to organic pollution and the self-purification capacity of the river. Temporal variability was mainly explained by the intra-annual climate variability (seasonality). Macroinvertebrate assemblages were dominated by Chironomidae (Diptera), Simuliidae (Diptera), and Baetidae (Ephemeroptera) throughout the year. High flows during the rainy season (May to December) reduced density while diversity peaked at the end of that season. Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera reached their maximum abundance during the dry season, while Diptera showed maximum richness at the end of the rainy season. Conclusions. Biological communities showed spatial and temporal adaptations to the main environmental stresses, including high levels of organic pollution. However, the high slope of river channels favors the self-purification processes, which offer an opportunity for the recovery of ecological integrity combined with control of the organic discharges. More information is needed on taxonomy and autoecology of aquatic fauna and flora in these fragile volcanic environments that are strategic for the protection of water resources in the tropics.

AB  - In the past decades, afforestation of grassland landscapes has gained importance both as an economic activity and a mechanism to mitigate anthropogenic carbon emissions. This study evaluates the effect of pine afforestation on grassland streams analyzing changes in two integrative ecological indicators: leaf litter breakdown and primary production. We compare those results with changes in structural attributes of benthic biota (primary producers and invertebrates). Six contiguous first-order streams were selected in the upper basin of the Ctalamochita river (Cordoba, Argentina): three reference streams draining grasslands and three streams draining Pinus elliottii afforestations. Two in situ experiments were performed to compare leaf litter breakdown and primary production between grassland and afforested streams. Additionally, invertebrate assemblages in leaf litter and riffles, and periphyton standing stock were sampled and assessed. Nine out of 26 structural indicators showed differences between stream types but indicators measuring changes at the basal level of the food web (i.e. detritus and primary producers) were less sensitive than those recording changes in consumers. Our attempt to measure direction and magnitude of changes on stream functioning following afforestation was halted by our simple implemented methodology (i.e. leaf pack method for leaf litter decay and biofilm accrual on natural stone substrates for primary production assessments); only 1 out of 4 indicators differed. We argue that the lack of strong differences in elemental measurements of primary production and needle decay between afforested and grassland streams resulted from compensating opposing forces controlling such processes, i.e. higher grazing vs. higher sunlight in grassland streams and higher shredding vs. lower microbial decomposition mediated by lower temperature in afforested streams. Attributes related to the invertebrate compartment showed the highest sensitivity to afforestation, emphasizing their value as biological indicators of stream ecological integrity.

AB  - Coastal sand dunes are complex transitional systems hosting high levels of biodiversity and providing important benefits to society. In this paper we aimed to evaluate the multi-service nature of ecosystem services (ES) supply in the dunes of the Italian Adriatic coast within Natura 2000 (N2K) sites. We i) identified ES indicators and assessed the supply capacity (Climate regulation, Protection from wind and aerosol, Erosion regulation, Recreation and Tourism and Existence value of biodiversity) of natural dune ecosystems of European conservation concern; ii) upscaled this data to create an inventory of ES supply for all dune N2K sites in the study area; iii) explored the trade-offs among ES; and iv) summarized and spatially compared the overall multi-service value of the N2K sites.
   The study provides a method for quantifying the role of N2K sites in supplying benefits for our society. We found that the multi-service capacity of coastal dunes is uneven within sites and within administrative regions. This variability is related to both ecological (e.g. distribution, ecological integrity, extent and conservation status of dune habitats) and administrative (e.g. local implementation of the Habitats Directive) characteristics of the analysed area. ES are not coupled as several sites with high values for one ES show very low values for others.
   The results suggest that conservation actions should favour restoration of the natural dune zonation, since this underpins multi-service ES supply. The approach can distinguish regions with high ES values and regions where the paucity of protected areas represents a gap in ES supply, fact that offers an incentive to enhance the protection strategy but also suggests an urgent need to improve the N2K network by enlarging existent sites and including new ones.

AB  - 1. Habitat restoration is increasingly undertaken in degraded streams and rivers to help improve biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Follow-up assessments focused on outcomes for biodiversity have often found scant evidence for recovery, raising concerns about the efficacy of habitat restoration for improving ecological integrity. However, responses of other ecological variables, such as ecosystem process rates and the functional trait composition of biological assemblages, have been little evaluated.
   2. We assessed how the restoration of habitat heterogeneity affected multiple functional parameters in 20 boreal stream reaches encompassing both more and less extensively restored sites, as well as channelised and natural reference sites. We further assessed relationships between our functional parameters and a fluvial geomorphic measure of habitat heterogeneity.
   3. Leaf decomposition was positively related to habitat heterogeneity. This was associated with shifts in the functional composition of detritivore assemblages, with the most obligate litter consumers more prominent in reaches showing higher habitat heterogeneity. The deposition of fine particulate organic matter was consistently higher in restored than channelised sites, and was positively related to the heterogeneity gradient. Algal biomass accrual per unit area did not vary either with restoration or the heterogeneity gradient.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that restoration of river habitat heterogeneity can enhance retention and decomposition of organic matter, key ecosystem properties underpinning ecosystem functioning and service delivery. Significantly, enhanced litter decomposition was linked with a change in the functional composition rather than diversity of detritivore assemblages. Future evaluation of the success of habitat restorations should incorporate quantification of ecosystem processes and the functional traits of biota, in addition to measures of fluvial geomorphology and more traditional biotic metrics, to facilitate a more comprehensive and mechanistic assessment of ecological responses.

AB  - The EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires member states to manage their marine ecosystems with the goal of achieving Good Environmental Status (GES) of all European Seas by 2020. Member states assess GES according to 11 descriptors set out in the MSFD, and their associated indicators.
   An ecosystem service approach is increasingly being advocated to ensure sustainable use of the environment, and sets of indicators have been defined for ecosystem service assessments. We considered whether a selection of GES indicators related to biological descriptors, D1 Biodiversity, D2 Non-indigenous species, D4 Food webs and D6 Seafloor integrity, may provide information relevant to ecosystem services, potentially allowing use of collected environmental data for more than one purpose. Published lists of indicators for seven selected marine ecosystem services were compared to 296 biodiversity-related indicators included within the DEVOTOOL catalogue, established for screening marine biodiversity indicators for the MSFD. We concluded that 64 of these biodiversity indicators are directly comparable to the ecosystem service indicators under consideration. All 296 biodiversity indicators were then reassessed objectively to decide which of them could be useful as ecosystem service indicators. To carry out this step in a consistent and transparent manner, guidelines were developed among the co-authors that helped the decision making process for each individual indicator. 247 biodiversity indicators were identified as potentially useful ecosystem service indicators. By highlighting the comparability between ecosystem service and biodiversity indicators it is hoped that future monitoring effort can be used not only to ensure that GES is attained, but also that ecosystem service provision is maximised. It is recommended that these indicators should be tested across EU regional seas to see if they are useful in practice, and if ecosystem service assessments are comparable across regional seas.

AB  - The Rwenzori Mountains and Albertine Rift region of southwestern Uganda are part of a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot, but are currently facing pressures from intensified agriculture, mineral exploitation and hydroelectric power generation. This study was undertaken to assess the ecological water quality of Rwenzori rivers using biomonitoring metrics to determine the major factors shaping macroinvertebrate community structure in disturbed and undisturbed sites. We sampled macroinvertebrates at 66 sites along headwater tributaries and downstream areas of the Nyamwamba, Mubuku and Nyamugasani rivers, supplemented by five sites along the Kazinga channel and Lake George wetland, and identified a total of 32,579 macroinvertebrates to family level. Insecta was the most diverse taxon (45 families). Based on Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) scores, sites were classified into four ecological water quality groups as excellent (40 sites), good (16), fair (7) and poor (8). Upstream sites had the highest abundance of pollution-sensitive families such as Caenidae and Hydropsychidae, while downstream sites had high numbers of Chironomidae. Lorenz curves revealed a low degree of evenness with Gini coefficient values ranging from 0.75 to 0.94. Ordination analysis revealed that total phosphorus, specific conductivity, chloride and chemical oxygen demand were key environmental variables contributing to variation among the sites. The majority of sites did show little to no anthropogenic influence with the exception of downstream sites. The results of this study provide useful baseline reference data, to assess and better manage the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the ecological integrity of the region's aquatic systems. Furthermore, these datasets will advance the development of a regional family-level biotic index.

AB  - Species tolerances are frequently used in multi-metric ecological quality indices, and typically have the strongest responses to disturbances. Usually the tolerances of many species are based on expert judgment, with little support from empirical ecological or physiological data. This is particularly true for fish of Mediterranean-type rivers, in which there are many basin-endemic taxa with little information on basic life history traits. In addition, the apparent tolerance of native Mediterranean freshwater fish species to naturally harsh environments and their short-term resilience may mask responses to man-made pressures. Consequently, we evaluated different statistical techniques and procedures for quantifying Mediterranean lotic fish tolerances and compared expert judgment of species tolerances with empirically determined tolerance values. We used eight alternative approaches to compute fish tolerance values for the Mediterranean basins of SW Europe. Three types of approaches were used: (1) those based on the concept of niche breadth along an environment/pressure gradient (five models); (2) those based on deviations from expected values at disturbed sites as predicted by statistical models describing relationships between species and environmental variables (generalized linear modelling (GLM) and generalized additive modelling (CAM), two models); and (3) one model based on the relatively independent contributions of pressure variables to the data variation explained by statistical models. Tolerance estimates based on the used/available pressure gradient and the average general pressure value had the highest mean correlations with the expert judgment classification (mean r=0.4) and with the other approaches (mean r of 0.48 and 0.46, respectively). The high degree of uncertainty in tolerance estimates should be accounted for when applying them in ecological assessments. Results also highlights the need for better designed research to separate effects of natural and disturbance gradients on species occurrences and densities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Europe, water policy is currently undergoing considerable change as emphasised by the recent European Water Framework Directive (WFD), which requires the restoration and maintenance of "healthy" aquatic ecosystems by the assessment of their hydromorphological, chemical and biological characteristics. If the requirements of the WFD are to be met, effective biological tools are needed to measure the "health" of rivers at scales large enough to be useful for management. These tools need to be ecologically based, efficient, rapid and applicable in different ecological regions. Among potential indicators, fish assemblages are of particular interest because of their ability to integrate environmental variability at different spatial scales. To meet the goals of the WFD, the French Water Agencies and the Ministry of the Environment initiated a research programme to develop a fish-based index that would be applicable nationwide. Such an index should encompass the relative importance of geographic, ecoregional and local factors influencing the distribution of riverine fish. A variety of metrics based on occurrence and abundance data and reflecting different aspects of the fish assemblage structure and function were selected from available literature and for their potential to indicate degradation. Logistic and multiple linear regression procedures were applied, using an initial data set of 650 reference sites fairly evenly distributed across French rivers and defined by some easily measured regional and local characteristics, to elaborate the simplest possible response model that adequately explains the observed patterns of each metric for a given site. Models obtained for each metric were validated using two independent data sets of 88 reference sites and 88 disturbed sites. These procedures allowed us to select the most effective metrics in discriminating between reference and disturbed sites. This multimetric index of fish assemblages integrity could serve as a practical technical reference for conducting cost-effective biological assessments of lotic systems.

AB  - Proper assessments of degradation for lotic ecosystems are of a great importance, given that they provide essential ecosystem services and host some of the most endangered habitats. Currently, one of the most frequently used ways to assess lotic ecosystems integrity is the Water Framework Directive. It implies but important investments in material and human resources, while it is also time consuming. The implementation of a set of indicators, based on available public data, with the aim of assessing the lotic ecosystems integrity could be a good alternative, especially when focusing on large territories. The current study aims at creating a methodology to assess the degradation level of lotic ecosystems, by integrating the above-mentioned indicators into a GIS based multicriteria analysis. The proposed methodology was applied on a sector of one of the most important rivers in Romania, Mures. The results we have achieved proved the efficacy of this method. In analyses of this kind, the accuracy of the output is directly related to the quality of input data (resolution, update and generalization level), thus a key element in our research was to process and compatibilize the available data to increase accuracy.

AB  - Dryland ecosystems are experiencing dramatic climate change, either drier or wetter. However, the differences in response amplitudes of dryland ecosystems to drier and wetter climates have not been frequently discussed, especially when using composite indicators at large scales. This study explores the changing patterns of ecosystem vulnerability in China's drylands by comprehensively considering exposure, sensitivity and resilience indicators using leaf area index (LAI) datasets and meteorological data within two periods from 1982 to 1999 (P1) and from 2000 to 2016 (P2). The results show that nearly 57% of China's drylands have experienced drier conditions in 2000-2016 based on the average aridity index (AI) values compared with the conditions in 1982-1999. Compared with the conditions in 1982-1999, ecosystem vulnerability has increased in 78% of dryland, and ecosystem resilience has decreased in 46% of the area in 2000-2016. The amplitudes of vulnerability increase are higher in drier conditions than in wetter conditions. Ecosystem resilience has obviously increased in wetter conditions but has decreased in drier conditions, especially in farming-pastoral ecotones with an obvious land use change. Consequently, vegetation-climate composite indicators provide a holistic pattern of China's dryland ecosystem response to climate change, and the decreased ecosystem resilience in drier conditions in northeast China should be a warning signal under the national vegetation greening background. This research highlights that the impact of drying on ecosystem resilience leads the response of ecosystems to drier environment.

AB  - Green tea extract is plant-dervied natural. antioxidant. The objective of this study was to explore the antioxidative effect of green tea extract on the cryopreserved bull semen. Experiments were carried out on Achai breeding bulls of similar age at the Semen Production Unit, Harichand, District Charsadda, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Collection of semen was done using artificial vagina (42 degrees C) for three weeks. Semen was extended in egg yolk extender at various inclusion levels (0.0%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75 and 1.0%) of green tea extract. Testing was consummated for quality characteristics of post-thawed spermatozoa such as motility, viability and plasma membrane integrity. The data was statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance using SPSS. The highest significant (P<0.05) response was obtained in extenders containing 0.75% green tea extract for all studied parameters. Based on the findings of the current study, it can be concluded that supplementation of green tea extract in semen extender showed significant response on the post-thawed spermatozoa motility, viability and membrane integrity of Achai bull.

AB  - We review the applications of REL test as a technique for detecting injury and thereby forecasting survivability of transplanted seedlings. The objectives of the present review are to present the fundamentals of this method, assess the relevant literature, present evidence of seasonal variations of REL, describe how REL responds to different stress conditions, suggest priorities for future research as well as practical recommendations for REL testing, and assess leakage of organic compounds as an indicator of root damage. Seasonal changes in REL may be connected with root freezing tolerance that varies among plants of different seed sources and species and thus does not always indicate health state of seedlings. REL technique can be used for assessing frost hardiness of roots under certain conditions (e.g. roots should be sampled into the test tubes prior to the freezing test). It can be used for studying heat stress with certain prerequisites (e.g. series of high temperatures or different exposure times should be used to find a threshold for heat tolerance). In desiccation tolerance assessment, REL presents high variation depending on species. In case of rough handling or hypoxic conditions, the effect depends on certain developmental stages. Additionally, though REL may be useful in quantifying damage caused by cold storage, it should be considered as a relative index of plant quality only since the relationship between REL and survivability could vary depending on cultural and handling practices prior to planting as well as on post-planting environmental conditions. In some cases, REL is correlated with field performance of seedlings, but in other cases the correlation is weak. Factors as species, seed lots, developmental stage of root tissue, season, and bud dormancy intensity may affect REL. Thus, REL must first be calibrated to these factors before it can be reliably used to predict the field performance of all types of seedling stock. Ambient storage, ageing and amino acids and protein leakage are also discussed. Limitations and questions for future research are suggested (e.g. species-dependence and decreasing variation). In general, REL is casually and statistically related with root damage and survivability of seedling. However, it depends on many other factors apart from root damages, and thus it remains a great challenge to improve its reliability.

AB  - Post-thawing motility of spermatozoon, which is directly correlated with the integrity of mitochondrion, is the main parameter for evaluation of respective cryopreservation treatments. In this review, we describe our model of mitochondrial apparatus of spermatozoa and behaviour of this apparatus during cryopreservation. This model shows why a priori the mitochondrial apparatus of the human spermatozoon is expected to be more cryo-stable than the mitochondrial apparatus of the fish spermatozoon. Negative changes of mitochondrial membrane potential are a good indicator of the functional normality of mammalian and fish spermatozoa. It is concluded that the cryostability of mitochondrial membranes of fish spermatozoa is lower than that of human spermatozoa, and protocols for effective cryopreservation of fish spermatozoa can be extrapolated to human spermatozoa. It is also provided a biological explanation for why cryoprotectant-free vitrification for human ejaculates is better than conventional freezing and vitrification with cryoprotectants. This review also includes a description of the various technologies of vitrification of human and fish spermatozoa. For cryobiological investigations, we propose to evaluate the fish spermatozoon as a suitable representative model of the human spermatozoon.

AB  - The influence of past land use on the present-day diversity of stream invertebrates and fish was investigated by comparing watersheds with different land-use history. Whole watershed land use in the 1950s was the best predictor of present-day diversity, whereas riparian land use and watershed land use in the 1990s were comparatively poor indicators. Our findings indicate that past land-use activity, particularly agriculture, may result in long-term modifications to and reductions in aquatic diversity, regardless of reforestation of riparian zones. Preservation of habitat fragments may not be sufficient to maintain natural diversity in streams, and maintenance of such biodiversity may require conservation of much or all of the watershed.

AB  - Introduction: Non-pathological, age-related cognitive decline varies markedly between individuals andplaces significant financial and emotional strain on people, their families and society as a whole. Understanding the differential age-related decline in brain function is critical not only for the development oftherapeutics to prolong cognitive health into old age, but also to gain insight into pathological ageing suchas Alzheimer's disease. The Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936 (LBC1936) comprises a rare group of people forwhom there are childhood cognitive test scores and longitudinal cognitive data during older age, detailedstructural brain MRI, genome-wide genotyping, and a multitude of other biological, psycho-social, andepidemiological data. Synaptic integrity is a strong indicator of cognitive health in the human brain; however, until recently, it was prohibitively difficult to perform detailed analyses of synaptic and axonalstructure in human tissue sections. We have adapted a novel method of tissue preparation at autopsy toallow the study of human synapses from the LBC1936 cohort in unprecedented morphological andmolecular detail, using the high-resolution imaging techniques of array tomography and electronmicroscopy. This allows us to analyze the brain at sub-micron resolution to assess density, proteincomposition and health of synapses. Here we present data from the first donated LBC1936 brain andcompare our findings to Alzheimer's diseased tissue to highlight the differences between healthy andpathological brain ageing.
   Results: Our data indicates that compared to an Alzheimer's disease patient, the cognitively normalLBC1936 participant had a remarkable degree of preservation of synaptic structures. However, morphological and molecular markers of degeneration in areas of the brain associated with cognition(prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and superior temporal gyrus) were observed.
   Conclusions: Our novel post-mortem protocol facilitates high-resolution neuropathological analysis of the well-characterized LBC1936 cohort, extending phenotyping beyond cognition and in vivo imaging to nowinclude neuropathological changes, at the level of single synapses. This approach offers an unprecedentedopportunity to study synaptic and axonal integrity during ageing and how it contributes to differences in agerelatedcognitive change.

AB  - Successful molecular analyses of human solid tissues require intact biological material with well-preserved nucleic acids, proteins, and other cell structures. Pre-analytical handling, comprising of the collection of material at the operating theatre, is among the first critical steps that influence sample quality. The aim of this study was to compare the experimental outcomes obtained from samples collected and stored by the conventional means of snap freezing and by PAXgene Tissue System (Qiagen). These approaches were evaluated by measuring rRNA and mRNA integrity of the samples (RNA Quality Indicator and Differential Amplification Method) and by gene expression profiling. The collection procedures of the biological material were implemented in two hospitals during colon cancer surgery in order to identify the impact of the collection method on the experimental outcome. Our study shows that the pre-analytical sample handling has a significant effect on the quality of RNA and on the variability of qPCR data. PAXgene collection mode proved to be more easily implemented in the operating room and moreover the quality of RNA obtained from human colon tissues by this method is superior to the one obtained by snap freezing.

AB  - For an effective integrity assessment of marine robotic in offshore environments, the elements' failure characteristics need to be understood. A structured probabilistic methodology is proposed for the operational failure assessment (OFA) characteristics of ROV. The first step is to assess the likely failure mode of the ROV system and its support systems. This captures the interaction and failure induced events during operation. The identified potential failure modes are further developed into logical connectivity based on the cause-effect relationship. The logical framework is modeled using the fault tree analysis technique to predict the ROV operational failure probability in an uncertain harsh environment. The fault tree analysis captured the logical relationship between the primary, intermediate, and top events probability. The importance measure criteria were adopted to identify the most probable events, links, and their importance on the failure propagation. The model was demonstrated with an ROV for deep arctic water subsea operations. The result identified the control system, communication linkages, human factor, among others, as most critical in the ROV operational failure. The methodology's application provides core information on the Mean time between failure (MTBF) of the ROV system that could aid integrity management and provides a guide on early remedial action against total failure.

AB  - The foundation of the community conditioning hypothesis, the persistence of effects, was tested in a series of microcosm experiments. Experiments were conducted with the water-soluble fraction of the turbine fuel JP-8 using the standard protocols for the standardized aquatic microcosm (SAM). A repeat trial was conducted using the SAM protocol but with a 126-d test period, twice the standard duration. The results were examined using a variety of conventional univariate, multivariate, and graphical techniques. The principal conclusions were as follows. Effects are persistent in these model ecological systems long after the degradation of the toxicant. Patterns of impacts are detectable at concentrations 15 times lower than an experimentally derived single-species EC50. The replicate experiments are not replicable in the specific, but the broad pattern of the disruption of algal-herbivore dynamics followed by more subtle effects are consistently repeated. The durability of the indirect effects and therefore the information about historical events appears to be a consistent feature of these microcosm systems. The identity of the treatment groups persists. The critical features of the community conditioning hypothesis-persistence of information within ecological systems and the reappearance of patterns and therefore the nonequilibrium dynamics-are again confirmed. The implications of these findings for environmental toxicology, monitoring, and ecological risk assessment are discussed.

AB  - Ethical considerations and the limitation in availability of human skin for percutaneous absorption studies of drugs are the main reasons for the use of animal skin. Pig skin has been reported to have permeability properties resembling that of human skin. The aim of the current study was to investigate the suitability of newborn pig skin as a model inpercutaneous absorption studies. The anatomical features of skin from newborn pigs have been investigated using light and electron microscopy. The use of pigs that have died of natural causes shortly after birth allows the experiments to be carried out under tissue retrieval rather than animal ethics regulations. The thickness of the stratum corneum and epidermis was found to be similar to that of human skin and considerably thinner than adult pig skin, although the hair follicle density was much greater than that in either adult pigs or humans. Assessment of integrity of full-thickness newborn pig skin was performed using water permeability and electrical resistance measurements. A resistance greater than 20 kOmegacm(2) was proposed as a stringent and conservative indicator of an intact barrier function. The in vitro permeation characteristics of some model compounds (tritiated water, [C-14] mannitol, and propranolol hydrochloride) have also been investigated. With the exception of mannitol, newborn pig skin was found to have a similar permeation properties to human skin (factor of difference values between 1-1.5). In addition, a comparison has been made on the enhancing effect of two terpenes, carvacrol and menthol, on the permeation of propranolol hydrochloride. Permeability through newborn pig skin was approximately double that of human skin but the rank order of enhancement remained the same. The factor difference values suggest that as a human skin substitute, newborn pig skin may be a suitable model for percutaneous absorption screening studies.

AB  - We analyzed the effects of sewage discharge on a subtropical estuary by comparing the functional diversity of intertidal macroinvertebrate assemblages in contaminated with non-contaminated reference areas. Functional structure was assessed using biological traits analysis (BTA) and four multivariate indices (FRic, FEve, FDis and Rao's Q) of functional diversity. Our results showed clear and temporally consistent changes in macrobenthic functional structure in contaminated areas. However, these results depended on whether abundance- or biomass-based measurements were used, with abundance-based analyses distinguishing most clearly between sewage contamination conditions. Differences between contaminated and non-contaminated conditions were also displayed by BTA for all the functional trait categories. FDis (functional divergence) and Rao's Q (functional dispersion) were higher in the non contaminated condition and increased with higher benthic environmental health, as measured by the AMBI index. These patterns of higher functional divergence and dispersion were driven by the numerical dominance of opportunistic annelids in the contaminated condition. We suggest that abundance-based BTA, and the FDis and/or Rao's Q indices are reliable approaches to detect changes in functional structure with respect to sewage pollution. They have a great potential for environmental assessment and monitoring of subtropical estuarine ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this research was to determine if population attributes and growth of an estuarine pulmonate could be used as bioindicators of environmental conditions in New Zealand estuaries. We quantified the size distribution of the deposit feeding Amphibola crenata in areas which contrasted in contaminant inputs. Within a small estuary, location and tidal level significantly affected A. crenata density. The highest mean abundances were found at the most contaminated site, close to the waste treatment discharge point, compared with lower densities at two river sites and close to the estuary mouth. The population structure was site-specific with juveniles present in historically contaminated areas. Growth of A. crenata held in experimental cages for 6 weeks was highest for medium length individuals from close to the waste discharge point and least for individuals from the estuary mouth. Sediment surface microalgal biomass (chlorophyll a), representing the potential food supply for A. crenata was greatest at the least contaminated site, and lowest at the most polluted site. The abundance, population structure and growth rate of A. crenata are attributes that may be used as ecological bioindicators, reflecting the complex environmental conditions within New Zealand estuaries.

AB  - Rangeland conditions in the Lesotho highland dam catchment areas is important for local livelihoods and regional water supply. We investigated changes in land cover and condition from 1991 (before construction) to 2013, using Landsat imagery. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) decreased in the catchment areas, while increasing within two protected areas. NDVI decreases were greatest close to the dams and in the high altitude summer grazing areas. Land cover maps were generated for 1993, 2005 and 2013, using structural vegetation classes, as well as categories of grassland based on NDVI. High altitude areas were characterised by grasslands changing to lower NDVI categories, indicating overgrazing in climax sourveld grasslands. Mid-altitude areas were characterised by grasslands changing to higher NDVI categories and increases in woody vegetation, indicating overgrazing in Sweetveld. At lower altitudes, the increase in cultivated areas suggested disproportionately high population growth in the catchment areas. The results suggest that there has been widespread degradation that appears to be more as a result of overgrazing than climate change. The study demonstrates the importance of using a combination of land cover, NDVI and field data in assessing degradation. Natural capital accounting methods provide a useful framework for documenting, monitoring and understanding changes in ecosystem condition.

AB  - The ecological consequences of freshwater land-based salmonid farms on rivers were studied by monitoring eight farms with substantial differences in annual trout production (29-368 t year(-1)) connected to rivers of contrasted hydrology (mean annual discharge ranging from 0.3 to 4.8 m(3) s(-1)) in France. Samples of water and benthic invertebrates were collected in the river immediately upstream and at two locations downstream of fish farm outlets during low flow period in summer. Suspended solids, PO43- and NH4+ concentrations increased downstream of the outlets, suggesting that fish food-derived wastes led to a dilute mixture of suspended solids and dissolved nutrients. The total abundance of benthic invertebrates consistently increased immediately downstream of the effluent outlets, and a positive correlation was observed with the biomass of fish in the aquaculture facilities at the sampling date. The proportions of oligochaetes and chironomids increased downstream of the farms and, conversely, proportions of ephemeropterans, plecopterans and trichopterans decreased. Similarly, the relative abundances of shredders and scrapers decreased in the benthic invertebrate community downstream of the outlets, whereas deposit-feeders and filter feeders increased. This consistent pattern outlined a major change in the ecosystem functioning, with particulate organic matter from fish food-derived wastes becoming a central source of energy in river benthic food webs. Furthermore, the taxonomic-based ecological indicator usually used for monitoring biotic integrity in French Rivers overlooked these functional impairments in larger streams (mean annual discharge above 2 m(3) s(-1)). This study outlines the interest of using benthic invertebrate functional feeding groups together with the results of water chemistry analyses for monitoring the ecological disturbances induced by land-based salmonid farm effluents in running waters.

AB  - Ecological restoration increases, but evaluation of restoration efforts is inadequate because reliable performance indicators are lacking. As plants are important actors in ecological restoration, we suggest that they be used as metres, i.e. phytometers, of restoration success. Phytometer plants are transplanted to different conditions to integrate measures of the prevailing conditions. We analysed 109 studies for the use of phytometers and especially their applicability to evaluate ecological restoration. Most studies employed single species and life-stages and focused on habitat conditions and environmental impacts. Most experiments were conducted on grasslands in moist temperate regions. Growth was the dominant response variable, in long-term studies often combined with reproductive output and plant survival. Only five studies specifically evaluated ecological restoration, implying that its potential is not yet realised. We found phytometers promising in evaluating restoration outcomes given that they are easy to measure, can provide rapid results, and serve as integrative indicators of environmental conditions with the ability of covering many aspects of plant life and ecosystem processes. To evaluate restoration success with high resolution and generality, we suggest a combination of different phytometer species, life-forms and life-stages, and experimental periods >1 year to reduce effects of transplantation and between-year variation and to account for time lags in ecological processes and changes after restoration.

AB  - The coastal dune environment, due to the complex coast-to-inland gradient, contributes greatly to plant biodiversity. The ability of plants to withstand the harsh conditions of this habitat leads to a peculiar vegetation profile which may be affected by the natural and artificial degradation of the coast. Given that these disturbances are likely to increase in the future, there is a great interest in increasing the knowledge of resistance mechanisms allowing plants to colonize this stressful environment. Our focus was on physiological stress markers that could be early signals of changes before ecological disturbances become evident. Three representative species of the different dune zones, Achillea maritima, Ammophila arenaria and Helichrysum stoechas were studied during the four seasons. Winter and summer were confirmed as the most critical seasons with different levels of stress depending on the coast profile where plants grew. The shoreline-inland gradient of stress conditions was evident only for A. arenaria, whose physiology was negatively affected in foredune during summer and for this reason this species could be a useful indicator of increasingly harsh environmental conditions. Physiological performances of the studied species changed across the seasons and the occupied niches, in accordance with the respective strategies of resistance.

AB  - Aquatic plants are important components of many freshwater ecosystems. In this review we examine natural and anthropogenic influences on the distribution and abundance of aquatic plants, and develop a conceptual model of those diverse interactions. Species of aquatic plants vary greatly in their anatomy, physiology, life-history traits, and ability to tolerate inorganic and biological stressors. Key examples of inorganic stressors are extreme regimes of flow velocity, irradiance, salinity, ice cover, temperature, nutrients, and pollutants. Stressors associated with competition, herbivory, and disease may also limit the ability of species to utilize otherwise suitable habitats. Some aquatic plants have a cosmopolitan distribution and display high levels of polymorphism and phenotypic plasticity in response to variations of environmental factors; these qualifies allow them to occur over a wide range of conditions. Other species, however, have narrower tolerances and are potentially useful indicators of environmental conditions, in terms of either their presence or relative abundance within communities. In this review, we examine key environmental influences affecting aquatic plants, and their potential use as indicators at local, watershed, and regional scales.

AB  - We examined the relationship between cladoceran, limnological, geological and biological variables in a recent sediment sequence to assess the cladoceran community response to flood conditions and human impacts during the last century in shallow Lake La Tembladera, on the southern coast of Ecuador. We recovered three sediment cores from central and littoral locations to analyze cladoceran subfossils and plant macrofossils. Redundancy analysis identified three environmental variables controlling the assemblage composition: the presence of non-aquatic plants, As and Be concentrations in the sediment. Before AD 1925, the surface area of the lake was smaller than it is now and the most representative cladocerans were Euryalona at lower lake levels and Leydigiopsis at relatively higher lake levels. After ca. AD 1925, anthropogenic works increased the lake level and the expanse of the littoral zone, favoring phytophilous cladocerans such as Kurzia. Around ca. AD 1990, the disposal of mining tailings contaminated with arsenic increased cladoceran sexual reproduction (total chydorid ephippia) and favored certain taxa. Our study shows the influence of anthropogenic activities on hydrologic regime, lake stage and heavy metal contamination and our results indicate the environmental trajectory of this lake, as it shifted from more natural to more impacted conditions in the last century.

AB  - Implementation of the Water Framework Directive requires tools for measuring and monitoring the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. Several indices are in use in the Iberian Peninsula, although there has been little comparison among them. We sampled the fish assemblage and limnological features of the Tordera stream (NE Spain) quarterly from September 2001 to May 2003 to evaluate the usefulness of several fish metrics and to compare habitat quality and biotic indices currently in use. Data for eight biotic and abiotic indices for this and three other Catalan river basins were also compiled in order to analyse the relationships among indices. In the Tordera stream, fish abundance and richness increased with stream order except in the last sampling site that had the lowest fish abundance owing to the effects of drought and water abstraction. Although most indices were positively correlated, some displayed low or null correlations particularly for the Tordera basin which is more affected by water abstraction and less by pollution; a commonly used physico-chemical index (ISQA) was the least correlated. In a regional fish index (IBICAT) under development, the brown trout (Salmo trutta) has been previously considered as introduced in the Tordera basin. Here, we report an old published record that demonstrates that trout was present before 1845 and we argue that its status should be considered as uncertain given the current information available. Whether brown trout is treated as native or introduced to this river basin has profound effects on the results of fish metrics because of its dominance in the upper reaches. We briefly discuss the role of introduced species, particularly in headwater streams, in the development of fish indices. Our study exemplifies the need for careful, basin-specific assessment of native/introduced status in the development of fish metrics.

AB  - The immune function operation of fish immune organs depends tightly on the immune organs' structural integrity which is mainly regulated by various biological respects such as oxidative status, apoptosis and tight junctions. Previous explorations have documented that dietary (2-carboxyethyl) dimethylsulfonium Bromide (BrDMPT) intervention boosted fish growth in association with the strengthened immune function of the head kidney, spleen and skin. Here, further exploration was performed to better decipher the primary action mechanisms by which Br-DMPT maintains the immune organs' integrity of fish. In this research, grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) (216.49 +/- 0.29 g) as a model were fed five graded levels of Br-DMPT diets (0-520.0 mg/kg) in triplicate for 60 days, followed by a challenge with Aeromonas hydrophila for 2 weeks. Subsequently, immune organ samples were selectively collected to investigate oxidative status, apoptosis and tight junctions associated parameters. Our data from above three immune organs manifested that compared to the control group, 260.0 mg/kg Br-DMPT diet group: (1) markedly decreased oxidative damage degree as evidenced by the obtained lowest value in all oxidative damage indicators and exhibited the highest significant value in almost all antioxidant enzymes activities and corresponding gene expressions, where this action may be in part correlated with the modulation of Nrf2 signalling (P < 0.05); (2) signally alleviated cell apoptosis by altering the expression profiles of mitochondria and death receptor pathways involved genes (such as caspase-3,8 and FasL), where this mechanism may be partly connected with p38MAPK and JNK signalling (P < 0.05); (3) dramatically elevated tight junctions by regulating the expression profiles of a series of complexes (such as occludin and claudins), where the reason may be in part correlated with myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) signalling (P < 0.05). Noticeably, no statistical distinction was examined between all Br-DMPT diet groups with respect to the gene expressions of GPx4a, GPx4b, GSTP2, Bcl-2, claudin-b and claudin-7 in above diverse immune organs (P > 0.05). Overall, for the first time, our present results confirm that the enhanced structural integrity of immune organs in Br-DMPT- supplemented fish appears to partly be associated with the increased antioxidant status and the inhibited cell apoptosis, as well as the elevated tight junctions, which provides groundbreaking insight into the undiscovered role of Br-DMPT in accelrating fish growth and increases Br-DMPT more potential to be popularly Table 1 applied in future fishery productin.

AB  - Chinese resource-based cities are facing serious challenges in the aspect of ecosystem health development due to the development mode of "Treatment after pollution" and the negative effect caused by increased global competition. Research from the theory and methodology aspects must be urgently advanced. This study innovatively combines emergy analysis indicators with traditional economic-social indicators and constructs the method for urban ecosystem health assessment and improvement path. Jining is selected as an example to verify the method effectively. Research results show that the urban ecosystem health level of Jining constantly improved during 2008-2017, which increased from unhealthy to sub healthy and then to healthy. The five urban ecosystem health factors, namely, vitality, organizational structure, resilience, ecosystem service functions, and public health conditions, all show a trend of continuous improvement. Through the model of obstacle degree, this study identifies the main obstacle factors that influence the urban ecosystem health development of Jining: environmental loading rate (D22), renewable emergy value rate (D7), and the proportion of environmental protection in fiscal expenditure (D19). Moreover, several ecological development paths are proposed to improve the urban ecosystem health level of Jining based on local conditions.

AB  - Diatom-based indicators were developed to assess environmental conditions in the Missouri, Ohio, and Upper Mississippi rivers. Disturbance gradients, comprising the first two principal components derived from a suite of stressor variables, included a trophic gradient (Trophic) and a gradient reflecting agriculture and other development activities (Ag/Dev). Diatom-based indicators were developed by creating models using weighted average calibration and regression-based transfer functions to relate planktonic and periphytic diatom species assemblages to each disturbance gradient. The most predictive disturbance models combined phytoplankton and periphyton assemblages into a single bioindicator model (observed versus inferred: Trophic ; Ag/Dev ). The geographic applicability of bioindicators was assessed by limiting sample geographical range during model calibrations. Geographic scale was limited by creating bioindicators using samples from: (a) each river, and (b) combined Mississippi/Missouri samples excluding Ohio River sites which were chemically unique. Indicator performance decreased with geographically restrictive models, therefore river basin-wide models, developed across all three rivers, is recommended. The most effective diatom-based disturbance bioindicators for this great river ecosystem could be applied using phytoplankton, periphyton, or combined assemblages to infer both trophic and agriculture/development disturbances.

AB  - The widespread impact of bottomtowed fishing gear onbenthic species andcommunities has long been recognized. The responses to a given intensity of fishing disturbance can be influenced by the extent to which these species and communities are preconditioned to disturbance by natural processes, in particular waves and currents. The advent of vessel monitoring system (VMS) and models of natural disturbance enable high-resolution and large-scale comparisons of fishing and natural disturbance. VMS data were employed to estimate the trawled area per 12 km by 12 km grid cell. We then quantified natural disturbance by estimating the number of days in a year the seabed was disturbed by tides and waves. As natural disturbance acts on large spatial scales, we assumed that each natural disturbance event affects whole grid cells. Frequencies could thus be translated into an area of impact, allowing us to compare fishing with natural disturbance. We showhow such comparisons can be used to estimate the extent of different seabed substrate types significantly affected by demersal fishing. Ameasure of the probability that fishing disturbance exceeds natural disturbance provides onemetric for identifying areas of significant trawling impact on seabed habitats and might be used to measure progress towards achieving good environmental status for sea-floor integrity within the context of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive. For more than half the seabed in the English sector of the Greater North Sea, the results suggest that disturbance attributable to demersal fishing exceeds natural disturbance based on data from the years 2006 to 2008. The imbalance between natural and fishing disturbance is greatest in muddy substrates and deep circalittoral habitats.

AB  - A new approach is chosen to visualize ecosystem health by using parasite bioindicators in Segara Anakan Lagoon, a brackish water ecosystem at the southern Java coast, Indonesia. Three fish species (Mugil cephalus, Scatophagus argus, Epinephelus coioides) were collected in two different years and sampling sites and studied for ecto- and endoparasites. Additional data were taken for E. coioides from two further sites in Lampung Bay, Sumatra, and for E. fucoguttatus out of floating cages from a mariculture facility in the Thousand Islands, Jakarta Bay, North Java. The parasite fauna of fishes inside the lagoon was characterized by a high number of ecto- and a low number of endoparasites, the endoparasite diversity was relatively low and the prevalence of ectocommensalistic trichodinid ciliates was high. These parameters were chosen to indicate the biological conditions inside the lagoon. In E. coioides during rainy season, the prevalence of trichodinid ciliates was highest inside the lagoon (55%) compared with 27% in an open-net-cage mariculture and 5.7% in free-living specimens in Lampung Bay. The endoparasite diversity (Shannon-Wiener) was lowest in fish from Segara Anakan lagoon (0.66) compared with fish from an open-net-cage mariculture (0.71) and free-living specimens (1.39). Results for E. fuscoguttatus from the mariculture site in the Thousand Islands, a relatively undisturbed marine environment, demonstrated high parasite diversity (1.58) in the cultivated fish, a high number of endoparasites, and no trichodinids. A star graph is used to visualize the parasite composition for the different fishes, sampling sites, and conditions, using (1) the prevalence of trichodinid ciliates, (2) the ecto/endoparasite ratio and (3) the endoparasite diversity as bioindicators. The application of the star graph is suggested to be a suitable tool to visualize and monitor environmental health under high parasite biodiversity conditions within tropical ecosystems. It can also support a better communication to stake holders and decision makers in order to monitor environmental impact and change.

AB  - Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing food producing industries globally, providing similar to 50% of fish for human consumption. However, the rapid growth of aquaculture presents a range of challenges including balancing environmental impact that can be influenced by variations in climatic conditions. Monitoring of physicochemical parameters is traditionally used to evaluate aquaculture output quality: however, this approach does not indicate the cumulative ecotoxicological effects on receiving waters. Specifically, this case study investigated the relationship between measuring traditional physicochemical parameters and the health of the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata in order to evaluate the potential ecotoxicological effects of freshwater aquaculture on the receiving aquatic ecosystem in the Irish midlands. This constituted the first 2-year longitudinal study conducted in 2018 and 2019 that reports on the efficacy of using algae as a natural bioindicator to monitor and assess freshwater aquaculture wastewater from a traditional flow-through fish farm producing Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis); monitoring was compared over a same six-month period in the same location each year. Findings demonstrated significant differences between the two monitoring periods when using P. subcapitata for assessing the quality of aquaculture intake (P = 0.030) and output (P = 0.039). No stimulatory effects were observed during 2019 unlike >50% rates experienced the previous year. These observations coincided with changes in dimatic conditions whereby the 2018 period experienced extended levels of drought; whereas non-drought conditions were observed during 2019. Findings suggest that reliance upon traditional monitoring techniques may not provide sufficient robustness or versatility to address emerging issues, such as extremes in climate variance, which may influence the future intensive sustainability of freshwater aquaculture. This research supports the complementary use of P. subcapitata as a rapid and simple early-warning bioindicator for measuring aquaculture output quality on receiving aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - One way that parasites influence host survival and fitness is by competing with their hosts for resources that would otherwise be used for growth and immune system development. Thus resource availability, influenced by environmental conditions, may be particularly important during offspring development. This study examined the influence of a haematophagous ectoparasite Carnus hemapterus (Diptera: Milichiidae) in relation to environmental conditions on the growth, immune response, and health of nestling European Bee-eaters (Merops apiaster). The abundance of this bloodsucking ectoparasite per nest was experimentally manipulated to determine its impact on nestling body condition, immune system function in terms of T-cell-mediated and humoral immune response, and two health parameters, sedimentation rate and haematocrit level. Results indicate a significant negative effect of C. hemapterus intensity on nestling body condition and immune response, and on one blood parameter (haematocrit levels). Nestling body condition, gamma-globulin levels, wing web swelling, and haematocrit levels increased when parasites were removed. Although a broad spectrum of fitness indicators seems to be affected, no difference in nestling mortality during the experiment was observed between the two treatment groups. Surprisingly, variations in environmental conditions (weather in particular) that likely affected nestling food availability or thermoregulatory demands had no additional effect on the impact of the parasite infestation.

AB  - This paper outlines the procedure developed in the United Kingdom to determine whether a wetland is groundwater-dependent and damaged or at risk of damage as a result of groundwater quality or quantity pressures. First, we determined which sites were thought to be critically dependent on groundwater; we then worked to quantify the risk of damage. Results were verified by local ecologists and hydrogeologists who advised on the cause(s) of damage to each site, and the level of risk and confidence in that judgement. Second, we classified each groundwater body at good or poor status, using site condition assessments of sites protected for nature conservation to identify actual ecological damage, and a seven-step process to assess whether the environmental supporting conditions for each site were met, and if not, whether the departure was due to poor groundwater quality or inadequate quantity. The Environment Agency for England and Wales is also promoting wetlands as cost-effective measures to a number of catchment pressures, particularly the reduction of sedimentation and eutrophication, as part of the ecosystem services approach adopted by the United Kingdom Government.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to sum up knowledge of colour infrared (CIR) aerial photography as a tool for vegetation data for mapping and monitoring in environmental and biodiversity surveys and change detection surveillance. It compiles thirty years of research of the main ecosystems in Swedish vegetation, where the overall goal was to develop methods for mapping and monitoring vegetation by use of CIR aerial photographs, assess the accuracy compared to field-based mapping and to implement them as a tool in nature conservation and environmental planning. The methods include development of a classification system, identification and analysis of indicators, development of interpretation techniques, and evaluation compared to the data collected in the field. The CIR observable criteria are colour, texture, pattern, size, form, and density, based on spectral reflectance, physiognomy, life forms, ecological conditions, moisture and nutrition, vegetation period and phenology, topography, site conditions, and management methods. The methods have been used to produce vegetation maps of mountains, boreal forests, and mires in northern and central Sweden, in national inventories of wetlands, ancient meadows and pastures, key biotopes in forests and for monitoring agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Effluents are a main source of direct and often continuous input of pollutants into aquatic ecosystems with long-term implications on ecosystem functioning. Therefore, the study of the effects of effluent exposure on organisms, populations or communities within the framework of impact assessment has a high ecological relevance. The aim of this study was to assess the toxicological impact of two effluents, one household wastewater treatment effluent (Effluent 1) and one industrial effluent (Effluent 2), on the receiving aquatic ecosystem using two test species under both in situ and laboratory conditions. Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) were exposed under laboratory conditions in an online monitoring flow-through system (receiving different concentrations of Effluent 2) and under in situ conditions along the pollution gradient established by these two effluent discharges. Bioassays focussed on growth and condition related endpoints (i.e. condition, growth, lipid budget), since these are key functional processes within organisms and populations. Under laboratory conditions, increasing concentrations of the industrial effluent (Effluent 2) had a negative effect on both zebra mussel and carp energy reserves and condition. Under in situ conditions, the same negative impact of Effluent 2 was observed for zebra mussels, while Effluent I had no apparent effect on exposed zebra mussels. Carp growth and condition, on the other hand, were significantly increased at the discharge sites of both effluents when compared to the reference site, probably due to differences in food availability. The results indicate that a combination of in situ and laboratory exposures can illustrate how ecological processes influence bioassay studies. The incorporation of indirect, ecological effects, like changes in food availability, provides considerable benefit in understanding and predicting effects of effluents on selected species under realistic exposure conditions.

AB  - A full range of natural flow regime has been widely recognized as a primary driving force for sustaining the integrity of a riverine ecosystem. Existing instream flow methods strive to assure a constant minimum flow but not the natural flow variability. We present in this paper a dynamic corridor-searching algorithm to seek the optimal time-varying scheme for instream flow releases. A compromise programming (CP) is employed to search the optimal Solution of an objective function aggregating the ecosystem and human needs objectives. The ecosystem need objective is represented by an overall index of hydrologic alteration, which integrates 32 indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA) derived from the range of variability approach (RVA). The human need objectives are expressed by shortage ratios for the agricultural and municipal water supplies. The proposed method is applied to a weir operation in Taiwan. Three approaches to evaluating the overall degree of hydrologic alteration (i.e., the three-class, fuzzy-based, and overall-mean approaches) are compared here. The results show that the time-varying schemes improve the human need objective, but only slightly deteriorate the ecosystem need objective. Such advantages increase with the time-varying frequency. For the wet periods, smaller flow releases may be prescribed; for the dry periods, however, greater releases must be specified to secure a lower degree of overall hydrologic alteration. It is also revealed that use of the three-class approach to evaluate the overall hydrologic alteration facilitates to eliminate highly altered IHA and maintain those low-flow characteristics subtle to flow diversions. However, such Outcomes are achieved at the cost of greater deficits for human water demands. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The paper presents a study concerning the influence of the hydraulic and hydrological connectivity among the oxbow lakes and the restoration of riparian-zones have on aging. Interconnectivity oxbow lakes emerge after complex regulating works for the protection of the shores and bottom of the lakes. Research has analyzed the influence of the hydraulic connectivity of three lakes located in northern Poland on the structure of associated bottom invertebrates - elements that monitor the conditions in habitats. The structure and functioning of ecosystems in wetlands, including in oxbow lakes, are direct or indirect in connection to fluctuations in water levels during floods or flow pulsations. Hydrological processes cause changes in the chemical composition of the water in oxbow lakes and sediment dispersion due to the exchange between water and sediments. In the lentic habitats (disconnected from the main river), the retention time is longer than in the semi-and lotic oxbow lakes whereas the productivity of the ecosystem is only internal and limited. The use of macrozoobenthos as bioindicators in re-connected oxbow lakes in small river valleys indicates that, on the long-term period (5 years), it does not have as a result the improvement of the environmental conditions of those habitats. This is shown by the monitoring indicators. The main reason seems to be the loss of the full connectivity between the oxbow lakes and the main river channel within 3 to 4 years, having as a result only systems of semi-lotic oxbow lakes and rivers. This hampers the free exchange of waters between ecosystems, the washing out of nutrients accumulated in sediments, the removal of bottom sediments, as well as the migration of hydrobionts. Therefore, the improvement of the ecological condition of the oxbow lake habitats and the permanence of those changes depend on the possibility of keeping the full hydrological connectivity to the river.

AB  - Floods caused by ice-jams on the Peace River are considered to be important for maintaining hydro-ecological conditions of perched basins in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), Canada, a highly productive and internationally recognized northern boreal ecosystem. Concerns over the potential linkages between regulation of the Peace River in 1968 for hydroelectric production and low Peace River discharge between 1968 and 1971 during the filling of the hydroelectric reservoir, absence of a major ice-jam flood, event between 1975 and 1995, and low water levels in perched basins during the 1980s and early 1990s have sparked numerous environmental studies largely aimed at restoring water levels in the PAD. Lack of sufficient long-term hydrological records, however, has limited the ability to objectively assess the importance of anthropogenic factors versus natural climatic forcing in regulating hydroecological conditions of the PAD. Here, we report results of a paleolimnological study on laminated sediments from two oxbow lakes in the PAD, which are located adjacent to major flood distributaries of the Peace River. Sediment core magnetic susceptibility measurements, supported by results from several other physical and geochemical analyses as well as stratigraphic correspondence with recorded high-water events on the Peace River, provide proxy records of flood history spanning the past similar to 180 and similar to 300 years in these two basins. Results indicate that inferred flood frequency has been highly variable over the past 300 years but in decline for many decades beginning as early as the late nineteenth century, well before Peace River regulation. Additionally, several multi-decadal intervals without a major flood have occurred during the past 300 years. While climate-related mechanisms responsible for this variability in flood frequency remain to be determined, as does quantifying the relative roles of river regulation and climate variability on hydro-ecological conditions in the PAD since 1968, these results suggest that ecosystem management strategies for the PAD need to explicitly account for natural variations in flood recurrence intervals.

AB  - In China, the regional development policy has been shifting from solely economic orientation to ecologically sound economic growth. Using the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) region as a case study, we evaluated the temporal variations in ecosystem service values (ESVs) associated with land use changes from 1990 to 2015. We analyzed the dynamic relations between ESVs and the economy (indicated by the gross domestic product, GDP) by introducing the elasticity indicator (EI), which reflects the growth synchronism between the two, and the ecosystem service load (ESL), which reflects the ecological efficiency of economic growth. The results showed that the land use changes in Jing-Jin-Ji have been characterized by decreases in water areas, cropland, and grassland and increases in woodland and built-up areas. The ESVs of woodland and water areas contributed to 80% of the total ESV of the region, and the total ESV increased by 13.87% as a result of an area increase in woodland (26.87%). The average EI of Jing-Jin-Ji improved from 0.028 to 0.293 over the study period, indicating that the growth of ESVs was being balanced with the growth in the GDP. The average ESL decreased by 1.24, suggesting a significant improvement in ecological efficiency per unit GDP. Within the Jing-Jin-Ji region, large disparities in EI and ESL were shown to exist among Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei owing to their differences in ecological resources, GDP compositions, and development levels. The study highlights the needs to reinforce woodland and water conservation, adjust economic structures, and balance the intraregional development to achieve the ecological-economic integrity of the region.

AB  - The role of Cyanoprokaryota ecological groups in the ecosystems of the North Azov region was revealed in this work. On the territory of Pryazovskyi National Nature Park, 9 experimental polygons were studied, which covered steppe areas or slopes, salt marshes, coastal sandy soils and water bodies (rivers, lakes, estuaries, sea bays, lagoons). As a result of research on the territory of Pryazovskyi National Nature Park, 124 species of cyanoprokaryotes were identified, which include 127 intraspecific taxa. It was proved that the procedure of canonical correspondence analysis is the most suitable for the analysis of the species matrix. The axes identified as a result of the ordination procedure, which indicate the coordinated dynamics of the species, correlated with both synecological characteristics, such as diversity indicators, and with autoecological characteristics, such as ecotypes of cyanoprokaryotes in relation to habitat types or types of adaptation to salinity conditions. The first four canonical axes together explain 47.5% of species matrix variability. Canonical axis 1 explains 18.0% of the variability of the species matrix and is mostly marked by aqual subaerophytes and eurybionts. This axis indicates the presence of a gradient of salinity conditions where the most saline conditions correspond to the positive values of the axis, and the negative values correspond to less saline. Canonical axis 2 describes 12.1% of species matrix variability. This axis differentiates aquatic ecosystems from others. Canonical axis 3 explains 10.0% of the communities' variability. This axis distinguishes freshwater ecosystems from saline ecosystems. Markers of freshwater communities are stenotopic halotolerants, which are narrow-range, common mainly in the temperate zone of Europe. The canonical axis 4 explains 7.3% of variability of the matrix of species and is able to differentiate sand ecosystems. The ecotopic structure and geographic range width of community species have the greatest independent value among the considered sources of variation. The independent role of adaptation to the salinity conditions of the ecotope and the role of the type of ecosystems is somewhat smaller. The interaction between the sources of variation is important in the variation of the structure of communities. The interaction between the ecotopic structure and the geographic range width of species and the triple interaction between the ecotopic structure of a community, the width of the geographic range of species and the ecosystem type plays the greatest role in the variation of community structure. Ecotopic groups, which indicate the preference of a particular habitat, correlate with the species composition of the communities. It is shown that the ratio of ecototopic groups in a community is a characteristic that reveals the features of the community as a whole.

AB  - Biotic indices for monitoring marine ecosystems are mostly based on the analysis of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Due to their high sensitivity to pollution and fast response to environmental changes, bacterial assemblages could complement the information provided by benthic metazoan communities as indicators of human-induced impacts, but so far, this biological component has not been well explored for this purpose. Here we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to analyze the bacterial assemblage composition of 51 estuarine and coastal stations characterized by different environmental conditions and human-derived pressures. Using the relative abundance of putative indicator bacterial taxa, we developed a biotic index that is significantly correlated with a sediment quality index calculated on the basis of organic and inorganic compound concentrations. This new index based on bacterial assemblage composition can be a sensitive tool for providing a fast environmental assessment and allow a more comprehensive integrative ecosystem approach for environmental management.

AB  - Diatoms are an important part of microscopic algae that populate considerable water spaces. They reflect very well the natural qualities, geology, climate and physico-chemical conditions. Analyzing of diatoms as important indicators of water quality had also the advantage to compare the chemical parameters with the biological ones. The aim of this study was to evaluate two water ecosystems in the south part of Albania, Viroi lake and Drino river, using chemical parameters and biomonitoring based on diatoms population. Obtained results indicated that two ecosystems were in mesotrophic status according to measured average values of total phosphorus concentration in water. Also, in these two water ecosystems 78 species of diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) were identified, from which 7 belong to the order Centric diatoms (Centrales), whereas the rest belongs to the order Penatte diatoms (Pennales). According to the saprobice classes, they vary from oligosaprob to beta-mesosaprob in these two investigated water ecosystems. These results showed a good relationship between water quality assessment using chemical parameters and diatoms indices. Thus, biomonitoring by using diatoms indices can be an effective and useful tool for the evaluation of the ecological status of water ecosystems.

AB  - Taxonomic-based multimetric indices (MMIs) have been widely employed for assessing ecosystem status, particularly through the use of stream macroinvertebrate assemblages. However, the functional diversity and composition of assemblages is also important for maintaining stream ecosystem condition. Nonetheless, aquatic insect functional diversity and composition have not commonly been included in MMIs. Our goal was to advance our understanding of the performance and ecological interpretation of an MMI that potentially combined functional and taxonomic metrics. We sampled aquatic insects and natural and land-use variables at 74 temperate Chinese streams. We selected a candidate set of 36 functional and 20 taxonomic metrics that were screened by range tests, natural variation, responsiveness to anthropogenic disturbance, and redundancy for subsequent inclusion in MMIs. We determined if natural variation adjustments improved the performance of a functional-taxonomic MMI. Finally, we evaluated the degree to which the functional-taxonomic MMI served as an early-warning indicator of land use intensity. Natural variation explained between 19.62% and 71.02% of metric variability, indicating that functional metrics changed systematically along natural gradients. The final functional-taxonomic MMI adjusted for natural variation incorporated multiple aspects of assemblage characteristics: functional richness, Rao's quadratic entropy, abundance-weighted frequency of soft bodies, abundance-weighted frequency of predators, and number of Diptera taxa. In contrast to the natural variation unadjusted MMI, the functional-taxonomic adjusted MMI clearly distinguished least-disturbed sites from most-disturbed sites, exhibited high precision and low bias, and showed a significant negative response to land uses. The slope of a linear regression relative to 0-10% urban and 0-20% agriculture was significantly steeper for the functional-taxonomic adjusted MMI than that of the taxonomic adjusted MMI. We conclude that functional-taxonomic adjusted MMIs are more effective indicators of ecological condition and risks to biota from human pressures than are purely taxonomic unadjusted MMIs because functional-taxonomic MMIs are more sensitive to subtle anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - The design of an isolator and its use by an oncology satellite pharmacy for preparing cytotoxic drugs are described.
   The isolator (Iso Concept, Boulogne, France) is a totally enclosed ventilated biological-safety cabinet of class III polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with positive air pressure, a half-suit with a rotating seal, and attached neoprene gloves. There are three workstations, one for the half-suit and two along one side of the isolator. The ventilation and air filtration system consists of one entry pipe with a full ventilation-filtration box fit ted with one prefilter, one blower, one ball valve, one high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, one airtight nipple connected to an automatic sterilizer, alarms, and one exhaust pipe protected by a HEPA filter. The air lock consists of a rigid, transparent Plexiglas pass-through. The chamber is sterilized with heated compressed air mixed with 3.5% peracetic acid. Maintenance includes regular changing of gloves and HEPA filters; checking of the integrity of the PVC, half-suit, and gloves; and washing and decontamination procedures. Preparation of cytotoxics is planned in advance with prescription data and manufacturing sheets. In the half-suit, a pharmacy technician reads the label, supervises preparation of the sterile admixture, and writes a label. The operators on the side of the unit read the manufacturing sheet and prepare the dose identified by the label. The isolator's sterile integrity and the effectiveness of sterilizations are validated by monitoring the temperature of the sterilizing agent, using biological indicators, counting airborne particles, introducing ammonia into the isolator and monitoring for its presence outside, and checking air pressure and air flow. The isolator may provide better protection of both operator and product than a vertical-laminar-airflow hood.
   An isolator maintains a sterile, safe environment in which to prepare doses of cytotoxic drugs.

AB  - The ecological and economic foundations of rational nature management in restoring various kinds of protective forest stands under conditions of severe damage and destruction of wood-shrubby species in the natural-climatic and economic zones of the country were developed. It was determined that using traditional methods of restoration of protective forest plantations in many cases is no longer acceptable due to different levels of damage and substantial changes to economic entities on Earth. However, the main methodological approaches remain. A new methodological approach to restoring forests on the basis of constant adaptation of the existing methodologies for the design and calculation of economic efficiency of new plantings and new ecological-economic conditions and peculiarities has been developed. Certainly, numerousincorrectly planned forest stands have been created that do not sufficiently fulfill their ecological and economic functions and do not even have a general system of protection of the soil from negative factors. For effective regeneration of plants we have developed a formula for calculating the erosion stability of forest-agrarian landscapes for their optimal recovery through forest shelterbelts. We have developed new features of design and calculation of ecological and economic efficiency of newly created forest ameliorative spaces with new natural-economic conditions for their sustainable regeneration under modern conditions.
   The transition to environmentally sustainable agriculture of European standards requires fundamentally new solutions to the problem of using forest stands as an organizational component of ameliorative complexes in the context of soil erosion control measures. Soil erosion is one of the main factors of anthropogenic impact on land resources. Intensification of erosion processes leads to substantial degradation of soils, causing great losses to agriculture and generally endangers the safe development of mankind. As long as the process of degradation of the soil continues, the agroecological condition deteriorates and the increased application of mineral and organic fertilizers fails to improve the crop volume, insofar as the crop yield is formed mainly due to the natural soil fertility. In the process of research, we discovered that the expansion of the front intake surface runoff in forestry plantings allows one to increase their effective water-regulative functions. Such an event has a certain practical value, because a large proportion of forest shelterbelts even in satisfactory condition only perform their functionsat 20-30%. Taking into account the indicators of ameliorative-hydrological stress and counter-erosion stability of landscapes in locations of planted forest stands proved to be the most effective method of strengthening the initial contact with runoff ("active") plots. This provides is a unique chance to optimize the ecological economic system of protective forest plantations, especially in newly formed agricultural enterprises under new economic conditions.

AB  - In 2012, the Netherlands started the testing and production of high resolution, national scale ecosystem accounts following the methodology of the System of Environmental Economic Accounting - Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EEA), in short 'ecosystem accounting'. The SEEA is endorsed by the United Nations Statistical Commission as a comprehensive system for analysing and recording physical and monetary information on ecosystems and human dependencies on ecosystems. Many other countries have been developing natural capital accounts following the SEEA EEA, but the Netherlands work was novel in the sense that a comprehensive set of accounts has been developed for the whole country, including high resolution maps and accounting tables of ecosystem type, condition, services, assets, carbon and biodiversity. The work involved over 10 man-years of work, and was carried out in a collaboration by the Netherlands Statistical Office (CBS) and Wageningen University. This paper presents the methodologies followed and results obtained, and reflects on the policy applications of the accounts. Some further testing and development of the SEEA EEA is needed and also the Netherlands accounts are not yet complete. Nevertheless, the lessons learned in the Netherlands are relevant for other accounting efforts world-wide.

AB  - The term transitional waters encompasses a wide variety of ecosystems with highly variable environmental conditions and naturally impoverished biological communities. These characteristics have led to a considerable delay in the design and implementation of ecological assessment tools within the European Water Framework Directive. Chironomids are a very important faunal group of transitional waters in terms of relative abundance and species richness. In the present investigation a water quality index based on the chironomid pupal exuviae assemblages was developed. Thirty-seven sites were surveyed along the Catalonian coast (North-East Spain) for their Chironomid pupal exuviae. The index registered a significant response to the causes of eutrophication and its symptoms. Different taxonomic resolution levels were tested and a final tool is proposed based on a genus level identification of chironomid taxa and a classification system based on sensitive/tolerant taxa abundances. The tool has the advantage of being cost-effective (cheap, involving low time-consumption and easy to use) and of integrating all the habitats within the ecosystem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasingly, composite indicators and multi-criteria approaches are applied in environmental assessment and decision-making, including the EU Water Framework Directive. For example, integrated evaluation of aquatic ecosystem conditions and functioning usually involves a group of criteria, such as biological organisms and communities, physicochemical and hydromorphological variables, which are measured individually and combined by a weighted linear function into an overall 'score'. We argue that the network interactions of evaluation components are useful information for expert judgments, which have not been sufficiently considered in existing multi-criteria combination strategies in environmental assessment and management. Built upon the Analytic Network Process and demonstrated with the Chishui River Basin in China, this paper introduces a network-based expert judgment approach to construct ecological water quality indicators, and to determine and adjust their variable weight settings with information of interaction networks. This approach has potential to construct composite indicators for a broad environmental context.

AB  - Food production systems, urbanization, and other anthropogenic activities dramatically alter natural hydrological and nutrient cycles, and are primarily responsible for water quality impairments in China's rivers. This study compiled a 16-year (2003-2018) dataset of river water quality (161,337 records from 2424 sites), watershed/landscape features, and meteorological conditions to investigate the spatial water quality patterns and underlying drivers of river impairment (defined as water quality worse than Class V according to China's Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Waters, GB3838-2002) at a national scale. Our analysis provided evidence of a distinct water quality improvement with a gradual decrease in the frequency of prevalence of anoxic conditions, an alleviation of the severity of heavy metal pollution, whereas the cultural eutrophication has only been moderately mitigated between 2003 and 2018. We also identified significant spatial variation with relatively poorer water quality in eastern China, where 17.2% of the sampling sites registered poor water quality conditions, compared with only 4.6% in western China. Total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) are collectively responsible for >85% of the identified incidences of impaired conditions. Bayesian modelling was used to delineate the most significant covariates of TP/NH3-N riverine levels in six large river basins (Liao, Hai, Yellow, Yangtze, Huai, and Pearl). Water quality impairments are predominantly shaped by anthropogenic drivers (82.5% for TP, 79.5% for NH3-N), whereas natural factors appear to play a secondary role (20.5% for TP, 17.5% for NH3-N). Two indicator variables of urbanization (urban areal extent and nighttime light intensity) and farmland areal extent were the strongest predictors of riverine TP/NH3-N levels and collectively accounted for most of the ambient nutrient variability. We concluded that there is still a long way to go in order to eradicate eutrophication and realize acceptable ecological conditions. The design of the remedial measures must be tailored to the site-specific landscape characteristics, meteorological conditions, and should also consider the increasing importance of non-point source pollution and internal nutrient loading.

AB  - In order to improve the knowledge of total mercury (THg) bioaccumulation in bioindicator species of sea catfish (Siluriformes, Ariidae) and taking into account the relatively recent approach with respect to estuarine fish on the Brazilian coast, 65 individuals were caught in the northern and southern regions of the Cananeia estuary to determine the concentration of the THg in muscles, gills, gonads and kidney of the Cathorops spixii and Genidens genidens specimens. The difference in the THg accumulation associated to the maturity of the catfish reflects a differential metabolism regarding THg bioaccumulation in adults (males and females) and juveniles. These observations reinforce the importance of considering the maturity of the individual in order to understand the bioaccumulation and metabolism of fish under different environmental stress and conditions. Furthermore, abiotic conditions such as salinity should be evaluated in association with metabolic/biological conditions of the fish's bioindicators, especially in environments with large natural or anthropogenic transition gradients.

AB  - Forest condition in Europe is monitored under the International Co-operative Program on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests). The focus of the program is to provide an overview of the status of forest ecosystems in Europe with respect to air pollution and contribute to the understanding of the relationship between pollution and forest health. Crown condition parameters, i.e., defoliation and discoloration, are used as the principal indicators of forest condition within the ICP Forest network. Crown condition assessments have been successful in disproving the "forest die-back" hypothesis. However, there are a number of limitations associated with this approach given the current monitoring objectives. Data from crown condition assessments indicate that stand age and country differences explain most of the variation in crown defoliation. It is difficult to clearly discern the effects of air pollution from other site and stress factors. The results do however indicate the role of meteorology and other factors. A better understanding of the relationships between forest condition and air pollution may be achieved if more specific, quantitative response variables are selected. However, we suggest that the original focus of the program on air pollution effects may need to be re-evaluated.

AB  - Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries-Reserve (TURF-Reserve) is a form of rights-based fisheries management that could improve the effectiveness and coral reef conservation efforts in Marine Protected Area (MPA). Maya Tribe Customary Council with Mayalibit Bay customary communities declared Customary Fisheries Management (CFM), a fishery resources management approach that combines customary marine tenure, traditional ecological wisdom, and TURF-Reserve principles. This study aims to measure coral reef health conditions to illustrate CFM's effectiveness in maintaining coral reef conditions in Mayalibit Bay. This study uses Point Intercept Transect (PIT) and fish belt transect as data collection methods to gather coral reef health data. Coral reef condition is measured using five indicators with ecological thresholds. Study results show that there is an increase of reef fish biomass and herbivore fish biomass proportion compared to previous condition which indicate a healthy coral reef ecosystem. Decreasing macroalgae: hard coral ratio along with fished: unfished ratio compared to previous condition indicate coral reef ecosystem with moderate condition. This study concluded that the coral reef ecosystem in Mayalibit Bay is in healthy condition and its reef fisheries activities are still considered sustainable. Based on the healthy coral reef condition, CFM is shown as an effective approach in maintaining coral reef ecosystem condition, complementing conservation efforts, and reef fishery resources management in Mayalibit Bay.

AB  - The reef communities of the Florida coral reef tract play a major role in supporting the regional economy but are threatened by increased exploitation and environmental factors. Coral reef ecosystem services are vital to the economy of SE Florida where revenue and jobs depend on the status of reef resources. Here, we used an extensive, reef monitoring database collected by the Florida Reef Resilience (FRRP, 2003-2011) and the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA, 1997-2011) programs to evaluate percent recent mortality (PRM) as a robust ecological indicator of coral colony and coral reef status. PRM, the proportion of a coral colony that has experienced recent tissue mortality so that corallite structures in the non-living parts of the coral are still intact and identifiable to species, can be attributed to disturbances taking place within days to a few months preceding the surveys.
   Based on data from >50,000 colonies from 11 coral species and nearly 1400 sites, we propose a benchmark level of <1% PRM and <5% prevalence of partial mortality for Florida reefs during periods of background, low-stress environmental conditions. PRM levels >1.0% and prevalence levels >5% can be used as early warning indicators of degrading conditions. Average PRM values >2% are indicative of increasingly stressful conditions as those experienced during temperature anomalies and major hurricanes. Finally, PRM values considerably >2% are reflective of significantly stressful conditions and warning signals of potential major coral mortality as evidenced by mean PRM levels of >10% recorded in Florida as a consequence of the 2010 extreme cold-water event. PRM and prevalence values from Florida reefs compared favorably with those recorded in the Caribbean and the Mesoamerican region where a benchmark of 2% for background levels of PRM under low-level, chronic stress was proposed. The status of this indicator can be easily communicated to stakeholders and will benefit managers by providing: (1) a baseline to assess the status of coral populations; and (2) early-warning indicators of unfavorable conditions that may trigger management actions such as temporary closures or the establishment of more permanent protection such as MPAs.

AB  - Using a scorecard approach, we assessed the condition of natural resources within the major habitats in Mount Rushmore National Memorial (MORU), South Dakota, and Niobrara National Scenic River (NIOB), Nebraska, as part of a "pilot" effort to determine a National Park Service (NPS) system-wide approach to Natural Resource Condition Assessments (NRCA). Both parks are considered small - MORU because of size (517 ha) and NIOB because the NPS does not own land within the boundary of the park. Small parks often contain resources that are not well-known because they lack research, monitoring, and staff expertise. However, we found adequate information to assess the condition, and sometimes trend, of 12 of 15 biodiversity and process indicators at MORU and 17 of 22 at NIOB, although most of the data we used to establish reference conditions came from sources outside of the parks. We believe forested habitats at MORU and NIOB are in poor condition and deteriorating primarily due to the suppression of fire for over 100 years. This is in contrast to the rivers, streams, and wetland habitats at both parks that are in good condition but threatened by an exotic fish (MORU) and reductions in streamflow and exotic plants (NIOB). For two habitats - stream and wetland (MORU) and Niobrara River and tributaries (NIOB) - we suggest several indicators of current condition be added as Vital Signs for long-term monitoring. The score-card approach is limited to those small parks with data to establish reference conditions for indicators.

AB  - The federally threatened American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is a flagship species and ecological indicator of hydrologic restoration in the Florida Everglades. We conducted a long-term capture-recapture study on the South Florida population of American crocodiles from 1978 to 2015 to evaluate the effects of restoration efforts to more historic hydrologic conditions. The study produced 10,040 crocodile capture events of 9,865 individuals and more than 90% of captures were of hatchlings. Body condition and growth rates of crocodiles were highly age-structured with younger crocodiles presenting with the poorest body condition and highest growth rates. Mean crocodile body condition in this study was 2.14 +/- 0.35 SD across the South Florida population. Crocodiles exposed to hypersaline conditions (> 40 psu) during the dry season maintained lower body condition scores and reduced growth rate by 13% after one year, by 24% after five years, and by 29% after ten years. Estimated hatchling survival for the South Florida population was 25% increasing with ontogeny and reaching near 90% survival at year six. Hatchling survival was 34% in NE Florida Bay relative to a 69% hatchling survival at Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge and 53% in Flamingo area of Everglades National Park. Hypersaline conditions negatively affected survival, growth and body condition and was most pronounced in NE Florida Bay, where the hydrologic conditions have been most disturbed. The American crocodile, a long-lived animal, with relatively slow growth rate provides an excellent model system to measure the effects of altered hydropatterns in the Everglades landscape. These results illustrate the need for continued long-term monitoring to assess system-wide restoration outcomes and inform resource managers.

AB  - Background Fecal indicator organisms such as Escherichia coli, enterococci, and coliphages are important to assess, monitor, and predict microbial water quality in natural freshwater ecosystems. To improve predictive modelling of fecal indicators in surface waters, it is vital to assess the influence of autochthonous and allochthonous environmental factors on microbial water quality in riverine systems. To better understand how environmental conditions influence the fate of fecal indicators under varying weather conditions, the interdependencies of environmental parameters and concentrations of E. coli, intestinal enterococci, and somatic coliphages were studied at two rivers (Rhine and Moselle in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) over a period of 2 years that exhibited contrasting hydrological conditions. Both riverine sampling sites were subject to similar meteorological conditions based on spatial proximity, but differed in hydrodynamics and hydrochemistry, thus providing further insight into the role of river-specific determinants on fecal indicator concentrations. Furthermore, a Bayesian multiple linear regression approach that complies with the European Bathing Water Directive was applied to both rivers' datasets to test model transferability and the validity of microbial water quality predictions in riverine systems under varying flow regimes. Results According to multivariate statistical analyses, rainfall events and high water discharge favored the input and dissemination of fecal indicators in both rivers. As expected, concentrations declined with rising global solar irradiance, water temperature, and pH. While variations in coliphage concentrations were predominantly driven by hydro-meteorological factors, bacterial indicator concentrations were strongly influenced by autochthonous biotic factors related to primary production. This was more pronounced under low flow conditions accompanied by strong phytoplankton blooms. Strong seasonal variations pointed towards bacterial indicator losses due to grazing activities. The Bayesian linear regression approach provided appropriate water quality predictions at the Rhine sampling site based on discharge, global solar irradiance, and rainfall as fecal indicator distributions were predominantly driven by hydro-meteorological factors. Conclusions Assessment of microbial water quality predictions implied that rivers characterized by strong hydrodynamics qualify for multiple linear regression models using readily measurable hydro-meteorological parameters. In rivers where trophic interactions exceed hydrodynamic influences, such as the Moselle, viral indicators may pose a more reliable response variable in statistical models.

AB  - This article presents the results of research on the geoecological conditions of floodplain oak forest habitats on the basis of the inventory of their phytocoenotic diversity in the large nature region of Southwestern Nechernozemye of Russia. The authors created a database on flood-plain oak forest distribution in the Upper Dnieper basin (Bryansk, Kaluga, Smolensk regions of Russia), comprising the author's unpublished geobotanical releves made in 2005-2018, as well as available materials on the regional floodplain forest syntaxonomy. Location information and taxonomic affiliation are organized in a spatial database created with use of MapInfo Professional and reflected on an electronic map, which became the basis for the identification and justification of distribution factors of floodplain oak forests. Communities of hygro-and mesohygrophyte oak forests with a wide enough variety of dominants amid similar overall floristic composition and structure combines ass. Filipendulo ulmariae-Quercetum roboris Polozov et Solomeshch in Semenishchenkov 2015, established by the method of J. Braun-Blanquet. Ten variants formed in different geoecological conditions were identified and described. DCA-ordination of syntaxonomical units demonstrates some ecological patterns of distribution of floodplain oak forests. Despite exponential differences in the composition of coenoflors, syntaxa don not take compact space in the diagram. This is due to the fact that the floristic composition of communities of floodplain forests largely depends on the mode flood length and the height of the flood, which vary from season to season. Coenoflors of floodplain forests consist of ecologically dissimilar species, which enter the communities during periods of environmental fluctuation and then are differentially maintained in communities or eliminated. Often, these communities have high rates of species richness. Variability of edafical conditions and regime of flood, geochemical characteristics of soil, and features of microrelief in floodplain generates high variety of floristic composition of communities and phytocoenotic diversity of floodplain oak forests, which is reflected in their syntaxonomy. Syntaxa of floristic classification, characteristic species of which have expressed environmental preferences, may be use as indicators of geoecological conditions in floodplains. Some types of communities are formed as a result of anthropogenic impact (grazing, trampling, recreational use, fire), which is reflected in their poor floristic composition.

AB  - Terrestrial plant litter is the main source of energy for food webs in forest headwater streams. Leaf litter quality often changes when native tree species are replaced by exotic ones and land use change in the watershed can alter physico-chemistry and functional composition of invertebrate communities, ultimately impairing associated ecosystem processes. We used the composition of invertebrate functional feeding groups (FFGs) and the ecosystem process of leaf breakdown as structural and functional indicators, respectively, of ecosystem health in upland Kenyan streams. During dry and wet conditions, invertebrates were sampled in 24 streams within forest (10), mixed (7) and agriculture (7) catchments. Five forest and five agriculture streams were subsequently used for leaf litter breakdown experiments using two native (Croton macrostachyus and Syzygium cordatum) and one exotic (Eucalyptus globulus) species differing in quality. Coarse- and fine-mesh litterbags were used to compare microbial (fine-mesh). with shredder + microbial (coarse-mesh) breakdown rates, and by extension, determine the role of shredders in litter processing in these streams. Seasonal influences on water quality were observed across catchment land uses. Total suspended sediments, turbidity and total dissolved nitrogen were consistently higher during the wet than dry season. However, seasonal influences on FFGs were inconsistent. Catchment land use influenced invertebrate functional composition: 21 taxa, including eight shredders, were restricted to forest streams, but abundance was a poor discriminator of disturbance. Breakdown rates were generally higher in coarse- compared with fine-mesh litterbags for the native leaf species and the relative differences in breakdown rates among leaf species remained unaltered in both agriculture and forest streams. Shredder and microbial breakdown of leaf litter displayed contrasting responses with shredders relatively more important at forest compared with agriculture streams. However, these patterns were inconsistent across leaf species over the dry and wet seasons. Overall, shredder mediated leaf litter breakdown was dependent on leaf species, and was highest for C macrostachyus and lowest for E. globulus. This suggests that replacement of indigenous riparian vegetation with poorer quality Eucalyptus species has the potential to reduce nutrient cycling in streams, with foodwebs becoming more reliant on microbial processing of leaf litter, which cannot support diverse consumers and complex food webs.

AB  - Restoration of old fields in agricultural landscapes has become increasingly important for conservation of species and their habitats owing to habitat destruction and rapid environmental change. Studies examining the outcomes of old field restoration predominantly focus on plant, and sometimes, vertebrate communities. Fewer studies have systematically investigated the effects of restoration efforts on soil properties or ground-dwelling invertebrates and there is limited synthesis of these data.
   We conducted a global meta-analysis of published studies to assess the effects of old field restoration on soil properties and soil invertebrate abundance and richness. We anticipated increased vegetation cover would improve soil properties towards reference condition and in turn, this would promote invertebrate abundance and richness. Studies were included if field sites had a history of cropping or livestock grazing.
   We identified 42 studies (1994-2019) from 16 countries that met our criteria. More studies assessed passive restoration methods than active planting, and native species were more commonly planted than exotic species.
   Results showed that restoration improved soil conditions with respect to total nitrogen, magnesium, soil carbon, bulk density and porosity when compared to controls; however, conditions similar to those in reference ecosystems were generally not achieved, even 50+ years after restoration had been initiated. Moderator analyses showed few significant tends, however, bulk density improved with age, and in passively restored versus reference ecosystems. Outcomes for soil carbon and bulk density were most predominant in the top soil when compared to the degraded ecosystem. We detected no consistent trends for the effect of restoration on soil invertebrate richness and abundance compared to the control or reference ecosystems.
   Synthesis and applications. Our global meta-analysis found strong evidence that old field restoration in agricultural landscapes had positive effects on soil condition but did not lead to full recovery when compared to a reference ecosystem. We detected few and idiosyncratic effects for invertebrates. Further research is needed to understand effects of restoration on soil invertebrate functional groups and to develop management interventions that accelerate the restoration of soil condition.

AB  - Metrics used to quantify the condition or physiological states of individuals provide proactive mechanisms for understanding population dynamics in the context of environmental factors. Our study examined how anthropogenic disturbance, habitat characteristics and hair cortisol concentrations interpreted as a sex-specific indicator of potential habitat net-energy demand affect the body condition of grizzly bears (n = 163) in a threatened population in Alberta, Canada. We quantified environmental variables by modelling spatial patterns of individual habitat use based on global positioning system telemetry data. After controlling for gender, age and capture effects, we assessed the influence of biological and environmental variables on body condition using linear mixed-effects models in an information theoretical approach. Our strongest model suggested that body condition was improved when patterns of habitat use included greater vegetation productivity, increased influence of forest harvest blocks and oil and gas well sites, and a higher percentage of regenerating and coniferous forest. However, body condition was negatively affected by habitat use in close proximity to roads and in areas where potential energetic demands were high. Poor body condition was also associated with increased selection of parks and protected areas and greater seasonal vegetation productivity. Adult females, females with cubs-of-year, juvenile females and juvenile males were in poorer body condition compared with adult males, suggesting that intra-specific competition and differences in habitat use based on gender and age may influence body condition dynamics. Habitat net-energy demand also tended to be higher in areas used by females which, combined with observed trends in body condition, could affect reproductive success in this threatened population. Our results highlight the importance of considering spatiotemporal variability in environmental factors and habitat use when assessing the body condition of individuals. Long-term and large-scale monitoring of the physiological state of individuals provides a more comprehensive approach to support management and conservation of species at risk.

AB  - AimAdult dragonflies are renowned for being good bioindicators of anthropogenic change, but their response to the heterogeneity of undisturbed river systems has received little investigation. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) has had a long lineage of natural selection which has honed life stages to the fine grain of the river systems. This leads to the intriguing question: How sensitive are the aerial adults to the in-water conditions?
   LocationRivers of the CFR, in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, are naturally heterogeneous and complex ecosystems running across a geologically ancient landscape. The CFR is a significant centre of local endemism for many taxa, including dragonflies.
   MethodsWe investigated dragonfly assemblages and 20 environmental variables along untransformed reaches of three CFR rivers.
   ResultsWe found that each river has its own particular signature' dragonfly assemblage. We also found that certain in-water parameters were the most important factors driving adult dragonfly assemblages, and not variables associated with substrate or riparian vegetation under these historic, natural conditions. This responsiveness to a heterogeneous range of in-water variables was similar from one river to the next, and also was independent of species turnover among the different dragonfly assemblages.
   Main conclusionsFrom a conservation perspective, the natural variation in certain water parameters, particularly in-water conditions, is essential for supporting the full suite of adult dragonfly species. Challenging but important for conservation planning is that each river has its own biotic merit. Addressing this challenge also means that maintenance and restoration of historic, heterogeneous, in-water conditions in addition to the removal of alien invasive trees which are already known to be highly detrimental to this largely irreplaceable dragonfly fauna. Prioritizing which rivers to conserve can be achieved through using indices involving dragonflies.

AB  - The Nutrient Cycling Index (hereafter 'Nutrient Index') derived from Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) is used extensively by land managers worldwide to obtain rapid and cost-effective information on soil condition and nutrient status in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite its utility, relatively little is known about its reliability under different management conditions (e.g. grazing) or across different climatic zones (aridity). Here we correlated the Nutrient Index, comprising measures of biocrust cover, plant basal cover, soil roughness and three attributes of surface litter cover, with empirical data on measures of soil total nutrient pools (C and N), nutrient availability (labile C, inorganic N and P), and decomposition-related enzymes at 151 locations from eastern Australia varying in grazing intensity and climatic conditions. Grazing intensity was assessed by measuring current grazing (dung production by the herbivores cattle, sheep/goats, kangaroos and rabbits), and historic grazing (the total area of livestock tracks leading from water). We used aridity (the relationship between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) as a measure of climate. On average, the Nutrient Index was positively associated with total nutrient pools, nutrient availability and decomposition enzymes. However, further statistical modelling indicated that grazing intensity strongly reduced the link between the index and decomposition enzymes, labile C and inorganic P, but not with total nutrient pools. This grazing effect was predominantly due to cattle. Conversely, aridity had no significant effect on the predictive power of the index, suggesting that it could be used across different aridity conditions in natural ecosystems as a reliable predictor of soil health. Overall, our study reveals that the Nutrient Index is a robust predictor of total nutrient pools across different aridity and grazing conditions, but not for predicting nutrient availability or decomposition in environments heavily grazed by livestock.

AB  - Cotton-strip bioassays are increasingly used to assess ecosystem integrity because they provide a standardized measure of organic-matter decomposition - a fundamental ecosystem process. However, several different cotton-strip assays are routinely used, complicating the interpretation of results across studies, and hindering broader synthesis. Here, we compare the decay rates and assemblages of bacteria and fungi colonizing the three most commonly used cotton materials: Artist's canvas, Calico cloth, and Empa fabric. Cotton strips from each material type were incubated in 10 streams that span a wide range of physicochemical properties across five ecoregions. Additionally, to evaluate responses to environmental stress without potentially confounding biogeographical effects, we deployed identical bioassays in five streams across an acidification gradient within a single ecoregion.
   Across all streams decomposition rates (as tensile strength loss [TSL]) differed among the three cotton materials; Calico cloth decomposed fastest (time to 50% TSL [T-50] = 16.7 d), followed by the Empa fabric (T-50 = 18.3 d) and then Artist's canvas (T-50 = 21.4 d). Despite these differences, rates of TSL of the three cotton materials responded consistently to variation in environmental conditions; TSL of each fabric increased with stream temperature, dissolved-nutrient concentrations and acid-neutralizing capacity, although Artist's canvas and Calico cloth were more sensitive than Empa fabric. Microbial communities were similar among the materials, and values of community structure (e.g., phylotype richness and diversity) were comparable to those reported for decaying leaves in streams from the same region, the major natural basal carbon resource in forested-stream ecosystems. We present linear calibrations among pairs of assays so that past and future studies can be expressed in a "common currency" (e.g., Artist's-fabric equivalents) 'past and future studies' repeated two times in the sentence. Lastly, given its relatively low within-site variability, and the large number of streams where it has been used ( > 700 across the globe), we recommend Artist's fabric for future work. These results show that cotton provides an effective and realistic standardized substrate for studying heterotrophic microbial assemblages, and acts as a reasonable proxy for more chemically complex forms of detritus. These findings add to growing evidence that cotton-strip bioassays are simple, effective and easily standardized indicators of heterotrophic microbial activity and the ecosystem processes that result.

AB  - One of the pressing problems for applied ecologists is the efficient restoration of structure and function to degraded ecosystems. Where some other conservation activities, such as protection of existing wilderness, continue to require making the best of increasingly bad situations, the goal of restoration raises the pleasing prospect of measurable improvement in landscapes. Restoration simultaneously provides the ultimate test for the discipline of community ecology: ecologists should be able to build an ecosystem in the same way an engineer builds a bridge, with a list of parts connected in specified ways leading to certain reliable outcomes. Failures would reveal that scientists do not adequately understand the system. Practical considerations suggest the application of tools that already exist rather than the invention of new ones. The objective of this paper is to suggest that two valuable tools may already exist, tools that provide an intellectual foundation for restoration ecology. Such a foundation is necessary because there has been a tendency for restoration ecology to represent a haphazard collection of individual cases rather than a well-defined discipline with repeatable methods. One possible scheme for unifying studies of restoration is that provided by assembly rules, where predictions are based upon key environmental factors and the responses of species to those factors. The potential of such assembly rules is introduced using three examples: fish in wetlands, plants in salt marshes, and plants in prairie potholes. I then describe an experiment where a standard species pool of wetland plants was sown into twenty-four different sets of environmental conditions, illustrating how landscapes can select communities out of larger pools. A second possible tool is indicators of ecosystem integrity. These can measure whether a project actually works. Clear discrimination between success and failure can improve restoration procedures by accelerating the evolution of management principles and techniques; Holling has called this process 'adaptive environmental assessment.' I conclude with the optimistic view that restoration already has the tools for continued progress; what is needed is primarily their intelligent application. That is, rather than ending with a typically academic plea for more research, I suggest (for a change) char what is needed is only the discriminating application of procedures and principles that already exist.

AB  - As a consequence of the growing global dependence on groundwater resources, environmental risk assessments (ERA) for groundwater are increasingly required and, with that, ecotoxicological studies with groundwater fauna (stygofauna). However, the literature on the ecotoxicological studies with stygobiotic species (i.e. species that complete their life cycle exclusively in groundwater) has not expanded significantly since the first paper published in this field. The limitations regarding the use of stygobiotic species for ecotoxicological testing are clear and consistent across the globe; stygobiotic species are often 1) naturally present in low numbers, 2) difficult to collect, and 3) difficult to culture under laboratory conditions. This paper reviews the methods used in ecotoxicological studies performed with stygobiotic species, and provides ten recommendations for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for such tests. The recommendations focused on the following 10 points: 1) the taxonomic identification, the life stage/size and gender of the test organisms; 2) collection methodology of the organisms, including collection location, conditions and methods: 3) holding and acclimation conditions in the laboratory; 4) exposure conditions such as test set up and exposure time, number of replicates and densities of organisms in tests and in test vessels; 5) range-finding test set up and schedule; 6) final test design, including details &controls and treatments, and replication options; 7) incubation conditions, specifying temperature, pH and oxygenation levels throughout the test; 8) test duration; 9) observations and endpoints; 10) test validity criteria and compliance. The recommendations were developed for the purpose of supporting future short-term ecotoxicological testing with stygofauna through providing consistency in the protocols. A discussion of the potential implications for groundwater managers and decision-makers committed to ERA for groundwater is included. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article presents an approach to identify Green Infrastructure (GI), its benefits and condition. This information enables environmental agencies to prioritise conservation, management and restoration strategies accordingly. The study focuses on riparian areas due to their potential to supply Ecosystem Services (ES), such as water quality, biodiversity, soil protection and flood or drought risk reduction. Natural Water Retention Measures (NWRM) related to agriculture and forestry are the type of GI considered specifically within these riparian areas. The approach is based on ES condition indicators, defined by the European Environment Agency (EEA) to support the policy targets of the 2020 Biodiversity Strategy. Indicators that can be assessed through remote sensing techniques are used, namely: capacity to provide ecosystem services, proximity to protected areas, greening response and water stress. Specifically, the approach uses and evaluates the potential of freely available products from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) to monitor GI. Moreover, vegetation and water indices are calculated using data from the Sentinel-2 MSI Level-2A scenes and integrated in the analysis. The approach has been tested in the Italian Po river basin in 2018. Firstly, agriculture and forest NWRM were identified in the riparian areas of the river network. Secondly, the Riparian Zones products from the CLMS local component and the satellite-based indices were linked to the aforementioned ES condition indicators. This led to the development of a pixel-based model that evaluates the identified GI according to: (i) its disposition to provide riparian regulative ES and (ii) its condition in the analysed year. Finally, the model was used to prioritise GI for conservation or restoration initiatives, based on its potential to deliver ES and current condition.

AB  - The relationships between fluctuations in climatic conditions. forest productivity and elemental cycling were studied from 1994 to 1997 in a headwater catchment of the southern Laurentians dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) growing on podzolic soils. Annual budgets show that H+, K, and NO3 were retained in the watershed while Ca, Mg and Na were lost. The magnitude of the net annual budget for Ca, Mg and Na was correlated to annual variations in precipitation with the absolute budget value decreasing during dry years. Stemwood (r(2) = 0.85) and total tree biomass production (r(2) = 0.99) were correlated with mean annual temperature but fine roots and leaf litter were not. During the growing season, the pH of the organic horizons (FH) decreased as the volumetric water content of soil decreased. A positive association was also found between air temperature and H2O-soluble (r(2) = 0.88) and PO4-extractable (r(2) = 0.99) SO4 in the upper B horizon. On a multi-year scale, we suspect that the decrease in the storage of inorganic SO4 in the soil results from the cumulative effects of annual variations in climatic conditions superimposed on the long-term decrease in SO4 deposition from the atmosphere. These soil changes were reflected by a decline in SO4, Ca and Mg concentrations in the stream. The generalisation of the observed short-term patterns to longer time scales must be approached with caution. Yet, our results indicate that the associations between climatic variations and the biogeochemistry of the ecosystem occur at different spatial and temporal scales and integrate a broad range of chemical components and ecosystem compartments. This reflects the inherent complexity of natural systems and offers a vast palette of indicators of the response of terrestrial ecosystems to variations in the intensity of environmental factors such as climatic conditions.

AB  - In this paper, a molecular analytical approach for detecting hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria in water is suggested as a proxy measurement for tracking petroleum discharges in industrialized or pristine aquatic environments. This approach is tested for general application in cold marine regions (freezing to 5 degrees C). We used amplicon sequencing and qPCR to quantify 16S rRNA and GyrB genes from oleophilic bacteria in seawater samples from two different crude oil enrichments. The first experiment was conducted in a controlled environment using laboratory conditions and natural North Sea fjord seawater (NSC) at a constant temperature of 5 degrees C. The second was performed in the field with natural Arctic seawater (ARC) and outdoor temperature conditions from -7 degrees C to around 4 degrees C.
   Although the experimental conditions for NSC and ARC differed, the temporal changes in bacterial communities were comparable and reflected oil biotransformation processes. The common bacterial OTUs for NSC and ARC had the highest identity to Colwellia rossensis and Oleispira antarctica rRNA sequences and were enriched within a few days in both conditions. Other typical oil degrading bacteria such as Alcanivorax (n-alkane degrader) and Cycloclasticus (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degrader) were rapidly enriched only in NSC conditions.
   Both the strong correlation between Oleispira SSU gene copies and oil concentration, and the specificity of the Oleispira assay suggest that this organism is a robust bioindicator for seawater contaminated by petroleum in cold water environments. Further optimization for automation of the Oleispira assay for in situ analysis with a genosensing device is underway. The assay for Colwellia quantification requires more specificity to fewer Colwellia OTUs and a well-established dose-response relationship before those taxa are used for oil tracking purposes.

AB  - The California Current System (CCS) has experienced large fluctuations in environmental conditions in recent years that have dramatically affected the biological community. Here we synthesize remotely sensed, hydrographic, and biological survey data from throughout the CCS in 2019-2020 to evaluate how recent changes in environmental conditions have affected community dynamics at multiple trophic levels. A marine heatwave formed in the north Pacific in 2019 and reached the second greatest area ever recorded by the end of summer 2020. However, high atmospheric pressure in early 2020 drove relatively strong Ekman-driven coastal upwelling in the northern portion of the CCS and warm temperature anomalies remained far offshore. Upwelling and cooler temperatures in the northern CCS created relatively productive conditions in which the biomass of lipid-rich copepod species increased, adult krill size increased, and several seabird species experienced positive reproductive success. Despite these conditions, the composition of the fish community in the northern CCS remained a mixture of both warm- and cool-water-associated species. In the southern CCS, ocean temperatures remained above average for the seventh consecutive year. Abundances of juvenile fish species associated with productive conditions were relatively low, and the ichthyoplankton community was dominated by a mixture of oceanic warm-water and cosmopolitan species. Seabird species associated with warm water also occurred at greater densities than cool-water species in the southern CCS. The population of northern anchovy, which has been resurgent since 2017, continued to provide an important forage base for piscivorous fishes, offshore colonies of seabirds, and marine mammals throughout the CCS. Coastal upwelling in the north, and a longer-term trend in warming in the south, appeared to be controlling the community to a much greater extent than the marine heatwave itself.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/CE) requires the use of different biological indicators, supporting physicochemical and hydromorphological elements, in the assessment of the ecological status of rivers: in each member state rivers should be at least in a good condition (or good ecological potential if heavily modified) by 2015, and those failing this criterion should be restored. Given that the need for restoration is primarily based on the results from ecological classifications, precision of these classifications is essential.
   The present study analyzed the relationships of two different biological communities (diatom and macroinvertebrate) when they are used to characterize a set of sites (from reference sites to human-impacted sites) within a single stream type (Mediterranean small sized volcanic-siliceous streams). In particular, we examine the issue of concordance among these communities and the anthropogenic stressors detected, using both multivariate and multimetric approach.
   Mantel test based on Bray-Curtis distance showed that assemblage dissimilarity between diatom and macroinvertebrate was weakly correlated, dissuading the use of one taxa group as surrogate of the other. The two biological indicators similarly reflected the overall river integrity, but provided complementary information on the specific stressors. Particularly, in accordance to previous studies, our results show that macroinvertebrate assemblage was influenced by water quality (nutrients enrichment and organic pollution) and habitat degradation. On the other hand, same as for benthos, diatom assemblage was regulated by chemical factors (especially nutrients), while did not show strong responses to morphological degradations.
   In addition, the ecological status of volcanic streams was evaluated by means of the two Intercalibration Common Metrics Indices (ICMi), based, respectively, on macroinvertebrate and diatom communities. The two ICM indices, developed for the Italian biomonitoring program (sensu WFD), were strongly correlated and provided a final classification mainly related to the water quality (nutrient enrichment and organic pollution). However, both indices were less sensitive to the hydromorphological alterations, highlighting the need for the development of stressor specific indices to achieve a complete evaluation of the anthropogenic stress present in the area. Studies of this kind across different disturbance gradients and focused on a particular river type (e.g. Mediterranean small-size volcanic-siliceous streams), will enable the relative merits of the indicators to become apparent and greatly facilitate their appropriate application.

AB  - The present paper proposes a novel fuzzy-VORS (vigor, organization, resilience, ecosystem services) model by integrating fuzzy logic and a VORS model to predict ecosystem health conditions in Abha city of Saudi Arabia from the past to the future. In this study, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was utilized to classify the land use land cover (LULC) maps for 1990, 2000, and 2018. The LULCs dynamics in 1990-2000, 2000-2018, and 1990-2018 were computed using delta (Delta) change and Markovian transitional probability matrix. The future LULC map for 2028 was predicted using the artificial neural network-cellular automata model (ANN-CA). The machine learning algorithms, such as random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (CART), and probability distribution function (PDF) were utilized to perform sensitivity analysis. Pearson's correlation technique was used to explore the correlation between the predicted models and their driving variables. The ecosystem health conditions for 1990-2028 were predicted by integrating the fuzzy inference system with the VORS model. The results of LULC maps showed that urban areas increased by 334.4% between 1990 and 2018. Except for dense vegetation, all the natural resources and generated ecosystem services have been decreased significantly due to the rapid and continuous urbanization process. A future LULC map (2028) showed that the built-up area would be 343.72 km(2). The new urban area in 2028 would be 169 km(2). All techniques for sensitivity analysis showed that proximity to urban areas, vegetation, and scrubland are highly sensitive to land suitability models to simulate and predict LULC maps of 2018 and 2028. Global sensitivity analysis showed that fragmentation or organization was the most sensitive parameter for ecosystem health conditions.

AB  - Physiological metrics are becoming popular tools for assessing individual condition and population health to inform wildlife management and conservation decisions. Corticosterone assays can provide information on howanimals cope with individual and habitat-level stressors, and the recent development of feather assays is an exciting innovation that could yield important insights for conservation of wild birds. Due to the widespread enthusiasm for feather corticosterone as a potential bioindicator, studies are needed to assess the ability of this technique to detect meaningful differences in physiological stress across a variety of stressor types and intensities. We examined feather corticosterone from 144 individuals among the 13 known breeding populations of Hawaiian gallinule (Gallinula galeata sandvicensis), an endangered waterbird, on the island of O'ahu. These ecologically independent subpopulations are known to have low genetic connectivity and movement rates and differ largely across a number of important conditions, including level of predator management, human disturbance, proximity to urban development and conspecific population density. This system is well suited for assessing the performance of feather corticosterone as a bioindicator of different known habitat-level threats common to this and many other conservation-reliant species. We found no statistically significant relationship between feather corticosterone and level of predator control, level of humandisturbance, gallinule population density, percent urban cover or body condition across all sites despite the substantial difference in stressor magnitude in our dataset. We did find that gallinules in habitats with larger population densities were in worse body condition. These findings suggest that feather corticosterone is not a consistent indicator of anthropogenic impacts on populations. Furthermore, they suggest that feather corticosterone may be a poor bioindicator of known habitat-level threats for Hawaiian gallinules and that it should be used with caution in other avian taxa of conservation concern.

AB  - Freshwater biodiversity underlies severe threats, mainly suffering from habitat degradation by anthropogenic land use, in particular by urbanisation. However, recent long-term studies indicate recovery of stream macroinvertebrate diversity due to improved water quality at least in North America and Europe. We monitored macroinverbrates at 56 urban stream sites over a 12-year period (2009-2020) in Braunschweig, a German urban district. We utilised these data to investigate spatio-temporal changes in taxon richness and assemblage structure as well as factors potentially affecting the resulting patterns. Overall taxon richness was increasing over the study period, comprising both all taxa and taxa being indicators for healthy stream conditions. 53.6% of the sites had significant positive trends becoming most eminent since 2014, despite decelerating since 2018, the beginning of an extra-ordinary dry period. Only 10.7% of the study sites had negative trends. Assemblage structure was shaped by environmental factors like stream width and water quality. Over-average taxon richness including positive trends and higher numbers of indicator taxa of healthy stream conditions was found in streams with higher flow velocity, good saprobic conditions and more natural streambed structure. In contrast, low taxon richness and predominance of tolerant taxa were found in streams with more degraded conditions. Most of the environmental conditions having positive effects on taxon richness were improved by various programs set up by the environmental authorities. We therefore conclude, if urban stressors like organic pollution and structural degradation can be mitigated by revitalisation and water quality improvement, urban streams can have good potential for increasing biodiversity and improving ecological functioning.

AB  - The biogeochemistry of the Gulf of Maine (GOM) is rapidly changing in response to the changing climate, including rising temperatures, acidification, and declining primary productivity. These impacts are projected to worsen over the next 100 y and will apply selective pressure on populations of marine calcifiers. This study investigates the transcriptome expression response to these changes in ecologically and economically important marine calcifiers, blue mussels. Wild mussels (Mytilus edulis and Mytilus trossulus) were sampled from sites spanning the GOM and exposed to two different biogeochemical water conditions: (1) present-day conditions in the GOM and (2) simulated future conditions, which included elevated temperature, increased acidity, and decreased food supply. Patterns of gene expression were measured using RNA sequencing from 24 mussel samples and contrasted between ambient and future conditions. The net calcification rate, a trait predicted to be under climate-induced stress. was measured for each individual over a 2-wk exposure period and used as a covariate along with gene expression patterns. Generalized linear models, with and without the calcification rate, were used to identify differentially expressed transcripts between ambient and future conditions. The comparison revealed transcripts that likely comprise a core stress response characterized by the induction of molecular chaperones, genes involved in aerobic metabolism, and indicators of cellular stress. Furthermore, the model contrasts revealed transcripts that may be associated with individual variation in calcification rate and suggest possible biological processes that may have downstream effects on calcification phenotypes, such as zinc-ion binding and protein degradation. Overall, these findings contribute to the understanding of blue mussel adaptive responses to imminent climate change and suggest metabolic pathways are resilient in variable environments.

AB  - Constructed wetlands, especially mangroves, have been studied for their usefulness in sewage treatment but the effects of mangrove vegetation and a sewage load on mangrove macrofauna have been given little attention. Ocypodid crabs are important components of mangrove forests and constitute good bioindicators of the functioning of the ecosystem as a whole. In constructed mangrove mesocosms, three vegetation treatments (bare substratum, and Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata seedlings) were subjected to 0, 20, 60 and 100% sewage loads from a nearby hotel. The physiological condition of introduced Uca annulipes and Uca inversa was evaluated in terms of their RNA/DNA ratio after one, five and twelve months, and used as an indicator of ecological function in the system. Crab condition in 0% sewage load was similar to that of wild crabs throughout, suggesting no significant effects of the mesocosms on their RNA/DNA ratio. Overall, both species coped well with the administered sewage loads, suggesting good ecological function in the system. Both species manifested similar patterns in RNA/DNA ratio, being more affected by seasonal fluctuations than by sewage load and vegetation presence and type. Higher RNA/DNA ratios were recorded in the long compared to the short rainy season. Sewage enhanced crab condition in the bare substratum and R mucronata treatments, especially after one year, probably as a result of enhanced food availability. Uca inversa may be more sensitive to sewage pollution than U. annulipes. In A. marina, no difference in crab condition was observed between sewage loads, and this mangrove yielded the best reduction in sewage impacts. Our results support the usefulness of constructed mangrove areas in sewage treatment, especially if planted with A. marina and inhabited by physiologically healthy ocypodid crabs to enhance the system's performance.

AB  - This study examined the effects of watershed development on macrobenthic communities in tidal creeks of Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, U.S. Two types of creeks were evaluated: upland creeks which drained watersheds consisting of at feast 15% terrestrial land cover, and salt marsh creeks which drained no upland habitat (i.e., only intertidal habitat). Samples of macrobenthic organisms were taken along the longitudinal axis of twenty-three primary (first order) tidal creeks. Water and sediment quality data were also collected including measurements of dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, sediment characteristics, and toxic chemicals in the creek sediments. Hypoxic conditions occurred more than 15% of the time in both reference and developed creeks and were a natural attribute of these systems. The most severe and frequent hypoxia occurred in impacted salt marsh creeks. Salinity fluctuations were the greatest in developed upland creeks and salinity range was identified as a potentially reliable indicator of the degree to which watershed development has altered hydrodynamic processes. The creeks draining urban and industrial watersheds were degraded environments characterized by watersheds with high (> 50%) levels of impervious surface, broad fluctuations in salinity, severe hypoxia, and potentially toxic levels of chemicals in the sediment. These creeks had low macrobenthic diversity and abundance and were numerically dominated by the oligochaete Monopylephorus rubroniveus in mud sediments, and the polychaete Laeonereis culveri in sand sediments. Suburban watersheds had 15-35% impervious surface and creeks draining them were exposed to frequent hypoxia and broad salinity fluctuations. The levels of chemical contaminants in sediments of suburban and impacted salt marsh creeks were generally not different from the levels in reference creeks. Macrobenthic diversity and abundance were higher for suburban and impacted salt marsh creeks than for urban and industrial creeks. However, suburban and salt marsh impacted creeks were numerically dominated by a few pollution indicative species including the oligochaetes M. rubroniveus and Tubificoides brownae and the polychaete L. culveri. These creeks appear to be exhibiting early signs of degradation (e.g., a simplified food web). Two promising community-level macrobenthic metrics for assessing environmental quality were identified: the proportional abundance of pollution indicative taxa, and the proportional abundance of pollution sensitive taxa. These indicators were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the salinity range, the level of chemical contaminants in sediments, and amount of impervious surface in, the watershed.

AB  - Visual assessments are integral components of several widely promoted efforts to assess the health of stream and riparian areas across the Nation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Habitat Assessment Field Data Sheet (HAFDS), U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Stream Visual Assessment (SVA), and U.S. Department of Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Proper Functioning Condition (PFC) assessment were applied to 234 rangeland riparian areas to determine: 1) how well the assessments correlate, and 2) how site-specific stream and riparian characteristics affect the outcome of each assessment and thus the comparison of outcomes across stream types. Habitat Assessment Field Data Sheet and Stream Visual Assessment are habitat driven assessments, which target similar parameters resulting in a strong positive correlation between these methods (r = 0.81). BLM's Proper Functioning Condition focuses on parameters related to hydrologic function, thus a weaker correlation was found when comparing Proper Functioning Condition to the Habitat Assessment Field Data Sheet and the NRCS' Stream Visual Assessment methods (r = 0.58 and 0.54, respectively). A combination of one habitat assessment and Proper Functioning Condition should be utilized to conduct a comprehensive assessment of riparian/stream health. Site characteristics, which were significantly associated with assessment outcomes included entrenchment ratio, substrate size, channel width to depth and slope. This presents a problem in that comparison of assessment outcomes across different streams and stream reaches are confounded by factors such as slope and substrate type, which may not always be indicative of riparian/stream health. The Rosgen Stream Morphology Classification system was used to successfully control for the effect of these site-specific effects on assessment outcome, allowing for comparison of riparian/stream health assessments across streams.

AB  - Fine roots play an important role in nutrient and water absorption and hence overall tree performance. However, current understanding of the ecological role of belowground traits lags considerably behind those of aboveground traits. In this study, we used data on specific root length (SRL), fine root diameter (D) and branching intensity (BI) of two datasets to examine interspecific trait coordination as well as intraspecific trait variation across ontogenetic stage and soil conditions (i.e., plasticity). The first dataset included saplings of 12 North American temperate tree species grown in monocultures in a common garden experiment to examine interspecific trait coordination. The second dataset included adult and juvenile individuals of four species (present in both datasets) co-occurring in natural forests on contrasting soils (i.e., humid organic, mesic, and xeric podzolic).The three fine root traits investigated were strongly coordinated, with high SRL being related to low D and high BI. Fine root traits and aboveground life-strategies (i.e., relative growth rate) were weakly coordinated and never significant. Intraspecific responses to changes in ontogenetic stage or soil conditions were trait dependent. SRL was significantly higher in juveniles compared to adults for Abies balsamea and Acer rubrum, but did not vary with soil condition. BI did not vary significantly with either ontogeny or soil conditions, while D was generally significantly lower in juveniles and higher in humid organic soils. D also had the least total variability most of which was due to changes in the environment (plasticity). This study brings support for the emerging evidence for interspecific root trait coordination in trees. It also indicates that intraspecific responses to both ontogeny and soil conditions are trait dependent and less concerted. D appears to be a better indicator of environmental change than SRL and BI.

AB  - Understanding the implications of environmental disturbance is of growing importance as climate change and extreme weather events increasingly threaten estuaries and other coastal ecosystems. Among species at risk in estuarine habitats, sport fishes are of particular interest to conservation and management agencies, because of their ecological and economic value. Here, we evaluate the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the abundance, diet, and body condition of age-0 red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) in Powderhorn Lake, a nearshore estuary in Texas, USA. Catch data from seines indicated that the abundances of age-0 red drum and spotted seatrout were not affected by the hurricane in the study system, but stomach contents and morphometric data show that diet and body condition changed after the event. Both species exhibited declines in body condition based on weight-length ratios, and diets included a greater proportion of invertebrates (i.e., shrimp, crab) post-disturbance, which may have been attributed to changes in fish assemblage structure within the estuary. Trophic niche overlap between age-0 red drum and spotted seatrout also decreased by up to 50% after the event, potentially serving as a mechanism to reduce competition in response to decreased prey availability. Thus, while more easily measured indicators of resistance/resilience (i.e., abundance) did not indicate effects of Hurricane Harvey on sport fishes in Powderhorn Lake, body condition and diet suggest impacts were observed among age-0 fish. Declines in body condition and greater reliance on crustacean prey could have implications for survival, fitness, and harvestability, particularly if more energy is allocated to maintenance during recovery, rather than growth.

AB  - The increasing pressure on marine biodiversity emphasizes the importance of finding benchmarks against which to assess change. This is, however, a notoriously difficult task in estuarine ecosystems, where environmental gradients are steep, and where benthic biodiversity is highly variable in space and time. Although recent emphasis on diverse, healthy benthic communities in legislative frameworks has increased the number of indices developed for assessing benthic status, there is a lack of quantitative baselines in benthic diversity that would enable comparisons across broad spatial scales, encompassing different environmental settings and bioregions. By taking advantage of long-term monitoring data, spanning hundreds of stations over the past 40 years, we provide a comprehensive analysis of benthic alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, encompassing the entire salinity gradient of the open sea areas of the large, brackish-water Baltic Sea. Using a relatively simple measure, average regional diversity, we define area-specific reference conditions and acceptable deviation against which to gauge current conditions in benthic macrofaunal diversity. Results show a severely impaired condition throughout large areas of the Baltic for the assessment period 2001-2006. All ecosystems are plagued by baselines that shift in time and space, and their definition is not trivial, but average regional diversity may offer a transparent way to deal with such changes in low-diversity systems. Identifying baselines will be of increasing importance given the potential of climatic drivers to interact with local anthropogenic stressors to affect patterns of biodiversity. Our analysis provides an evaluation of the current condition in a system that has been heavily influenced by anthropogenic impact and changing oceanographic conditions, and it provides a basis for future impact assessment and ecosystem-based management.

AB  - The Atlantic Slope Consortium (ASC) is a project designed to develop and test a set of indicators in coastal systems that are ecologically appropriate, economically reasonable, and relevant to society. The suite of indicators will produce integrated assessments of the condition, health and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems based on ecological and socioeconomic information compiled at the scale of estuarine segments and small watersheds. The research mandate of the ASC project is the following: Using a universe of watersheds, covering a range of social choices, we ask two questions:
   center dot How "good'' can the environment be, given those social choices?
   center dot What is the intellectual model of condition within those choices, i.e., what are the causes of condition and what are the steps for improvement?
   As a basis for compiling ecological indicators, a watershed classification system was required for the experimental design. The goal was to develop approximately. five categories of watersheds for each physiographic province, utilizing landscape and land use parameters that would be predictive of aquatic resource condition. All 14-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) watersheds in the Mid-Atlantic region would then be classified according to the regime. Five parameters were utilized for the classification: three land cover categories, consisting of forested, agricultural, and urban, median slope or median elevation, and total variance of land covers in 1-km-radius circles positioned on all stream convergence points in a specified 14-digit HUC watershed. Cluster analysis utilizing these five parameters resulted in approximately five well-defined watershed classes per physiographic province. The distribution of all watersheds in the Mid-Atlantic region across these categories provides a unique report on the probable condition of watersheds in the region.

AB  - Key issues with defining reference condition for stream bioassessment are (1) equivocal definitions of minimally disturbed' pressure criteria and wide-ranging approaches to site selection, (2) highly modified regions where near-pristine areas do not exist, leading to management decisions based on inconsistent and unquantified benchmarks and (3) costly field campaigns associated with extensive spatial survey' approaches. We used generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) to classify stream segments into ecotypes, and transparently and efficiently define candidate reference conditions for the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program (EHMP) assessment area in south-eastern Queensland, a highly modified region with a complex biogeographic history. We modelled fish presence-absence data from 396 sites with GIS-based natural and anthropogenic predictors. Stream segments were classified into ecotypes using the GDM-transformed natural variables so that (1) reference-site selection adequately covered the -diversity of the study area and (2) we could evaluate the validity of incorporating sites from neighbouring catchments outside of the EHMP assessment area. Relationships between selected anthropogenic variables (the river disturbance index and %stream connectivity) and fish assemblages were used to define pressure criteria and map candidate reference conditions. We conclude by describing a new framework that can be used to select indicator-specific reference sites by GDM and a stratified, probabilistic sampling design.

AB  - The improvement of land management practices on lands susceptible to desertification requires information on the status and condition of the existing resources as well as any change occurring in the resource condition over time. The Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has developed a statistical survey design for monitoring the condition of ecological resources on large spatial scales. EMAP-Rangelands used a uniformity sampling study in 1993 to evaluate response plot designs for three categories of indicators (soils, vegetation, and spectral reflectance) to be used for monitoring ecological condition of a site. The response plot design study was developed to integrate on-site measurements for the three indicator categories. The study was conducted on the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah in three rangeland resource classes (grassland, desertscrub, and conifer woodland) of differing productivity levels in an attempt to develop a common plot design for all three resource classes. Basic measurement units were developed to facilitate integration of data collection. Preliminary spatial analysis of the sampling study found considerable differences in variation patterns among the study sites and measurement categories for the indicator classes used by EMAP-Rangelands. Evidence of substantial trends in the indicator measurements on monitoring sites relative to regional trends leads to the conclusion that nonstationary spatial models for biological processes on a monitoring site may be needed to fulfill the requirements for developing plot designs and indicator criteria.

AB  - Many authors have addressed the relationship between body condition and ecological parameters in a wide range of studies, suggesting a better fitness in those individuals with higher values of body condition. However, body size and body condition of individuals can vary significantly at the intraspecific level between geographic locations, which is usually explained by phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation. We suggest that a higher body condition per se might not be a good indicator of physiological health status, particularly when comparing populations inhabiting places with different levels of habitat alteration. We examined two populations of the western pond turtle Emys marmorata in the northern part of California's Central Valley, and found that individuals inhabiting a water pollution control plant located on the valley floor had significantly larger body size and higher body condition than those inhabiting an unaltered natural habitat in the foothills. However, turtles from the water pollution control plant did not show a better health status, estimated by comparisons between two immune system variables: T-cell-mediated immune response and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio. Parameters such as body size and body condition might be misleading indicators of health condition, particularly when they are used to estimate health status of populations from habitats with different levels of alteration. We emphasize the importance of using physiological methods in assessing the conservation state of wildlife populations, rather than relying on biometric indices that might miss important effects of alteration.

AB  - Seabirds are important predators in marine ecosystems and are commonly used to monitor the productivity of their marine environments. However, different measures of seabird breeding success differ in their sensitivity to environmental conditions. Here, we present an analysis of provisioning rates and chick growth as well as hatching and fledging success, in thin-billed prions Pachyptila belcheri at New Island, Falkland Islands between 2003 and 2005 and relate these patterns to ocean climate. During the study period, SST were rising within and between breeding seasons and were negatively correlated with provisioning frequencies of thin-billed prions. Chick mass was reduced and begging intensities increased at low feeding frequencies, but overall breeding success and fledging success were not affected, because most chicks in survived to fledging despite poor provisioning rates. Chick numbers and survival therefore may not be sensitive indicators of environmental conditions in all seabird species and ranges of food abundance. Monitoring behavioural buffering mechanisms, such as feeding rates, may be more effective in some ranges of food abundance and time scales and provide an earlier warning of ecological change. As a novel technique, the use of begging intensities as indicator of chick body condition is proposed in species where repeated handling causes disturbance. The present data suggest that begging rates can serve as a non-invasive method to monitor chick condition.

AB  - The main objectives of this study were to determine the influence of several strains of ectomycorrhizal fungi on the growth of Acacia holosericea in a dry tropical environment and their short-term effect on indicators of ecosystem soil conditions such as biological soil properties (microbial biomass, mycorrhizal soil infectivity). Three fungal strains have been tested: Pisolithus albus IR 100, P. albus COI024 and Scleroderma dictyosporum IR 109. Ectomycorrhizal inoculation has significantly enhanced the growth (shoot and root biomass) of A. holosericea seedlings after 4 months culture in glasshouse conditions in a disinfected soil. In field conditions, the transplanting shock was less important for the ectomycorrhized trees. After 2 years, the inoculated trees had a better growth than that recorded in the control treatment. Ectomycorrhizal inoculation has significantly stimulated height, leave and wood biomass, root biomass of A. holosericea trees. Moreover, this fungal inoculation has significantly modified the leaf nutrient contents for P, N and phenols. Microbial biomass and mycorrhizal soil infectivity were also larger in the inoculated plots.
   Ectomycorrhizal inoculation could be of great relevance to improve the reafforestation process of degraded areas with legumes fast growing trees. This biological practice could also ameliorate soil characteristics such as microbial biomass or mycorrhizal soil infectivity. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainable groundwater management provides an opportunity for environmental water needs to be considered and secured by establishing appropriate groundwater thresholds. Ecosystems that require access to groundwater for some or all their water requirements are referred to as groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs). However, large data gaps often exist around the cause-and-effect relationships between groundwater conditions and the impacts they have on GDEs. These data gaps are largely attributed to a lack of shallow monitoring wells near GDEs, and a lack of practical biological metrics to characterize ecosystem health. This transdisciplinary study explores the use of geophysics (electrical resistivity tomography) to fill in our understanding of shallow subsurface soil-hydrological conditions within GDEs. In addition, we develop an approach to characterize ecosystem health within GDEs, using groundwater-dependent vegetation (phreatophytes) as indicators. Ten vegetation variables were used to characterize six biological indicators-growth, diversity, recruitment, structure, native plant dominance, and survivorship-which were used to infer ecosystem health conditions. Health indicators for groundwater-dependent vegetation were found to directly correlate with subsurface conditions, where greater groundwater availability (higher soil moisture content and shallower groundwater levels) was associated with "healthier" vegetation. This study provides a new approach to integrate hydrological, geophysical, and biological data to strengthen monitoring programs and inform water resource management decisions.

AB  - The assessment of ecological impacts of pumped-storage (PS) hydropower plants on the two connected water bodies is usually based on present climatic conditions. However, significant changes in climate must be expected during their long concession periods. We, therefore, investigate the combined effects of climate change and PS operations on water temperature and quality, as well as extent and duration of stratification and ice cover, using a site in Switzerland. For this purpose, a coupled two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model for the two connected water bodies is run with 150years long synthetic stochastic meteorological forcing for both current and future climate conditions under two PS and two reference scenarios. The results show relevant synergistic and antagonistic effects of PS operations and climate change. For example, hypolimnion temperatures in September are projected to increase by <0.6 degrees C in a near-natural reference scenario and by 2.5 degrees C in an extended PS scenario. Ice cover, which occurs every year under near-natural conditions in the current climate, would almost completely vanish with extended PS operation in the future climate. Conversely, the expected negative impacts of climate change on hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations are partially counteracted by extended PS operations. We, therefore, recommend considering future climate conditions for the environmental impact assessment in the planning of new or the recommissioning of existing PS hydropower plants.

AB  - The main objectives of this study were to reconstruct the environmental conditions for a small oligotrophic lake during the last two centuries, to determine if the environment of the lake was anthropogenically mediated, and to assess the pre-impact reference conditions with palaeolimnological techniques. A short sediment core from Lake Nohipalu Valgjarv was analysed in detail for diatom assemblages as well as for loss-on-ignition measurements. Accurate chronology of the sediment core was established and evaluated by different independent approaches - Pb-210, Cs-137, and Am-241 dating, and the distribution of spheroidal fly-ash particles in sediments. Quantitative inference models based on sedimentary diatoms were applied to reconstruct changes in past lake water pH. Before the mid-19th century, Nohipalu Valgjarv was an oligotrophic lake with clear water continuously transparent down to the bottom and with rich benthic diatom flora. Since the early second half of the 19th century, presumably as a result of forest logging around the lake, water transparency decreased and benthic diatom productivity diminished, and the lake did not recover any more to natural baseline conditions. Due to peat mining activities in the Meenikunno bog, the quality of lake water has changed during the last two decades. The lowered lake level, deteriorated light climate, and decreased pH are the most important environmental variables that have influenced the lake ecosystem.

AB  - Drainage and afforestation of peatlands cause extensive habitat degradation and species losses. Restoration supports peatland biodiversity by creating suitable habitat conditions, including stable high water tables. However, colonization by characteristic species can take decades or even fail. Peatland recovery is often monitored shortly after restoration, but initial trends may not continue, and results might differ among taxonomic groups. This study analyzes trends in plant, dragonfly, and butterfly diversity within 18 years after rewetting of montane peatlands in central Germany. We compared diversity and species composition of 19 restored sites with three drained peatlands and one near-natural reference site. Restoration resulted in improved habitat conditions and benefited species diversity, but there were marked differences among taxonomic groups. Dragonflies rapidly colonized small water bodies but their diversity did not further increase in older restoration sites. Characteristic peatland vegetation recovered slowly, since it depended on a high water holding capacity that was only reached after peat started accumulating. Generally, plant diversity developed toward reference conditions albeit incompletely, even 18 years after restoration. Butterflies responded less to peatland restoration; generalists increased only temporarily and specialists could not establish. In conclusion, peatland restoration improves habitat conditions and biodiversity, while trajectories of recovery are nonlinear and incomplete after two decades. This highlights the need for long-term monitoring and a strategic selection of indicator species for evaluation of restoration success.

AB  - Point-sampling of water is often referred to as an inaccurate and crude method for use in estuaries; however, budgetary, spatial and time constraints often leave it as the only feasible option. The present paper investigates the relationship between spring water quality and diatom sampling of 52 eastern Australian subtropical estuaries and the OzCoasts determined classification of estuarine condition. In general, estuarine health decreases along the total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and the centric to pennate diatom ratio gradients. However, although there is a general trend, results are varied within each class, with some estuaries classed as extensively modified, recording low nutrient conditions. Principal components analysis (PCA) indicated that 55% of the variance among sites is explained by the first and second axes, with TN, TP, TN:TP, latitude and pH having high correlation with PCA Axis 1, and temperature, conductivity and the centric to pennate diatom ratio being correlated with Axis 2. Two diatom species that may have bioindicator value for estuary conditions were identified. We concluded that even though natural variability and accurate characterisation of estuaries is not possible with point-sampling, it can still identify important information on the status of estuarine condition, particularly in relation to total nutrient concentrations where budget and/or time constraints limit environmental monitoring.

AB  - Intervention is often required for the restoration of damaged arid ecosystems, particularly when the base environmental conditions are no longer suitable for autogenic recovery. Umm Nigga, in Kuwait, was damaged by overgrazing and destructive camping. It is unclear whether its restoration will require remediation of the soil conditions, or whether autogenic succession can occur once the area is fenced and released from this pressure. Thus, in this project, we assessed the current condition of the site by collecting soil samples and vegetation assessment within each ecosystem and determined suitable locations for the re-vegetation of native seeds and seedlings using geographical information system. Our results showed that the vegetation in the coastal portions of the ecosystem was not damaged. However, in the desert ecosystem locations, vegetation cover was very low and composed of very few species in the damaged areas but still, most soil nutrients were in supply similar to that in the control areas. We conclude that soil remediation and re-vegetation are, likely, not necessary to restore the damaged sites in any of these ecosystems. Rather, fencing alone will probably release the ecosystem. With these sites as a model, a conceptual framework is presented for arid ecosystem assessment and restoration planning.

AB  - Many state water-quality agencies use biological assessment methods based on lotic fish and macroinvertebrate communities, but relatively few states have incorporated algal multimetric indices into monitoring programs. Algae are good indicators for monitoring water quality because they are sensitive to many environmental stressors. We evaluated benthic algal community attributes along a landuse gradient affecting wadeable streams and rivers in Maine, USA, to identify potential bioassessment metrics. We collected epilithic algal samples from 193 locations across the state. We computed weighted-average optima for common taxa for total P, total N, specific conductance, % impervious cover, and % developed watershed, which included all land use that is no longer forest or wetland. We assigned Maine stream tolerance values and categories (sensitive, intermediate, tolerant) to taxa based on their optima and responses to watershed disturbance. We evaluated performance of algal community metrics used in multimetric indices from other regions and novel metrics based on Maine data. Metrics specific to Maine data, such as the relative richness of species characterized as being sensitive in Maine, were more correlated with % developed watershed than most metrics used in other regions. Few community-structure attributes (e.g., species richness) were useful metrics in Maine. Performance of algal bioassessment models would be improved if metrics were evaluated with attributes of local data before inclusion in multimetric indices or statistical models.

AB  - In this paper the Marine Fish Community Index (MFCI) for the assessment of ecological status of marine environment is proposed. The MFCI was divided into 4 typologies: Rocky subtidal; shallow, intermediate and deep soft-bottoms. Based on the typical community associated to each typology and the DPSIR analysis performed, a set of metrics were selected and tested through a multiple correlation matrix (Pearson's coefficient) and the core ones included in the index. The MFCI was applied in all typologies and the scores obtained with each metric were analyzed. In order to test the robustness of the MFCI the final ecological value of each zone was recalculated by removing Successively one metric at a tinge. The MFCI showed a sensitive and robust response in the ecological status assessment. Since it incorporates both functional and structural Community information, the MFCI can be useful in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive as well as in other contexts of conservation and sustainable management of the marine environment.

AB  - The macrophyte vegetation of Central Europe's rivers and streams has markedly impoverished during the last decades as a consequence of man's impact on water chemistry and hydromorphology. Here, we examine relationships between species composition and about 35 physical, chemical and river morphological parameters in 69 water courses (291 sampling plots) in the Pleistocene lowlands of northwest Germany for identifying indicator species and environmental parameters suited for categorizing habitat types, growing conditions and the anthropogenic influence in these profoundly altered aquatic ecosystems. Of the 94 species recorded in total, 31 frequent taxa were analyzed for their affinity to specific environmental conditions. Current velocity and water depth (river size) were the most influential determinants of community composition while chemical factors were of secondary importance. We identified eight macrophyte assemblages, each with their own distinctive indicator species and characteristic combinations of growth forms. Small rhithral, relatively nutrient-poor water courses with high velocity were indicated by Myriophyllum alterniflorum and Ranunculus peltatus, while Elodea nuttallii, Myriophyllum spicatum and Spirodela polyrhiza characterized large, potamal water courses with high trophy. We conclude that macrophytes may serve as valuable bioindicators of habitat conditions even in anthropogenically altered running waters, but the specific effects of physical, chemical, and river morphological factors are difficult to separate.

AB  - The authors present a framework that illustrates how a resource quality index can be used to examine policy relevant questions regarding environmental condition, the management of a resource as a production output, and sustainability. The framework demonstrates that heterogeneous endowments of a resource can change over time in different ways. By evaluating these changes using substitution, reversibility and uncertainty criteria, we can suggest four general guidelines for managing an environmental resource in a single production process. This framework was applied in a case study to three soil types (stable, neutral and susceptible) used in agricultural production in the Midwestern United States. By evaluating the economic and environmental impacts of managing soil quality under different sustainability and profit objectives, we uncovered policy relevant information including: which soils need to be preserved; when public intervention is needed to attain sustainability; and what perceptions of sustainability may be worth pursuing at all. The accuracy of these insights is highly dependent upon the reliability of the assessment of resource quality. An index was useful in this resource assessment because it could adapt to many of the complexities of environmental condition. We offer three lessons in refining resource indicators so that they may be used in the framework to better achieve optimal resource management and a greater understanding of what sustainability really means.

KW  - wind power prediction
AB  - More accurate wind power prediction (WPP) is of great significance for the operation of electrical power systems, as offshore wind power penetration increases continuously. As the offshore wind turbines (OWT) are a key system in converting offshore wind power into electrical power, maintaining their condition plays a pivotal role in WPP. However, it is seldom considered in traditional WPP. This paper proposes an ultra-short term offshore WPP methodology based on the condition assessment (CA) of OWTs. Firstly, a modified fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (MFCE) based CA of the OWT is presented with a new defined deterioration of indicators calculated by the relative errors. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is introduced to deal with the complicated interactions between the various monitoring data of an OWT and the dynamic marine environment. Then, with the classifications of the health conditions of the OWT, the historical operation data is classified accordingly. An OWT-condition based WPP with a backpropagation (BP) neural network is developed to deal with the non-linear mapping relations between the numerical weather prediction (NWP) information, health conditions of OWT, and the output power. The results of the case study show the influences of the OWT health conditions to its output power and verifies the effectiveness and higher accuracy of the proposed method.

AB  - Global biodiversity is decreasing as a consequence of environmental changes and freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened. There is an urgent need to identify indicators that are both sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances and predictive of the consequences of biodiversity changes on ecosystem functioning. The fungal compartment associated with decaying leaves is an excellent candidate for this purpose, given its key role in leaf litter breakdown, a major ecosystem process. In this study, we determined the extent to which microbial richness and biomass associated with leaf-decaying leaves could be used to predict impacts of multiple disturbances on ecosystem functioning using dams as models of multi-stressed (i.e. physically and chemically) ecosystems.
   We conducted in situ and laboratory experiments to assess the response of the microbial compartment associated with decaying leaf litter to multiple stressors associated with dams and consequences on higher trophic levels. First, fungal biomass and taxa richness of communities associated with decaying alder leaf litter were determined at nine field sites. Second, two experiments under laboratory conditions were conducted with conditioned leaves from the field experiment to assess consequences of fungal changes on (1) their direct contribution to leaf litter breakdown by measuring the production of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), and (2) leaf litter breakdown by two leaf-shredding invertebrates, Gammarus pulex and Allogamus auricollis, by measuring leaf consumption rates and FPOM production.
   In the absence of contamination, the presence of a dam reduced fungal biomass in reservoirs and downstream reaches. Contaminated sediments significantly affected fungal biomass and taxa richness in reservoirs and appeared to lead to synergistic impacts further downstream. Laboratory experiments evidenced the cascading effects on their contribution to ecosystem functioning (i.e. directly by modifying their performance to breakdown leaf litter and indirectly by modifying shredder performance).
   This study highlights the sensitivity of fungal-based indicators and their value for aquatic ecosystem bioassessment methodologies, identifying the effects of multiple stressors and reflecting the initial signs of ecosystem functioning impairment. Given the importance of the fate of organic matter stewed within reservoirs for ecosystems downstream, the microbial compartment associated with decaying leaves could provide powerful indicators of the integrity of reservoir functioning, with strong potential for use in the risk assessment of multiple stressors associated with dams.

AB  - The 'normative definitions' of ecological water quality classes given by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) are narrative descriptions of the conditions present in water bodies of different qualities relative to reference conditions found in unimpacted sites. Defining the type-specific reference conditions for water bodies and finding biological metrics that sensitively reflect only the anthropogenic deviations from those conditions are the biggest challenges that the ecological status assessment faces. This study aimed at phytoplankton, macrophyte, macro-invertebrates and fish-based assessment in two high mountain glacial lakes and establishing preliminary reference conditions. The lakes are located in Rila and Pirin Mountains, Southwest Bulgaria. Chernoto Lake is ultra-oligotrophic and has abundant submerged macrophytes; Bezbog Lake is also oligotrophic with submerged macrophytes, both with macrozoobenthic communities typical for oligosaprobic conditions. Sampling was carried out from July to September in 2009 and 2011. The biological and water quality parameters in the lakes are discussed. Indices elaborated in a European context (Algae Group Index, Reference Index, adapted biotic index, Pantie & Buck's saprobic index and German trophic index PETI) were tested on the collected data set. The type-specific taxa for the studied lake type were preliminarily determined. Biotechnol. & Biotechnol. Eq. 2013, 27(1), 3522-3528

AB  - The term "indicator" is frequently used at the interface between science and policy. Although there is a great demand for clear definitions of technical terms in science and policy, the meaning of indicator is still ambiguous. In this contribution, we analyze different meanings of the term in ecology and environmental planning, suggest a general definition, and make recommendations for its appropriate use. We determined that the ways in which indicator is defined differ greatly, and some definitions are mutually exclusive. We arrived at the conclusion that a broad definition of the term is feasible. We recommend distinguishing between indicators as ecological components, i.e., ecological units, structures, or processes and as measures, i.e., properties of a phenomenon, body, or substance to which a magnitude can be assigned, and between descriptive and normative indicators. This clarification prevents the term "indicator" from becoming a meaningless buzzword, improves communication among stakeholders, and assures the testability of theories that include indicators. To avoid problems based on different understandings of the term and to maintain integrity in its use, we advise always providing a definition of the indicator term.

AB  - Understanding what constitutes a reference (background) nutrient condition for lakes is important for National Park Service managers responsible for preserving and protecting aquatic resources. For this study we characterize water quality conditions in 29 lakes across four national parks, and compare their nutrient status to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) nutrient reference criteria and alternative criteria recently proposed by others. Where appropriate we also compare the nutrient status of these 29 lakes to state or tribal nutrient reference criteria or standards. For lakes that exceed reference criteria we investigate physical and chemical patterns, and for a subset of lakes compare modern nutrient conditions to paleolimnological (i.e., diatom-inferred [DI]) nutrient reconstructions. Many lakes exceeded USEPA nutrient reference criteria, but met alternative less restrictive criteria. Modern nutrient conditions were also largely consistent with DI historic (pre-1900) nutrient conditions. Lakes exceeding alternative nutrient criteria and with elevated nutrient levels relative to DI historic conditions were mostly small, shallow, and dystrophic; continued attention to their nutrient dynamics and biological response is warranted. Coupling modern and paleolimnological data offer an innovative and scientifically defensible approach to understand long-term nutrient trends and provide greater context for comparison with reference conditions.

AB  - Because of the economic and environmental importance of stabilizing fragile sand dune habitats, restoration of dunes has become a common practice. Restoration efforts in the Great Lakes and East Coast regions of North America often consist of planting monocultures of the dominant native grass species, Ammophila breviligulata. We evaluated 18 dune restoration projects in the Great Lakes region conducted over the past 25 years. We characterized attributes of diversity (plants and insects), vegetation structure (plant biomass and cover), and ecological processes (soil nutrients and mycorrhizal fungi abundance) in each restoration, and we compared these measures to geographically paired natural dune communities. Restoration sites were similar to reference sites in most measured variables. Differences between restorations and reference sites were mostly explained by differences in ages, with the younger sites supporting slightly lower plant diversity and mycorrhizal spore abundance than older sites. Plant community composition varied little between restored and reference sites, with only one native forb species, Artemisia campestris, occurring significantly more often in reference sites than restored sites. Although it remains unclear whether more diverse restoration plantings could accelerate convergence on the ecological conditions of reference dunes, in general, traditional restoration efforts involving monoculture plantings of A. breviligulata in Great Lakes sand dunes appear to achieve ecological conditions found in reference dunes.

AB  - Aboriginal land managers have observed that feral Asian water buffalo (Bubalis bubalis Lydekker) are threatening the ecological and cultural integrity of perennial freshwater sources in Arnhem Land, Australia. Here we present collaborative research between the Aboriginal Rangers from Warddeken Land Management Limited and Western scientists which quantified the ground-level impacts of buffalo on seven perennial freshwater springs of the Arnhem Plateau. A secondary aim was to build the capacity of Aboriginal Rangers to self-monitor and evaluate the ecological outcomes of their land management activities. Sites with high buffalo abundance had significantly different ground, ground cover, and water quality attributes compared to sites with low buffalo abundance. The low buffalo abundance sites were characterized by tall herbaceous vegetation and flat ground, whereas wallows, bare ground, and short ungrazed grasses were indicators of sites with high buffalo abundance. Water turbidity was greater when buffalo abundance was high. The newly acquired monitoring skills and derived indicators of buffalo damage will be used by Aboriginal Rangers to assess the ecological outcomes of their future buffalo control efforts on the Arnhem Plateau.

AB  - Water projects in the Yangtze River basin, especially the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), have strongly affected the biological and ecological integrity of the Yangtze estuary and adjacent coastal ecosystems. The Ecopath with Ecosim model was applied to study trophic structure and energy flow after the impoundment of TGR based on field surveys in 2006. The model results showed that the trophic levels ranged from 1.000 to 4.058; and 44% of the energy flows originated from the detritus food chain, while 56% originated from the grazing food chain in the trophic transfer process; the transfer efficiency of the ecosystem was 10.0%, and TPP/TR (Total Primary Production/Fotal Respiration) was 1.899. Compared with model results in 2000 (before impoundment of TGR), the trophic structure of the ecosystem did not exhibit substantial changes; however, the mean trophic level and catch amount decreased remarkably after impoundment. The estuary and adjacent coastal ecosystems were found to be more sensitive to external perturbations after impoundment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neotropical forests are extremely diverse ecosystems, listed within the biological hotspots of our planet. However, species from these forests are threatened by diverse anthropogenic activities. Small dung beetles (Scarabaeidae, Aphodiinae) assemblages were studied within different habitats of the Brazilian Amazon. The monitored habitats encompassed the main gradients of disturbance, from pristine to highly anthropogenic situations, with the aim of supporting their use as indicators of neotropical forests' ecological status. Additionally, seasonal patterns and bait attractiveness were evaluated in the scope of more effective monitoring studies. Our main results demonstrate that the diversity and distribution of small dung beetles along disturbance gradients, represented by the monitored locations, is associated with particular habitats within the forest landscape. Although spatially and temporally restricted, the results of this study highlight the potential of using small dung beetles, due to their sensitivity and habitat specificity, as ecological indicators for assessing the extent of disturbance in neotropical forest landscapes. We also suggest specific techniques and periods to be used in order to increase captures of small dung beetles within the different habitats.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are susceptible to loss in both health and extent via stressors associated with global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Peat collapse may represent an additional phenomenon contributing to coastal wetland loss in organic-rich soils through rapid vertical elevation decline. However, the term "peat collapse" has been inconsistently used in the literature, leading to ambiguities regarding the mechanisms, timing, and spatial extent of its contribution to coastal wetland loss. For example, it is unclear whether peat collapse is distinct from general subsidence, or what biogeochemical changes or sequence of events may constitute peat collapse. A critical analysis of peer-reviewed literature related to peat collapse was supplemented with fundamental principles of soil physics and biogeochemistry to develop a conceptual framework for coastal wetland peat collapse. We propose that coastal wetland peat collapse is a specific type of shallow subsidence unique to highly organic soils in which a loss of soil strength and structural integrity contributes to a decline in elevation, over the course of a few months to a few years, below the lower limit for emergent plant growth and natural recovery. We further posit that coastal wetland peat collapse is driven by severe stress or death of the vegetation, which compromises the supportive structure roots provide to low-density organic soils and shifts the carbon balance of the ecosystem toward a net source, as mineralization is no longer offset by sequestration. Under these conditions, four mechanisms may contribute to peat collapse: (1) compression of gas-filled pore spaces within the soil during dry-down conditions; (2) deconsolidation of excessively waterlogged peat, followed by transport; (3) compaction of aerenchyma tissue in wetland plant roots, and possibly collapse of root channels; and (4) acceleration of soil mineralization due to the addition of labile carbon (dying roots), oxygen (decreased flooding), nutrients (eutrophication), or sulfate (saltwater intrusion). Scientists and land managers should focus efforts on monitoring vegetation health across the coastal landscape as an indicator for peat collapse vulnerability and move toward codifying the term "peat collapse" in the scientific literature. Once clarified, the contribution of peat collapse to coastal wetland loss can be evaluated.

AB  - Salinas systems are artificial wetlands which are interesting from the viewpoint of nature conservation. They play an important role both as habitats for migratory waterbird species and as nodes of biotic connectivity networks. In the Mediterranean basin, where the coastal salinas are highly significant as alternative and complementary habitats for waterbirds, a process of abandonment occurs, and many seminatural systems of this kind are disappearing. This abandonment is having serious consequences for migratory bird populations and for the ecological role these play. In the present paper, this group of waterbird species has been used to evaluate these wetlands for conservation purposes. We have developed a methodological approach for the selection of ecological indicators for the conservation and management of these Mediterranean habitats and waterbird assemblages, the main consumers therein. The stepwise procedure developed constitutes a practical tool for this task. Application thereof enabled us to differentiate the habitats available for the waterbirds and to identify the biotic and abiotic indicators for the maintenance and management of the salina ecosystems. These variables can then be incorporated into monitoring programs.

AB  - The development of a broader, more holistic approach to aquatic ecosystem management has been called for in recent years. Physical and chemical objectives alone are no longer considered sufficient for the protection of aquatic ecosystems and should be supplemented with biological objectives. The ubiquitous and sedentary nature of macroinvertebrates, combined with their measurable response to environmental conditions, favour their use as important indicators in environmental policies. To establish biological objectives, there is a need for a regional framework to limit the variability between ecosystems. Past studies have demonstrated that an a posteriori regionalisation approach may be more useful than an a priori approach in explaining single component (e.g. macroinvertebrates) patterns across ecosystems. This is particularly important as aquatic resource management agencies often focus on one or two components of the ecosystem to assess environmental health. This study uses an a posteriori method to delineate and describe biological regions based on edge and riffle macroinvertebrate data. The regionalisation will provide a framework for setting biological objectives, based on the range of reference conditions measured within each separate region. The objectives will include regional checklists for taxa and biotic indices. Predictive modelling in the style of RIVPACS or AUSRIVAS will also be used within each region to develop objectives, incorporating local, regional and systematic features as predictor variables.

AB  - Assessing the ecological impacts of environmental change on biological communities requires knowledge of the factors driving the spatial patterns of the three diversity facets along extensive environmental gradients. We quantified the taxonomic (TD), functional (FD), and phylogenetic diversity (PD) of lichen epiphytic communities in 23 beech forests along Europe to examine their response to environmental variation (climate, habitat quality, spatial predictors) at a continental geographic scale. We selected six traits related to the climatic conditions in forest ecosystems, the water-use strategy and the nutrient uptake, and we built a phylogenetic tree based on four molecular markers. FD and climate determined TD and PD, with spatial variables also affecting PD. The three diversity facets were primarily shaped by distinct critical predictors, with the temperature diurnal range affecting FD and PD, and precipitation of the wettest month determining TD. Our results emphasize the value of FD for explaining part of TD and PD variation in lichen communities at a broad geographic scale, while highlighting that these diversity facets provide complementary information about the communities' response under changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, traits such as growth form, photobiont type, and reproductive strategy mediated the response of lichen communities to abiotic factors emerging as useful indicators of macroclimatic variations.

AB  - The Queensland Environmental Protection Agency monitored water quality at 133 sites in North Queensland waterways between Cooktown and Bundaburg from 1992 to 2001. Condition of the waterways was rated by comparing recent data with the Queensland Water Quality Guidelines. Long-term trends were analysed using a censored regression technique that incorporates the effects of flow, temperature, seasonality and allows for long-term non-linear trends. Many sites were in good condition; those in poor condition were usually impacted by point source discharges; those in moderate condition were usually impacted by agricultural land use. There were no consistent long-term trends across the whole region. Recommendations for future programs include incorporating pressure indicators, ensuring high standards of quality assurance, including covariates such as rainfall in trend assessment and continuing programs over more than 10 years to allow detection of trends due to changes in land-use.

AB  - Africa is home to some of the most vulnerable natural ecosystems and species on the planet. Around 7000 protected areas seek to safeguard the continent's rich biodiversity, but many of them face increasing management challenges. Human disturbances permeating into the parks directly and indirectly affect the ecological functioning and integrity of protected areas. With the envisaged expansion of the protected area network and further expected population and economic growth in the region, the competition between nature conservation and resources demands is likely to increase. The regular monitoring of land cover in and around protected areas can support the early detection of conservation conflicts. In this paper, we evaluate the use of the annual time series of MODIS Land Cover (LC) type product between 2003 and 2009 to monitor land cover changes at continental scale. We use the mean classification confidence and change frequency as indicators to assess the temporal consistency of the MODIS LC classifier for accurately monitoring land cover changes. We discuss the perspectives and issues for an automated monitoring of land cover changes in African protected areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With concerns about the maintenance of both aquatic communities and flow conditions, a number of hydrologic indicators have been developed. These indicators are generally based on the development of hydrologic statistics for flows that are important to the maintenance of aquatic ecosystems. Although the hydrologic basis for indicators is well defined by common techniques in stochastic hydrology, the basis for ecological integration is still being developed. A critical evaluation of hydrologic indicators intended to protect aquatic ecosystems finds that proposed indicators are based more on standard hydrologic statistics and measures of hydrologic alteration than the habitat needs and ecological requirements of local or desired aquatic communities. We argue that hydrologic indicators are not ecohydrological indicators unless direct connections between flow events and aquatic community habitat and ecological needs are the basis of the indicator development and selection. In this article, we identify ecohydrological indicators that are based on habitat and ecological needs of fish communities. The indicator identification process is initiated with the analysis of community needs using an autecology matrix. Hydrologic statistics are then selected that are appropriate to the target fish community. The resulting ecohydrological indicators provide a direct connection to fish community flow requirements and the physical habitat conditions and associated ecology and life history needs of fish species.

AB  - Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to investigate the relationships between annual recruitment of natural coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) from Oregon coastal rivers and indices of the physical ocean environment. Nine indices were examined, ranging from large-scale ocean indicators, e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), to indicators of the local ecosystem (e.g., coastal water temperature near Charleston, OR). Generalized additive models with two and three predictor variables were evaluated using a set of performance metrics aimed at quantifying model skill in short-term (approximately 1 yr) forecasting. High explanatory power and promising forecast skill resulted when the spring/summer PDO averaged over the 4 yr prior to the return year was used to explain a low-frequency (multi-year) pattern in recruitment and one or two additional variables accounted for year-to-year deviations from the low-frequency pattern. More variance was explained when averaging the predictions from a set of models (i.e., taking the ensemble mean) than by any single model. Making multiple forecasts from a set of models also provided a range of possible outcomes that reflected, to some degree, the uncertainty in our understanding of how salmon productivity is driven by physical ocean conditions.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressure on marine ecosystems is affecting water quality and seafloor integrity. Mediterranean seagrass meadows of endemic Posidonia oceanica (Linnaeus) Delile are considered a priority habitat under the European Directive 92/43/ CEE, given their ecological and economic importance and being an environmental quality indicator. Availability of historical data on three P. oceanica meadows along the Ligurian coast (NW Mediterranean Sea) allowed assessing change in the meadow status over time. A number of indicators and ecological indices at different levels of ecological complexity, including the multimetric PREI (Posidonia Rapid Easy Index) adopted by the environmental agencies, were employed and compared. This paper aims at a) defining the health status of the P. oceanica meadows and measuring their changes through time collating available historical information; b) evaluating the discriminating power of the different indices and assessing their consistency with each other. The different indices adopted revealed little consistency thus suggesting that no single index can define the health status of P. oceanica meadows; as a consequence the use of an indices set is highly recommended to monitor meadow evolution over time.

AB  - (edaphic filters drive Myrtaceae assemblages)Aims This study investigated whether soil chemistry act as abiotic drivers of Myrtaceae assemblages, and also investigated the occurrence of indicator species. Methods We first characterize the edaphic conditions of forest fragments occupied by Myrtaceae assemblages in Subtropical Araucaria Forest. Then, we investigated the association between soil chemistry and the structure of the assemblages. Finally, we verified which Myrtaceae species are chemical-edaphic bioindicators. Results We measured 2357 individuals belonging to 26 species from the Myrtaceae family. The Myrtaceae assemblages were predominantly composed by populations with aggregate spatial distribution pattern. This spatial behavior reflects their edaphic requirements because the soil conditions are heterogeneous even on a small scale, forming chemical-edaphic niche patches. Ecological dominance occurred in habitats characterized by restrictive environmental factors such as soils with high acidity and high availability of exchangeable aluminum.Acca sellowianaandCampomanesia xanthocarpaare indicator species of fertile soils, whileMyrceugenia regnellianais acid and low fertility soils indicative. Conclusions In this study we show that soil acidity is an effective driver of Myrtaceae assemblages in Subtropical Araucaria Forest and the use of Myrtaceae indicators can enable policymakers and environmental inspectors to more easily enact conservation in Brazilian ecosystems.

AB  - Few studies to date have demonstrated widespread biological impacts of ocean acidification (OA) under conditions currently found in the natural environment. From a combined survey of physical and chemical water properties and biological sampling along the Washington-Oregon-California coast in August 2011, we show that large portions of the shelf waters are corrosive to pteropods in the natural environment. We show a strong positive correlation between the proportion of pteropod individuals with severe shell dissolution damage and the percentage of undersaturated water in the top 100 m with respect to aragonite. We found 53% of onshore individuals and 24% of offshore individuals on average to have severe dissolution damage. Relative to pre-industrial CO2 concentrations, the extent of undersaturated waters in the top 100 m of the water column has increased over sixfold along the California Current Ecosystem (CCE). We estimate that the incidence of severe pteropod shell dissolution owing to anthropogenic OA has doubled in near shore habitats since pre-industrial conditions across this region and is on track to triple by 2050. These results demonstrate that habitat suitability for pteropods in the coastal CCE is declining. The observed impacts represent a baseline for future observations towards understanding broader scale OA effects.

AB  - This paper deals largely with the dynamics and changes in the helminth parasite communities of fish along the trophic gradient of lakes. The use of parasitological community data as a bioindicator of environmental health underlines the need to study parasite communities at comparable localities with known pollution levels. The comparison of the conditions in different habitats might be helpful to differentiate between normal fluctuations in ambient conditions and pollution-mediated effects. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the community structure of parasites in snow trout (Schizothorax niger Heckel) inhabiting 3 lakes of contrasting trophic status in Kashmir. The idea of selecting the lakes, namely Anchar (strongly hypereutrophic), Dal (eutrophic) and Manasbal (mesotrophic) for this study was intentional as they depict different trophic gradients and exhibit the desirable pattern which was a prerequisite for this study. The findings presented in this article suggest an apparent lake-wise gradient in community structure, as the increase in trematode and cestode infections in Anchar was markedly greater, to levels clearly distinguishable from those in the other two water bodies. We conclude that human-induced eutrophication of lakes modifies the parasite community at component level and community-level studies on parasites may provide information on health status of lakes.

Starting from assays in controlled conditions, in recent years this approach has also found successful applications multi-stressed natural systems. It is also able to exploit the huge amount of data provided by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques. Similarly, the focus has shifted from effects on the overall genetic variability, the so-called "genetic erosion", to selective effects induced by contaminants at more specific pathways. In the aquatic context, effects are usually assessed on non-model species, preferably native fish or macroinvertebrates. Here we provide a review of current trends in this specific discipline, with a focus on population genetics and genomics approaches. In addition, we demonstrate the potential usefulness of predictive simulation and Bayesian techniques. A focused collection of field and laboratory studies is discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, covering a range of molecular markers, different endpoints of genetic variation, and different classes of chemical contaminants. Moreover, guidelines for a future implementation of evolutionary perspective into Ecological Risk Assessment are provided.

AB  - In present article the synphytoindication of environmental conditions formed in the areas of power substations and set the direction of environmental transformations caused by soil contamination substations technological oil have been performed. Studies have been conducted in the autumn of 2016. Releves have been made on 19 power substations. Geobotanical description have been within each sub-station separately for control site, which has not experienced the negative impact of oil spills and technological area with obvious traces of the spill process oil. Moreover, the substations within the description made in additional areas. The total number of releves is 51, of which 22 are in control conditions and 29 are in process oil contaminated sites. In terms hygromorphes investigated edaphotopes can be attributed to those that are favorable for plant environmental group sub-mesophytes. The variability of damping forms the regime that are favorable to the ecological group of hemi-hydrocontrastophiles. The soil acidity forms favorable regime for sub-acidophiles. Th total salt regime may be stated as being favorable for mesotrophes. The regime of the carbonate content in soil may be attributed to those that are favorable for acarbonatophiles. The nitrogen content in soil are favorable for hemi-nitrophiles. The soil aeration is favorable for sub-aerophiles. The thermal climate of ecotypes can be considered as immoral. In the study area the radiation balance of 2045.3 MJ.m(2).hr(-1). The humidity can be evaluated as such, which is favorable sub-aridophytes. The difference between the amount of precipitation and evaporation according to phytoindication is -299.1 mm. The continentality of climate can be estimated as hemi-continental. The phytoindication evaluation reveals that the temperature of the coldest month is -4,8 degrees C. The light mode is heliophyte friendly. The synphytoindication method has been shown to be a quite informative for environmental regimes detection due to anthropogenic transformation of ecotops. Ability to use tools phytoindication designed for natural ecosystems, for the purposes of the environmental assessment of anthropogenically transformed areas, caused by non-specific nature of the response of communities living organisms on pollution. Against the background of the natural gradient, which is subject to environmental conditions in the relevant part of the steppe zone, where power substations are studied, and their vegetation cover reflects some of the specific features inherent in this is man-made formations. First of all, it thermal climate whose valuation is impossible to explain the relevant gradients. This feature of the thermal climate accompanied by increased light mode and an increased level of human-induced soil aeration. We obtained evidence that pollution leads to unification of ecological structure of the plant community. Under the influence of pollution there is a transition to a final state, which is to some extent independent of the initial ecological diversity of communities. Unification of ecological structure of vegetation under the influence of soil contamination with oil technology is a testament to the unification of the environmental conditions.

AB  - Evaluation of environmental vulnerability over large areas is a difficult and complex process because it is affected by many variables. Few research on environmental vulnerability assessment is conducted in mainland China comprehensively. In this study, indicators were selected mainly from the function of ecosystem factors and the natural environmental factors associated with the life of the residents. After collinearity diagnostics, 12 indicators remained, covering landform, meteorology, vegetation and irrigation conditions. Entropy method was used to determine the weights for indicators. Results indicate that the vulnerability degree in western China is significant higher than that of eastern China. The spatial distributions of vulnerability gradation are analyzed at national, regional and provincial scales, respectively. On the whole, areas of light vulnerability are main in the northeastern region. Potential, light and medium vulnerability occupy the largest area in the eastern and central region. Percentages of medium, heavy and very heavy vulnerability are the maximum in the western region. The change trend of vulnerability gradation showed that eco-environment has got more vulnerable since 2000. The evaluation results would provide references for the environmental protection and the formulation of related policies.

AB  - To facilitate extrapolation among watersheds, ecological risk assessments should be based on a model of underlying Factors influencing watershed response, particularly vulnerability. We propose a conceptual model of landscape vulnerability to serve as a basis for watershed classification systems to predict resistance and resilience of aquatic ecosystems to hydrology-related stressors. Watershed area, storage capacity, channel slope, and soil permeability determine sensitivity of lotic systems to stressors associated with land-use activities that impact hydrologic regimes. Natural hydrologic disturbance regimes also influence the resilience of aquatic systems by selecting for life history strategies associated with rapid recolonization following disturbance. Variability in some of these physiographic driving factors can be partitioned by landscape classification schemes such as the U.S. Forest Service Ecological Unit Classification System, while others (watershed storage) may explain remaining variability within landscape units. We are conducting a comparative watershed study to examine simple and interactive effects of physiographic units, watershed storage (lakes + wetlands), and land-clearing activities in watersheds surrounding the western arm of Lake Superior. Initial results for second-order watersheds indicate significant watershed class effects on baseflow water quality, percent motile biraphid diatom species in periphyton communities, habitat quality, and fish community integrity. Future studies have been designed to examine cumulative effects downstream.

AB  - Evaluating wetland vegetation responses to flow regimes is challenging because of the inherently complex, variable and dynamic nature of wetland vegetation in space and time. We propose four principles to guide the development of management objectives and evaluation approaches to support adaptive management of wetland vegetation in flow-managed systems. First, we assert a need for more explicit, direct and defensible alignment of management objectives, targets and indicators to reflect broader ecological, sociocultural and economic values, and the underlying ecosystem functions that support them. Second, we propose a framework for indicator selection across multiple spatiotemporal scales and levels of ecological organisation, from individuals to landscape mosaics (vegscapes). Third, we emphasise the need to evaluate vegetation condition and responses to environmental flows in relation to a more nuanced understanding of temporal flow dynamics. Finally, we discuss the importance of considering the effects of non-flow variables that can modify vegetation responses to environmental flows. We highlight key knowledge needs required to support the implementation of these principles, particularly the urgency of improving our understanding of ecological, sociocultural and economic values of wetland vegetation and the attributes and functions that support these values.

AB  - The present study focuses on the importance and need to identify criteria and indicators (C&I) for sustainable landscaping using native plants in Qatar. The conditions for operationalizing the criteria and indicators approach are being incorporated into sustainable development practices and management planning in Qatar. This paper aims to develop criteria and related indicators for strengthening the global sustainability assessment system (GSAS) in order to provide a holistic approach for sustainable environmental assessment and the enhancement of ecosystem services. A total of 50 potentially native plant species were prioritized and categorized based on the following different parameters: weather conditions tolerated (temperature, humidity, and rainfall), multiple use value (ecological, economical, and medicinal), standard crown size (<= 50 cm and >= 50 cm) and water requirement (moist, moderate, and dry). Diverse local stakeholders as well as international experts were consulted to rank the plant species, and concluded that these prioritized native species are fit for sustainable landscaping as opposed to the exotic plant species which are imported from different geo-climatic zones. Environmental, social, economic, human, and policy sustainability aspects were considered, along with 12 criteria and 49 related indicators which were identified by promoting the use of potential native plants for sustainable landscaping in Qatar.

AB  - The Lake Habitat Survey (LHS) method was developed to assess the ecological integrity of the physical habitat around lake and reservoir ecosystems, as well as to determine the magnitude of human pressure on lake systems. The LHS method has not previously been applied to tropical lakes but could potentially be a useful tool. The LHS approach was applied on a tropical African reservoir, Malilangwe reservoir, in 2011. The application of this methodology included the calculation of summary metrics Lake Habitat Metric Survey (LHMS) and Lake Habitat Quality Assessment (LHQA). Results show that although Malilangwe reservoir is experiencing increasing human pressure, it does not appear to suffer from a major invasion of alien plants. Its LHQA score, 76 out of 112, and LHMS score, 16 out of 42, are indicative of relatively few human pressures such as water pumping structures and residential areas. We conclude that the use of LHS can directly enhance the quality and reliability of hydromorphological assessments and can lead to better lake conservation and rehabilitation. It is clear that, for conservation management, a holistic assessment of naturalness, representativeness and species rarity needs to be made in conjunction with scoring systems.

AB  - Biotic indices based on community composition and calculated from sensitivity scores assigned to individual taxa are commonly used as indicators for ecological integrity of fluvial ecosystems. Macroinvertebrate indices can assess water quality but invertebrate community composition also responds to other environmental factors including stream bed disturbance. This study presents a biotic community index that assesses stream bed stability in stony riffles. This Macroinvertebrate Index of Bed Stability is calibrated on transport and entrainment of in situ-marked tracer stones in 46 streams in New Zealand's North Island, representing a wide range of substrate stability. Scores were investigated for 67 common invertebrate taxa using Indicator Species Analysis based on taxa abundance at varying levels of substrate stability. The resulting site score, weighted by taxa abundance, improved a predictive model of bed stability, generated with model trees, when added to the pool of habitat variables and explained 69% of the variation in bed stability. Site scores were strongly correlated with measured bed stability at the development sites, but not at eight independent validation sites, suggesting the need for further testing on a larger dataset including streams in other regions of New Zealand, and overseas.

AB  - Karst ecosystems are considered as priority environments for the protection of biodiversity on a global scale. This study provides a first comparative analysis of epilithic diatom flora from karst springs in two Mediterranean geographic areas (Spain and Italy) with contrasting characteristics (islands vs mainland). We investigated twenty-three springs with different anthropogenic impact levels once in the winter season between 2007 and 2017 (N = 23). A total of 176 diatom taxa (56 genera) were found of which 101 (44 genera) were observed in single sites. A general good biotic integrity was revealed by structural indices (species richness, diversity and evenness). However, crenophilous species were generally present and abundant in less impacted springs. Comparing islands and mainland, significant differences were found in species composition and diversity (H') based on multivariate analyses (global R = 0.610; p = 0.001) and t-test (t = 2.304; p = 0.031). Discharge and Cl- were the most significant variables in determining diatom assemblages. Our results confirm the role of springs as multiple ecotones and refuges for rare species and suggest that the geographic insularity may be an important factor in maintaining diatom biodiversity.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is (a) to describe the distribution pattern of tiger beetles in Shorea robusta dominated forest ecosystems at landscape level of north western Shivalik Himalaya in environmental space and (b) to evaluate the nature of microhabitat association amongst recorded species of tiger beetles. Twenty-five species of tiger beetles belonging to ten genera were recorded from six protected areas in the tropical dry deciduous Shivalik region with an altitudinal gradient of 350-1,400 m above mean sea level in north western India. Sampling for tiger beetles was carried out using strategically designed sample plot in ten distinct habitat types with five collection methods employed. Species composition of tiger beetles varied significantly between microhabitat types of the protected areas (Shannon H' = 0.436-1.069) and habitat specialists were found in only few of habitats. Bray-Curtis cluster analysis clustered the ten habitats into five cluster groups based upon the species composition with Shorea robusta most distinct from agricultural habitats. Riverine area was found to be the most diverse (with 18 or 72% of total species) as well as abundant (457 +/- A 33.61 SE individuals recorded per sample plot). Khair, Syzygium and pine forests were least rich and had only three species each. Two species J. crassipalpis and M. melancholica were found only in riverine habitat. Though late summer to mid-monsoon was found most favorable for tiger beetles, only one species, C. chloris was persistently found even during modest winter months. Bulla's diversity index showed that habitat breadth of species ranged from 0.00 to 6.66, an indicative of their habitat restrictiveness. Indicator species analysis revealed as many as 14 species indicative of particular habitat conditions. Descriptions of some important ecological and behavioral aspects are included for these species. The observed C-score (299.43330) showed that there is less co-occurrence among species pairs alongwith lower niche overlap (Pianka's index = 0.14191) thereby illustrating ample resource partitioning at microhabitat level. Further, co-occurrence index among guilds (C-score = 213.16250 with variance 1,949.76300) was found to be smaller than expected, revealing that feeding guilds are differing significantly from one another in their levels of co-occurrence. Canonical correspondence analysis identified canopy cover, litter and average tree density as the most important habitat variable defining the distribution of tiger beetles in environmental space. Such assemblage patterns among species of tiger beetle would thus provide a solid basis to interpret changes in microclimatic conditions, caused by humans directly or through long term climate change and would thus help establishing a baseline in long term monitoring of these forest ecosystems.

AB  - We explored the spatial and temporal variations in the ecological characteristics of the macroinvertebrate community in relation to the environmental factors from the Vishav stream basin of Kashmir Himalaya from March 2013 to February 2015. We collected water quality and biological data from five locations within the stream basin. Integrated water quality and biological approach indicated the clean water conditions with pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrates at an upstream site located well within the forest area. In response to changing water quality with increasing agricultural and other anthropogenic activities, there was an increase in the number of macroinvertebrate taxa at middle and downstream sites, mostly moderately and highly pollution tolerant taxa. Harsh in-stream environmental conditions (high discharge and stream water velocity) at the upstream site resulted in lower values of alpha diversity metrics. Despite statistically significant spatial variations, macroinvertebrates remained stable across seasons due to low taxa replacement and harshness of climatic factors. Multivariate dispersion homogeneity and composition analysis showed that the macroinvertebrate composition varied similarly among sites, with different compositions. Distance-based redundancy analysis indicated that water temperature, discharge, dissolved oxygen, pH and total phosphorus are major environmental factors determining the benthic macroinvertebrate diversity (alpha diversity) and composition (beta diversity) throughout the study area.

AB  - Urbanization impacts stream ecosystems globally through degraded water quality, altered hydrology, and landscape disturbances at the catchment and riparian scales, causing biodiversity losses and altered system functioning. Addressing the "urban stream syndrome" requires multiple mitigation tools, and rehabilitation of riparian vegetation may help improve stream ecological status and provide key ecosystem services. However, the extent to which forested riparian buffers can help support stream biodiversity in the face of numerous environmental contingencies remains uncertain. We assessed how a key indicator of stream ecological status, benthic diatoms, respond to riparian habitat conditions using 10 urban site pairs (each comprising of one unbuffered and one buffered reach), and additional urban downstream and forest reference upstream sites in the Oslo Fjord basin. Diatom communities were structured by multiple drivers including spatial location, land use, water quality, and instream habitat. Among these, riparian habitat condition independently explained 16% of variation in community composition among site pairs. Changes in community structure and indicator taxa, along with a reduction in pollution-tolerant diatoms, suggested tangible benefits of forested riparian buffers for stream biodiversity in urban environments. Managing urban impacts requires multiple solutions, with forested riparian zones providing a potential tool to help improve biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - Legal and policy initiatives to address the environmental dimensions of armed conflicts and their impact on people, ecosystems and sustainable development are highly dependent on the availability of environmental data from conflict-affected areas. Socio-political and security conditions in these areas often impede data collection, while traditional models of post-conflict environmental assessments are limited in scope. In response, an increasing range of actors is utilising remote sensing and open source data collection to identify and estimate health and ecological risks during and after conflicts. This paper considers the role of participatory citizen science methodologies in complementing both remote monitoring and post-conflict assessments. It examines existing models and mechanisms for environmental data collection and utilisation in conflict contexts, and the extent to which the core values and principles of citizen science are transferable. We find that 'civilian science' is feasible and could be well-suited to conflict conditions. In addition to addressing gaps in data collection, it may also empower communities affected by environmental degradation, enhance their environmental human rights, supplement the often limited monitoring capacity of governmental agencies and facilitate cooperation and peacebuilding. The paper concludes by proposing methodological approaches for three common forms of environmental degradation associated with armed conflicts.

AB  - From November 2000 to September 2001, eight points in the Ibera lagoon were sampled bimonthly. At each point, pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured and invertebrates were collected from the water around macrophytes by mean of a net of 180 mu m pore size. Four biotic indices were calculated and compared, given similar trends. The total number of taxa shows to be a good and simple indicator of water quality. Averaging indices across points we obtained a good positive correlation between indices and temperature. In this ecosystem, multi-habitat sampling must be used in order to obtain a good estimation of ecological integrity. The total number of taxa can be used for water quality assessment.

AB  - Awareness of sustainable management of water and its biological resources is rising in West Africa, but application of effective tools for biomonitoring and detecting habitats at risk in aquatic ecosystems is limited. In this study, we provide key environmental descriptors to characterize reference sites by applying the following "a priori criteria" (physical and chemical, hydro-morphological, and land use parameters) by exploring their potential to determine suitable reference sites. Using data collected from 44 sites, we identified 37 criteria that reliably identify reference conditions in semi-arid rivers by reflecting the impacts of multiple pressures ranging from low to very high intensity of human uses and impairments. We integrated all these impacts in an overall pressures index, which showed that protected areas can reasonably be considered as credible reference sites as far as they show low overall impact levels from cumulative pressures. We recommend that development of bio-indicator standards should be based on the collection and integration of all the available information, especially quantitative, spatially-explicit data, from benthic macroinvertebrates and fish. Rigorous standardization of bio-indicator protocols will make them more easily applicable for management and conservation of aquatic ecosystem resources in semi-arid zones of Africa.

AB  - Improving rice (Oryza spp.) competitiveness against weeds would provide a low-cost and safe tool for an integrated weed management strategy. This paper addresses the underlying causes of tradeoff between yield without weed competition and weed competitiveness. Rice yield or weed biomass under weedy conditions are used as indicators of weed competitiveness. For this analysis, a common database was compiled from the results of 45 concurrent field trials comparing the performance of four to 64 genotypes in weed-free and weedy conditions in Asia, West Africa, North America and Latin America. Cyperus spp., Echinochloa spp. and Eleusine indica were the most frequent dominant weed species, being found in 9, 20 and 7 trials, respectively. Mean relative yield reduction [(yield under weed-free conditions yield under weedy conditions)/yield under weed-free conditions] across genotypes tested for each trial was defined as weed pressure level. Mean yield without weed competition across genotypes ranged from 1.8 to 11.6 t ha(-1) with mean relative yield reduction from almost 0 to 91%. Correlations for rice yield between weed-free and weedy conditions were generally positive, and significant in 27 trials. The correlations were related to weed pressure level and dominant weed species, but not to ecosystem (upland or lowland) or yield level under weed-free conditions. Relative yield reduction had a more pronounced effect than dominant weed species. Correlation decreased as weed pressure level increased, and became negative when relative yield reduction exceeded 80%. suggesting that different morpho-physiological mechanisms are responsible for high yields under weed-free conditions or severe weed competition. Correlations between rice yield under weed-free conditions and weed biomass varied, giving 17 and 19 for positive and negative ones, respectively. These correlations were related neither to weed pressure level, ecosystem and yield level under weed-free conditions, nor to dominant weed species. These results indicate that correlations between rice yields under weed-free and weedy conditions can be strongly affected by weed pressure level, and, unless severe weed competition occurs, there appears to be no tradeoff between them. Association of morpho-physiological mechanisms with weed competitiveness under conditions differing in weed pressure levels and dominant weed species deserves further investigation.

AB  - The spatial distribution of biological indicators of zooplankton in Shardara reservoir (southern Kazakhstan) was investigated in summer 2015. The development of macrophytes in the water area significantly affected the species diversity of zooplankton. Copepoda avoided places with high concentrations of polyphosphates from detergents, but gained a competitive advantage on water areas polluted by beta-HCCH. The most favorable conditions for Cladocera, represented mostly by Daphnia galeata, were formed on parts of the reservoir with high content of phosphates, nitrites, zinc and accumulation of green algae. Cladocera avoided waters with a high content of lead, copper and cadmium. Statistical maps of distribution of Delta-Shannon, Clarke's W-statistics and average individual mass did not reveal any certain relations with environmental variables, which we attribute to the complex nature of the Shardara reservoir's pollution. A strong relationship between the Delta-Shannon and Clarke's W-statistics parameters was found. It was found that Delta-Shannon is easily calculated and can be used for the zooplankton community structure description.

AB  - The ecological restoration of urban parks is used to increase their recreational attractiveness, improve air quality, mitigate urban heat island effects, improve stormwater infiltration, and provide other social and environmental benefits. The dynamics of plant communities after urban forest restoration requires investigation. The study assessed the impact of urban park reconstruction on the state of grass cover, phytoindication of changes in light regime caused by park reconstruction and found out the dependence of reliability of phytoindication assessment on the number of species in the relevant area. The study was conducted in the recreational area of the Botanical Garden of the Oles Honchar Dnipro National University (Ukraine). A tree plantation was created after the Second World War in the location of a natural oak forest. In 2019, a 2.8 ha area of the park was reconstructed. The samples were taken within polygons, two of which were placed in the reconstruction area and two of which were placed in a similar section of the park where no reconstruction was performed. During the reconstruction process, walkways were rebuilt, shrubs were removed, old, damaged trees were removed, and tree crowns were trimmed. Juvenile trees were planted in place of the removed old trees. Old outbuildings, which greatly impaired the aesthetic perception of the park, were also removed. Transport and construction machinery was involved in the reconstruction. A total of 65 plant species were found within the studied polygons. The number of herbaceous species in the park area after reconstruction was higher than without reconstruction. The crown closure in the reconstructed area was significantly lower than that in the untreated conditions. The phytoindication assessment showed that the light regime varies from the conditions suitable for the scyophytes (plants of typical foliage forests) to the conditions suitable for the sub-heliophytes (plants of light forests and shrubberies, or high herbaceous communities; lower layers are in the shade). The light regime in the park area after reconstruction was statistically significantly different from the regime in the untreated park area. The lighting regime after the reconstruction was favourable to sub-heliophytes, and without reconstruction the regime favoured hemi-scyophytes. Tree canopy crown closure negatively correlated with grass height and herbaceous layer projective cover. The tree canopy crown closure, grass height, and herbaceous layer projective cover were able to explain 86% of the phytoindication assessment of the lighting regime variation. These parameters negatively affected the light regime. The prospect of further research is to investigate the dependence of indicative reliability of the assessment of other environmental factors with the help of phytoindication depending on the number of species. In addition to the indication of traditional ecological factors it is of particular interest to clarify the aspect of the dynamics of hemeroby indicators as a result of park reconstruction.

AB  - The alteration of flow regimes is the most serious threat to the environment and populations of riverine ecosystems. The aim of this study was to verify how newly recovered assemblages of riverine birds react to recent and intensive water control transformations. Data on habitat transformations, breeding bird species and population abundance within submontane river channels in southern Poland were compared before and after river regulation. Regulation works affected approximately one-third of river sections in the drainages studied. Simultaneously, large amounts of gravel, clay and woody debris were removed from river channels, and river channels became overgrown by dense vegetation. Regulation works carried out in river channels, previously restored by severe flood, led to a strong decline in breeding bird assemblages (23% decrease of species richness and 33% decrease of population abundance). These results show that river regulation can significantly alter the structure of breeding bird assemblages, and such change is generally negative for bird diversity (especially for rare and vulnerable species). Riverine habitats are some of the most important biodiversity hotspots and major routes of migration for organisms in Europe, so the degradation of riverine ecosystems can have a catastrophic impact on nature in the entire European Union.

AB  - Caribbean coastal ecosystems are increasingly being threatened by natural and anthropogenic factors. The scale of these factors is at local, national, regional and global levels. Threats include the effects of fisheries and extraction, eutrophication, siltation, and pollution as well as global climate events such as El Nino and global climate change. Integrated coastal management (ICM) should clearly demonstrate the adverse effects of environmental impacts, thus justifying the need for mitigation and should evaluate the success of management efforts. ICM requires robust indicators that gauge the 'health' of the coast in relation to environmental, social and economic activities. Biological indicators (bioindicators) offer a signal of the biological condition in an ecosystem. Using bioindicators as an early warning of pollution or degradation in an ecosystem can help sustain critical resources. Biological indicators in the Caribbean are focused around particular ecosystems, especially coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove forests and include a range of biological parameters relating to particular species, groups of species and biological processes. The use of these indicators is critically reviewed and the presence or absence of a relevant, framework for their use in Caribbean ICM programs is discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The bioaccumulation and environmental persistence of atrazine (ATZ) poses a severe hazard to animal ecosystem. Quail has strong sensitivity to environmental pollutant, thus it is one of the most important ecological pollution indicator. However, true proof for the effects of ATZ exposure on the liver of quails is lacking. To evaluate the liver injury and the role of Nrf2-mediated defense responses during ATZ exposure, male quails were treated with ATZ (0, 50, 250 and 500 mg/kg) by oral gavage for 45 days. Histopathological and ultrastructural changes, oxidative stress indices, apoptosis-related factors and Nr12 pathway were detected. ATZ caused irreparable mitochondrial damage and destroyed morphophysiological integrity of the quail liver. Lower level ATZ (< 250 mg/kg) activated Nrf2 signaling pathway to protect liver against oxidative stress and apoptosis via enhancing antioxidative activity. Higher level ATZ (> 500 mg/kg) induced oxidative stress and apoptosis through decrease of non-enzymatic antioxidant, antioxidant enzymes and anti-apoptosis factors and increase of apoptosis factors expressions. Taken together, our results suggested that ATZ-induced hepatotoxicity in quails was associated with blocking Nrf2-mediated defense response.

AB  - Humid tropical forests on highly weathered soils are often characterized by low bioavailable phosphorus (P) concentrations. These ecosystems also often experience low and fluctuating redox conditions. Little is known about how soil redox conditions affect P availability and how this might feedback on biogeochemical cycling. Here we used soils from a wet tropical rainfall gradient in Puerto Rico to explore the effects of redox on P bioavailability and associated biogeochemical processes. Concentrations of soil carbon (C) and poorly crystalline iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) minerals increased at least twofold with increasing rainfall, reflecting stronger anaerobic conditions at wetter sites and associated declines in decomposition. The fraction of the total P pool in the NaOH-extractable organic form also generally increased with increasing rainfall. In a laboratory incubation experiment using three sites along the gradient, P amendment increased aerobic CO2 production. However, anaerobic processes, including anaerobic respiration, Fe reduction, and methanogenesis, increased with P amendment at the driest site only. Microbial biomass C:P ratios decreased with P amendment under anoxic conditions at the driest site, an indicator of possible microbial P limitation at this site. Both microbial biomass C and P concentrations were lower under anoxic conditions than under oxic conditions across all soils, suggesting that anoxic conditions could be a more limiting factor to microbes than P concentrations. Overall, our results demonstrate that redox conditions regulate the extent of P limitation to biogeochemical processes in tropical forest soils. Phosphorus limitation was pronounced in aerated environments with low mean annual rainfall, whereas low redox conditions or associated factors under high rainfall conditions may have a stronger impact on biogeochemical cycling than P availability.

AB  - Nanosized photonic explorers for bioanalysis with biologically localized embedding (PEBBLEs) have been created for the intracellular monitoring of small analytes (e.g. H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, O-2, K+, Na+, Cl-, OH and glucose). The probes are based on the inclusion of fluorescent analyte-sensitive indicator dyes and analyte-insensitive reference dyes in a polymer (polyacrylamide, polydecylmethacrylate) or sol-gel (silica, ormosil) nanoparticle. The probes are ratiometric, reversible and protected from interaction with the cellular environment, a quality which is of benefit to the integrity of both the cell and the sensor functionalities. Herein we describe two types of PEBBLE sensors, direct measurement sensors and ion correlation sensors, as well as the use of these PEBBLEs in intracellular sensing.

AB  - Environmental stressors associated with human land and water-use activities have degraded many riparian ecosystems across the western United States. These stressors include (i) the widespread expansion of invasive plant species that displace native vegetation and exacerbate streamflow and sediment regime alteration; (ii) agricultural and urban development in valley bottoms that decouple streams and rivers from their floodplains and reduce instream wood recruitment and retention; and (iii) flow modification that reduces water quantity and quality, degrading aquatic habitats. Here we apply a novel drainage network model to assess the impacts of multiple stressors on reach-scale riparian condition across two large U.S. regions. In this application, we performed a riparian condition assessment evaluating three dominant stressors: (1) riparian vegetation departure from historical condition; (2) land-use intensity within valley bottoms; and (3) floodplain fragmentation caused by infrastructure within valley bottoms, combining these stressors in a fuzzy inference system. We used freely available, geospatial data to estimate reach-scale (500m) riparian condition for 52,800km of perennial streams and rivers, 25,600km in Utah, and 27,200km in 12 watersheds of the interior Columbia River Basin (CRB). Model outputs showed that riparian condition has been at least moderately impaired across approximate to 70% of the streams and rivers in Utah and approximate to 49% in the CRB. We found 84% agreement (Cohen's ?=0.79) between modeled reaches and field plots, indicating that modeled riparian condition reasonably approximates on-the-ground conditions. Our approach to assessing riparian condition can be used to prioritize watershed-scale floodplain conservation and restoration by providing network-scale data on the extent and severity of riparian degradation. The approach that we applied here is flexible and can be expanded to run with additional riparian stressor data and/or finer resolution input data.

AB  - Floristic Quality Assessment is a proven technique for evaluating the condition of a variety of habitats including wetlands. Its utility in state monitoring and assessment programs, however, has been curtailed by the additional effort and expertise needed for deployment. In this study, we tested the validity of two prerequisites of floristic quality assessment: the need for a comprehensive species list and the requirement that all taxa be identified to species. The mean coefficient of conservatism (mean C) was shown to be the most sensitive variable of the index and was used to test its efficacy in a rapid context. Mean C demonstrated a lack of significant response when graminoid taxa were selectively removed and also when scores were calculated based on dominant taxa only ((C) over bar (dom)). The muted response observed is likely due to redundancy in the species list (many plants with the same C value) and the averaging of C values. Site ranks did shift when based on (C) over bar (dom), however, and this result may have implications on how individual sites are prioritized for restoration and protection. Ultimately, resource managers must determine if the decreased level of accuracy obtained from abridged plant lists is an acceptable trade-off for increased savings in time and effort.

AB  - Environmental practitioners must conduct and monitor the effects of environmental management activities on ecosystem health with limited resources. Using soundscapes to monitor aspects of ecosystem health is a potentially economical, low impact alternative to traditional monitoring techniques. The success of using soundscapes as an alternative monitoring technique relies on developing a method that links soundscapes to the impact of resource management on biodiversity over time.
   We completed a pilot study to test whether soundscapes can be related to vegetation condition by comparing eight published soundscape metrics to BioCondition scores within a rural property in Queensland, Australia. Three-minute soundscape recordings and BioCondition score data were sampled within three broad vegetation conditions of a woodland ecosystem: cleared, regrowth and remnant. Our hypotheses were that the soundscapes from these three vegetation conditions would be different and that this difference would be: (i) detectable in the acoustic indices; and (ii) related to existing methods of assessing vegetation condition (i.e. BioCondition score). Using ANOVA, three soundscape indices (Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI), Acoustic Entropy Index (H) and Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI)) were significantly different between treatments of broad vegetation condition type (AEI p-value approximate to 0.016, H p-value approximate to 0.006, ADI p-value approximate to 0.038). Spearman's correlation coefficients suggested that two indices had the greatest potential to link to BioCondition Score (AEI (-0.821) and H (0.893). We conclude that differences in ecosystem condition can be detected as differences in the soundscape and that there is a relationship between soundscapes and BioCondition score that indicates inherent biodiversity values. Our findings support soundscapes as a potential surrogate measure of vegetation condition for assessing biodiversity values. Although further research is required to strengthen these associations, this study is an early step towards understanding the link between soundscapes and vegetation condition as an indicator of biodiversity and overall ecosystem health.

TI  - Floristic Characterization of Sward and Phytoindicative Valorisation of Habitats' Conditions of Selected Forest Meadows
T2  - ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA

AB  - Forest meadows are characterized by high species diversity and serve many important functions in nature. On their area, there is a considerable variety of aquatic and edaphic conditions and unique microclimate, which is affected by closeness of a forest, which determines both system of habitat conditions and floristic composition of those meadows. Individual plant species present in the grasslands sward are often indicators of specific habitat conditions in the area. It can be specified more exactly site conditions using bioindication for the whole plant associations. Fitoidication method is a objective, yet cheaper and simpler in implementation method than the traditional chemical examinations.
   The aim of studies was to fix floristic composition of forest meadows' sward and on this basis lay down conditions of their habitats. Investigated forest grasslands were surrendered by mixed forest, situated on north of Klodawa (Lubuskie Province). There were made botanic-gravimetric analyses to stipulate floristic composition of sward and used ecological indicators values of vascular plants ace. to Zarzycki et al. [14] to appraise habitat's conditions.
   Estimated moisture of habitat (W), trophic status of soil (Tr), soil acidity and light conditions in communities. On this area there were floristic types with domination of Carex riparia, Phalaris arundinacea, Phalaris arundinacea with Alopecurus pratensis, Alopecurus pratensis, Arrhenatherum elatius with Festuca rubra, Arrhenatherum elatius with Holcus lanatus, Arrhenatherum elatius, Festuca ovina. On a basis of indicator species there found out that the most various were moisture conditions, characterized as from wet to dry. Soils of the largest area of investigated meadows were eutrophic with neutral to slightly alkaline pH, only soils estimated as dry were oligotrophic, and species occurred there had distinctive soil pH tolerance. There were moderate light conditions in investigated plant communities, only in community with domination of sedges recorded few species which were tolerant to partial shade.

AB  - In the Podillya area, the most promising for greening different objects is the Lupine perennis L. and Lupine Polyphyllus Lindl. For creation of modern garden compositions of the park zone of Vinnytsia National Agrarian University the most appropriate are the varieties: Lulu-Russell, Minaret, Albus, Fireworks, which were well adapted to the growing conditions, were practically not affected by pests and diseases, were sufficiently resistant to environmental conditions. According to the flowering phase study, it was found that the highest flowering duration was observed in perennial lupine plants. In determining the suitability of the plants studied by us for their use in landscaping, their assessment of the complex of economic and biological indicators in accordance with the State Methodology of Variety Testing was carried out. Their high score on a set of criteria testifies to the prospect and suitability for cultivation in Podillia conditions, as well as the value for different uses: flower beds, ridges, mixboards, landscape type compositions and their smaller variants imitating natural groups.

AB  - The increasing consumption of natural resources due to population growth, and the expansion of agricultural activity have a major impact on freshwater ecosystems. The aim of this study was to verify if possible changes in habitat condition and physical-chemical variables due to different land uses are reflected by changes in Odonata assemblages. hi order to do that, we evaluated the conservation status of the riparian zone and the physicochemical parameters of stream waters affected by different degrees of anthropogenic impact, and assessed richness and variation in species composition, testing for potential indicator species of habitat quality. The riparian index allowed the differentiation of three habitat condition categories: conserved, intermediate and degraded. No significant differences were found in species richness between the three conservation states, but it was possible to discriminate between the communities present. Four species showed potential as habitat quality indicators that can serve as biomonitors in future strategies of stream management and conservation.

AB  - In view of the unique biological characteristics of mangroves, it is interesting to assess the extent to which these ecosystems can be used as indicators of coastal change or sea-level rise. From recent studies of mangrove mortality at several locations (including Guiana, Gambia, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, India and Bangladesh), it appears that these coastal ecosystems are so specialized that any minor variation in their hydrological or tidal regimes causes noticeable mortality. Each species of mangrove (but particularly those belonging to the genera Rhizophora, Bruguiera, Sonneratia, Heritiera and Nypa) occurs in ecological conditions that approach its limit of tolerance with regard to salinity of the water and soil, as well as the inundation regime. If the duration of daily immersion were to be modified by tectonic, sedimentological or hydrological events, the species either readjusts to the new conditions or succumbs to unsuitable conditions. Consequently, the use of remote sensing data for mangrove ecosystems offers excellent potential as a tool for monitoring coastal change.

AB  - We experiment with artificial data to test the response of five numerical techniques in extrapolating paleo-environments for no-analog conditions. No-analog conditions are those beyond the technique calibration (modern) data set and will be encountered in applications to the geologic past, though they may not be easy to recognize. In the ideal, a numerical technique will correctly extrapolate to no-analog conditions. Failing this, the technique will have a consistent, predictable error response to increasing no-analog conditions, as these are measured by a reliable index. The no-analog conditions that we used are a natural extension of the calibration conditions we created. Thus we test techniques for their response to shifting environmental conditions rather than for factors unrelated to the ecology of the taxa (e.g. post-depositional fossil preservation). Five numerical techniques we test with our hypothetical data are (1) multivariate regression of species percents, (2) correlation-based principal components with linear regression, (3) covariance-based principal components with linear regression, (4) correlation-based principal components with non-linear regression, and (5) the Imbrie and Kipp technique. All the techniques show increasing estimation error as conditions depart from those of the calibration data set. There are two main causes of error in our estimates: (1) the distorting effects of matrix closure on taxon abundances; and (2) generation of ratio no-analogs among species abundances because of non-linear responses to conditions departing progressively from the calibration range. With all the techniques, the distribution of error for no-analog conditions is complex. Non-linear regression with factors shows the least predictable error response. We found that currently developed no-analog indicators do not have a good correlation to estimation error. This means that better indicators, more closely linked to the accuracy of estimates, need to be developed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the eighties the city of Rijeka was one of the most polluted in the country regarding sulphur dioxide. To estimate the harmful effects of air pollution on plants, lichen specimens collected within the city area in 1985/ 1986 were tested on cell membrane integrity. The highest cell membrane damage, e.g. specific conductivity per mass of lichens, was observed in those collected at sites with highest winter SO2 levels. As the levels of SO2 declined (50-70%) in the mid-nineties, the test was repeated in winter 1995/96. Lower specific conductivity, prevailing of the relatively sensitive P. caperata strain among the randomly collected specimens, as well as reappearing of lichens in the city center indicate recovering of their natural habitat due to decline of SO2 levels.

AB  - Photoperiodic diapause is an important adaptation that allows individuals to escape harsh seasonal environments via a series of physiological changes, most notably developmental arrest and reduced metabolism. Global gene expression profiling via RNA-Seq can provide important insights into the transcriptional mechanisms of photoperiodic diapause. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an outstanding organism for studying the transcriptional bases of diapause due to its ease of rearing, easily induced diapause, and the genomic resources available. This manuscript presents a general experimental workflow for identifying diapause-induced transcriptional differences in A. albopictus. Rearing techniques, conditions necessary to induce diapause and non-diapause development, methods to estimate percent diapause in a population, and RNA extraction and integrity assessment for mosquitoes are documented. A workflow to process RNA-Seq data from Illumina sequencers culminates in a list of differentially expressed genes. The representative results demonstrate that this protocol can be used to effectively identify genes differentially regulated at the transcriptional level in A. albopictus due to photoperiodic differences. With modest adjustments, this workflow can be readily adapted to study the transcriptional bases of diapause or other important life history traits in other mosquitoes.

AB  - The current condition of the former pesticide storages has been investigated and characterized. All pesticide storages of Kryzhopil region are in extremely poor condition and they contain substantial amounts of unknown mixtures of unusable pesticides, which are stored in bulk in 100% of pesticide storages being a powerful source of environmental pollution by toxicants of various chemical composition. Pesticide residues in different environment (soil, water, plant) have been determined. The research results clearly prove availability of severe local sources of contamination of agricultural lands with organochlorine pesticides. There is a risk of contamination of other environmental objects with hazardous substances and a negative impact of toxic substances on human health. Migration of pesticides from the soil into agricultural products and drinking water has been identified. It has been suggested that poor environmental conditions and consumption of pesticide-contaminated agricultural products and drinking water lead to an increase in the number of human diseases. It has been found that the population of the district has much higher morbidity rates compared to the indicators of the oblast. Step-by-step environmental risk assessment has been carried out.

AB  - Forecasted increases in global temperatures will likely have profound effects on freshwater fishes. Overlaid on increasing global temperatures, human populations are expected to grow, which will increase anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in freshwater ecosystems. Florida (US) represents the equatorial range limit for many freshwater fishes, thus these species are potentially at risk to climate warming. Likewise, Florida's population is expected to aggressively expand, increasing risk for nutrient enrichment. In this study, we examined whether maximum water temperatures or trophic state indicators (a proxy for nutrient enrichment) better explains variation in Florida Bass (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) condition across 23 different Florida freshwater bodies distributed throughout the state. Florida Bass lengths and weights, temperature, and chlorophyll-alpha, total phosphorous (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) measures were collected in the late summer and fall from 2010 to 2012. We described relationships between bass relative condition and environmental measurements (temperature, and trophic state indicators) across these lake-year combinations using linear and non-linear regressions. We found no significant relationship between temperature and bass condition (r(2) = 0.01). However, we found that trophic state indicators did predict bass condition (r(2) = 0.39-0.50). Though research is needed to more rigorously assess the effects of rising temperature on bass condition, our results may suggest that lake productivity is currently an influential driver on Florida Bass. As such, management efforts should continue to closely monitor and manage water quality and potential nutrient enrichment in Florida's freshwater waters, as bass condition appears to be closely tied to lake productivity.

AB  - Military installations provide important native habitat for songbirds, including many species that have experienced population declines in recent decades. As part of the Land Condition Trend Analysis (LCTA) program to monitor animal populations on military lands, we surveyed small (< 250 g) breeding landbirds on 60 permanent plots on the Fort Riley Military Installation in northeastern Kansas from 1991 to 2002. During this period, species richness averaged 39.0 species ( SE 0.9)/ year and mean species richness per plot ranged from 3.6 species ( SE = 0.2)/ plot ( 1999) to 7.5 species ( SE = 0.3)/ plot ( 1992). Turnover ( the appearance and disappearance of species on all plots from one year to the next) ranged from 5 species ( 2000 - 2001) to 16 species ( 1992 - 1993) and was driven primarily by turnover of woodland species. We developed an index of relative difference ( C) to evaluate relative trends of local populations and found that 25 species declined, 15 species increased, and 7 did not change. Based on migration assemblages, more resident species ( 6 of 10) and more short-distant migrants ( 9 of 12) decreased than long-distance migrants ( 10 vs. 11). Our analysis of major vegetation communities on plots showed few changes in the quantity of habitats ( grassland vs. woodlands) during the study. Our results indicate that Fort Riley provides important habitats for many landbirds, particularly those that require grasslands for breeding. Several species exhibited local declines when compared to the regional Breeding Bird Survey routes. We offer an approach that evaluates population changes of small landbirds and provides objective inputs for conservation directives. These can be adopted easily for use on military installations ( that use LCTA), parks, and wildlife refuges that have data from annual breeding bird surveys.

AB  - Floodplain riparian ecosystems support unique vegetation communities and high biodiversity relative to terrestrial landscapes. Accordingly, estimating riparian ecosystem health across landscapes is critical for sustainable river management. However, methods that identify local riparian vegetation condition, an effective proxy for riparian health, have not been applied across broad, regional extents. Here we present an index to assess reach-scale (500 m segment) riparian vegetation condition across entire drainage networks within large, physiographically-diverse regions. We estimated riparian vegetation condition for 53,250 km of perennial streams and rivers, 25,685 km in Utah, and 27,565 km in twelve watersheds of the interior Columbia River Basin (CRB), USA. We used nationally available, existing land cover classification derived from 30 m Landsat imagery (LANDFIRE EVT) and a modeled estimate of pre-European settlement land cover (LANDFIRE BpS). The index characterizes riparian vegetation condition as the ratio of existing native riparian vegetation cover to pre-European settlement riparian vegetation cover at a given reach. Roughly 62% of Utah and 48% of CRB watersheds showed significant (>33%) to large (>66%) departure from historic condition. Riparian vegetation change was predominantly caused by human land-use impacts (development and agriculture), or vegetation change (native riparian to invasive or upland vegetation types) that likely resulted from flow and disturbance regime alteration. Through comparisons to ground-based classification results, we estimate the existing vegetation component of the index to be 85% accurate. Our assessments yielded riparian condition maps that will help resource managers better prioritize sites and treatments for reach-scale conservation and restoration activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The natural high productivity of river lagoons has always attracted human activities of high economic value such as aquaculture. Notwithstanding, these environments are also prone to contamination, excessive organic enrichment and hypoxic/anoxic events due to the synergy between natural (e.g. fluctuations of oxygen, temperature and salinity) and anthropogenic factors (e.g. accumulation of pollutants carried by the river). In order to minimize any economic loss and potential risk for human health, river lagoons are kept under surveillance by means of monitoring campaigns that rarely include foraminifera and nematoda despite their suitability as ecological indicators. In May 2016, these two assemblages were investigated within the framework of the project RITMARE in four lagoons of the Po Delta system (Adriatic Sea) in terms of taxonomic composition, biodiversity and biological traits. Dominated by a few tolerant taxa (Ammonia tepida and Haynesina germanica for foraminifera; Daptonema, Tershellingia and Sabatieria for nematoda), both assemblages seemed adapted to conditions of environmental instability mainly ascribable to natural disturbance factors rather than to anthropogenic contamination, as indicated by the DISTLM outputs. Furthermore, the stochastic occurrence of abnormal tests and the presence of numerous organisms in subsurface sediment levels confirmed a limited effect of synthetic organic compounds (e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons and polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and trace metals on foraminifera. Focusing on nematoda, the assemblage seemed more sensitive in reflecting the peculiar environmental conditions of each lagoon and the degree of confinement, as indicated by the significant intra- and interlagoon variability detected for the majority of the tested metrics. In particular the significantly less biodiverse assemblage dominated by r-strategist (i.e. pioneer) organisms at the inner and middle stations of Scardovari may represent the nematoda response to recent hypoxic/anoxic conditions that often occur in the inner areas of this lagoon because of its low water renewal. Both assemblages showed to be suitable for the implementation of monitoring programs; from the study of foraminifera, a relatively low chemical contamination was inferred while, from that of nematodes, recent events of oxygen deficiency were detectable.

AB  - The planning and management of river ecosystems affects a variety of social groups (i.e., managers, stakeholders, professionals and users) who have different interests about water uses. To avoid conflicts and reach an environmentally sustainable management, various methods have been devised to enable the participation of these actors. Mathematical modelling of river systems is highly recommended to forecast, but we do not always have enough information to do it. In these cases, the soft and meta-models can be valid alternatives to simulate these complex systems.
   The Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are presented as a tool that facilitates the modelling of ecological systems, functions and services. FCM networking concepts are intertwined through causal relationships. The FCM concept spatial arrangement and the use of fuzzy logic facilitate the integration of different expert opinions. In our study, from a panel of seven experts from representatives of different social sectors, an aggregated FCM was obtained. The most central concept in the aggregated map was cross barriers, dams and weirs. Using our FCM expert model, we performed a number of simulations from different possible scenarios, such as the continuous degradation of natural conditions and the improvement of river natural conditions. A regular increment in the natural conditions generates a substantial enhance in variables as natural water flow and sediment transport. Conversely, the increment in human activities as agro-forestry production addresses to a deterioration of river banks among other variables.
   In the Esla River, the FCM indicators showed an ecosystem that was greatly influenced by human activity, especially by the presence of barriers, in which the economic variables presented high network influence even though their centrality indices were relatively low. Meanwhile, the essential elements for the proper functioning of this ecosystem, as a natural flow regime, showed very low values that were visibly affected by anthropogenic variables.
   FCM methodology enabled us not only to understand the perception of current fluvial ecosystems but also to generate plausible management scenarios based on expert knowledge in this field. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The framework of land sparing versus land sharing provides a useful analytical tool to address the crop-production/biodiversity trade-off. Despite multiple case studies testing the sparing-sharing trade-off, this framework still lacks the ability to identify the conditions in which sparing, or sharing, would be the preferred strategy for pareto-optimizing both food production and biodiversity. Under some conditions, ecosystem services may create a positive feedback between biodiversity and crop production, affecting the optimization. This study aims to identify the conditions and the relevant variables that determine the preferred land use strategy in terms of maximizing both biodiversity and food production, while accounting for positive feedback of ecosystem services in this analysis. We used a simulation model with data from a mixed cropping landscape (100 km(2)) covering seven crop types, five taxonomic groups, three biodiversity metrics and 23 bioindicators to explore the variables shaping the biodiversity-production trade-off and ecosystem services underlying it. We explored a continuum of sparing large semi-natural patches to sharing by maintaining uncultivated field margins of varying size. Land sparing outperformed land sharing in 62% of the scenarios and it was economically more predictable. The optimization was shaped by costs, associated with crop type, rather than by landscape composition and configuration, biodiversity metric, taxonomic group or bioindicator. Landscape configuration and taxonomic group results corroborate the notion that land sharing benefits mainly small organisms, and that the common width of field margins in many agri-environmental policies (10 m) is not cost-effective compared to land sparing. Land sharing was the optimal strategy whenever it resulted in minimal costs, despite contributing little to biodiversity. Yet, when field margins were >20 m wide (small-scale sparing), land sharing maintained higher biodiversity and was at least as cost-effective as sparing. Synthesis and applications. Our model highlights the importance of socio-economic variables compared to ecological variables in selecting land-management strategy to pareto-optimize both food production and biodiversity. Considering opportunity costs alongside economic benefits from ecosystem services in various cropping systems may therefore improve the cost-effectiveness of biodiversity conservation policies in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The impounding of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) at the Yangtze River caused large flooding of urban, industrial, and agricultural areas, and profound land use changes took place. Consequently, substantial amounts of organic and inorganic pollutants were released into the reservoir. Additionally, contaminants and nutrients are entering the reservoir by drift, drainage, and runoff from adjacent agricultural areas as well as from sewage of industry, aquacultures, and households. The main aim of the presented research project is a deeper understanding of the processes that determines the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of organic pollutants, i.e., mainly pesticides, in aquatic food webs under the newly developing conditions of the TGR. The project is part of the Yangtze-Hydro environmental program, financed by the German Ministry of Education and Science. In order to test combinations of environmental factors like nutrients and pollution, we use an integrated modeling approach to study the potential accumulation and biomagnification. We describe the integrative modeling approach and the consecutive adaption of the AQUATOX model, used as modeling framework for ecological risk assessment. As a starting point, pre-calibrated simulations were adapted to Yangtze-specific conditions (regionalization). Two exemplary food webs were developed by a thorough review of the pertinent literature. The first typical for the flowing conditions of the original Yangtze River and the Daning River near the city of Wushan, and the second for the stagnant reservoir characteristics of the aforementioned region that is marked by an intermediate between lake and large river communities of aquatic organisms. In close cooperation with German and Chinese partners of the Yangtze-Hydro Research Association, other site-specific parameters were estimated. The MINIBAT project contributed to the calibration of physicochemical and bathymetric parameters, and the TRANSMIC project delivered hydrodynamic models for water volume and flow velocity conditions. The research questions were firstly focused on the definition of scenarios that could depict representative situations regarding food webs, pollution, and flow conditions in the TGR. The food webs and the abiotic site conditions in the main study area near the city of Wushan that determine the environmental preconditions for the organisms were defined. In our conceptual approach, we used the pesticide propanil as a model substance.

AB  - The microbial biomass content is the most informative indicator for early detection of soil condition. Soil microorganisms support the homeostasis of forest ecosystems due to the unique ability of rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions. The article presents the results of soil microbiological assessment carried out within the framework of comprehensive monitoring studies of the forest ecosystems of the Kamennaya Steppe. The following objects of the agroforestry permanent study area served as options: a mowing fallow of 1882; forest belt no. 40 of 1903 laying out, located on the watershed area; forest belt no. 133 of 1950 planting; and forest belt no. 131 of 1959 planting. Additionally, arable lands adjacent to forest belts no. 40 and 133 (watershed, slope) were included in the research scheme. The research purpose was to determine the biological activity of soils of the Kamennaya Steppe, as well as the direction and intensity of soil and biological processes in agroforestry arrangement of the territory. The total number and structure of ecological and trophic groups of the microbial community were determined by the method of E.Z. Tepper by seeding on solid nutrient media. It is shown that the soil cover under the tree plantation is defined by a higher content of ammonifiers and actinomycetes. Intensive agricultural land use significantly reduces the intensity of microbiological processes. The undertaken studies allow stating that the optimum conditions for the development of micromycetes are formed in soils under woody and native steppe vegetation. The involvement of chernozems in active agricultural production leads to a decrease in the number of fungal flora. A high concentration of nitrifiers was revealed in arable lands. The lands with woody vegetation and steppe cenoses had lower indices and were somewhat inferior to agrogenic soils. Annual soil cultivation is crucial and drives up the activity of bacterial colonies (genus Azotobacter) on arable lands. The activity is much lower under the tree crops and steppe vegetation in most cases. Mineralization coefficients are calculated for the studied soils. Due to the fact that these coefficients in all the studied objects are above one (except the field under winter wheat and bordering the forest belt no. 133), it follows that the mineralization processes of soil organic matter prevail over the decomposition of organic residues.

AB  - Modern ecological assessments of running waters are based on the a priori definition of ecological benchmarks, given by reference-quality sites. Such benchmarks are established at the level of ecoregions, typologies, or site. Yet, in highly disturbed regions, such as coastal areas of European countries, the assessment of streams' water quality based on the reference condition concept is very difficult, due to the lack of undisturbed sites. Among others, the reduced number of reference sites may have as a consequence the definition of imprecise ecological benchmarks. Here we tested the hypotheses that (1) the increase in the number of potential reference sites (2) the definition of more precise abiotic threshelds using the least disturbed condition approach (LDC), and (3) the use of diatom assemblages, as the most ubiquitous element in lowland areas, would result in refinement and eventual sub-division of existing river types of a highly disturbed area, such as the Portuguese centre-western region. For this purpose, abiotic data characterising natural conditions of 55 sites from a littoral highly disturbed region were used in a hierarchical classification analysis that revealed the existence of three different sub-groups. In addition, a three-step approach was used to define thresholds for the pressure variables in LDC. Based on these new thresholds, sites in LDC were selected. A hierarchical classification performed to the LDC diatom spring assemblages revealed the existence of two sub-groups, concordant with two of the abiotic sub-groups. Several species contributed to the dissimilarity between the two sub-groups (e.g., Achnanthidium minutissimum and Karayevia oblongella)., Differences between the sub-groups were also found in the trait proportions of stalked species. New benchmark values for these two sub-groups, based on the scores of the official diatom index, the Indice de Polluosensibilite Specifique (IPS), were different from the previous reference value used. Yet, no biological benchmark values were established for one of the groups due to the absence of sites in the LDC. Our study suggests that streambed substrate is an important characterisation variable in the river type definition and highlights that, in spite of the potential refinement in reference conditions and typology obtained, an alternative approach that does not require the use of reference sites should be explored in the future.

AB  - This study used the visible fluorescence signal of scales from Astyanax lacustris fishes to differentiate ten populations of streams in Ivinhema River Basin, Upper Parana Basin, Brazil. Scales were removed from the humeral region of each fish and the fluorescence spectroscopy was carried out with two excitation wavelengths: at 360 nm (UV-A) and 405 nm. The broad emission covers all visible regions and it is related to the organic fraction of scale, basically composed from type I collagen. By interpreting the experimental fluorescence spectra with multivariate statistical analysis, it was possible to discriminate the investigated populations. By exciting the inner face of scales at 405 nm, for instance, the obtained Wilk's lambda was 0.143, and the ten sampled streams could be statistically differentiated with 85.2% of explanation. This fluorescence interpretation exhibits very good correlation with the diet composition, which was also investigated for the same fishes from which the scales were removed. The applied methodology was capable to analyze the scales of A. lacustris, and to provide meaningful and enlightening results for the differentiation of populations. This methodology is very important for aquatic environmental study, mainly because small fishes, non-migratory or with small migration rate, can exhibit differences among habitats, as response to genetic isolation and adjustment to local conditions.

AB  - Restoring forest structure and composition is an important component of urban land management, but we lack clear understanding of the mechanisms driving restoration success. Here we studied two indicators of restoration success in temperate rainforests: native tree regeneration and epiphyte colonization. We hypothesized that ecosystem properties such as forest canopy openness, abundance of exotic herbaceous weeds, and the microclimate directly affect the density and diversity of native tree seedlings and epiphytes. Relationships between environmental conditions and the plant community were investigated in 27 restored urban forests spanning 3-70 years in age and in unrestored and remnant urban forests. We used structural equation modelling to determine the direct and indirect drivers of native tree regeneration and epiphyte colonization in the restored forests. Compared to remnant forest, unrestored forest had fewer native canopy tree species, significantly more light reaching the forest floor annually, and higher exotic weed cover. Additionally, epiphyte density was lower and native tree regeneration density was marginally lower in the unrestored forests. In restored forests, light availability was reduced to levels found in remnant forests within 20 years of restoration planting, followed shortly thereafter by declines in herbaceous exotic weeds and reduced fluctuation of relative humidity and soil temperatures. Contrary to expectations, canopy openness was only an indirect driver of tree regeneration and epiphyte colonization, but it directly regulated weed cover and microclimatic fluctuations, both of which directly drove the density and richness of regeneration and epiphyte colonization. Epiphyte density and diversity were also positively related to forest basal area, as large trees provide physical habitat for colonization. These results imply that ecosystem properties change predictably after initial restoration plantings, and that reaching critical thresholds in some ecosystem properties makes conditions suitable for the regeneration of late successional species, which is vital for restoration success and long-term ecosystem sustainability. Abiotic and biotic conditions that promote tree regeneration and epiphyte colonization will likely be present in forests with a basal area >= 27 m(2)/ha. We recommend that urban forest restoration plantings be designed to promote rapid canopy closure to reduce light availability, suppress herbaceous weeds, and stabilize the microclimate.

AB  - As structural systems approach their end of service life, integrity assessment and condition monitoring during late life becomes necessary in order to identify damage due to age-related issues such as corrosion and fatigue and hence prevent failure. In this paper, a novel method of level 3 damage identification (i.e. detection, localisation and quantification) from local vibration mode pair (LVMP) frequencies is introduced. Detection is achieved by observation of LVMP frequencies within any of the vibration modes investigated while the location of the damage is predicted based on the ranking order of the LVMP frequency ratios and the damage is quantified in terms of material volume loss from pre-established quantification relations. The proposed method which is baseline-free (in the sense that it does not require vibration-based assessment or modal data from the undamaged state of the pipe) and solely frequency-dependent was found to be more than 90% accurate in detecting, locating and quantifying damage through a numerical verification study. It was also successfully assessed using experimental modal data obtained from laboratory tests performed on an aluminium pipe with artificially inflicted corrosion-like damage underscoring a novel concept in vibration-based damage identification for pipes.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC proposes macrophytes as biological indicators for assessing the ecological status of rivers. It also indicates the need to establish reference conditions for that indicator in each of the types of surface water bodies. In the Ebro Basin, the macrophyte index IVAM-G has been applied since 2006, a trophic index that gives tolerance and indicator scores to aquatic taxa, including macroalgae, bryophytes and vascular plants, with a maximum taxonomic level of genus. In this study, we established the reference conditions and benchmarks of the IVAM-G for five river types which had a defined reference network. In this study, the only modification included respect to the original version of the IVAM-G, was the abundance scale that has been changed to 5 classes, in order to converge with the current Spanish official index IBMR. Testing the IVAM-G efficacy in the assessment, we obtained the following results: significant discrimination between impacted and non-impacted sites; strong and highly significant (p < 0.001) response to pressure gradient (r = 0.606); highly significant correlations with other biotic indices (IPS, diatoms, r = 0.609; IBMWP, macroinvertebrates, r = 0.506), land uses (agriculture, r = 0.503) and nutrients (nitrite, r = -0.605; nitrate, r = -0.594; phosphate, r = -0.47). Additionally, the response obtained by the index IVAM-G was similar to that obtained by the indices included in RD 817/2015 (e.g. IBMWP and IPS) in most of the river classes except in the R-T26 type. In this river type the index IVAM-G showed significant differences with IBMWP in the classification of ecological status of the sections studied, however, with IPS no significant differences were observed. Therefore, the IVAM-G is an index that yields good results for monitoring the ecological status and, at the same time, it optimizes and simplifies the field work and laboratory processing. However, it is necessary to continue testing this index together with the current national indices in order to compare results, efficacy and costs.

AB  - Complexity is increasingly the hallmark in environmental management practices of sandy shorelines. This arises primarily from meeting growing public demands (e.g., real estate, recreation) whilst reconciling economic demands with expectations of coastal users who have modern conservation ethics. Ideally, shoreline management is underpinned by empirical data, but selecting ecologically-meaningful metrics to accurately measure the condition of systems, and the ecological effects of human activities, is a complex task. Here we construct a framework for metric selection, considering six categories of issues that authorities commonly address: erosion; habitat loss; recreation; fishing; pollution (litter and chemical contaminants); and wildlife conservation. Possible metrics were scored in terms of their ability to reflect environmental change, and against criteria that are widely used for judging the performance of ecological indicators (i.e., sensitivity, practicability, costs, and public appeal). From this analysis, four types of broadly applicable metrics that also performed very well against the indicator criteria emerged: 1.) traits of bird populations and assemblages (e.g., abundance, diversity, distributions, habitat use); 2.) breeding/reproductive performance sensu lato (especially relevant for birds and turtles nesting on beaches and in dunes, but equally applicable to invertebrates and plants); 3.) population parameters and distributions of vertebrates associated primarily with dunes and the supralittoral beach zone (traditionally focused on birds and turtles, but expandable to mammals); 4.) compound measurements of the abundance/cover/biomass of biota (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates) at both the population and assemblage level. Local constraints (i.e., the absence of birds in highly degraded urban settings or lack of dunes on bluff-backed beaches) and particular issues may require alternatives. Metrics - if selected and applied correctly provide empirical evidence of environmental condition and change, but often do not reflect deeper environmental values per se. Yet, values remain poorly articulated for many beach systems; this calls for a comprehensive identification of environmental values and the development of targeted programs to conserve these values on sandy shorelines globally.

AB  - A rapid toxicity test based on inhibition of esterase activity in the harmful freshwater microalgae - Microcystis aeruginosa was developed using flow cytometry. The hydrolysis rate of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) by intracellular esterase to fluorescein was used to indicate the metabolic activity of algae. Uptake of FDA was optimized at different concentrations and incubation times. Propidium iodide (PI) was utilized to assess cell membrane integrity. The optimized FDA/PI staining dosages were 10 mg/L and 10 mu M, respectively, lower than the reported concentrations. Correspondingly, the proper incubation time was 1421 min at the optimal FDA dosage determined in this study. A new procedure based on optimized FDA/PI condition, called "whole algal culture flow cytometry with fluorescence triggering", was developed for short-term bioassays. This new procedure, taking account of working conditions such as pH and impure cultures, is able to avoid algal cell damages in sample preparation and separate algal cells from non-algal particles by fluorescence triggering. This newly-developed procedure was then used to assess the toxicity of copper on M. aeruginosa in a short-term exposure (36 h). As copper concentrations increased, it was found that the esterase activity decreased in a concentration-dependent manner with increased membrane fragments. Moreover, esterase activity was a good indicator of copper toxicity in M. aeruginosa. The EC50 value based on mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was 123.3 mu g/L (95% confidence limits 101.5-146.2 mu g/L). Therefore, the new-developed procedure could be used for sublethal endpoints detection, and has the potential to be a rapid and cost-effective bioassay for selecting M. aeruginosa control methods or exploring the M. aeruginosa activity inhibition mechanism.

AB  - Exposure to heat stress (HS) may affect the intestinal epithelia of pigs, resulting in impaired digestive and absorptive capacity. The serum concentration (SC) of free AA in pigs can be used as indicators of their availability. This study was conducted with 12 crossbred (Landrace x Hampshire x Duroc) pigs (29.0 +/- 2.8 kg initial BW) distributed into 2 groups to analyze the SC of free AA and some AA metabolites in pigs exposed to HS conditions. The treatments were pigs housed under natural HS conditions in a room with no ambient temperature control (23.6 to 37.6 degrees C, HS) and pigs housed at thermoneutral conditions (24 +/- 2 degrees C), feed restricted to a level similar to that of their HS counterparts. All pigs received a wheat-soybean meal diet. Blood samples were collected at both the absorptive (2.5 h after a meal) and postabsorptive (10.0 h after a meal) phase. At the absorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, Leu, Lys, Phe, Thr, and Trp were lower (P < 0.05) and the SC of His, Val, Ala, Pro, Ser, and Tyr tended to be lower (P < 0.10) in HS pigs. At the postabsorptive phase, the SC of free Arg, His, Met, Asn, Gln, and Tyr were higher (P < 0.05) but the SC of Ala was lower (P < 0.01) and the SC of Pro tended to be lower (P < 0.10) in HS pigs. The absorptive SC of carnosine, ornithine (Orn), and Tau were lower (P < 0.05) and of citrulline (Cit), cystathionine, and urea tended to be lower (P < 0.10) in HS pigs. The postabsorptive SC of 3-methyl-His, homo-Cys, OH-Lys, and OH-Pro increased (P = 0.05) and of Cit tended to increase (P = 0.10) but that of carnosine and sarcosine (P < 0.05) decreased in HS pigs. The results of this study show a marked and differential effect of HS on the SC of AA. These data indicate that HS negatively affects the digestive and absorptive capacity of pigs and that the metabolism of some AA is modified in pigs to counteract the negative effects of the HS.

AB  - In the last few decades petroleum has been consumed at a much faster pace than new reserves have been discovered. The point at which global oil extraction will attain a peak ("peak oil") and begin a period of unavoidable decline is approaching. This eventuality will drive fundamental changes in the quantity and nature of energy flows through the human economic system, which probably will be accompanied by economic turmoil, political conflicts, and a high level of social tension. Besides being a geological and economic issue, peak oil is also a fundamental concern as it pertains to ecological systems and conservation because economics is a subsystem of the global ecosystem and changes in human energy-related behaviors can lead to a broad range of effects on natural ecosystems, ranging from overuse to abandonment. As it becomes more difficult to meet energy demands, environmental considerations may be easily superseded. Given the vital importance of ecosystems and ecosystem services in a postpetroleum era, it is crucially important to wisely manage our ecosystems during the transition period to an economy based on little or no use of fossil fuels. Good policies can be formulated through awareness and understanding gained from scenario-based assessments. Presently, most widely used global scenarios of environmental change do not incorporate resource limitation, including those of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Considering the potential magnitude of the effects of peak oil on society and nature, the development of resource-constrained scenarios should be addressed immediately. Ecologists and conservation biologists are in an important position to analyze the situation and provide guidance, yet the topic is noticeably absent from ecological discussions. We urge politicians, corporate chief executives, thought leaders, and citizens to consider this problem seriously because it is likely to develop into one of the key environmental issues of the 21st century.

AB  - Despite the importance for both animal welfare and scientific integrity of effective welfare assessment in non-human primates, there has been little or no consensus as what should be assessed. A Delphi consultation process was undertaken to identify the animal- and environment-based measures of welfare for laboratory-housed macaques and to determine their relative importance in on-site welfare assessments. One-hundred fifteen potential indictors were identified through a comprehensive literature search, followed by a two-round iterative electronic survey process to collect expert opinion. Stable group response and consensus about the validity, reliability, and feasibility of the proposed indicators (67.5% agreement) was achieved by the completion of Round Two. A substantially higher proportion of environment-based measures (72%: n=44/61) were considered as valid, reliable, and feasible compared to the animal-based measures (22%: n=12/54). The indicators that ranked most highly for assessing welfare were the presence of self-harm behaviours and the provision of social enrichment. This study provides an empirical basis upon which these indicators can be validated and then integrated into assessment tools developed for macaques and emphasises the need to include both animal- and environment-based indicators for accurate welfare monitoring.

AB  - Seagrasses are globally recognized as bioindicators of marine eutrophication and contamination. Seagrasses also harbor a distinct root microbial community that largely reflects the conditions of the surrounding environment as well as the condition of the seagrass. Hence monitoring changes in the root microbial community could act as an additional biological indicator that reflects both the seagrass health condition, as well as potential deterioration in coastal waters. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with analysis of seagrass nutrients (C, N, delta N-15, delta C-13) and tissue metal concentrations to investigate potential links between seagrass (Halophila ovalis) root bacteria and seagrass nutrient and metal concentrations within an anthropogenically influenced estuary. We found seagrass tissue nitrogen (%) and delta N-15 values were 2-5 times higher than global averages for this species. Seagrass root associated bacteria formed distinct communities that clustered by site and were correlated to both seagrass nutrient and metal concentration, with some putative sulfide oxidizing bacteria (Sulfurimonas and Sulfurovum) correlated with greater nutrient concentrations, and putative iron cycling bacteria (Lewinella and Woeseia) correlated with greater Fe and As concentrations. Our findings shed further light on the relationship between seagrass and their microbes, as well as provide additional assessment of the use of both seagrass and their microbes as indicators of estuarine and seagrass condition.

AB  - Historically, Inuit communities of the Arctic have relied significantly on the living marine resources of their coastal waters for nutrition, underpinning community cohesion and enhancing individual and collective well-being. Inadequate understanding of the conditions of coastal marine stocks and their dynamics, along with failed past fisheries management practices, now threatens secure access to these resources for food and nutrition. We examine the degree of integration of modern Canadian federal food and marine resource management policies, which heretofore have been unable to lessen food insecurity in the Arctic, suggesting that causes rather than symptoms need to be treated. Using evidence from Nunatsiavut, northern Labrador, we assess the limits to marine resource governance affecting access to traditionally important food sources. We explore the potential for both increased subsistence harvests and enhanced access to commercial fisheries in mitigating Inuit food insecurity, arguing for the relevance of expanded marine resource assessments, more focused fisheries management, and integration with policies designed to mitigate food insecurity. Crucially, the absence of methods for tracking changes in locally harvested marine resources threatens not only individual and household nutrition but also the social, economic, and cultural integrity of Inuit communities. We further describe the needs for monitoring and propose the use of indicators that capture the contributions of locally harvested marine resources to increased food security along with a framework that allows for utilizing local knowledge and observations. Relying on emerging lessons from research in Nunatsiavut, we build a foundation for a better understanding of both the political and institutional legacies that contribute to Labrador Inuit food insecurity and discuss how the deeper integration of food and marine resource management policies could help mitigate it.

AB  - The whole of the Swan-Canning Estuary, in the south-west of Australia, is impacted by human activity, and the selection of a local reference site to assess the impact of environmental contamination on the health of biota is not possible. To determine whether fish depurated under laboratory conditions could be used as an alternative to a reference site; adult black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) were collected from the estuary and maintained in clean water (S24) for 3 months. A suite of biomarkers of fish health were assessed, and the results were compared with field-captured black bream from three sites within the estuary (Ascot, Claisebrook, and Riverton). Comparisons of a subset of biomarkers were also made between hatchery-bred juvenile fish and the depurated fish. Biomarker levels were up to 3.8 times higher in field captured fish compared with depurated fish, while DNA integrity was lower. EROD activity was comparable in the hatchery-bred black bream to the depurated fish while s-SDH levels were two times higher in the hatchery fish. From the results obtained, field-captured black bream depurated for 3 months are suitable to determine reference/baseline levels for biomarker of health studies in estuarine environments.

AB  - Listeria monocytogenes has previously been shown to adapt to a wide variety of environmental niches, principally those associated with low pH, and this compromises its control in food environments. An understanding of the mechanism(s) by which L. monocytogenes survives unfavourable environmental conditions will aid in developing new food processing methods to control the organism in foodstuffs. The present Study aimed to gain a further understanding of the physiological basis for the differential effects of one control strategy, namely the use of the lantibiotic nisin. Using propidium iodide (PI) to probe membrane integrity it was shown that L. monocytogenes Scott A was sensitive to nisin (8 ng mL(-1)) but this was growth phase dependent with stationary phase cells (OD600=1.2) being much more resistant than exponential phase cells (OD600=0.38). We demonstrate that, using a combination of techniques including fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), the membrane adaptations underpinning nisin resistance are triggered much earlier (OD600 < 0.5) than the onset of stationary phase. The significance of these findings in terms of mechanism and application are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.

AB  - Multiple stressors threaten biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, imposing new challenges to ecosystem management and restoration. Ecosystem managers are required to address and mitigate the impact of multiple stressors, yet the knowledge required to disentangle multiple-stressor effects is still incomplete. Experimental studies have advanced the understanding of single and combined stressor effects, but there is a lack of a robust analytical framework, to address the impact of multiple stressors based on monitoring data. Since 2000, the monitoring of Europe's waters has resulted in a vast amount of biological and environmental (stressor) data of about 120,000 water bodies. For many reasons, this data is rarely exploited in the multiple-stressor context, probably because of its rather heterogeneous nature: stressors vary and are mixed with broad-scale proxies of environmental stress (e.g. land cover), missing values and zero-inflated data limit the application of statistical methods and biological indicators are often aggregated (e.g. taxon richness) and do not respond stressor-specific. Here, we present a 'cookbook' to analyse the biological response to multiple stressors using data from biomonitoring schemes. Our 'cookbook' includes guidance for the analytical process and the interpretation of results. The 'cookbook' is accompanied by scripts, which allow the user to run a stepwise analysis based on his/her own data in R, an open-source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. Using simulated and real data, we show that the recommended procedure is capable of identifying stressor hierarchy (importance) and interaction in large datasets. We recommend a minimum number of 150 independent observations and a minimum stressor gradient length of 75% (of the most relevant stressor's gradient in nature), to be able to reliably rank the stressor's importance, detect relevant interactions and estimate their standardised effect size. We conclude with a brief discussion of the advantages and limitations of this protocol. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, 35 published studies on life cycle assessment (LCA) of sewage sludge were reviewed for their methodological and technological assumptions. Overall, LCA has been providing a flexible framework to quantify environmental impacts of wastewater and sewage sludge treatment and disposal processes for multiple scales, ranging from process selection to policy evaluation. The results of LCA are, in principle, unique to the goal and scope of each study, reflecting its local conditions and comparison between different LCAs is not intended. Furthermore, the assessments are limited by the methodological development of the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and the advancement of research in quantifying environmental emissions associated with wastewater and sewage sludge treatment processes. Thus, large discrepancies were found in the selection of the environmental emissions to be included and how they were estimated in the analysis. In order to reduce these choice uncertainties, consolidation of the modelling approach in the following area are recommended: quantification of fugitive gas emissions and modelling of disposal practices. Besides harmonization of the key technical assumptions, clear documentation of the modelling approach and the uncertainties associating with each assumption is encouraged so as to improve the integrity and robustness of assessment.

AB  - In contrast to surface water ecosystems, groundwater ecosystems are usually considered to have relatively stable conditions and physically inert environments. However, many groundwater ecosystems undergo substantial changes through space and time, related to fluxes in groundwater flow, exchange and nutrient imports.
   In this study we used hydrochemical data to: 1) determine the different hydrogeological conditions in an alluvial system, the shallow Gwydir River alluvial aquifer (located in Northern New South Wales, Australia); and 2) analyze the relationship between hydrochemical conditions and the composition of stygofauna assemblages in the aquifer.
   Using hydrochemical modeling and multivariate analyses, four main hydrogeological situations were defined as occurring in the aquifer. Bores were classified as having either a high, low or no influence from or exchange with the river. The latter group was further subdivided into those of low and high salinity.
   Further analysis combining the biological and hydrochemical data identified two main groups of samples. The first group was composed mainly of samples related to the aquifer groundwater which had higher richness and abundance of fauna compared to samples in the second group which was comprised of samples affected by stream water leakage and samples related to the highest salinities. These results suggest that more stable conditions (mainly related to steadier groundwater head levels) and lower nitrate concentrations promoted a more diverse and abundant stygofauna community.

AB  - Interactions between seabirds and their prey are shaped largely by the dynamics of the marine ecosystems in which they are embedded. Physical oceanographic processes can drive the distributions of ectothermic and planktonic prey and hence their availability to marine birds. Owing to the complex nature of these processes and interactions, the signal-to-noise ratios of avian indicators of prey conditions are variable, often low and further degraded (buffered) by seabird behaviour and life-history features. Cairns (1987, Biol Oceanogr 5:261-271) detailed seabird responses operating over a range of temporal scales to variation in food supplies, and suggested that interval relationships might be developed between avian responses and environmental variation. While this may be possible in some instances, it appears unrealistic in most instances to expect interval relationships between seabird responses and prey conditions that are often nonlinearly related. The present paper focuses on binary data (e.g. breeding success versus failure) derived from seabirds that can provide robust information about major shifts in prey and oceanographic conditions and that are particularly informative when accumulated over decadal and large ocean scales. Inter-annual and decadal variations in specific and nominally categorized (warm-versus cold-water) prey landings of northern gannets Sula bassana at a large oceanic colony in the NW Atlantic reflect shifts in pelagic food webs induced by changes in regional sea surface temperature. Binary patterns emphasize decadal shifts in food webs and yield predictive indication of systemic change.

AB  - Traditional bacterial indicators used in public health to assess water quality and the Biolog (R) system were evaluated to compare their response to biological, chemical, and physical habitat indicators of stream condition both within the state of Oregon and among ecoregion aggregates (Coast Range, Willamette Valley, Cascades, and eastern Oregon). Forty-three randomly selected Oregon river sites were sampled during the summer in 1997 and 1998. The public health indicators included heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), total coliforms (TC), fecal coliforms (FC) and Escherichia coli (EC). Statewide, HPC correlated strongly with physical habitat (elevation, riparian complexity, % canopy presence, and indices of agriculture, pavement, road, pasture, and total disturbance) and chemistry (pH, dissolved O-2, specific conductance, acid-neutralizing capacity, dissolved organic carbon, total N, total P, SiO2, and SO4). FC and EC were significantly correlated generally with the river chemistry indicators. TC bacteria significantly correlated with riparian complexity, road disturbance, dissolved O-2, and SiO2 and FC. Analyzing the sites by ecoregion, eastern Oregon was characterized by high HPC, FC, EC, nutrient loads, and indices of human disturbance, whereas the Cascades ecoregion had correspondingly low counts of these indicators. The Coast Range and Willamette Valley presented inconsistent indicator patterns that are more difficult to characterize. Attempts to distinguish between ecoregions with the Biolog system were not successful, nor did a statistical pattern emerge between the first five principle components and the other environmental indicators. Our research suggests that some traditional public health microbial indicators may be useful in measuring the environmental condition of lotic systems.

AB  - The appraisal is strongly focussed on challenges associated with the nuclear sector, however these are representative of what is generally encountered by a range of engineering applications. Ensuring structural integrity of key nuclear plant components is essential for both safe and economic operation. Structural integrity assessments require knowledge of the mechanical and physical properties of materials, together with an understanding of mechanisms that can limit the overall operating life. With improved mechanistic understanding comes the ability to develop predictive models of the service life of components. Such models often require parameters which can be provided only by characterisation of processes occurring in situ over a range of scales, with the sub-micrometrescale being particularly important, but also challenging. This appraisal reviews the techniques currently available to characterise microstructural features at the nanometre to micrometre length-scale that can be used to elucidate mechanisms that lead to the early stages of environmentally-assisted crack formation and subsequent growth. Following an appraisal of the techniques and their application, there is a short discussion and consideration for future opportunities.

AB  - Purpose
   The aim of this study was to evaluate polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) removal in relation to the associated bacterial community composition in Ohio River sediments (USA) using field and laboratory approaches.
   Materials and methods
   PCB removal was studied in different sediment layers applying dialysis equilibrators in the field for 4 months. In parallel, dissolved chemical constituents and bacterial community composition using the 16S rDNA cloning-sequencing approach were determined within the appropriate sediment layers. The effects of several bioremediation treatments on PCB removal and bacterial community composition were evaluated in laboratory experiments. Sediments spiked with 245-2'4'5' hexachlorobiphenyl were incubated under different conditions for up to 250 days, including alternating anaerobic-aerobic conditions, amendments with electron donors, FeSO4, and incubations at different temperatures (10A degrees C, 25A degrees C, 40A degrees C).
   Results and discussion
   PCB levels remained stable in the sediment layers under field conditions. Surface sediments (0-26 cm) had elevated levels of nitrate+nitrite and sulfate, while subsurface sediments (27-35 cm) were characterized by high concentrations of ammonium, methane, and dissolved organic carbon. Oxic/anoxic conditions were also reflected in the bacterial community, with aerobic bacteria in the Bulkholderiales order enriched in the surface sediments, and anaerobic bacteria in the Clostridiales, Syntrophobacteriales, and Desulfobacterales orders more prevalent in the subsurface sediments. Although the chemical status was favorable and the potential degraders were present, PCB transformation did not take place under the prevailing environmental conditions. Under laboratory conditions, PCB transformation was positively influenced by lowered redox conditions with or without amendments with FeSO4, electron donors, or alternating anaerobic-aerobic conditions. The main PCB transformation process in all anaerobic treatments at 25A degrees C was reductive dechlorination of 245-2'4'5' hexachlorobiphenyl to 24-2'4'5' pentachlorobiphenyl and 24-2'4' tetrachlorobiphenyl, which occurred at rates between 60-85% in 177 days. Exposing sediments to air for an additional period of 100 days in the sequential anaerobic-aerobic treatment did not result in additional mineralization of PCBs. Temperature, electron donors, and redox conditions significantly affected the abundance of bacteria in the Bacteroidales, Hydrogenophilales, Pseudomonales, Myxococcales, Syntrophobacterales, Acidobacterales, Caldilineales, and Clostridiales orders. The PCB dechlorinator Dehalococcoides and other dechlorinating bacteria were detected in anaerobic sediments, including Desulfitobacterium, Desulfuromonas, Anaeromyxobacter, Geobacter, and Desulfomonile. The data suggested that shifts in the bacterial communities due to abiotic conditions affected PCB transformation, either directly (degraders) or indirectly (bacterial syntrophic associations with degraders).
   Conclusions
   The data indicated that elevated redox status and low temperature conditions accounted for stable PCB concentrations under field conditions in Ohio River sediments. In laboratory experiments, PCB removal increased under anaerobic conditions at 25A degrees C, but was not affected by other varying conditions. Depending on the environmental conditions, several bacterial groups involved in the stepwise degradation of natural organic matter to dechlorinating substrates acetate and hydrogen were prevalent in sediments, including Clostridiales, Caldilineales, Syntrophobacterales, Bacteroidales, and Acidobacteriales. Measurements of the prevailing bacterial community composition and chemical-physical properties important for PCB degradation could be valuable prior to developing PCB bioremediation strategies in sediments.

AB  - The environmental conditions in the ocean have long been considered relatively more stable through time compared to the conditions on land. Advances in sensing technologies, however, are increasingly revealing substantial fluctuations in abiotic factors over ecologically and evolutionarily relevant timescales in the ocean, leading to a growing recognition of the dynamism of the marine environment as well as new questions about how this dynamism may influence species' vulnerability to global environmental change. In some instances, the diurnal or seasonal variability in major environmental change drivers, such as temperature, pH and seawater carbonate chemistry, and dissolved oxygen, can exceed the changes expected with continued anthropogenic global change. While ocean global change biologists have begun to experimentally test how variability in environmental conditions mediates species' responses to changes in the mean, the extensive literature on species' adaptations to temporal variability in their environment and the implications of this variability for their evolutionary responses has not been well integrated into the field. Here, we review the physiological mechanisms underlying species' responses to changes in temperature, pCO(2)/pH (and other carbonate parameters), and dissolved oxygen, and discuss what is known about behavioral, plastic, and evolutionary strategies for dealing with variable environments. In addition, we discuss how exposure to variability may influence species' responses to changes in the mean conditions and highlight key research needs for ocean global change biology.

AB  - Identification of stressors related to biological impairment is critical to biological assessments. We applied nationally derived tolerance indicator values for four water-quality variables to fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at 29 sites along an urban gradient in New England. Tolerance indicator values (TIVs), as biologically based predictors of water-quality variables, were determined for dissolved oxygen, nitrite plus nitrate (nitrate), total phosphorus, and water temperature for each site based on observed biological assemblages (TIVo), and for expected assemblages (TIVE). The quotient method, based on a ratio of the TIVs for observed and expected assemblages (tolerance units), was used to diagnose potential water-quality stressors. In addition, the ratio of measured water-quality values to water-quality criteria (water-quality units) was calculated for each water-quality variable to assess measured water-quality stressors. Results from a RIVPACS predictive model for benthic macroinvertebrates and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity for fish were used to classify sites into categories of good or impaired ecological condition. Significant differences were detected between good and impaired sites for all biological tolerance units (fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages averaged) except for nitrate (P = 0.480), and for all water-quality units except for nitrate (P = 0.183). Diagnosis of water-quality stressors at selected sites was, in general, consistent with State-reported causes of impairment. Tolerance units for benthic macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages were significantly correlated for water temperature (P = 0.001, r = 0.63), dissolved oxygen (P = 0.001, r = 0.61), and total phosphorus (P = 0.001, r = 0.61), but not for nitrate (P = 0.059, r = -0.35). Differences between the two assemblages in site-specific diagnosis of water-quality stressors may be the result of differences in nitrate tolerance. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The development of multi-metric indices of chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) from disparate disturbance indicators represents a major challenge for understanding the impacts of CAD on biodiversity, especially in tropical dry areas where livelihoods of local populations are highly dependent on natural resources. We present a conceptual framework for deriving variably integrated, multi-metric measures of CAD from disparate disturbance indicators. Our framework has three steps: (1) identifying the main sources of CAD in the target region, and quantifying them using data of varying levels of spatial and intensity precision; (2) classifying the sources of disturbance into general disturbance pressures, and deriving an index for each; and (3) combining the individual disturbance pressure indices into a fully integrated index that characterizes the overall level of CAD. We apply this framework to Catimbau National Park in the Brazilian Caatinga, using 12 primary data sources to derive disturbance pressure indices relating to livestock, wood extraction and people pressure. The meaningfulness of pressure and overall CAD indices were validated by reference to variation in ant communities. Our analysis revealed notable findings. First, indirect measures from the geographic and socio-ecological context were poorly correlated with direct, field-based measurements, and were therefore of questionable reliability. Second, the three main disturbance pressures were largely independent of each other, which points to complex patterns of resource use by local communities. Third, different weightings of component disturbance pressure indices had little influence on the Global index, making our Global CAD index somewhat insensitive to assessments of the relative importance of different disturbance pressures. Finally, our results caution against a reliance on multivariate ordination to derive integrated indices of disturbance from disparate data sources. Our multi-scale integration of disturbance data can facilitate the analysis of the resource use effects on biodiversity, contributing to effective conservation management and sustainable livelihood development.

AB  - Direct monitoring of air quality does not cover more than the last three decades in most industrialized countries. For that reason studies using growth-ring carbon isotopes (delta C-13) of several species of trees have recently investigated isotopic responses in the contexts of stationary and diffuse pollution in humid continental conditions. Here, the growth-ring delta C-13 series (1880-2009) of spruce trees living in sub-humid subarctic conditions were measured to assess if they represent indicators for air quality changes near oil sands (OS) developments initiated in northeastern Alberta in 1967. The measured delta C-13 pre-operation rings at two forest sites were analyzed along local climatic conditions to develop response-to-climate statistical models and predict the natural isotopic behaviour for the most recent part of the ring series. The measured trends and climate-modelled (natural) delta C-13 values strongly depart during the operation period, depicting anomalies which can be nicely reproduced by multiple regression models combining climate and a proxy for OS airborne emissions. This research allows envisioning the use of carbon dendroisotopic indicators to compensate for the lack of long-term air quality measurement, and monitor environmental conditions in the sub-humid terrestrial ecosystem exposed to emissions from oil sands operations which are predicted to increase in the future.

AB  - This paper reports on a process for selecting a suite of indicators that, in combination, can be useful in assessing the ecological conditions of rangelands. Conceptual models that depict the structural and functional properties of ecological processes were used to show the linkages between ecological components and their importance in assessing the status and trends of ecological resources on a regional scale. Selection criteria were developed so that relationships could be assessed at different spatial scales using ground and aerial measurements. Parameters including responsiveness and sensitivity to change, quality assurance and control, temporal and spatial variability, cost-effectiveness and statistical design played an important role in determining how indicators were selected. A total of ten indicator categories were selected by a committee of scientists for evaluation in the program. A subset that included soil properties, vegetation composition and abundance, and spectral properties was selected for evaluation in a pilot test conducted in 1992 in the Colorado Plateau region of the southwestern United States. This work is part of a major effort being undertaken by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its collaborators to assess the condition of rangelands (primarily comprised of arid, semi-arid and dry subhumid ecosystems) along with seven other ecosystem groups (forests, agricultural lands, wetlands, surface waters, landscapes, estuaries and Great Lakes) as part of a national Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP). The indicator selection process reported upon was developed to support EMAP's goal of providing long-term, policy-relevant research focusing on evaluating the ecological condition (or health) of regional and national resources.

AB  - Understanding effects of recent climate warming and changes in catchment conditions on nutrient cycling and the biology of shallow subarctic lakes is necessary to predict their evolution. Here, we use multiple analytical methods on sediment cores to identify effects of change in catchment conditions on nutrient availability and biotic assemblages in two subarctic lakes on the Seward Peninsula (Alaska, USA). We compare limnological and biotic responses to flooding and expansion of a thermokarst lake basin (late 1950s), increased shrub growth in the catchment of another lake (since the mid-1980s), and regional warming (since the late 1970s). Among these three environmental drivers, the largest biotic responses occurred because of flooding and expansion of the thermokarst lake. An increase in the nitrogen isotope composition and decline in organic carbon isotope composition in sediments are interpreted to reflect an elevated supply of dissolved inorganic carbon and nitrogen. This was associated with significant shifts in composition of chironomid and diatom assemblages. In contrast, increases in particulate organic carbon and nitrogen from enhanced shrub growth had less influence on the biota. Declines in cold-water biotic indicators typical of warming lakes in Arctic regions occurred several decades after catchment-induced changes to the nutrient supply in both systems. This indicates that initial lake catchment condition may mediate lake-specific changes in nutrient cycling and aquatic productivity within regions undergoing warming.

AB  - Critics of SRI have said little about the integrity of corporate representations resulting in screening inclusion or exclusion. This is surprising given social and environmental accounting research that finds corporate posturing and deception in the absence of external verification, and a parallel body of literature describing corporate "greenwashing" and other forms of corporate disinformation. In this paper I argue that the problems and challenges of ensuring fair and accurate corporate social reporting mirror those accompanying corporate compliance with law. Similarities and points of convergence between social reporting and corporate compliance are discussed, along with proposals for reform.

AB  - The flow regime of the Wimmera River was substantially modified due to the construction of a water supply reservoir. Samples of diatoms and soft algae and measurements of water quality were analysed at ten sampling sites for 3 years (between February 2012 and November 2014) along the MacKenzie River, a tributary of the Wimmera River, in different seasons and under different flow regimes, to understand the spatial and temporal variation in the relationship between algal communities, water quality and stream condition. Baseline information on algal communities and water quality was collected during base flow conditions, while experiments on the effect of water releases on algal communities were based on flow regime variations (manipulated flow regimes), specifically on the algae community structure, water quality and ecosystem function. Algal species composition changed along the river under different flow regimes and different seasons. Under base flow, Bacillariophyta (diatoms) were more abundant upstream, and filamentous green algae were more abundant downstream. The results showed that the algal composition shifted downstream after water release events. Chlorophyta (green algae), Cyanophyta (blue-green algae) and Chrysophyta gradually increased from upstream to downstream under base flow conditions and before water releases, whereas diatoms were greater upstream and increased downstream after water releases. The results are presented to tailor discharge and duration of the river flows by amalgamation of consumptive and environmental flows to improve the condition of the stream thereby supplementing the flows dedicated to environmental outcomes.

AB  - This critical review examines the definition and implementation of environmental protection goals for chemicals in current European Union (EU) legislation, guidelines, and international agreements to which EU countries are party. The European chemical industry is highly regulated, and prospective environmental risk assessments (ERAs) are tailored for different classes of chemical, according to their specific hazards, uses, and environmental exposure profiles. However, environmental protection goals are often highly generic, requiring the prevention of "unacceptable" or "adverse" impacts on "biodiversity" and "ecosystems" or the "environment as a whole." This review aims to highlight working examples, challenges, solutions, and best practices for defining specific protection goals (SPGs), which are seen to be essential for refining and improving ERA. Specific protection goals hinge on discerning acceptable versus unacceptable adverse effects on the key attributes of relevant, sensitive ecological entities (ranging from organisms to ecosystems). Some isolated examples of SPGs for terrestrial and aquatic biota can be found in prospective ERA guidance for plant protection products (PPPs). However, SPGs are generally limited to environmental or nature legislation that requires environmental monitoring and retrospective ERA. This limitation is due mainly to the availability of baselines, which define acceptable versus unacceptable environmental effects on the key attributes of sentinel species, populations and/or communities, such as reproductive status, abundance, or diversity. Nevertheless, very few regulatory case examples exist in which SPGs incorporate effect magnitude, spatial extent, and temporal duration. We conclude that more holistic approaches are needed for defining SPGs, particularly with respect to protecting population sustainability, ecosystem function, and integrity, which are implicit in generic protection goals and explicit in the International Programme for Chemical Safety (IPCS) definition of "adverse effect." A possible solution, which the chemical industry is currently assessing, is wider application of the ecosystem services approach proposed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for the risk assessment of PPPs.

AB  - For the European Parliament and Commission to implement the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the water-quality indices that are currently used in Europe need to be compared and calibrated. This will facilitate the comparative assessment of ecological status throughout the European Union. According to the WFD, biologic indices should respond consistently to human impacts, using multimetric approaches and water-quality classification boundaries adjusted to a common set of normative definitions. The European Commission has started an intercalibration exercise to review biologic indices and harmonize class boundaries. We used data from rivers in Spain to compare the IBMWP (Iberian Biological Monitoring Working Party) index, which is commonly used by water authorities in Spain and by several research centers, with the Intercalibration Common Multimetric Index (ICM-Star), which was used as a standard in the intercalibration exercise. We also used data from Spanish rivers to compare the multimetric indices ICM-7 (based on quantitative data) and ICM-9 (based on qualitative data) with the IBMWP. ICM-7 and ICM-9 were proposed by the Mediterranean Geographical Intercalibration Group (Med-GIG). Additionally, we evaluated two new multimetric indices, developed specifically for macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting Mediterranean river systems. One of these is based on quantitative data (ICM-10), while the other is based on qualitative data (ICM-11a). The results show that the IBMWP index responds well to the stressor gradient present in our data, and correlates well with ICM-Star. Moreover, the IBMWP quality class boundaries were consistent with the intercalibration requirements of the WFD. However, multimetric indices showed a more linear relation with the stressor gradient in our data, and less variation in reference values. In addition, they may provide more statistical power for detecting potential environmental impacts. Multimetric indices produced similar results for quantitative and qualitative data. Thus, ICM-10 (also named IMMi-T) and ICM-11a (also named IMMi-L) indices could be used to meet European Commission requirements for assessing the water quality in Spanish Mediterranean rivers.

AB  - Modal frequency is an important indicator for structural health assessment. Previous studies have shown that this indicator is substantially affected by the fluctuation of ambient conditions, such as temperature and humidity. Therefore, recognizing the pattern between modal frequency and ambient conditions is necessary for reliable long-term structural health assessment. In this article, a novel machine-learning algorithm is proposed to automatically select relevance features in modal frequency-ambient condition pattern recognition based on structural dynamic response and ambient condition measurement. In contrast to the traditional feature selection approaches by examining a large number of combinations of extracted features, the proposed algorithm conducts continuous relevance feature selection by introducing a sophisticated hyperparameterization on the weight parameter vector controlling the relevancy of different features in the prediction model. The proposed algorithm is then utilized for structural health assessment for a reinforced concrete building based on 1-year daily measurements. It turns out that the optimal model class including the relevance features for each vibrational mode is capable to capture the pattern between the corresponding modal frequency and the ambient conditions.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is a measure of the deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry, and has been used across mammals as a reliable indicator of environmental stress during growth and development. Antler size and symmetry can be an indicator of individual fitness and social rank among ungulates such as the North American elk Cervus elaphus. When environmental conditions are favourable, ungulates allocate additional resources to antler development to increase secondary Sexual traits and enhance reproduction. We tested whether there was an appreciable change in antler length and the number of points as extreme climatic conditions (e.g. heavy snow and drought) reduced the nutritional condition of elk using 8,690 antler measurements collected at hunter check stations in south-central Montana surrounding the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) during 1982-2006. We also hypothesized that FA in elk antlers would increase at high elk density because of density-dependent competition for food. We developed a priori general linear models of FA expressed as a function of climate covariates, elk density and relevant ecological interactions between the variables. In contrast to previous studies, especially of European ungulates, our results show little support for strong effects of climate or density oil FA in length or the number of points. Thus, North American elk do not appear to respond to environmental variation by varying allocation to antler growth, instead they show stronger age-related effects oil FA.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the impact of treated wastewaters on native wild Prussian carp inhabiting effluent-receiving waters (ERC) receiving municipal and sugar plant treated wastewaters, further downstream waters (DW), and a detached canal unaffected by the WWTP activities. To that end, general fish health status was determined, including plasma biochemical, haematological, oxidative stress and tissue histopathological indices, over three seasons. The greatest tissue alterations were in fall in ERC during sugar beet processing, as hypertrophy of gill epithelial and interlamellar cells, necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration, hyperplasia and hypertrophy of renal tubules, distention of hepatic sinusoids. In fall the lowest leukocytes, lymphocytes and granulocytes (2467 +/- 565, 1333 +/- 264, 1133 +/- 488 cells/mu L respectively), as well as highest plasma ALP (52.7 +/- 19.39 U/L) were measured. ERC in fall had the highest ammonium (20 mg/L), nitrite (1.48 mg/L), nitrate (13.4 mg/L), and lowest dissolved O-2 (1.23 mg/L). Gill, kidney and liver alterations, and the highest plasma cholesterol (9.1 +/- 1.98 mmol/L) were noted in DW fish in fall. Tissue morphology during sugar cane processing seems a consequence of cellular and structural tissue integrity loss. Structural heterogeneity of gills and spleen was enhanced with increasing concentrations of heavy metals and correlated with oxidative stress (SOD 392.5 +/- 77.28 U/L). Monogenean infestation was moderate in ERC fish in all seasons compared with DW fish. Prussian carp biological responses to multiple stressors, measured by the effects of WWTP on blood and tissue parameters, reached far downstream and were not of localized nature. This study demonstrated that in aquatic environments impacted with complex contaminants acting synergistically, causal relationships between biological responses and environmental stressors should be interpreted. Integrated histopathological, haematological and biochemical findings are valuable biomarkers for native fish adaptive patterns and monitoring of water quality/pollution of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - We examined responses of benthic macroinvertebrate communities to natural geothermal discharges in 32 streams in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), USA. Geothermal discharges played a major role in structuring benthic communities in YNP, as downstream communities were characterized by low species richness, reduced abundance of EPT taxa and increased abundance of tolerant caddisflies (Trichoptera), chironomids and non-insects. While some taxa were a subset of tolerant organisms that were also common at references sites, others (the damselfly Argia sp., the caddisfly Oxyethira sp. and the exotic New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum Gray 1843) were found almost exclusively in geothermal streams. Because geothermal waters are a common feature of YNP, monitoring programs designed to assess long-term status and trends of Yellowstone's aquatic ecosystems must account for the influence of these discharges. To separate geothermal effects from other potential anthropogenic disturbances in YNP (e.g., atmospheric deposition, road construction, wastewater, global change), we developed a multimetric index based on responses of benthic communities to geothermal discharges. Streams were placed into one of four geothermal categories based on conductivity (reference = < 150 mu S/cm; low, moderate and high = 151-300, 301-600 and > 600 mu S/cm, respectively). The index clearly distinguished among these categories and showed a well-defined threshold response to geothermal effects at very low levels of conductivity. Although the index was specific to geothermal effects, the approach used to develop the index has broad applicability for other systems where impacts of stressors must be assessed within the context of natural environmental gradients. Our findings may provide important insights into how benthic macroinvertebrate communities respond to global change. Reduced discharge and warmer temperatures predicted for Rocky Mountain streams may favor the establishment and expansion of exotic species such as New Zealand mudsnails (P. antipodarum), which are highly tolerant of geothermal influences.

AB  - Monitoring of benthic invertebrates in streams receiving acidic metal-contaminated water over an 18-yr period revealed both degraded conditions and recovery along a network of downstream locations. Compared with reference streams, and over the course of clean-up remediation efforts below an abandoned open-pit sulfur mine in the central Sierra Nevada of California, improving water quality was accompanied by recovery of benthic communities at some sites. Years of high flow resulted in degraded biological status when acid mine drainage capture was incomplete and metal loading had increased with runoff. Seasonal patterns of recovery evident in the fall after the summer treatment season reverted in the next spring after overwinter periods when sources were not captured. As the metal load has been reduced, phased recovery of community structure, function, and similarity progressed toward that of reference assemblage taxonomic composition. From impacted communities dominated by relatively tolerant midges, reassembly involved an increase in density, return of long-lived taxa, an increased ratio of sensitive-to-tolerant forms, then overall diversity and community composition, and eventually large predators and grazers reappearing along with mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly richness. Threshold effect levels defined using several analysis methods showed that the response range of biological indicators corresponds to US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines of predicted effects utilizing cumulative criterion units (CCUs) of metal toxicity (i.e., CCU approximate to 1). All sites have shown improved function with increased density of some or all trophic groups over time. Although recovery is progressing, year-around treatment may be necessary to fully restore biological integrity in streams nearest the mine. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2575-2592. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB  - A key question in sustainable development is how much alteration in natural systems, such as river basins, is acceptable? One of the ways by which humans alter a river basin is by building water storage infrastructure. While storage reservoirs deliver numerous benefits, they can also induce social and environmental costs by displacing people, fragmenting river networks and altering downstream flow regimes. In such a context, merely capping total water withdrawal from rivers for human consumption is not sufficient. River basin plans should also identify optimal (acceptable) limits to surface storage capacities, and optimal numbers, degrees of distribution and locations of storage infrastructure. It remains largely unclear, however, whether it is possible to define a hydrologically, ecologically and socially justified 'surface water storage boundary' for a river basin. An associated question is what would be the 'best' arrangement of this bounding storage capacity in the basins river network (in terms of numbers, sizes and locations of reservoirs) to maximize water storage benefits and minimize environmental and social costs. The main objective of this review is to examine contemporary knowledge on surface water storage development with a focus on tools and approaches that may help to answer the above questions of a 'surface water storage boundary' and its 'optimum arrangement' for a river basin. In order to achieve this objective, our review introduces two novel concepts: the 'storage scale' and the 'sustainable storage development framework.' The 'storage scale' has four elements - capacity, number, distribution and location - individual scales that help visualize a 'surface water storage boundary' and its 'optimum arrangement' for a typical river basin. The 'sustainable storage development framework' consists of three dimensions - economic benefits, ecosystems and society- and a set of indicators quantifying each dimension. This review shows that optimal levels of the elements of the 'storage scale' may be identified using the 'sustainable storage development framework'.

AB  - Massive use of beaches has forced traditional management of these systems to focus on the service offer to users. Consequently, human activity and behavior prevailed over other biological and physical processes and functions. Mirroring this tendency, the use of Performance Awards (Blue Flag) and Environmental/Quality Management Systems (ISO 14001, EMAS, and Q of Quality) were popularized as standards of environmental quality. In parallel to this process, recent international coastal and marine policies have emphasized the need to develop sustainable strategies for implementing the principles of the Ecosystem Approach into management with the overarching goal to maintain ecosystem integrity while enabling the sustainable use of ecosystem goods and services in systems under management. As Performance Awards and Environmental/Quality Management Systems do not follow the Ecosystem Approach, an Ecosystem-Based Management System for beaches (EBMS-Beaches) is introduced to overcome this issue. The EBMS-Beaches is intended as a formal standard framework that add new aspects not considered in a classical beach management process by the introduction of the principles of the Ecosystem Approach, between them: a) a clear vision-driven process; b) a holistic approach from a geographical perspective; c) pressure analysis and institutional coordination inside clear participatory planning; d) use of risk management techniques in planning; e) the ecosystem service concept as the central piece of the system; f) use of the DPSWR as accountable framework of indicators, g) desired vision based on state indicators and using BQI partial indices; and h) timely participation by local population. The EBMS is structured along three pillars (managerial, informative and participatory pillars) working in an adaptive management way. Based on these three pillars, existing management practices can be standardized into a viable, systematic means of implementing, in an integrated way, the new international policies for beach social-ecological systems. An initial experience of EBMS implementation in a particular beach (S'Abanell beach, Girona-Catalonia, Northwestern Mediterranean) has been initiated and it is presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 1. Lotic ecosystems worldwide are being increasingly modified hydromorphologically, for example, by damming, fragmentation, flow regulation and channel modification. Serious threats to riverine biodiversity are suspected, yet available field data are few and rarely address the various taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic components of biodiversity.
   2. We examined benthic macroinvertebrate diversity along a gradient of hydromorphological alteration across 65 lowland river sites in the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. We calculated eight metrics describing taxonomic diversity (richness, rarefied richness, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity, Pielou's evenness), functional diversity (mean trait diversity) and phylogenetic diversity (mean taxonomic distinctness and its variance).
   3. Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) showed detailed changes in taxonomic and trait composition, respectively, with increasing hydromorphological alteration. TITAN revealed a gradual turnover under increasing impact in which taxon losses were almost balanced by gains. NMS illustrated a high degree of concordance in the traits possessed by the taxa lost and gained at the gradient's end points.
   4. Although a biologically meaningful hydromorphological gradient was evident, the biodiversity response was modest (Spearman's <|0.32| for all metrics). Pielou's evenness and mean taxonomic distinctness actually increased at impaired sites.
   5. Our results suggest that taxonomic and trait replacement with hydromorphological alteration is not followed by changes in whole-community diversity. This implies some redundancy in these systems, with ecologically similar species replacing those lost through environmental change.
   6. The results highlight how whole-community-based diversity, although frequently calculated and interpreted for decades in ecology and conservation biology, is not the all-purpose concept to detect and assess the various facets of biodiversity loss. Therefore, we suggest that concerted effort is needed to develop and test novel indicators of biodiversity, capable of detecting biodiversity loss, or other changes, in response to the main environmental stressors of lotic ecosystems.

AB  - In shallow estuaries, artificial substrates provide a means of assessing the response of the diatom community to water chemistry. The shallow St Lucia Estuary was historically connected to the Mfolozi River at the mouth. This connection was severed during the early 1950s due to sediment input from the agriculturally impacted Mfolozi River. A connection has recently been re-established and the potential impact of dissolved inorganic nutrients from the Mfolozi River needs to be determined, as it may alter the ecological integrity of the St Lucia Estuary which forms part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This study found that the epilithic algal biomass and diatom species composition grown on glass slides were good indicators of nutrient enrichment in the estuary. Over a 28-day study period an above-average rainfall event resulted in an increase of nutrient-enriched freshwater flow into the estuary. No significant biomass differences were recorded in either the natural phytoplankton or microphytobenthos communities because of high variability. By contrast, the epilithic algal biomass accumulation on the glass slides was highest following the freshwater input. Statistical analyses indicated that the accumulation of the epilithic community on the glass slides was mostly affected by DIN and salinity. Diversity index scores for both the natural phytoplankton and microphytobenthos were variable, while the epilithic diatom index scores consistently declined from Day 7 (H' = 1.2) to Day 28 (H'= 0.7). These data indicate that epilithic algae grown on glass slides can be used as an effective monitoring tool to detect nutrient-induced changes as a supplementary method in this highly variable estuary.

AB  - A critical review of the definition of "food security" (FS) in the context of the views of economists was conducted. The main indicators were analysed that make it possible to determine the actual food security level of the country and the region. Justified the necessity of establishing food security as a priority goal of state policy. The food security of Ukraine was considered as a derivative of anthropogenic loading on the natural environment. The aim of the article. The purpose of this study is a critical review of scientific works on the problems of assessing the food security level, calculation of food security indicators with the established rational norms of food consumption in order to analyse the existing food security system of the Ukrainian Black Sea region and the peculiarities of its development. The subject of the study is theoretical bases, methodological approaches and practical recommendations for the definition of the existing system of indicators of food security and their thresholds for foreign values. Methodology. The methodological and theoretical foundations of the research are the scientific positions of economic theory, agro-food complex, planning and forecasting, scientific publications of domestic and foreign scientists in various spheres of economic science. In order to achieve the conceptual integrity of the work, general scientific and special methods were used: analysis and synthesis - for the comprehensive study of food safety processes; systematization to identify the conditions, factors of providing food security; statistical - for generalization, systematization, and revealing of development tendencies of phenomena and processes connected with food safety of the region; graphic for the visual display of the regularities of the change of food security indicators. Results. The conducted research indicates an improvement of the status of food safety indicators. The negative aspect is the ineffective state regulation of foreign trade, the conditions for the effective development of the food market are not created, and there are no favourable conditions for increasing the production volumes of the main agricultural products types. Value/originality. The methodology for determining the indicators for assessing the state of food security, which exist at present, requires new approaches and improvements. The conducted research allowed the authors to combine indicators into groups. The research has shown that for the sake of a comprehensive, complete analysis of the state of food security, it is necessary to take into account the indicators: socio-economic, which take into account such components as level and quality of life, solvency of the population, demographic factor; macroeconomic, such as gross aggregate product, gross domestic product, personal income, because the problem is systemic and related to the development of the country and its individual regions. From the author's point of view, from the strategic perspective, Ukraine should make the transition to the food safety indicators proposed by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS). This will allow an assessment of the real state of food security, which was formed in the regions and in the country as a whole, and urgently take appropriate action to improve it.

AB  - High variability in soil-moisture conditions is typical for semi-arid forest-steppe ecosystems where precipitation varies greatly over time. Plant species that inhabit these environments integrate responses to broadly fluctuating wetness conditions. Indirect assessment of contrasting habitat wetness based on plant indicator values, species frequency, and species coverage was carried out in two sites representing the larch (Larix sibirica) and pine (PinUS sylveStriS) forest-steppe communities. For the larch forest-steppe, we found that plant community composition and spatial structure depended strongly on wetness. In addition, we found that the vegetation was clearly differentiated into forest stands and steppe communities, depending on the slope aspect. There was also a strong correlation between dissimilarities of species composition and differences in habitat wetness revealed in the larch forest-steppe. In contrast, soil properties, such as gravel and stone content were found to be a key factor in the spatial distribution of plant species composition in the pine-forest-steppe communities. Indirect assessment of moisture conditions in the forest-steppe habitats, based on the field-layer plant species, was found to be preferable for indicating soil water deficits in the forest. Furthermore, as long-term observational data is often lacking, indirect assessment of the forest-steppe vegetation provides an opportunity to identify vulnerable forests at the marginal distribution. Based on indirect assessments of soil-moisture conditions, and taking into account differences in potential drought resistance between larch and pine forests, we concluded that increasing aridity will cause the replacement of Siberian larch by Scots pine in the South Siberian forest-steppe landscape. Consequently, in the future it is likely that forest-steppe typological diversity will decrease, and the semi-arid landscape may become more monotonous. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal lagoons are complex systems, with considerable habitat heterogeneity and often subject: to high temporal dynamics, which constitutes a great challenge for ecological assessment programs. For defining reference conditions for benthic invertebrates, under the EU Water Framework Directive objectives, historical data from the Ria Formosa leaky lagoon (wet surface area of about 105 km(2)) located in Southern Portugal was used. The influence of habitat features, such as channel depth, sediment type and seagrass cover, on the expression of these biological communities, was inferred by analyzing subtidal data collected at stations with different environmental characteristics. Such heterogeneity effect was analyzed at the community compositional and structural levels, and also for three indices in the multimetric Benthic Assessment Tool (BAT). This tool for the assessment of ecological status include; the Margalef index, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). Significant variations associated with environmental features were reflected on specific reference conditions at four habitats in the lagoon. After habitat calibration, the Benthic Assessment Tool (BAT) revealed that, in general and for the period of time covered by this historical data set, the status of the lagoon corresponded to a good ecological condition, which is mainly due to its high water renewal rate. Such classification is in accordance with the majority of studies at the lagoon. However, at punctual sites with human induced high water residence times, significantly lower BAT values were registered. Such community degradation can be associated with physical stress due to salinity increase and to a degradation of water quality, with occurrence of occasional dystrophic crisis, triggered by low water renewal. Habitat differentiation was a crucial step for a correct evaluation of the ecological condition of invertebrate communities across the lagoonal system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is often desirable to describe the rate and manner in which structures deteriorate when subjected to random excitation. Oftentimes, structural deterioration is reflected by variations in the system's stiffness or equivalently, natural frequency. This paper compares the performance of two continuous structural integrity assessment techniques in monitoring variations in the natural frequency of single degree-of-freedom systems when subjected to random loads. The first technique makes use of the Fourier transform and the second is an adaptive finite-impulse-response technique developed by the authors. The effectiveness and limitations of the techniques are evaluated using numerically simulated single degree-of-freedom vibratory systems subjected to random base excitation. The influence of damping, noise, and damage progression type (sudden and gradual) is evaluated and the results compared. The results show that, despite a greater sensitivity to noise and damping ratio, the digital finite-impulse-response technique is able to more precisely determine the natural frequency of the system and the time at which any changes occurred for a range of damage scenarios and extraneous noise levels when compared to the more conventional Fourier-based analysis techniques. This is significant as it allows for the accurate measurement of stiffness for systems that undergo rapid structural deterioration under random loading.

AB  - Industrial harbours are a complex interface between environmental, economic and social systems. Trying to manage the social and economic needs of the community while maintaining the integrity of environmental ecosystems is complicated, as is the identification and evaluation of the various factors that underpin the drivers of economic, community and resource condition. An increasingly popular strategy to deal with the identification and evaluation challenges in complex human-environmental systems is to use a report card system which can be used as a summary assessment tool to monitor the health of aquatic ecosystems. To date though these have largely focused on environmental factors, and it is only very recently that attempts are being made to include social, cultural and economic indicators. There has been limited consensus in the selection of social and economic indicators applied in different aquatic report cards but as recreation is such an important activity, typically some measure of recreation benefit is included. However, there has been no commonality in the measures applied to assess its performance as an economic indicator.
   This paper is focused on the assessment of recreational benefits as an indicator of economic value in the report card for Gladstone Harbour in Queensland, Australia. It is the first aquatic health report card to include an assessment of the nonmarket value of recreation which makes it a more comprehensive indicator of economic value compared to other report cards based on measures of employment, participation or expenditure. There have now been three consecutive years of reporting (2014-2016) of the Gladstone Harbour report card, and the results indicate that the recreation index appears to be effective in monitoring changes over time.

AB  - Groundwater depletion threatens many riparian ecosystems in arid and semiarid regions of the world. The aquifer that sustains Arizona's San Pedro River riparian ecosystem, for example, is threatened by regional groundwater declines and localized pumping from the alluvial aquifer. This paper demonstrates the important role of shallow groundwater in structuring the San Pedro River plant community, portions of which function as reference areas that indicate site potential for a globally rare forest type (Sonoran riparian Populus-Salix forests). Several ecological indicators varied with depth to groundwater, including a weighted average wetland indicator score calculated for herbaceous and woody plant species, cover of plants within wetland indicator groups, and frequency of indicator plant species. These relationships can be used in a space-for-time substitution to predict consequences of groundwater decline. For example, the wetland indicator score changed sharply as depth to groundwater ranged from 0 to 4 m, and abundance of obligate wetland herbs (the group most sensitive to groundwater changes) declined sharply at groundwater depths below approximate to 0.25 m. Such sequential ''desertification'' of the riparian flora (i.e., loss or reduction in cover of species based on their probability of occurrence in wetlands) is one predicted response to groundwater decline. Other predicted impacts of groundwater decline include reduced establishment of Populus fremontii-Salix gooddingii forests, and reduced cover of herbaceous species associated with the fine-textured soils and shady conditions of floodplain terraces stabilized by these early seral tree species. High floodplain terraces (depth to groundwater of 5-8 m) had wetland indicator scores below those of upland sites and were vegetated by species (e.g., Prosopis velutina and Sporabolus wiightii) with low sensitivity to groundwater changes.

AB  - Variability in the spatial distribution of nematode communities in relation to the structural heterogeneity of the environment was studied in nine different microhabitats within a relatively small area of a natural oak forest in Bulgaria. Maturity and diversity indices, trophic structure and the distribution of colonizer-persister groups were applied to analyze the quality of substrate and ecological processes involved from a functional point of view. Two main groups of nematode communities, below- and above-ground, were distinguished in terms of the location of the microhabitats. Our results indicated a higher percentage similarity between nematode communities inhabiting microhabitats with a higher resemblance in substrate structure, and abiotic and biotic conditions than between microhabitats with more dissimilar microenvironmental conditions. The application of Detrended Correspondence Analysis helped to reveal two ecological gradients. The first one was from microhabitats characterized by smaller fluctuations in microclimatic conditions and nutrient supply to microhabitats with more adverse abiotic conditions and dynamics of food resources. Along this gradient from below- to above-ground microhabitats, the proportion of general opportunists (cp 2 taxa) increased, whereas the diversity, MI and the proportions of persisters (cp (3-5) taxa), decreased. Along the second gradient a gradual decrease in the decomposition rate within above-ground microhabitats was revealed, which was indicated by the proportion of enrichment opportunists (cp I taxa). The nematode communities of decaying wood had the most specific cp groups' distribution characterized by a high proportion of enrichment opportunists (colonizers). Each microhabitat has developed nematode communities with a characteristic trophic structure that was related to the relative importance of primary production and decomposition processes occurring within the microhabitat. The nematode communities of mosses growing on soil, stones and tree trunks had similar trophic structure dominated by bacterial-feeding nematode taxa. Our results supported the role of nematode communities as potential indicators of environmental conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relative impact of lichen photobiont and mycobiont was evaluated by submitting nine lichen species with: (i) different photobiont types; (ii) different lichen growth forms; and (iii) different nutrients, pH, humidity preferences; to a range of Cu concentrations (mu M) supplied in repeated cycles to simulate the natural process of uptake under field conditions. The physiological performance of the photosystem II photochemical reactions was measured using F-v/F-m, and the metabolic activity of the mycobiont was evaluated using ergosterol and intracellular K-loss as indicators. Lichens with higher cation exchange capacity showed higher intracellular Cu uptake and their ecology seemed to be associated with low-nutrient environments. Thus the wall and external matrix, mainly characteristic of the mycobiont partner, cannot be ignored as the first site of interaction of metals with lichens. No common intracellular Cu concentration threshold was found for the physiological impacts observed in the different species. Most physiological effects of Cu uptake in sensitive lichens occurred for intracellular Cu below 200 mu g/g dw whereas more tolerant species were able to cope with intracellular Cu at least 3 times higher. Cyanobacterial lichens showed to be more sensitive to Cu uptake than green-algal lichens. Within the Trebouxia lichens, different species showed different sensitivities to Cu uptake, suggesting that the mycobiont may change the microenvironment close to the photobiont partner providing different degrees of protection. Despite the fact that the photobiont is the productive partner, the metabolic activity of the mycobiont of lichen species adapted to environments rich in nutrients, showed to be more sensitive to Cu uptake than the photochemical performance of the photobiont.

AB  - Quantifying ecological condition, notably the extent of forest degradation is important for understanding and designing measures to protect biodiversity and enhancing the capacity of forests to deliver ecosystem services. Conservation planning, particularly the prioritization of management interventions for forests, is often lacking spatial data on forest degradation, and it is often overlooked within decision-making processes. We develop a continuous metric termed Forest Condition (FC) which aims to measure the degree of forest degradation on a scale from 0 to 100, incorporating the temporal history of forest change over any spatial extent. We parameterize this metric based on estimated changes in above ground biomass in the context of forest fragmentation over time to estimate a continuous measure of forest degradation for Congo Basin countries. We estimate that just <70% of Congo Basin forests remain fully intact, a decrease from 78% in the year 2000. FC was validated by direct remote sensing measurements from Landsat imagery for DRC. Results showed that FC was significantly positively correlated with forest canopy cover, gap area per hectare, and magnitude of temporal change in Normalized Burn Ratio. We tested the ability of FC to distinguish primary and secondary degradation and deforestation and found significant differences in gap area and spectral anomalies to validate our theoretical model. We apply the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria to demonstrate the integration of forest condition to assess the risk of ecosystem collapse. Based on this assessment, we found that without including FC in the assessment of biotic disruption, 12 ecosystems representing over 11% of forested area in 2015 would not have been assigned a threat status, and an additional 9 ecosystems would have a lower threat status. Our overall assessment of ecosystems found about half of all Congo Basin ecosystem types, accounting for 20% of all forest area are threatened to some degree, including 4 ecosystems (<1% of total area) which are critically engendered. FC is a transferrable and scalable assessment to support forest monitoring, planning, and management.

AB  - Land uses such as forestry and agriculture are presumed to degrade the biodiversity of riparian wetlands in the northern temperate regions of the United States. In order to improve land use decision making in this landscape, floral and faunal communities of 15 riparian wetlands associated with low-order streams were related to their surrounding land cover to establish which organismal groups are affected by anthropogenic disturbance and whether these impacts are scale-specific. Study sites were chosen to represent a gradient of disturbance. Vascular plants of wet meadow and shrub carr communities, aquatic macro-invertebrates, amphibians, fish and birds were surveyed, and total abundance, species richness and Shannon diversity were calculated. For each site, anthropogenic disturbances were evaluated at local and landscape scales (500, 1000, 2500 and 5000 m from the site and the site catchment) from field surveys and a geographic information system (GIS). Land use data were grouped into six general land use types: urban, cultivated, rangeland, forest, wetland and water: Shrub carr vegetation, bird and fish diversity and richness generally decrease with increasing cultivation in the landscape. Amphibian abundance decreases and fish abundance increases as the proportions of open water and rangeland increases; bird diversity and richness increase with forest and wetland extent in the landscape. Wet meadow vegetation, aquatic macro-invertebrates, amphibians and fish respond to local disturbances or environmental conditions. Shrub carr vegetation, amphibians and birds are influenced by land use at relatively small landscape scales (500 and 1000 m), and fish respond to land use at larger landscape scales (2500, 5000 m and the catchment). Effective conservation planning for these riparian wetlands requires assessment of multiple organismal groups, different types of disturbance and several spatial scales. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the topographically induced pattern of ground vegetation in managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands on inland dunes and to link the pattern to the spatial variation of environmental agents (microclimatic and soil conditions). The study was conducted in the Torun Basin (N. Poland), which is located in one of the biggest inland dune fields of the European sand belt. We investigated ground vegetation in 151 plots situated in 3 topographical variants (intra-dune depressions, north- and south-facing dune slopes). Environmental variables were examined in the 3 studied relief positions both with indirect (Ellenberg Indicator Values - EIVs) and direct approaches (measurements of air temperature and humidity as well as soil temperature and moisture). The relationship between the pattern of species composition and environmental controls was investigated using redundancy analysis (RDA).
   We evaluated the persistence of topographic patterns under the potentially homogenizing influence of forest plantations by sampling pine stands at different stages of growth. Intra-dune depressions were revealed as positions of the highest richness in herbaceous species. This was primarily linked to soil fertility and secondarily to moisture, which were both higher in these positions than on both slope aspects. The affinity of the species richness to low-situated locations was the strongest in mid age classes of pine stands, where stress conditions, resulting mainly from shadowing, were of the highest importance for understory throughout the stand development. However, the results showed that finally in old-growth stands, typical herbaceous species appeared for each of the studied topographical positions. Our study showed that intra-dune depressions could be used in forest management to introduce admixtures of broadleaved species into extensive pine mono-stands. This potentially could increase ecological stability of pine stands growing on inland dunes as well as support forest productivity of such ecosystems.

AB  - Eutrophication and acidification are among the major stressors on freshwater ecosystems in northern Europe and North America, but possible consequences of interactions between pH and nutrients on ecological status assessment and species richness patterns have not previously been assessed. Using data from 52 river sites throughout Norway, we investigated the combined effects of pH and nutrients on benthic algae assemblages, specifically 1) taxa-specific couplings between nutrient and acidity traits, 2) the degree of consistency between different biotic indices, separately for nutrients and acid conditions, 3) the impact of pH on nutrient indices and phosphorus on indices of acid conditions, and 4) the impact of pH and phosphorus supply on diatom and non-diatom taxon richness. We found that 1) acid-tolerant taxa are generally associated with nutrient-poor conditions, with only a few exceptions; this is probably more a consequence of habitat availability than reflecting true ecological niches; 2) correlation coefficients between nutrient indices and TP, as well as acid conditions indices and pH were barely affected when the confounding factor was removed; 3) the association of acid-tolerant taxa with nutrient-poor conditions means that the lowest possible nutrient index at a site, as indicated by benthic algae, is lower at acid than at circumneutral sites. Although this may be an artifact of the datasets from which taxa-specific indicator values were derived, it could lead to a drift in nutrient indices with recovery from acidification; 4) the response of non-diatom taxon richness follows a complex pattern with a synergistic interaction between nutrient supply and pH. In contrast, diatom richness follows a simple additive pattern; this suggests structural differences between diatoms and non-diatom benthic algae in their response to nutrient supply and pH; diatom taxon richness tended to increase with nutrient supply, while non-diatom richness decreased.

AB  - Accurate patient stratification into prognostic categories and targeting Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)-associated pathways may pave the way for promising trials. We evaluated blood-based prognostic indicators using an array of pathological markers. Plasma samples were collected as part of a large, phase III clinical trial (Mitotarget/TRO19622) at months 1, 6, 12 and 18. The ALSFRS-r score was used as a proxy of disease progression to assess the predictive value of candidate biological indicators. First, established clinical predictors were evaluated in all 512 patients. Subsequently, pathologic markers, such as proxies of neuronal integrity (Neurofilament light chain and phosphorylated heavy chain), DNA oxidation (8-oxo-2'-desoxyguanosine), lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, isoprostane), inflammation (interleukin-6) and iron status (ferritin, hepcidin, transferrin) were assessed in a subset of 109 patients that represented the whole cohort. Markers of neuronal integrity, DNA and lipid oxidation, as well as iron status at baseline are accurate predictors of disability at 18-month follow-up. The composite scores of these markers in association with established clinical predictors enable the accurate forecasting of functional decline. The identified four biomarkers are all closely associated with 'ferroptosis', a recently discovered form of programmed cell death with promising therapeutic targets. The predictive potential of these pathophysiology-based indicators may offer superior patient stratification for future trials, individualised patient care and resource allocation.

AB  - We conducted the ecological risk assessment in an urban stream by using multiple-level approaches ranging from community level, chemical analyses in water and sediments, physiological assays of DNA biomarkers, embryonic development tests, and gene-level marker analyses of cyp1a, c-Fos, CRH, transgenic fli1 :GFP and HuC:eGFP in zebrafish (Danio rerio). In water, the chemical perturbations based on nutrients (N,P), organic matter, ionic contents and metals identified in downstream zone. Analogous corroborations verified in sediment samples having hazardous metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, Ni, As, Cd). The chemical contaminations reflected significant damages in fish DNA, based on tDNA, tail length (TL), and tail extent moment (TEM). Zebrafish embryonic development experiments significantly enlightened the chemical contaminants in downstream compared to those in control and reference conditions. Hatching and survival rates rigorously declined in downstream region. Embryonic development delayed and followed by death in the downstream substantiated by the above-mentioned findings. Similar were the findings on heart rate and pigmentation largely affected in the contaminated zone. Pollutants in urban stream reflected significantly at the gene level, and were corroborated through experiments using transgenic zebrafish strains that were influenced by pollutants during the process of occurrence. In conclusion, these studies illuminate the community to gene-level ecological health assessment that could be useful for ecological risk assessments of urban streams and rivers. Further, the gene-level biomarkers and transgenic zebrafish experiments combination propose the procedures could be effectively used as sensitive and efficient biomarkers of ecological health and risk assessment in urban streams from community to gene-level assessments.

AB  - 1. Elaborate restoration attempts are underway worldwide to return human-impacted rivers to more natural conditions. Assessing the outcome of river restoration projects is vital for adaptive management, evaluating project efficiency, optimising future programmes and gaining public acceptance. An important reason why assessment is often omitted is lack of appropriate guidelines.
   2. Here we present guidelines for assessing river restoration success. They are based on a total of 49 indicators and 13 specific objectives elaborated for the restoration of low- to mid-order rivers in Switzerland. Most of these objectives relate to ecological attributes of rivers, but socio-economic aspects are also considered.
   3. A strategy is proposed according to which a set of indicators is selected from the total of 49 indicators to ensure that indicators match restoration objectives and measures, and that the required effort for survey and analysis of indicators is appropriate to the project budget.
   4. Indicator values are determined according to methods described in detailed method sheets. Restoration success is evaluated by comparing indicator values before and after restoration measures have been undertaken. To this end, values are first standardised on a dimensionless scale ranging from 0 to 1, then averaged across different indicators for a given project objective, and finally assigned to one of five overall success categories.
   5. To illustrate the application of this scheme, a case study on the Thur River, Switzerland, is presented. Seven indicators were selected to meet a total of five project objectives. The project was successful in achieving 'provision of high recreational value', 'lateral connectivity' and 'vertical connectivity' but failed to meet the objectives 'morphological and hydraulic variability' and 'near natural abundance and diversity of fauna'. Results from this assessment allowed us to identify potential deficits and gaps in the restoration project. To gain information on the sensitivity of the assessment scheme would require a set of complementary indicators for each restoration objective.

AB  - The Suquia River (Cordoba, Argentina) has become an important issue because it flows into Mar Chiquita Lake, one of the largest saline lakes in the world. This water body, together with the expansive swamps of the Dulce River on the northern shore and the mouth of Suquia and Xanaes River, is considered one of the most important wetlands in Argentina in terms of biodiversity in a range of freshwater to very saline environments. Nevertheless, the presence of densely populated urban settlements and the increasing environmental impact due to anthropogenic activities characterize the central and lower sections of Suquia River Basin. Fishes are particularly affected and change their distribution and abundance as a consequence of the environmental deterioration. We collected information on fish fauna to develop and validate a Biotic Index to assess degradation of the Suquia River Basin. We classified fish species according to their sensitiveness or tolerance to environmental degradation, based on their distribution and abundance variations along a water quality gradient in order to design a Biotic Index for Suquia River Basin. The set of metrics used in the Biotic Index calculation was conformed by: the abundance of Astyanax eigenmanniorum, Rineloricaria catamarcensis, Gambusia affinis and Cnesterodon decemmacultus, the proportion of sensitive species richness, and the proportion of tolerant species richness. They clearly distinguished between the impaired and referenced sites. We demonstrated that it is possible to use fish as indicators of water quality in Cordoba Province (central part of Argentina) in order to carry out rapid and relatively inexpensive monitoring and conservation programs. The application of this Biotic Index showed that fish assemblages reflect the watershed conditions and are sensitive to changes in water quality across the environmental gradient.

AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey examined 25 agricultural streams in eastern Wisconsin to determine relations between fish, invertebrate, and algal metrics and multiple spatial scales of land cover, geologic setting, hydrologic, aquatic habitat, and water chemistry data. Spearman correlation and redundancy analyses were used to examine relations among biotic metrics and environmental characteristics. Riparian vegetation, geologic, and hydrologic conditions affected the response of biotic metrics to watershed agricultural land cover but the relations were aquatic assemblage dependent. It was difficult to separate the interrelated effects of geologic setting, watershed and buffer land cover, and base flow. Watershed and buffer land cover, geologic setting, reach riparian vegetation width, and stream size affected the fish IBI, invertebrate diversity, diatom IBI, and number of algal taxa; however, the invertebrate FBI, percentage of EPT, and the diatom pollution index were more influenced by nutrient concentrations and flow variability. Fish IBI scores seemed most sensitive to land cover in the entire stream network buffer, more so than watershed-scale land cover and segment or reach riparian vegetation width. All but one stream with more than approximately 10 percent buffer agriculture had fish IBI scores of fair or poor. In general, the invertebrate and algal metrics used in this study were not as sensitive to land cover effects as fish metrics. Some of the reach-scale characteristics, such as width/depth ratios, velocity, and bank stability, could be related to watershed influences of both land cover and geologic setting. The Wisconsin habitat index was related to watershed geologic setting, watershed and buffer land cover, riparian vegetation width, and base flow, and appeared to be a good indicator of stream quality. Results from this study emphasize the value of using more than one or two biotic metrics to assess water quality and the importance of environmental characteristics at multiple scales.

AB  - The use of biomarkers has become an important tool for modern environmental assessment as they can help to predict pollutants involved in the monitoring program. Despite the importance of fish gill in several functions (gaseous exchange, osmotic and ionic regulation, acid-base balance and nitrogenous waste) its use in coastal water biomonitoring focusing on protection and damage is scarce.
   This field study investigates biochemical (catalase, superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidation), molecular (DNA integrity) and morphological (histology) parameters in gill of mullet (Mugil cephalus) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and originating from Bizerte lagoon (a coastal lagoon impacted by different anthropogenic activities) and from the Mediterranean Sea (a reference site). Remarkable alterations in the activities of oxidative stress enzymes and DNA integrity in the tissue of the two studied fish species were detected in Bizerte Lagoon. The study of histopathological alterations of gills in both two fish species from Bizerte Lagoon suggest thickening of primary lamellae, cellular hyperplasia, aneurism, curving, shortening and fusion of secondary lamellae.
   The adopted approach, considering simultaneously protection responses and damaging effects, revealed its usefulness on the pollution assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem water regulation couples energy and water balance, depends on the integrity of the ecosystem, and responds to changes in climate. Changes in tree-water relationships in the biodiversity hotspot of the tropical Andes in southern Ecuador might be potentially observed at the level of individual trees, thus providing an efficient ecosystem monitoring method with applications in forest management and conservation at the tree and landscape levels. In this study, we combine area-average measurements from a laser scintillometer above the forest with optical satellite data at high spatial resolution to obtain area-wide evapotranspiration data. The processing of field data includes the calculation of energy storage in forest biomass and the partitioning of evapotranspiration into transpiration and evaporation. Satellite-based estimates are calibrated by using tower flux measurements and meteorological data within periods of humid and less-humid atmosphere. The annual evapotranspiration was 1316 mm, of which 1086 mm per year corresponds to the forest transpiration at the study site. Average values of 4.7 and 4.1 mm d(-1) per tree crown are observed under humid and less-humid atmospheric conditions, respectively, when applying high-resolution area-wide evapotranspiration in individual crown analysis. Approximately 24% of the observed crowns show a positive monthly change in ET, and 51% of the crowns show a significant change in the daily ET, which can be considered sensitive individuals concerning water relationships. The limitations in the area-wide evapotranspiration at the crown level can be explained by considering the spectral responses of the crown individuals. The presented method can be robustly deployed in the ecological monitoring of mountain forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Numerical models are useful for predicting the transport and fate of contaminants in dynamic marine environments, and are increasingly a practical solution to environmental impact assessments. In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model and field data were used to validate a far-field dispersion model that, in turn, was used to determine the fate of treated wastewater (TWW) discharged to the ocean via a submarine ocean outfall under hypothetical TWW flows. The models were validated with respect to bottom and surface water current speed and direction, and in situ measurements of total nitrogen and faecal coliforms. Variations in surface and bottom currents were accurately predicted by the model as were nutrient and coliform concentrations. Results indicated that the ocean circulation was predominately wind driven, evidenced by relatively small oscillations in the current speeds along the time-scale of the tide, and that dilution mixing zones were orientated in a predominantly north-eastern direction from the outfall and parallel to the coastline. Outputs of the model were used to determine the 'footprint' of the TWW plume under a differing discharge scenario and, particularly, whether the resultant changes in TWW contaminants, total nitrogen and faecal coliforms would meet local environmental quality objectives (EQO) for ecosystem integrity, shellfish harvesting and primary recreation. Modelling provided a practical solution for predicting the dilution of contaminants under a hypothetical discharge scenario and a means for determining the aerial extent of exclusion zones, where the EQOs for shellfish harvesting and primary recreation may not always be met. Results of this study add to the understanding of regional discharge conditions and provide a practical case study for managing impacts to marine environments under a differing TWW discharge scenario, in comparison to an existing scenario.

AB  - This work aims to analyze changes in the fish assemblages along a longitudinal reaches of the rio Paraiba do Sul, one of the most used Brazilian aquatic systems, to assess the river "health" and to identify eventual recovery trends. Standardized monthly samplings were carried out at six sites, from October 1997 to September 1999, using casting, sieves, seine and gill nets. Three zones were searched: upstream (Z I), downstream (Z III) and nearby the source of pollution (Z II). Three univariate distribution methods were used: ABC (abundance-biomass curves), K-dominance curves, and geometric class's distribution. Additionally, cluster analysis was applied to detect eventual patterns. The ABC and K-dominance curves showed Z II with evident indication of stress in both yearly cycles, followed by Z III and Z I. Few rare species and absence of common species in Z I, presence of common and abundant species, mainly opportunist, in Z II, and the highest number of rare species in Z III, was the overall pattern showed by geometric class. Number of fish was higher at Z II, while number of species did no change significantly among zones. Cluster analysis separate Z II samples from Z I and III. All the three univariate methods showed evident signals of stress at Z II, which showed indication of organic enrichment as expressed in the high abundance of common species, although physicochemical variables (ammonia, nitrogen, total phosphorous and DBO) have increased slightly from Z I to Z III. A lesser stress condition was shown at the downstream zone (Z III), indicating the river recovery capacity. The use of biological indicators in this study proved to be a better tool to assess non-point sources pollution when compared to traditional physicochemical measurements.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the ecological health of an urban stream using Integrated Health Responses (IHRs). Water chemistry analysis, habitat health, and ecotoxicity tests were conducted in the stream along with analyses of molecular/biochemical, physiological biomarkers, and population-level responses in indicator species. Chemical stresses, measured as nutrient levels, ionic content and organic matter concentrations were significantly greater (p < 0.01) at the downstream than the reference site (R-F). The habitat health was largely impacted in the downstream reaches and had a negative relation with the land-use pattern of % urban area. Comet assay, 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and vitellogenin (VTG) were evaluated for low-level biomarker responses on DNA/physiological conditions of target species. The multi-metric fish model (M-m-F) was used to test the community-level response in relation to chemical and physical habitat stresses. The impaired responses of separate biomarker and bioindicator at the downstream sites occurred at all organizations from molecular/biochemical level to community level. Using all biomarkers/bioindicators, the star-plot model of IHRs was developed and then the integrative health/risk assessments were conducted in the urban stream. The reduced values of IHRs occurred in the downstream sites and the impacts were attributed to effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WTPs) and industrial complex. Ecological health impairments, thus, were evident in the urban reach, and reflected the long-term community responses as well as short-term responses of molecular biomarkers. The degradation of the urban stream was mainly due to a combined effect of chemical pollution and physical habitat modifications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deforestation affects freshwater assemblages since aquatic organisms are dependent on the structure of the riparian vegetation. To investigate the responses of riffle beetles (Elmidae) to deforestation, this study assessed the structure of riffle beetle assemblages found in streams running through a large and well-preserved semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest remnant in Southern Brazil and in nearby deforested areas. Additionally, the effects of different substrate types (litter and stone) on the assemblages were assessed. Riffle beetle assemblages showed a remarkably distinct structure between forested and deforested areas. Lower abundance occurred in deforested streams. Indicator genera of forested streams were detected (e.g., Macrelmis and Microcylloepus), while a generalist genus (Heterelmis) predominated in deforested streams. Substrate type did not affect the composition of riffle beetle genera, although higher abundance was found in litter. Our results are likely associated with changes in the vegetation type and levels and quality of allochthonous material input between forested (native and higher levels) and deforested (exotic and lower levels) streams, which are directly linked to the feeding habits of riffle beetles. Thus, our study reveals an interesting potential of riffle beetles as indicators of stream ecological integrity in semi-deciduous areas of the Atlantic Forest biome.

AB  - Riparian zones are among the most valuable ecosystems on the earth. They act as the ecological engineers that improve river health through delivering a range of ecosystem functions. Stream bank stabilization, pollutant and sediment buffering, temperature regulation, provision of energy to river food webs and communities, groundwater recharge and provision of ecological corridors and habitat for wildlife, are among major ecosystem functions of riparian zones that play a great role in river health. Besides these ecosystem functions, riparian zones also provide various ecosystem goods and services for human well-being. But in the current scenario, riparian zones are under severe threat due to agricultural activities, urbanization, river flow alteration, overexploitation, climate change, pollution, and biological invasion. In the present and probable future scenarios of declining river health and global environmental changes, there is a pressing need of an integrated approach for managing riparian zones. This review article aims to advocate an integrated approach for riparian zone management based on various components such as riparian condition assessment, policy framework, stakeholder's participation, management practices, legislation, and awareness. Authors also discussed riparian zones in context of their concepts, features, functions, and threats.

The analysis of such assemblages may help managers detect changes in important parameters of ecosystem health within this MPA. In this study we compared the hydrozoan assemblages occurring on hard (rocky) and soft (Posidonia meadows) bottoms from stations belonging to three different conditions: i) small marinas (medium anthropogenic impact), ii) yacht stopovers (low impact), and iii) unspoiled sites (no impact) in the southern part of the Datea Peninsula during summer and winter 2015 and 2016. Significant differences in the structure, species composition and richness of benthic hydrozoans among the sampling sites were detected. In both seasons, hydroid assemblages in medium-impact sites significantly differed from little-impact and no-impact sites in terms of qualitative composition. Large structural species were widely represented in all hard-bottomed sampling sites, but small inconspicuous taxa with diverse life histories were much less abundant at the medium impacted sites. Species richness and diversity in Posidonia meadows was much higher in little- and no-impact sites, where highly specific hydroid epibionts were abundant.

AB  - The lichen Evernia prunastri (L.) Ach. has been exposed for 3 months in and around an industrial area of Mediterranean Italy for monitoring physiological (photosynthetic efficiency, membrane lipids peroxidation and cell membrane integrity) and chemical (bioaccumulation of the heavy metals Cr, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) effects and investigate the consistency with the environmental quality status depicted by the diversity of epiphytic lichens (index of lichen diversity (ILD)).
   The results showed that thalli transplanted close to the industrial area exhibited early stress symptoms, as revealed by the increase in electrical conductivity indicating a damage endured by lichen cell membranes. The electrical conductivity was inversely correlated with the diversity of epiphytic lichens recorded at the same sites. The ILD negatively correlated also with membrane lipid peroxidation and the rate of accumulation of Pb, V and Zn. Reciprocal correlations found among trace elements pinpointed vehicular traffic and metal processing in the industrial area as main sources. The damage endured by cell membranes was the best physiological indicator consistent with the air quality status depicted by the diversity of epiphytic lichens. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - An ecological assessment method for takes based on fish communities similar to the IBI-system was developed and further tested on two Austrian prealpine lakes. Important quality criteria used were species composition, reproductive success, size structure and total fish biomass. The reference status of each lake was established by the reconstruction of the native fish community and the native total fish biomass.
   In Hallstattersee only minor deviations from the reference status could be observed. Additionally to the 12 native (reconstructed) fish species two exotic species were found inhabiting this lake. There was no change in the number of intolerant fish species and for 10 native fish species reproduction success was confirmed.
   The fish community of Irrsee differed to a higher extent from the reference status. Three native fish species were missing. Seven exotic species were confirmed by catches and four of these are reproducing in Irrsee. No reproductive success could be verified for five native species. The sum of scores in our proposed scoring system revealed a value of 92 points for Hallstattersee, which corresponds to a "high ecological status" and of 60 points for Irrsee, which corresponds to a "moderate ecological status" of the fish community.

AB  - Soil quality represents an integral value of the compositional structures and natural functions of soil in relation to soil use and environmental conditions on site. Among the indigenous soil components, different organisms and especially microorganisms play a key role in ecologically important biogeochemical processes. In that way, soil microorganisms contribute to the maintenance of the matter and energy transfer in terrestrial environments. Under stress conditions caused by adverse anthropogenic effects such as dissemination of chemical pollutants, the development and biochemical activities of soil microorganisms undergo several alterations. To prevent negative ecological consequences, microbiologically-related parameters should be involved in the indication of soil quality. In order to indicate some reliable indicators, an international project was established in which scientists from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia, Slovak Republic and Germany were participating. Standardized methods for selected microbiological and biochemical soil parameters were repeatedly applied in the individual laboratories on soil samples from rather unaffected and anthropogenically-affected soil sites (49 in total). After evaluation of more than 20 individual parameters it was concluded that N-2-fixing bacteria, total microbial biomass, soil respiration, dehydrogenase activity, and perhaps also the humification activity of soil microorganisms could serve as sensitive indicators of soil quality. Further research is necessary, however, to recognize critical limits with respect to the different soil types and uses. Seasonal oscillations in ecologically-related soil biological activities which regularly occur should be appropriately respected. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshwater ice is an integral part of the hydrologic regimes of cold environments. It controls the ecology of related aquatic systems and is important economically, through the facilitation of winter transport and via generation of extreme hydrologic events. Given projected changes in future climate, concern has been raised about related changes in freshwater ice. This paper reviews the status and trends in records of lake and river ice around the circumpolar North from traditional observations, remote sensing and paleo-sources. The temporal and spatial variability in trends are evaluated with relation to climatic conditions. Rapid changes experienced in freeze-up and break-up timing for high-latitude lakes, compared to those at more southerly locations, are particularly notable. Also considered are the nature and implications of changes in future freshwater-ice regimes that will have cascading effects on cold-region hydrology and a suite of hydro-ecological conditions including UV radiation receipts, habitat quality and availability, fisheries productivity and contaminant pathways. Overall, the duration and event timing of river and lake ice are proving to be useful indicators of climate change. Considering the scope and significance of ice-cover changes on northern hydro-ecology, a recommendation is made to place more emphasis on long-term and spatially diverse monitoring of freshwater ice.

AB  - Ecological evaluation of Ohrid Lake is based in biomonitoring, especially in epileptic diatoms and aquatic macrophytes correlated with organic pollution and nutrient enrichment. Ten sampling sites were selected in the Ohrid Lake of Albanian side. This study aimed comparing diatoms and macrophytes indexes as bioindicators of Lake water quality. All two organisms groups showed significant response to eutrophication organic or inorganic pollution gradients. Submerged macrophytes respond to changes in the nutrient concentrations in their environment. In contrast to diatoms e. g., submerged macrophytes are capable of taking up nutrients from sediment and overlying water. Individual species of diatoms have specific preference to habitat and requirement for water chemistry. In this study, more epiphytic and oligotrophic species (such as Cymbella spp., Gomphonema clevei, G. gracile etc.) were appeared while more euplanktonic meso and/or eutrophic species toward sediment surface. Diatoms and macrophytes therefore function as integrators of environmental conditions to which they are subjected and thus can be used as long-term indicators with high spatial resolution. The Shannon Index gave evidence of biodiversity variations over the seasons and some differences between sampling sites. The Saprobic Index oscillated within a small band, indicative for oligo-beta-mesosaprob to beta-mesosaprob conditions. The Trophic Diatom Index TIDIA, Macrophyte Index (MI) and the Saprobic Index (SI) follow similar trends. This indicates that the structures of the communities reflect real environmental changes.

AB  - Aquatic angiosperms favor the development of ecosystems services, the welfare of marine organisms and people. Generally, the presence of angiosperms in transitional water systems (TWS) are indicators of good ecosystem status. Presently, these environments are densely populated and often are so highly degraded that angiosperms have almost disappeared, replaced by tionitrophilic macroalgae responsible of anoxic events that deteriorate the environment furtherly. Although this trend is hardly reversible because the anthropogenic impact is increasing and the restoring of damaged environments within a reasonable time is difficult, recent studies have shown that by managing the harvesting of the natural algal species of commercial interest a progressive environmental recovery is achievable. Biomass-harvesting can contribute both to the removal of high amounts of nutrients and the generation of economic revenues for a sustainable, self-financed environmental restoration. In fact, unlike clam-farming which destroys the seabed and re-suspends large amounts of sediments, the proper management of the macroalgal biomass, can favor the nutrient abatement and the recolonization of aquatic angiosperms which help restore the conditions necessary for the conservation of the benthic and fish fauna and birds, and produce valuable economic resources.

AB  - The Nature Conservancy acquired the Emiquon Preserve along the Illinois River, Illinois, with the primary objective of restoring ecological floodplain processes and habitats that promote and sustain native species and communities. The Conservancy convened an Emiquon Science Advisory Council prior to restoration implementation that identified key ecological attributes (KEAs) for riverine and backwater targets, KEA indicators, and acceptable ranges for those indicators. We assessed the application of this methodology to evaluate status of conservation targets and to inform future science and management at Emiquon. The KEA framework provided an important function of directing a systematic monitoring program that provided fundamental data on changing environmental conditions that were incorporated into annual target evaluations. Data show that 46-55% of all indicators were within acceptable ranges prior to reconnection of the preserve with the Illinois River. Recent completion of a water control structure represents a critical intervention that provides potential to improve conservation status of those floodplain and riverine targets that depend on water management and river connectivity. Continued review and modification of the KEA model in conjunction with a strategic monitoring program will provide critical information to guide relevant management decisions and testable hypotheses to reduce potential threats and achieve future restoration goals.

AB  - Charophytes, i.e. extant and fossil members of the order Charales plus the members of the extinct orders Sycidiales and Moellerinales, are closely related to modern land plants. These algae have a complex morphology, and can tolerate salinities from freshwater up to hypersaline conditions, although they are not known to occur in fully marine habitats. Extant charophytes are found on all continents except Antarctica, in both lotic and lentic, natural and artificial habitats, ranging from ancient lakes to newly excavated gravel pits. The large size of the internode cells makes charophytes useful objects in plant cell biology. Charophytes can build up large biomasses in brackish and freshwater ecosystems, and contribute to a number of ecosystem services, including removal of nutrients from water, storage of carbon and nutrients in biomass and sediments, possible phytoremediation of organic chemicals and trace metal elements from water, as well as provision of habitat and food for a number of organisms. Charophytes are valuable indicators for lake and river ecological status assessment, and their oospores and gyrogonites are useful for paleolimnological reconstructions of ecosystem properties such as trophic status or salinity. This paper introduces charophytes, and summarizes different aspects studied in these macroalgae. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although functional classifications have been successfully used in terrestrial and marine ecosystems to generate ecological hypotheses, compare local and regional environments, and supplement studies of biodiversity, they rarely have been applied to aquatic ecosystems, especially interstitial ones. We present two complementary classifications of interstitial invertebrates, and demonstrate their utility as a supplement for conventional measurements of biodiversity, as "common currency" for regional and global comparisons, as a tool for generating hypotheses, and as indictors of ecological variation in space and time. The first classification uses three species traits: diet, locomotion, and body size. Although mode of reproduction and extent of parental care were originally explored, these traits were less useful for prediction and explanation. The second classification reflects the degree of affinity for different subsurface habitats. Invertebrates can be classified as stygoxenes, stygophiles and stygobites. Changes in conditions in subsurface habitats (e.g. through groundwater extraction, sedimentation) can alter the proportions of these categories, providing a useful biological indicator of subsurface dynamics. Presently, use of these functional classifications is limited by a lack of autecological data for many interstitial species. However, as our knowledge increases and these data are obtained, there is great potential for large-scale ecological hypothesis-testing, prediction of the effects of human and natural disturbances, and global comparisons of interstitial assemblages and biodiversity.

AB  - Indicators provide easy and quick information on the status or condition of an object of interest and are therefore widely used in policy-making. In recent years, policy interest in vulnerability research has increased and a growing number of studies have been aimed at developing vulnerability indicators. Some of these studies have been done within the social-ecological system (SES) framework, taking into account both social vulnerability and ecological vulnerability. A particular challenged faced, however, is with regard to the incorporation of indicators to capture the latter, especially as the concept of vulnerability as applied in ecology is relatively new and not yet well-explored. This paper expounds on this problem by answering the following questions: (1) How are the concept of vulnerability and thereby ecological vulnerability currently understood? (2) What are the challenges in the development and use of ecological vulnerability indicators? (3) What are the current efforts to overcome these challenges? One insight gathered is that due to the complexity, nonlinearity, and multiplicity of dynamics of natural systems, development of sufficiently general indicators of ecological vulnerability may not be realizable. Rather, ecological vulnerability assessment and the development of indicators thereof, whether done independent of the human system or within the SES, should be conducted at smaller scales and must be context-specific.

AB  - Indonesia is biologically one of the most diverse areas in the world. Nevertheless, its biodiversity is underestimated, and this is particularly evident for meiobenthic assemblages. Seagrass meadows are known to be ecosystem engineers that can significantly modify the habitat heterogeneity and, thereby, increase the meiobenthic diversity. Therefore, a study on the meiobenthic distribution and biodiversity was conducted in two seagrass meadows around Siladen Island (Bunaken Marine National Park): Barat and Lagoon, characterized by different sedimentary regimes, as well as by different anthropogenic impact. An overall high level of diversity indices and richness were recorded (H': 1.19-1.69; J: 0.46-0.67; number of taxa: 9-14), with meiobenthic abundances ranging between 770 and 2529 ind. 10 cm(-2). The lowest meiobenthic abundance and diversity (i.e. Shannon-diversity, number of taxa) were reported at Barat meadow, probably in response to sedimentological modifications and higher anthropogenic pressure at this site. Differences in meiobenthic assemblage structures were particularly evident when only rare taxa were considered (i.e taxa found in low abundances and characterized by a sporadic distribution in the study area). This result underlines the role of rare species as possible indicators of spatial variability generated by engineer species and different environmental conditions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Our planet is changing, and one of the most pressing challenges facing the scientific community revolves around understanding how ecological communities respond to global changes. From coastal to deep-sea ecosystems, ecologists are exploring new areas of research to find model organisms that help predict the future of life on our planet. Among the different categories of organisms, meiofauna offer several advantages for the study of marine benthic ecosystems. This paper reviews the advances in the study of meiofauna with regard to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Four taxonomic groups are valuable for predicting global changes: foraminifers (especially calcareous forms), nematodes, copepods and ostracods. Environmental variables are fundamental in the interpretation of meiofaunal patterns and multistressor experiments are more informative than single stressor ones, revealing complex ecological and biological interactions. Global change has a general negative effect on meiofauna, with important consequences on benthic food webs. However, some meiofaunal species can be favoured by the extreme conditions induced by global change, as they can exhibit remarkable physiological adaptations. This review highlights the need to incorporate studies on taxonomy, genetics and function of meiofaunal taxa into global change impact research.

AB  - Payments for ecosystem services (PES) are promising instruments to create additional funding for biodiversity conservation, but related socio-economic effects are rarely assessed. This study aimed at evaluating socio-economic benefits using a set of indicators related to 13 topics. Based on 50 cases in 21 Natura 2000 sites in Italy, our results revealed positive effects on the socio-economic development of the local communities as well as an improvement in the defined conservation objectives. At greater spatial scales, potential effects were related to an increase in knowledge, innovation, and public finances supporting a green economy. Our results suggest that the level of socio-economic impacts is determined by a combination of several factors, including the type of ecosystem services, the conditions of the PES agreement, and the general socio-economic context. Specifically, PES related to regulating (e.g., water recharge, flood mitigation) and cultural services (e.g., recreational value) had positive effects on ecological and socio-economic conditions. Our findings highlight how PES schemes in protected areas can contribute to overcoming biodiversity finance gaps and strengthen sustainable development. However, PES should be planned carefully to not privilege individual ecosystems or services. As PES focus on a rather short period, long-term effects need to be evaluated.

AB  - Biodiversity' is one of the most common keywords used in environmental sciences, spanning from research to management, nature conservation, and consultancy. Despite this, our understanding of the underlying concepts varies greatly, between and within disciplines as well as among the scientists themselves. Biodiversity can refer to descriptions or assessments of the status and condition of all or selected groups of organisms, from the genetic variability, to the species, populations, communities, and ecosystems. However, a concept of biodiversity also must encompass understanding the interactions and functions on all levels from individuals up to the whole ecosystem, including changes related to natural and anthropogenic environmental pressures. While biodiversity as such is an abstract and relative concept rooted in the spatial domain, it is central to most international, European, and national governance initiatives aimed at protecting the marine environment. These rely on status assessments of biodiversity which typically require numerical targets and specific reference values, to allow comparison in space and/or time, often in association with some external structuring factors such as physical and biogeochemical conditions. Given that our ability to apply and interpret such assessments requires a solid conceptual understanding of marine biodiversity, here we define this and show how the abstract concept can and needs to be interpreted and subsequently applied in biodiversity assessments.

AB  - This study examined use of the oyster Crassostrea gigas as a bioindicator of experimental pollution caused by two concentrations of live pesticides (atrazine, isoproturon, alachlore, metolachlore, and diuron) used in agricultural and urban activities. The effect of these pesticides on the genetic structure of the marine bivalve was studied as part of an environmental biomonitoring project. This research was performed on two natural estuarine populations sampled along the French Atlantic coast as part of an ongoing monitoring program to survey the ecosystem of Brittany using two approaches: identifying the genetic markers based on the alleles and genotypes associated with pollution effects, and searching for a correlation between these markers and the sensitivity or tolerance of individuals under stress conditions. Results indicate a differential survival of individuals subjected to the various pollutants examined. The sensitivity of alleles and genotypes to environmental stress can be assessed based on the significant differences in allele and genotype frequencies observed between resistant and sensitive individuals: when subjected to the pesticides. This genetic study included examination of five enzyme systems (Ak, Pgi, Cap, Pgm, and Mdh) involved in physiologic processes. A total of six alleles and five genotypes at three loci (Ak, Pgi, and Pgm) were identified as being markers of resistance or sensitivity. It is hypothesized that these markers could be used as potential generic markers in estuarine ecosystem monitoring.

AB  - 1. To assess the biological status and response of aquatic resources to management actions, managers and decision-makers require accurate and precise metrics. This is especially true for some parts of the Florida Everglades where multiple stressors (e.g. hydrologic alterations and eutrophication) have resulted in a highly degraded and fragmented ecosystem. Biological assessments are required that directly allow for the evaluation of historical and current status and responses to implantation of large-scale restoration projects. 2. Utilising periphyton composition and water-quality data obtained from long-term (15 years) monitoring programmes, we developed calibrated and verified periphyton-based numerical models (transfer functions) that could be used to simultaneously assess multiple stressors affecting the Everglades peatland (e.g. salinity, nitrogen and phosphorus). Periphyton is an ideal indicator because responses to stressors are rapid and predictable and possess valued ecological attributes. 3. Weighted averaging partial least squares regression was used to develop models to infer water-quality concentrations from 456 samples comprising 319 periphyton taxa. Measured versus periphyton-inferred concentrations were strongly related for log-transformed salinity ( = 0.81; RMSEP 0.15 mg L-1) and log-transformed total phosphorus (TP; = 0.70; RMSEP 0.18 mg L-1), but weakly related for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) ( = 0.46; RMSEP 0.12 mg L-1). Validation results using an independent 455 sample data set were similar (log(salinity) r2 = 0.78, log(TP) r2 = 0.65 and log(TKN) r2 = 0.38). 4. Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA-1), a large ombrotrophic subtropical peatland impacted by multiple water-quality stressors that has undergone major changes in water management, was used as a case study. The models were applied to a long-term periphyton data set to reconstruct water-quality trends in relation to restoration efforts to reduce nutrient loading to the Everglades. The combination of biologically inferred TP and salinity was used to identify the ecological status of periphyton assemblages. Periphyton assemblages were ecologically imbalanced with respect to salinity and TP. Salinity imbalance varied spatially and temporally, whereas TP was spatially restricted. Imbalances caused by water management were owing to salinity more so than to TP. 5. The transfer functions developed for the Everglades are trait-based quantitative numerical methods and are ideal because the abundances of species are modelled numerically in relation to a stressor. The resulting inferred value is a numerical representation of the stressors effect on biological condition that can be compared against the management of the stressor independent of other factors. The benefits are that biological lags or hysteresis events can easily be identified and environmental conditions can be estimated when measurements are lacking. Reporting biological assessments in terms of well-defined water-quality metrics (e.g. numeric criterion) increased the communicative ability of the assessment. The use of multiple metrics to assess ecological imbalance increased the ability to identify probable causes.

AB  - The impact of an off-shore fish farm in Alghero Bay (northwest Sardinia, Italy) on the benthic ecosystem was investigated in 2007 and 2008. In addition to studying the chemical and physical characteristics of the area (i.e., currents and sediment analyses), some biological analyses were also performed. The AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and the multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI) were calculated, which are being used in assessing the ecological status of benthic communities within the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Clear impact gradients were detected according to both methods; they are related to farm production, prevailing currents, and characteristics of the area (i.e., water depth and distance to the cages). The site affected most was detected within 84 m from the cages: the area that no longer showed effects was over 907 m from the cages. The gradient is shown by decreasing AMBI values and percentage of opportunistic species and increasing richness, diversity, and the presence of sensitive species.

AB  - This study presents a standardized approach to collecting, registering, and reporting field-survey data for baseline MAES (Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services) information in Greece. This is accomplished through a web-based platform (MAES_GR) exclusively developed under the relevant, nation-wide LIFE-IP 4 NATURA project. Based on the European Commission's guidance for ecosystem condition (EC) and ecosystem services (ES) MAES studies, we conceptualized and structured an online platform to support EC and ES assessments, integrating all relevant fields of information needed for registering EC and ES parameters. A novel algorithm calculating EC was also developed and it is available as an integral part of the platform. The use of the MAES_GR platform was evaluated during nationwide field surveys efforts, increasing time efficiency and reducing costs. Field recording of EC and ES pinpoint spatial priorities for ecosystem restoration, conservation and sustainable development. This work highlights that MAES implementation can be favored by the use of technology tools such as mobile survey platforms, developed according to scientific needs and policy guidelines. Such tools, apart from the data inventory phase, can be used for data analysis, synthesis and extraction, providing timely, standardized information suitable for reporting at the local, regional, national and European Union scale.

AB  - One of the serious environmental problems since the 1980s has been the conflict between the high rate of deforestation and maintenance of healthy ecosystem services and biological values in tropical forests. There is an urgent demand for setting up an appropriate environmental assessment to keep healthy ecosystem functions and biodiversity along with sustainable forest use based on ecology. In this study, we tried to assess logging- disturbance effects on the abundances of several flying insect groups ( higher- taxon approach) in lowland tropical rain forest ( Deramakot Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia), while considering seasonal changes and vertical forest strati. cation. The season was the most important factor affecting the abundances of all the insect groups. Effects of logging disturbance were prominent in the understorey but obscure in the canopy. Changes in physical conditions caused by logging - possibly an increased evaporation due to solar radiation - may have decreased the abundance of desiccation-sensitive insects, especially in the understorey. There are also two probable reasons for the difference between events in the understorey and those in the canopy: ( 1) noise effects of various physical, environmental factors may have obscured insect responses to logging disturbance in the canopy; ( 2) higher spatio-temporal variation in quality and quantity of living food resources - such as leaves flowers and fruits - provided in the canopy may have affected the abundance of their One of the serious environmental problems since the 1980s has been the conflict between the high rate of deforestation and maintenance of healthy ecosystem services and biological values in tropical forests.

Thus, this study suggests that the abundance of some insect groups at higher-taxon level, especially in the understorey, can be used as bioindicators for assessing effects of logging disturbance on the forest ecosystem.

KW  - TO-NOISE RATIO
AB  - Health assessment is an important part of PHM technology, which is crucial to product state monitoring and management. With the complexity of product structure and diversification of functions, the product health presents uncertainty under the complex influence of multiple factors. Nowadays, the general health assessment method is relatively simple and only considers the product function completeness, and the assessment effect accuracy still needs to be strengthened in the actual working environment. Most assessment parameters and assessment methods are selected ignoring the impact of environmental changes and operating time performance. Therefore, a new health measurement method for the avionic radio-frequency power source based on a three-dimensional complex measurement model is proposed. Firstly, the product health definition is proposed, and the health connotation is analyzed from three-dimensional aspects containing functional integrity, environmental adaptability, and temporal sustainability. According to the function and structure characteristics of radio-frequency power source, the health characterization parameters are then obtained and the health assessment parameter system is established. Finally, the three-dimensional complex measurement model is given, and the RF power source health assessment is carried out comprehensively from integrity, stability, and reliability aspects. The three-dimensional health assessment method provides a new way to solve the uncertainty of product health state under multiple factor effects, which is conducive to the targeted optimization management strategy.

AB  - Invasive common carp Cyprinus carpio has long been identified as a contributor to water quality deterioration, disrupted ecosystem processes, and shifts in biological assemblage structure. In contrast, little information is available regarding the effects of native benthivorous species on aquatic systems despite their functional similarity to common carp. Effects of common carp and the native black bullhead Ameiurus melas on sediment resuspension, nutrient concentrations, macrophytes, and assemblage structure of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, were experimentally evaluated. We observed decreased water clarity, increased nutrient concentrations, decreased macrophyte biomass, and decreased benthic macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass associated with common carp, regardless of the presence of black bullhead. In contrast, black bullhead increased total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a concentrations and copepod abundance, but had little or no effect on other measured water quality and biological variables when compared to control conditions. Overall, experimental results suggest that although black bullhead tend to be tolerant of degraded ecosystems, they are not a source of physical changes to the environment known to be responsible for perpetuating degraded water quality (e.g., stable state shifts). Therefore, increased abundance of native species, such as black bullhead, following the invasion of common carp, may serve as an indicator of ecological conditions and should not to be assumed as causative.

AB  - Baseline environmental conditions are a critical consideration in the development of scientifically defensible aquatic nutrient criteria. We applied three methods to ecoregionally stratified data to determine reference conditions in Kansas lakes and reservoirs with respect to total phosphorus, total nitrogen, Secchi depth, and planktonic chlorophyll a (chl a). First, minimally developed lake/watershed units were identified based on existing geographical databases and visual basin surveys. Lakes and reservoirs in these watersheds were considered minimally-to-least impacted "reference" waters. Second, median nutrient, Secchi depth, and chl a values were determined for the best one-third of lakes and reservoirs and applied as indicators of reference condition (trisection). Third. a regression-based extrapolation method was applied to estimate water quality conditions in the absence of anthropogenic influences. The first method suggested no ecoregional effect on the trophic status of minimally impacted reference water bodies, whereas the other two methods indicated some significant ecoregional differences. Lack of ecoregional effect in reference bodies could indicate that differences were driven by anthropogenic influences rather than natural regional characteristics. Reference conditions. as determined by these three methods, broadly agreed for all parameters and were generally at or less than literature values for the mesotrophic-eutrophic threshold for lakes and reservoirs Worldwide. Reference values for total phosphorus were primarily less than levels commonly associated with cyanobacterial blooms. Overall, the data suggest that multiple methods can be used to determine reference condition, and that in Kansas lakes and reservoirs reference condition corresponds to mesotrophic state.

AB  - Improved understanding of pathogen survival in the stream environment is needed to enhance existing predictive models of stream pathogen populations. Further, the increasing use of thermal springs for bathing necessitates additional studies focused on not only typical streams but also thermal spring conditions, where water temperature is relatively higher than typical streams. This study was conducted to assess the survival of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium in stream water under free floating and particle-attached conditions at a range of temperature. A series of microcosm studies were conducted to determine pathogen decay rates. In bench-scale experiments, water circulation and sediment resuspension mimicked natural stream and thermal spring conditions, with continuous air flow providing aeration, constant mixing and turbulent conditions, and improved water circulation. Data on E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella survival were subsequently used to determine first-order decay equations for calculating the rate constant and decimal reduction time for the modeled experimental conditions. Results showed that at 40 degrees C, the survival of particle attached E. coli O157:H7 was longer than that of particle attached Salmonella. Under free floating condition, Salmonella survived longer than E. coli O157:H7. At 50 degrees C, survival of particle attached E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella was longer than that of free floating E. coli and Salmonella. At 60 degrees C, survival of particle attached Salmonella was longer than that of free floating Salmonella. Similarly at 60 degrees C, the survival of E. coli O157:H7 under particle attached condition was longer than that of the free floating condition. The findings of this study suggest that the survival of E. coli O157:H7 differs than the survival of Salmonella in stream water and thermal spring conditions, and the assumption used in previous studies to estimate survival of bacteria in stream environment could result in over/ underestimation if the impact of particle attachment on pathogen survival is not accounted for.

Damage rates of ozone (and consequently, ozone biomonitoring capacity of bioindicators) were found to vary highly in time and space depending on the local environmental and meteorological conditions. Lower ozone damage to foliage was produced when meteorological conditions favour stomata resistance. Modulatory effects of meteorological conditions need to be considered in biomonitoring and when modeling plant ozone doses and damage.

TI  - Pavlov on the conditioned reflex method and its limitations
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Pavlov's aim was to use the salivary conditioning method to investigate the function of the brain of higher animals in their adaptation to the external environment. The salivary reflex, according to Pavlov, was of minor biological significance but a good indicator of the subtle changes in the brain under different experimental conditions. To account for conditioned reflex phenomena, Pavlov faced two alternatives: to offer an objective (physiological) or a subjective (psychological) explanation. In 1901, after a bitter conflict with his disciple A. T. Snarskiy, Pavlov chose the first alternative. During the next decades, Pavlov provided reasons for this decision: The physiological approach (a) avoids anthropomorphizing or speculations about the dogs' subjective experiences, and (b) permits the explanation of observed phenomena which the subjective method is not capable of doing. Pavlov realized that the conditioned reflex method has a limitation; it cannot be used in the study of human subjects because their thinking interferes with experimental results.

AB  - The influence of area-based socioeconomic (SE) conditions on environmental quality conditions has recently been reported showing the precise spatial relationship between area-based SE conditions and neighborhood environmental quality in an urban area in a low-income setting. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of understanding of the nature of the relationship on a temporal scale. This study aimed to investigate the dynamic temporal relationship between area-based SE conditions and urban environmental quality conditions over a decadal period in Accra, Ghana. The results showed that there were differences in environmental quality across the SE quintiles in space (with regard to per capita waste generation (p<0.012), waste collection/clearing (p<0.01), and waste deposition (p<0.001) and that the urban environmental quality conditions had changed dramatically over the decade for most of the environmental variables (p<0.001). Despite the enormous urban development initiatives, some of the environmental quality indicators (e.g., proportion of households without flush toilet/Water Closet, connection to central sewer p<0.001) appeared to have worsened in the high class quintile, suggesting that a high proportion of households were without acceptable sanitation facilities. The study concludes that urban development in low-income countries will need to follow strictly international best practice by observing standardized building codes and guidelines, if progress should be made in meeting the Millennium Development Goals targets.

AB  - The objective of this article is to assess the condition of and hazards to the natural environment in selected landscape parks in Poland with respect to the impact of agricultural management using the DPSIR method. Our proposed set of indicators, based on generally available and applicable data, shows at the local scale, in a simple way, the condition of functioning of the balance between the natural environment and agricultural management and it assesses the level of repair works in the context of the records of the environmental protection program. The highest negative impact of agricultural management in the areas studied is noticed in the soil environment as well as the contexts of biodiversity and landscape. On the other hand, the lowest influence of agricultural economy was noted in the cases of the atmosphere and hydrosphere. The results of the aggregated indicators also showed lower or higher dependencies between the coverage and the use of the area in landscape parks and the condition of particular elements of the environment and the landscape.

AB  - Background: Life-history studies of wild bird populations often focus on the relationship between an individual's condition and its capacity to mount an immune response, as measured by a commonly-employed assay of cutaneous immunity, the PHA skin test. In addition, haematocrit, the packed cell volume in relation to total blood volume, is often measured as an indicator of physiological performance. A multi-year study of a wild population of house wrens has recently revealed that those exhibiting the highest condition and strongest PHA responses as nestlings are most likely to be recruited to the breeding population and to breed through two years of age; in contrast, intermediate haematocrit values result in the highest recruitment to the population. Selection theory would predict, therefore, that most of the underlying genetic variation in these traits should be exhausted resulting in low heritability, although such traits may also exhibit low heritability because of increased residual variance. Here, we examine the genetic and environmental variation in condition, cutaneous immunity, and haematocrit using an animal model based on a pedigree of approximately 2,800 house wrens.
   Results: Environmental effects played a paramount role in shaping the expression of the fitness-related traits measured in this wild population, but two of them, condition and haematocrit, retained significant heritable variation. Condition was also positively correlated with both the PHA response and haematocrit, but in the absence of any significant genetic correlations, it appears that this covariance arises through parallel effects of the environment acting on this suite of traits.
   Conclusions: The maintenance of genetic variation in different measures of condition appears to be a pervasive feature of wild bird populations, in contradiction of conventional selection theory. A major challenge in future studies will be to explain how such variation persists in the face of the directional selection acting on condition in house wrens and other species.

AB  - The use of exposure biomarkers in measuring the impact of aqueous waste holds out promise because such tools have short response times, are of flexible use and give an indication of the type of pollution. However, their ecological significance has not yet been demonstrated. During field studies focusing on aqueous industrial waste, the correlations obtained between several biocoenotic indicators and biomarkers measured in a fresh-water bivalve (Corbicula fluminea), demonstrate the need for work to be carried out under controlled conditions.
   Working in partnership with the Adour Garonne Water Board, the ELF company has developed a pilot scheme incorporating such controlled conditions. This pilot is made up of 16 canals 40 m in length supplied by river water. The pilot scheme, which is currently at the validation stage, makes it possible to reconstitute an aquatic ecosystem which, once established, will be exposed to perfectly controlled pollution conditions. The responses provided by all the indicators - biocoenotic and microbiological indicators, biomarkers - will then be correlated in order to attribute an ecological significance to the biomarkers.

AB  - Tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon regulation. Although positive relationships between biodiversity and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage have been found in experimental grasslands, biodiversity effects on SOC storage in natural forests remain debated. Based on a large dataset from 523 forest inventory plots across subtropical forests in China, we tested the relationship between biodiversity and SOC storage and examined whether environmental conditions (temperature, precipitation, soil properties) and litter quantity (leaf litter and root biomass) and quality (leaf litter carbon to nitrogen ratio [leaf litter C/N]) had effects on SOC storage. Furthermore, we used linear mixed-effects models to test the relative effects of biodiversity, environmental conditions, and litter quantity and quality on SOC storage. We used structural equation models to test how these variables directly or indirectly affected SOC storage. We found that species diversity, together with climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation), leaf litter C/N and root biomass determined SOC storage in subtropical forests at a large spatial scale. SOC storage was most strongly affected by climatic factors, followed by leaf litter C/N. Species diversity had both direct and indirect (through root biomass and leaf litter C/N) effects on SOC storage after accounting for environmental conditions. We also found that the positive diversity-SOC storage relationships were stronger in low and medium mean annual precipitation. Our findings highlight that higher species diversity can lead to higher SOC storage and therefore the conservation of biodiversity could play an important role in climate change mitigation.

AB  - Given the recent strengthening of wetland restoration and protection policies in France, there is need to develop rapid assessment methods that provide a cost-effective way to assess losses and gains of wetland functions. Such methods have been developed in the US and we tested six of them on a selection of contrasting wetlands in the IsSre watershed. We found that while the methods could discriminate sites, they did not always give consistent rankings, thereby revealing the different assumptions they explicitly or implicitly incorporate. The US assessment methods commonly use notions of "old-growth" or "pristine" to define the benchmark conditions against which to assess wetlands. Any reference-based assessment developed in the US would need adaptation to work in the French context. This could be quite straightforward for the evaluation of hydrologic variables as scoring appears to be consistent with the best professional judgment of hydrologic condition made by a panel of French local experts. Approaches to rating vegetation condition and landscape context, however, would require substantial reworking to reflect a novel view of reference standard. Reference standard in the European context must include acknowledgement that many of the best condition and biologically important wetland types in France are the product of intensive, centuries-long management (mowing, grazing, etc.). They must also explicitly incorporate the recent trend in ecological assessment to focus particularly on the wetland's role in landscape-level connectivity. These context-specific, socio-cultural dimensions must be acknowledged and adjusted for when adapting or developing wetland assessment methods in new cultural contexts.

AB  - River hydromorphology has long been subjected to huge anthropogenic pressures with severe negative impacts on related ecosystems' functioning and water quality. Therefore, improving river hydromorphological conditions represents a priority task in sustainable river management and requires proper assessment tools. It is well known that riparian vegetation plays a crucial role in sustaining river hydromorphological conditions. However, it has been nearly neglected in most hydromorphological assessment protocols, including the European Water Framework Directive (WFD).
   This paper reviews and synthesizes the relevance of riparian vegetation for river hydromorphology, focusing on its contribution to streamflow and sediment regime conditions. We also examine how riparian vegetation is considered in the WFD and how it is included in national hydromorphological protocols currently in use.
   Our findings point to a temporal mismatch between the date when the WFD came into force and the emergence of scientific and technologic advances in riparian vegetation dynamism and bio-geomorphic modeling. To overcome this misalignment, we present promising approaches for the characterization and assessment of riparian vegetation, which include the identification of vegetation units and indicators at multiple scales to support management and restoration measures. We discuss the complexity of riparian vegetation assessment, particularly with respect to the establishment of river-type-based reference conditions and the monitoring and management targets, and propose some attributes that can serve as novel indicators of the naturalness vs. artificiality of riparian vegetation. We argue that the hydromorphological context of the WFD should be revisited and offer guidance to integrate riparian vegetation in river hydromorphological monitoring and assessment.

AB  - Balancing ecological and human water needs often requires characterizing key aspects of the natural flow regime and then predicting ecological response to flow alterations. Flow metrics are generally relied upon to characterize long-term average statistical properties of the natural flow regime (hydrologic baseline conditions). However, some key aspects of hydrologic baseline conditions may be better understood through more complete consideration of continuous patterns of daily, seasonal, and inter-annual variability than through summary metrics. Here we propose the additional use of high-resolution dimensionless archetypes of regional stream classes to improve understanding of baseline hydrologic conditions and inform regional environmental flows assessments. In an application to California, we describe the development and analysis of hydrologic baseline archetypes to characterize patterns of flow variability within and between stream classes. We then assess the utility of archetypes to provide context for common flow metrics and improve understanding of linkages between aquatic patterns and processes and their hydrologic controls. Results indicate that these archetypes may offer a distinct and complementary tool for researching mechanistic flow-ecology relationships, assessing regional patterns for streamflow management, or understanding impacts of changing climate.

AB  - Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have been inevitably introduced into ecological environment during their extensive applications in daily human life. Thermodynamically, Ag NPs are unstable and transform into other species under various aqueous conditions. Ag NPs and their transformation products pose potential threats to environment and humans. However, the complex environmental conditions and transformations of Ag NPs complicate their human health and environmental risk assessment. To bridge the knowledge gap, four essential environmental transformations, oxidative dissolution, sulfidation, chlorination and photoreduction, of Ag NPs are reviewed herein. The mechanism, morphology and size change, as well as the toxicity of Ag NPs during these transformations under certain aqueous conditions are detailed. In particular, these environmental transformations have shown strong correlations that are discussed. The transformation, fate, bioavailability, morphology and toxicity of Ag NPs are critical factors and should be considered in a complete human health and environmental risk assessment of Ag NPs. The fluctuation of these factors in the realistic environment is also vital and should be considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM) spans five U.S. states and encompasses estuaries that vary greatly in size, shape, upstream river input, eutrophication status, and biotic communities. Given the variability among these estuaries, assessing their biological condition relative to anthropogenic stressors is challenging, but important to regional fisheries management and habitat conservation initiatives. Here, a hierarchical generalized linear modeling approach was developed to predict species presence in bottom trawl samples, using data from 33 estuaries over a nineteen-year study period. This is the first GoM estuary assessment to leverage Gulf-wide trawl data to develop species-level indicators and a quantitative index of estuary disturbance. After controlling for sources of variability at the sampling event, estuary, state, and sampling program levels, our approach screened for statistically significant relationships between watershed-level anthropogenic stressors and fish and invertebrate species presence. Modeling results indicate species level indicators with sensitivities to landscape stressor gradients. The most influential stressors include total anthropogenic land use, crop land use, and the number of toxic release sites in upstream watersheds, as well as agriculture in the shoreline buffer, each of which was significantly related to between 21% and 39% of the 57 species studied. Averaging the effects of these influential stressors across species, we develop a quantitative estuary stress index that can be compared against benchmark conditions. In general, disturbance levels were greatest in estuaries west of the Mississippi delta and in highly developed estuaries in southwest Florida. Estuaries from the Florida panhandle to the eastern Mississippi delta had less anthropogenic stress.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine whether the number of landscape elements and site conditions are reliably associated. As example, we considered the distribution of hedgerows on sites of varying agricultural quality. Experiments were carried out on two spatial levels: the first as the "natural unit", characterised as a region having nearly homogeneous site conditions; the second as the entire area of Baden-Wuerttemberg, comprising various natural units.
   The association between ecological and economic information was analysed statistically. We observed that a considerable correlation between "agricultural site quality" and "hedgerow density" (-0.63) existed only on the spatial level of the natural unit, but here exclusively in the case of the less-favoured natural unit. In contrast, no such correlation was found on the spatial level of a federal state (Baden-Wuerttemberg). Although there is still a need for improving indicator deriving processes these results indicate that agri-environmental programmes concerning biotope protection would be best implemented on an administrative level, whose size and landscape homogeneity is comparable to that of the natural units.

AB  - Defining reference conditions for lakes situated in areas of human settlement and agriculture is rarely straightforward, and is especially difficult within easily eroding and nutrient rich watersheds. We used diatoms, cyanobaterial akinetes, remains of green algae and chironomid head capsules from sediment samples of Lake Kirmanjarvi, Finland, to assess its deviation from the initial ecological status. These site-specific records of change were compared to current type-specific ecological status assessment. All paleolimnological data indicated deviation from natural conditions and mirrored the current, monitoring-ased assessment of "moderate" ecological lake status. However, the sediment data showed that the lake should be re-typified as a naturally eutrophic lake. Sediment records as well as current monitoring data indicated temporary improvement in water quality in response to extensive fish manipulation. Our results suggest that paleolimnological records can be used to derive site-specific reference conditions and that extensive restoration efforts can result in gradual, observable improvements of water quality and ecological status.

AB  - The mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) is among the most invasive fish worldwide, with well documented ecological impacts on ecosystem functioning and several native taxa. Although it has been suggested that salinity limits the invasive success of mosquitofish, there are few studies on how salinity affects its ecology. We examined differences in life history traits of mosquitofish at 19 sampling sites from fresh (438 mu S/cm; ca. 0.2 parts per thousand of salinity) to polysaline waters (35.1 mS/cm; ca. 23 parts per thousand). Salinity affected the density and life history traits of both male and female mosquitofish; density showed a unimodal response to salinity, stronger for females and thus affecting the sex ratio. On the other hand, the endemic Aphanius iberus was only present in polysaline and eusaline waters, where mosquitofish were generally absent. Mosquitofish increased reproductive investment (higher gonadal mass) in oligosaline waters, at the cost of somatic condition in females. The increase in reproductive investment also implied an increase in total mass in contrast to somatic mass, demonstrating that the latter is a better indicator of condition. Females from higher salinity waters presented more embryos in advanced developmental stages, indicating earlier reproduction than in fresh water. After correction for brood and fish sizes, females from saltier environments presented heavier embryos (independently of maturation state). In summary, salinity mainly affected mosquitofish females which, despite presenting earlier maturation and higher reproductive investment, reduced their condition and density, hence supporting the hypothesis that salinity limits mosquitofish invasive success.

AB  - We examined regional conditions and trends related to quality of life and potential vulnerabilities of these factors to changes in the condition of natural resources in the Mid-Atlantic Region, USA. We selected a variety of variables on economic and socio-demographic conclusions that demonstrate links between the condition of natural areas and human concerns and that quantify dependencies on resources. We extracted data from economic and population census databases for counties within the study area and present a subset of results of the Cluster analyses used to describe condition and potential risks due to distinct combinations of variables.
   We found that the same variables used to judge quality of life were often correlated with increasing Population and thus were likely to be related to land pressures and risks to natural resources. Within the region, economic dependence on resource-harvesting industries Such as forestry and fisheries was low (less than 4% of total earnings at most), however, the potential for natural amenities to attract residents appeared to be growing as the self-employed and otherwise mobile people settled in areas with affordable housing and natural amenities. Suburban residential spread had been occurring in both the close-in and distant Suburbs of the region's urban areas and some rural growth appeared to be driven, in part, by businesses migrating to suburbs. Further work is needed to tease apart causal factors for the trends we observed, but correlations clearly existed in some areas between increasing Populations and quality of natural Surroundings.

AB  - The Polish agricultural economy has a chance to dynamically develop and influence the innovation policy in the EU model of bioeconomy. The research aims to assess the spatial diversification of the level and structure of spending funds for two Rural Development Program (RDP) measures: agri-environment-climate measures (AECM) and organic farming scheme (OFS) aimed at supporting proenvironmental forms of agricultural management in the context of bioeconomy development. The EU financial perspective determined the time range for 2014-2020. The study was conducted on the example of Poland in two spatial scales: regional (province) and local (community). The analysis was based on partial indicators, which were then subjected to the standardisation procedure and included in the total as a synthetic indicator of the utilisation of RDP 2014-2020 funds aimed at supporting proenvironmental forms of farming. The following information was included in the evaluation: the number of farms, the size of utilised agricultural area (UAA) covered by support and the amounts of payments made under the two analysed RDP measures. In the research, the size and distribution of farms benefiting from AECM and OFS were determined. Besides, the relationship between funds absorption and socioeconomic development, as well as natural and non-natural conditions, were identified. The synthetic indicator of AECM/OFS usage showed a strong spatial differentiation, determined by the impact of several conditions: the level of socioeconomic development, the level of agriculture development, natural conditions of agriculture, land with significant natural and ecological values, and proenvironmental forms of land use on farms. Spatial diversification is more often the result of the impact of proenvironmental or natural-ecological factors than of socioeconomic conditions, or the level of agricultural development.

AB  - We studied the effects of N deposition (0, 10, 20 and 50 kgNha(-1)year(-1)) on cover and physiology of Pleurochaete squarrosa, a terricolous moss from semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystems. We also investigated the effects of N fertilization under competition with vascular plants or under water stress. Under greenhouse conditions, vascular plant competition reduced moss cover, and there was a significant interaction between N and competition. Water stress reduced moss cover under high and low competition conditions. Nitrogen fertilization increased moss cover irrespectively of the N dose supplied at low competition conditions. Under field conditions, N deposition affected moss physiology but not cover. Most of the physiological variables analyzed responded to N deposition, although the response of some of them was saturated with only 10 kgNha(-1)year(-1) over the background (nitrate reductase; phosphomonoesterase; tissue N and K+). The response of indicators such as chlorophyll a and lutein contents did not show any evidence of saturation, which probably makes them the best candidates in monitoring programs. Based on the data provided, the applicability of the phosphomonoesterase can also be considered. In addition, the importance of taking into account the existence of superimposed environmental gradients (such as those in soil mineral N content) interacting with the response of P. squarrosa to predict impacts of N deposition has been demonstrated. Therefore, detailed soil surveys and integrative physiological evaluations will be required to produce a significantly better picture of the effects of N deposition on Mediterranean ecosystems along extant N deposition gradients.

AB  - It is significant to increase energy efficiency of ethylene production process for petrochemical enterprise, in terms of the production level and productive benefits. But it is noticed from the actual production data that the energy efficiency of ethylene production has a strong relationship with the complex production conditions. It is necessary to combine the ethylene production states analysis with energy efficiency evaluation and improvement. With regard to the efficiency evaluation methods, data envelopment analysis (DEA) concentrate on a single working condition mode and fails to take into account the complicated working conditions. Therefore, a new energy efficiency evaluation method is presented with respect to operation classification. First, the typical working conditions of the ethylene production are determined corresponding to the key factors, including crude material composition and cracking depth, and the working conditions of production data are classified by k-means clustering algorithm. On the basis of the multiple working conditions, DEA is used to evaluate the performance of decision making units (DMUs) for different working conditions respectively. In addition, the advice on energy new allocation is suggested to the operators. Finally, the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated by applying in a practical ethylene production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As recruitment in marine fish is related to ocean condition, we developed proxies for ocean conditions based on sea surface temperature (SST) and biometric measurements of chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) captured in the walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) fishery in the eastern Bering Sea in three periods (July 16-30, September 1-15 and September 16-30). The main purpose of this paper was to evaluate Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) growth as a possible indicator of ocean conditions that, in turn, may affect age-1 walleye pollock recruitment. Marine growth rates of Pacific salmon are the result of a complex interplay of physical, biological and population-based factors that fish experience as they range through oceanic habitats. These growth rates can, therefore, be viewed as indicators of recent ocean productivity. Thus, our hypothesis was that estimated intra-annual growth in body weight of immature and maturing age-4 male and female chum salmon may be used as a biological indicator of variations in rearing conditions also experienced by age-0 walleye pollock; consequently, they may be used to predict the recruitment to age-1 in walleye pollock. Summer SSTs and chum salmon growth at the end of July and September explained the largest amount of variability in walleye pollock recruitment indicating that physical and biological indices of ocean productivity can index fish recruitment.

AB  - Soil biota is very diverse and contributes widely to ecosystem services that are important in the sustainable function of natural and managed ecosystems. Knowing the condition of the soil food web through the communities that inhabit it is necessary to assess the productivity of the soil. Nematode communities in the soil food web can be used as indicators because of their high abundance, and they inhabit various trophic levels, and participate in several important processes in the soil. The soil food web condition from three locations (Agr1, Agr2, Agr3) through the nematode functional index was evaluated using the maturity index (MI), the maturity index 2-5 (MI-25), the plant-parasitic index (PPI), the channel index (CI), the enrichment index (EI), the structure index (SI), and the basal index (BI). Nematode diversity was evaluated using Simpson's index of diversity, dominance, and evenness. The MI and MI2-5 scores indicated that Agr3 (3.81) had an undisturbed food web, while Agr2 (2.88 and 3.0) and Agr1 (2.5 and 2.51) were in a moderate condition with minor disturbances. Fauna profile analysis using SI and EI shows that Agr3 and Agr1 had an undisturbed soil food web, and Agr2 was in enriched conditions. CI results found that Agr1 and Agr3 had a fungal decomposition pathway while Agr2 had a bacterial decomposition pathway. This research showed that prospect of the nematode community to serve as a collection of biological indicator data in assessing soil or ecosystem health can be considered in further research.

AB  - Distribution, frequency and intensity of harmful phytoplanktonic species are impacted by changes in environmental conditions. In the Bay of Brest, Alexandrium minutum has been responsible for several harmful algal blooms (HABs) associated with toxin production causing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Additionally, Lepidodinium chlorophorum causes green water and hypoxia locally in the Bay of Biscay. Previous studies revealed that L. chlorophorum's success was related to possible competitive exclusion. Therefore, the phytoplankton composition and the environmental conditions should be taken into account. This study aims to assess the combined effect of changes in habitat conditions and community structure with the occurrence of HAB species, on a spatial-temporal scale. For the investigation we first used the Hutchinson's niche concept by means of the Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis. The OMI analysis enable us to observe the environmental variables defining the ecological niche of the harmful species among the community. Secondly, we used the subniche theory to highlight the environmental variables defining the subniches in cases of high and low abundance of HABs with an estimation of the biological constraint restricting the species' subniche. This was undertaken using the Within Outlying Mean indexes (WitOMI) calculated under environmental conditions promoting high (H) and low (L) abundance bloom. Thirdly, we used the Indicator Species Concept from the Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to link the biological restriction with potential competing or indicator species. We combined a data set from the French National Phytoplankton and Phycotoxin Monitoring Network (REPHY), the Velyger network (oyster monitoring program) and satellite imagery. A total of 44 stations, over the period of 1998-2017 using 50 taxonomic units. 36 taxa had significant niche and were mostly distributed along nutrient and salinity gradients. The two species of interest L. chlorophorum and A. minutum seemed to have similar affinity for summer-like environmental conditions and both used a marginal habitat compared to the rest of the community. A. minutum had a larger niche due to a greater affinity to the estuarine-like conditions. The subniche of the two species had a similar response to the environmental variation; their respective abundance was partly caused by greater environmental restrains. Their success in abundance appeared to be linked to local hydrodynamics which increases or reduces resources. On the other hand, the biotic pressure exerted upon A. minutum and L. chlorophorum were antagonistic. A possible competitor assemblage was exposed but the analysis was inconclusive. The methodological limitations were discussed as well as a perspective for future similar studies.

AB  - Ecological compensation is an example of a trade-off whereby loss of natural values is remedied or offset by a corresponding compensatory action on the same site or elsewhere, determined through the process of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Ecological compensation actions are often criticised for having low levels of compliance: meaning that they are achieved only partially or not at all, while development activity proceeds with much greater certainty. Our research investigated compliance with 245 conditions relating to ecological compensation across 81 case studies across New Zealand under the Resource Management Act 1991. Our results show that present tools and practice in New Zealand are not adequately securing the necessary benefits from ecological compensation requirements, with 35.2% of requirements not being achieved. Significant variation in non-compliance with ecological compensation occurs between different activities, applicant types and condition types, while critical variables within the planning process influence levels of compliance. Our research demonstrates the importance of understanding the nature of non-compliance and of providing a consistent and robust decision-making framework for the consideration of ecological compensation in practice.

AB  - There is widespread contemporary interest in causes and consequences of blood glucose status in humans (e.g., links to diabetes and cardiovascular disease), but we know comparatively less about what underlies variation in glucose levels of wild animals. Several environmental factors, including diet, disease status, and habitat quality, may regulate glucose circulation, and we are in need of work that assesses many organismal traits simultaneously to understand the plasticity and predictability of glucose levels in ecological and evolutionary contexts. Here, we measured circulating glucose levels in a species of passerine bird (the house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus) that has served as a valuable model for research on sexual selection, disease, and urban behavioral ecology, as these animals display sexually dichromatic ornamental coloration, harbor many infectious diseases (e.g., poxvirus, coccidiosis, mycoplasmal conjunctivitis), and reside in both natural habitats and cities. We tested the effects of sex, habitat type, body condition, coccidiosis and poxvirus infections, and expression of carotenoid plumage coloration on blood glucose concentrations and found that the body condition and poxvirus infection significantly predicted circulating glucose levels. Specifically, birds with higher blood glucose levels had higher body condition scores and were infected with poxvirus. This result is consistent with biomedical, domesticated-animal, and wildlife-rehabilitation findings, and the premise that glucose elevation is a physiological response to or indicator of infection and relative body weight. The fact that we failed to find links between glucose and our other measurements suggests that blood glucose levels can reveal some but not all aspects of organismal or environmental quality.

AB  - Nearly one hundred biological methods are currently used to assess the ecological status of European lakes. Here, using information from a questionnaire, complemented with findings from the literature, we compared the use of different methods to assess the ecological status of lakes as well as the rationale for using different organism groups (phytoplankton, benthic diatoms, macrophytes, benthic invertebrates and fish) in monitoring programmes. Reference conditions were estimated for about half of the methods using near-natural reference sites, complemented with other approaches, such as historical data, modelling and expert judgment. About 40% of the methods used more subjective approaches to establish reference conditions (e.g. selecting near-natural reference sites without any pressure criteria) or no information was available. Methods using several measures (i.e. multimetric methods) were developed, with particular emphasis on measures based on sensitivity/tolerance and abundance. Different organisms showed different responses to similar levels of human impacts. Assessment methods based on phytoplankton showed the strongest response to eutrophication, with class boundaries mainly based on ecological rationale. By contrast, statistical distributions and expert judgment were frequently used in setting class boundaries in macrophyte, benthic invertebrates and fish methods. Methods were strongly biased towards detecting changes associated with eutrophication, with other pressures (e.g. hydromorphological alteration) seldom monitored. Effective restoration measures and achieving good ecological status of European lakes will require assessment programmes based on a sound understanding of pressureresponse relationships as well as the use of ecologically based approaches in establishing reference conditions and setting class boundaries.

AB  - The scaling relationship between the concentrations of leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), which can be formulated as [N] = alpha[P](beta), shows the relative investment of plants in nutrient uptake. Most of the current knowledge on this topic is based on studies at the individual or species level. However, patterns at these levels can hardly reflect the response of vegetation or ecosystems along environmental gradients. Here, we explored how the nutrient demands of vegetation as a whole vary with productivity, climate and soil nutrient availability by generalizing the scaling relationship from the individual to the community level using community-weighted mean data from shrub communities at 1,080 shrubland sites and tree communities at 2,087 forest sites across China. By comparing the community-level leaf N-P scaling exponents under different conditions and using a bootstrapping method to construct continuous environmental gradients, we found that the scaling exponents declined with increased primary productivity (i.e. growth rate at the community level), temperature and water availability, indicating a higher P demand relative to N under these conditions. In addition, the scaling exponent of shrub communities had a declining trend, while that of tree communities had a rising trend, with higher soil N availability, showing a more resistant response of shrub communities to nutrient limitation. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that leaf N-P scaling exponents could be used as indicators of plant growth conditions and, more importantly, that communities, as assemblages of plants, exhibits varied nutrient preferences and utilization strategies among different habitat conditions.

AB  - Social-ecological contexts are key to the success of ecological restoration projects. The ecological quality of restoration efforts, however, may not be fully evident to stakeholders, particularly if the desired aesthetic experience is not delivered. Aesthetically pleasing landscapes are more highly appreciated and tend to be better protected than less appealing landscapes, regardless of their ecological value. Positive public perception of restoration actions may therefore facilitate stakeholder involvement and catalyse recognition of ecological improvement. Here we aim to contrast aesthetical perception and ecological condition in headwater river reaches restored through passive ecological restoration in study areas in Portugal (Alentejo) and France (Normandy). We recorded structural and functional indicators of riparian vegetation to monitor the ecological condition of study sites along a passive restoration trajectory. Aesthetical perception indicators were assessed through stakeholder inquiries developed under a semantic differential approach. We analysed perception responses to changes in the riparian ecosystems resulting from passive ecological restoration across different geographical contexts and social groups. The analysed social groups comprised stakeholders (environmental managers and landowners) and university students (landscape architecture and geography students). Results indicate that (a) visual preferences often do not reflect changes in ecological condition, (b) perception of the restoration process is strongly context dependent, and (c) experience and cultural background affect perception of ecological condition across the different social groups analysed. Clear identification of relevant stakeholder groups (those interested in or directly affected by restoration), effective communication, and stakeholder engagement are therefore essential for assuring the success of river restoration projects.

AB  - Benthic macrofauna is one of the most widely used biological groups to assess the ecological status of marine systems. Lately, attention has been paid to similar use of benthic foraminifera. In this study, distribution patterns of benthic foraminiferal and macrofaunal species were investigated simultaneously in 11 fjords in southeastern Norway in order to assess correlations and responses to environmental conditions. Selected fjords allowed to investigate contrasted environmental conditions from low total organic carbon (TOC) content (sediment TOC < 2.7%) in normoxia (bottom-water [O-2] > 2mL O-2.L-1) up to high TOC content (> 3.4%) in severe hypoxia (< 0.5mL O-2.L-1). Environmental parameters comprised bottom-water dissolved oxygen, grain size, total organic carbon, total nitrogen (TN), pigments and depth below threshold (DBT). Foraminiferal and macrofaunal community data were significantly correlated (Procrustes analysis m(2) = 0.66, p = 0.001). Hence, benthic foraminiferal distribution patterns mirror those of benthic macrofauna. However, as opposed to the foraminifera, macrofauna was not recorded at the most oxygen-depleted stations and, hence, was more sensitive to severe oxygen depletion. With regard to assigning species to ecological groups for ecological quality status assessment, the results suggest that species, e.g. Spiroplectammina biformis (foraminifera), Scalibregma inflatum. (macrofauna), may exhibit different ecological requirements depending on their habitat. Considering the observed congruent patterns of benthic foraminifera and macrofauna, palaeo-communities of benthic foraminifera could be used as indicators of reference conditions for benthic macrofaunal community structure. This would however need further developments of algorithms to perform such a translation.

AB  - The paper suggests a minimum set of abiotic and biotic threshold indicators and progress indicators for forest landscape restoration (FLR), then also briefly discusses progress indicators of pressures and project outputs. FLR aims to restore multiple functions of forests at a landscape scale. It is predicated on the hypothesis that restoration produces enabling conditions for ecosystem services, including regulating services such as carbon sequestration and pollination, and provisioning services such as food and energy. As FLR gains greater uptake, it is increasingly important to monitor progress. The types of indicators required are influenced by the degree of forest loss and degradation. To measure the status of land under restoration, one or more abiotic and biotic threshold indicators are required, measuring the return of enabling conditions for restoration (soil quality, water, etc.), along with progress indicators measuring the reemergence of the ecosystem services. Although all elements of the proposed monitoring framework are well known, compiling them into a coherent system, suitable for application in a wide range of conditions, will take much further development.

AB  - There is a considerable gap linking human dimensions and marine ecosystem services with Sustainable Development Goals, and one of these issues relate to differing perspectives and ideas around concepts of human development. There is also a lack of contemporary evaluations of coastal communities from developing nations under the lens of wellbeing and social vulnerability indexes. This study contributes to that discussion by presenting an analysis of Brazilian coastal municipalities, based on two indexes: The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI). These indicators intend to map some aspects of social well-being and development in the Brazilian territory under different perspectives. MHDI illustrates the average population conditions in a certain territory for humans to thrive, while the SVI points more specifically to the lack of assets necessary for wellbeing in a territory. The main aims are to map inequalities between coastal municipalities based on these two indexes and to provide a critical view reinforcing the importance of also considering natural capital as a key issue for wellbeing. Both indexes were developed with data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics Census of 2010, the most recent one available for municipalities. Overall, 65.9 and 78% of a total of 387 Brazilian coastal municipalities assessed were ranked below SVI and MHDI country average values, respectively. Both indexes indicated higher human development conditions in Southern municipalities than in Northern ones, especially for income and education conditions, also showing large heterogeneity of discrepancies among and within regions. The importance of combined approaches for local socioeconomic wellbeing improvements, as measured by the MHDI and the SVI, and natural capital optimization seems essential for improvements in coastal communities' quality-of-life conditions.

AB  - The Murray Darling Basin Plan (Murray Darling Basin Authority 2012) represents the largest investment by government in an Australian environmental management challenge and remains highly conflicted owing to the contested allocation of diminishing water resources. Central to the decision to reallocate consumptive water to environmental purposes in this Plan was the case made to maintain the freshwater character of two lakes at the terminus of the Murray Darling Basin, in South Australia. This freshwater state was identified as the natural condition on the basis of selected anecdotal evidence and was enshrined in the site's listing under the Ramsar Convention. The commitment to the freshwater state was challenged under drought when sea water was seen as a means of averting acidification when low river flows risked the exposure of sulfidic sediments. Independent evidence from water quality indicators (diatoms) preserved in lake sediment records, however, attested to an estuarine, albeit variable, condition before the commissioning of near-mouth barrages in 1940. This interpretation for a naturally estuarine history, published after peer review, was overlooked in a report to the South Australian government, which argued, without the provision of new evidence from the lakes, that they were fresh for their entire history. This revised interpretation is widely cited in the scientific literature, government reports and online discussion and underpins a watering strategy aimed at a freshwater future for the Lower Lakes. The allocation of large volumes of fresh water to achieve this condition presents significant difficulties owing to the highly contested nature of water use across the Basin.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the compound effect of environmentally relevant 4-nonylphenol (NP) concentrations and natural stressors-namely fish predation and food availability-on Daphnia magna, which were exposed to four NP concentrations (0, 1, 5 and 10 mu g l(-1)) under optimum or low food concentrations (1.00 and 0.075 mg C l(-1), respectively) in water (un)conditioned by a fish predator (Alburnus alburnus). A(n) "environmentally relevant" and "no observable effect" concentration (NOEC) of NP (10 mu g l(-1)) resulted in a significant reduction (P < 0.01**) in daphnids' survival when it was encountered concurrently with conditions of low food availability and presence of fish predation. The significance of the results lies in the observation that not only environmentally relevant concentrations of NP but also NP concentrations reported to have no observable effect on daphnids may in reality have unexpected critical effects on D. magna survival under conditions more parallel to natural ecosystems. The deterioration of the life-history traits-namely, NP-induced delay in the age at first reproduction (P < 0.001***) and fish kairomone-induced reduction in the size at first reproduction (P < 0.001***)-of the D. magna individuals is also crucial, as such alterations could significantly influence future generations and result in ultimate adverse effects at the community level because large-bodied daphnids are key-stone species in freshwater ecosystems. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of taking into account environmentally realistic conditions while investigating the effects of NOEC levels of toxicants on non-target aquatic species.

AB  - The delta of the Parnaiba River has a set of highly dynamic, productive ecosystems located in the Amazon-semiarid interface environment on the coast of Brazil. Phytoplankton is a key element in the evaluation of aquatic environments, as it is extremely sensitive to the broad spatial and seasonal variability of masses of freshwater and the physicochemical conditions of the water. To evaluate spatial-seasonal variation in the hydrological characteristics and the phytoplankton community in relation to the saline gradient, three sampling campaigns were performed at eight points considering seasonal periods (dry, rainy and transition) and spatial distribution (Nearshore Turbid Zone [NTZ], Mixing Zone [MZ] and Tidal River Zone [TRZ]) during neap tides. Variability in the environmental characteristics and phytoplankton was tested using permutational multivariate analysis of variance, dissimilarities and correlations. The data revealed a strong spatial-seasonal influence throughout the entire length of the estuary, with a clear spatial gradient related to salinity. Thalassiosira subtilis was the bioindicator for the NTZ, Cyclotella meneghiniana for the MZ and Oocystis parva for the TRZ. Concentrations of chlorophyll a, suspended particulate matter and nitrite were the main variables affected by the two factors combined (seasonality and spatial distribution). Moreover, total dissolved solids, nitrate and nitrite were the variables that promoted favorable ecological conditions for the development of the phytoplankton community associated with seasonality, especially the growth of Cyclotella meneghiniana, which proved to be better adapted to these conditions and was considered a key species in the area studied.

AB  - This research is an attempt to study ecosystem reaction of Karkheh River and Hoor al-Azim Wetland against the changes in the flow regime of the river using Bayesian Network modelling approach. In this research, demographic changes of two fish species of Barbus Grypus and Barbus Sharpeyi, as two important ecological indicators in the region, against the stress caused by water flow fluctuations were investigated by the next 10 years. For this purpose, the Bayesian Network was structured by three sub-models of hydrology, ecology, and quality. Future trends of demographic changes were studied in the form of three scenarios, including the natural condition (before the construction of the dam), current situation (after its construction and operation), and the predicted (proposed) situation of Karkheh River discharge in the next 10 years with a focus on the drought and wet periods. According to the natural scenario, this model predicts a 60% probability that the Barbus Grypus population will increase or survive, which shows a 16% decrease compared to the current situation. Due to tangible changes in the volume of water flow in the spring and summer, spawning and larval transmission in the current conditions is reduced compared to natural conditions. As a result, the population of Barbus Grypus in the current situation is lower than that in normal conditions. Based on the proposed scenario, there is a 24% chance of maintaining or increasing the Barbus Grypus population for the next 10 years. No significant changes were observed under any of the scenarios in the population of Barbus Sharpeyi by the next decade.

AB  - The floodplain of the Upper Parana River, Brazil, is strongly influenced by hydrology, which in turn affects geomorphological and environmental conditions, and controls the form of islands in the river. Such islands develop by deposition of river-borne sediment that creates small lateral sediment bars. Geomorphological processes can produce a variety of aquatic environments on such islands, e.g. channels, backwaters, lakes, transitional areas, and swamps. Our objective was to test whether subfossil diatoms preserved in the sediment on an island in the Upper Parana River floodplain responded to changes in limnological conditions brought about by such geomorphological modifications. We hypothesized that the composition of diatom assemblages in the sediment shifted in response to past geomorphic, and hence limnological conditions. We analyzed diatom subfossils in a 2-m-long sediment core with a calibrated date near the base of 1047-1224calyr AD. Absence of diatoms at the bottom of the sequence was associated with the channel phase, followed by appearance of diatoms 1229-1381calyr AD that were adapted to flow, in the backwater phase. After another 100-200years, presence of Eunotia species in the lake phase suggests a decrease in pH, phosphorus and nitrogen. Replacement of Eunotia spp. by Diadesmis species, following a transition phase, suggests different environmental conditions, with reduced water depth. Diatoms in surface deposits are distinct from assemblages in the other phases in the core and contain taxa that suggest a disturbed environment, with variations in water depth and flow. The data illustrate the importance of physical and hydrological factors in shaping diatom communities and show the utility of diatoms as bioindicators in this floodplain environment.

The validation of data under environmental conditions is therefore a major asset in environmental risk assessment of chemicals. The present study aimed to validate the mode of action of a commercial fungicide formulation in the soil invertebrate F. candida, under more realistic exposure scenarios (in-field bioassay), by targeting specific molecular biomarkers retrieved from laboratory experiments. Organisms were exposed in soil cores under minimally controlled field conditions for 4 days to a chlorothalonil fungicide dosage causing 75% reduction of reproduction in a previous laboratory experiment (127 mg a.i. kg(-1)) and half this concentration (60 mg a.i. kg(-1)). After exposure, organisms were retrieved and RNA was extracted from each pool of organisms. According to previous laboratorial omics results with the same formulation, ten genes were selected for gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR, corresponding to key genes of affected biological pathways including glutathione metabolism, oxidation-reduction, body morphogenesis, and reproduction. Six of these genes presented a dose-response trend with higher up- or down-regulation with increasing pesticide concentrations. Highly significant correlations between their expression patterns in laboratory and in-field experiments were observed. This work shows that effects of toxicants can be clearly demonstrated in more realistic conditions using validated biomarkers. Our work outlines a set of genes that can be used to assess the early effects of pesticides in a realistic agricultural scenario.

AB  - Ciliated protozoa (ciliates) play important ecological roles in coastal waters, especially regarding their interaction with environmental parameters. In order to increase our knowledge and understanding on the functional structure of ciliate communities and their relationships to environmental conditions in marine ecosystems, a 12-month study was carried out in a semi-enclosed bay in northern China. Samples were collected biweekly at five sampling stations with differing levels of pollution/eutrophication, giving a total of 120 samples. Thirteen functional groups of ciliates (A-M) were defined based on their specific spatio-temporal distribution and relationships to physico-chemical parameters. Six of these groups (H-M) were the primary contributors to the ciliate communities in the polluted/eutrophic areas, whereas the other seven groups (A-G) dominated the communities in less polluted areas. Six groups (A, D, G, H, I and K) dominated during the warm seasons (summer and autumn), with the other seven (B, C, E, F, J, L and M) dominating in the cold seasons (spring and winter). Of these, groups B (mainly aloricate ciliates), I (aloricate ciliates) and L (mainly loricate tintinnids) were the primary contributors to the communities. It was also shown that aloricate ciliates and tintinnids represented different roles in structuring and functioning of the communities. The results suggest that the ciliate communities may be constructed by several functional groups in response to the environmental conditions. Thus, we conclude that these functional groups might be potentially useful bioindicators for bioassessment and conservation in marine habitats.

AB  - Good urban riverfronts have both ecological and social benefits in urban planning and development. With rapid increase of urban stream rehabilitation projects in developing countries, the concept of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (PAR) has become a highlight in evaluating river ecosystem improvement. In this study the Comprehensive Index of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (CIPAR) that consists of 4 sub-indexes and 12 indicators is designed for assessing the conditions of PAR. The index system is novel for its combined consideration of riverfront accessibilities and benefits. These four sub-indexes measure (1) spatial accessibility reflecting riverfront openness and main transportation convenience, (2) visual accessibility reflecting visual field openness, (3) corridor continuity reflecting riverfront vegetation condition, water-oriented settings, and spatial continuity, and (4) amenity reflecting comfortable experience of riverfront environment and diversity of riverfront activities. Based on the questionnaire and field data collected during March 1-15, 2011, 24 reaches of the Suzhou Creek and its distributaries were assessed with CIPAR, and the urban riverfront after rehabilitation was quantified. The result showed that most of the reaches of Suzhou Creek still suffered a poor-fair PAR condition, and that among the four sub-indexes, visual accessibility got the lowest score with an average score of 0.7. The unsatisfactory PAR condition along the Suzhou Creek mainly resulted from the failure in synchronizing the planning and management of riverfront land uses and river channels in previous phase of the rehabilitation project. This case study supports the use of CIPAR to assess the effectiveness of riverfront rehabilitation project. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The environment is currently changing worldwide, and ecosystems are being exposed to multiple anthropogenic pressures. Understanding and consideration of such environmental conditions is required in ecological risk assessment of toxicants, but it remains basically limited. In the present study, we aimed to determine how and to what extent alterations in the abiotic and biotic environmental conditions can alter the sensitivity of a community to an insecticide, as well as its recovery after contamination. We conducted an outdoor microcosm experiment in which zooplankton communities were exposed to the insecticide esfenvalerate (0.03, 0.3, and 3 mu g/L) under different regimes of solar radiation and community density, which represented different levels of food availability and competition. We focused on the sensitivity of the entire community and analysed it using multivariate statistical methods, such as principal response curves and redundancy analysis. The results showed that community sensitivity varied markedly between the treatments. In the experimental series with the lowest availability of food and strongest competition significant effects of the insecticide were found at the concentration of 0.03 mu g/L In contrast, in the series with relatively higher food availability and weak competition such effects were detected at 3 mu g/L only. However, we did not find significant differences in the community recovery rates between the experimental treatments. These findings indicate that environmental context is more important for ecotoxicological evaluation than assumed previously. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Overfishing has the potential to adversely affect the ecological stability, economic value, social and spiritual integrity of a given area. Of these contexts, relatively little emphasis in literature is placed on the social and cultural consequences of overfishing and marine biodiversity loss. New Zealand's fisheries management system is regarded as one of the best in the world. But is this success' reflected at the local community scale? This study uses the knowledge of 100 participants from different stakeholder groups including Mori, New Zealand's indigenous peoples, and investigates local perception of the state of inshore fisheries stocks. Quantitative methods were used to assess the relative significance of important seafood species among different groups, while qualitative analysis highlighted main stakeholder concerns. A common consensus among all participants emerged; access to important inshore seafood species had become more difficult during the course of their lifetime with marked declines occurring from the 1970s onwards. Even where food species are present, they are typically harder to obtain, take longer to harvest and/or require expensive gear. Five species of marine invertebrates, three finfish species and one seabird were identified as having considerable worth to stakeholders. Of these, quantitative analysis revealed that pua (abalone), tuna (eel) and tt (muttonbird) were of particular significance to Mori stakeholders. Mori discussed pua almost twice as much as non-Mori, despite pua ranking as the most significant species among both ethnic groups. Furthermore, Mori associated the depletion of pua with a loss of cultural identity, hospitality, tradition, practices, emotional and spiritual connection to their environment. As such, in this paper pua is defined as a cultural keystone species', whereby the removal of such a species jeopardizes cultural integrity. This paper serves as a case study bringing to light the disparity between an internationally acclaimed fisheries management strategy and the concerns of local stakeholders.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between recreational use impacts and hiking experiences in natural areas. The effects of trail erosion, extension and widening, muddiness, tree and plant damage, fire rings, and litter were related to four dimensions of recreational experiences-solitude, remoteness, naturalness, and artifactualism. Recreational use impacts were found to have a negative effect on hiking experiences in natural areas. Litter, tree and plant damage, and fire rings had the greatest effect on hiking experience indicators; trail extension and widening and trail erosion had a moderate effect; and muddiness had a minimal effect on experience. Information generated through this study should assist in appropriate planning, design, and management of natural areas to maintain ecological integrity and to provide for quality hiking experiences.

AB  - The paper presents the development and implementation of a decision support system (DSS) for wetland management in a river basin context under data scarce conditions. It is shown that by combining hydrological, socioeconomic, institutional and biological indicators in a participative approach, a better Understanding of the interactions between the different factors affecting the "wetland socio-ecological system conditions" can be created. For this purpose, mathematical models, expert judgment and stakeholder preferences were combined into an integrated DSS framework.
   The DSS for the Abras de Mantequilla-Guayas Basin environment was derived from a generic, conceptual Decision Support Framework developed and proposed within the WETWin project, taking into consideration the specific conditions at the case study site. Standard methodologies for the characterization of wetland ecosystem services were applied and used to evaluate the effects of potential management solutions using appropriate criteria to assess the trade-offs.
   In order to account for the interactions between the river catchment and the wetland system, an embedded modeling framework was adopted in which coupled models for rainfall-runoff and hydrodynamics including the wetland and its adjacent rivers provided the inputs to a water allocation model. Using these tools, several management solutions were evaluated, including a baseline scenario where climate changes were combined with the effects of major infrastructure works that are presently envisaged by the local water authority.
   As a complementary tool for indicators based on poor quantitative data, expert elicitation was incorporated in the decision making process to capture the potential socioeconomic, institutional and ecological impacts of the various management alternatives. Simultaneously, stakeholder consultation (both users and decision markers) was carried out to derive current and future sets of preferences thus determining the criteria weight sets for different user groups. All these elements served as inputs to the DSS choice phase in order to provide a ranking of the proposed management solutions under each management criterion.
   At present, the option dealing with a moderate landuse substitution and reforestation was the preferred one by local stakeholders. In the future, there could well be an agreement between local actors and governmental agencies when their interests move closer toward more environmentally sustainable landuse. This decision support methodology may facilitate further negotiations toward a sustainable wetland system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Cut-over peatlands cover large surfaces of high potential value for enhancing biodiversity and carbon sequestration if successfully restored. Unfortunately, evaluation of restoration success is not straightforward. We assessed the bioindicator value of organic matter (OM), testate amoebae (protozoa) and bacteria in peat from two regeneration stages and a reference site of a cut-over bog.
   2. Contrasting biochemical signatures of peat OM were observed along the regenerating profiles, allowing clear differentiation between the newly regenerated peat and the old peat. Where peat macrofossils were absent sugar biomarkers were used to infer peat botanical origin and OM alteration.
   3. Over the succession, the OM composition of the new peat differed. Peat from the more recent stage was dominated by Sphagnum-derived tissues and characterized by lower carbohydrate preservation and higher bacterial biomass than the advanced regeneration stage.
   4. Surface testate amoeba communities also changed from the recent to the advanced stages of regeneration, indicating a shift from wet and moderately acidic conditions to drier and more acidic conditions. Over this regeneration sequence (i) the biomass and average size of species declined but were higher at the unexploited site and (ii) species richness and diversity increased but density declined.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Although secondary succession in the cut-over bog led to an ecosystem similar to that of the reference site in terms of surface vegetation, OM and testate amoebae continued to reflect disturbances associated with peat harvesting. Nevertheless, the described dynamics of both microbial and biochemical variables over the succession showed similarities between the advanced stage and the reference site: a higher testate amoeba diversity was associated with better carbohydrate preservation and a more heterogeneous botanical composition of the peat. The inferred water table depth and pH based on testate amoebae indicators proved to be an alternative approach for assessing restoration processes, in contrast to labour-intensive repeated measurements in the field. The botanical and biochemical composition of peat OM provided additional information on past anthropogenic perturbations of the bog and could be used for restoration monitoring. The combination of several indicators therefore provides a more complete assessment of ecological conditions that could be valuable for the management of cut-over peatlands.

AB  - An interdisciplinary team of academics and representatives of fishing fleets and government collaborated to study the emerging requirements for sustainability in Canada's fisheries. Fisheries assessment and management has focused on biological productivity with insufficient consideration of social (including cultural), economic, and institutional (governance) aspects. Further, there has been little discussion or formal evaluation of the effectiveness of fisheries management. The team of over 50 people (i) identified a comprehensive set of management objectives for a sustainable fishery system based on Canadian policy statements, (ii) combined objectives into an operational framework with relevant performance indicators for use in management planning, and (iii) undertook case studies that investigated some social, economic, and governance aspects in greater detail. The resulting framework extends the suite of widely accepted ecological aspects (productivity and trophic structure, biodiversity, and habitat-ecosystem integrity) to include comparable economic (viability and prosperity, sustainable livelihoods, distribution of access and benefits, regional-community benefits), social (health and well-being, sustainable communities, ethical fisheries), and institutional (legal obligations, good governance structure, effective decision-making) aspects of sustainability. This work provides a practical framework for implementation of a comprehensive approach to sustainability in Canadian fisheries. The project also demonstrates the value of co-construction of collaborative research and co-production of knowledge that combines and builds on the strengths of academics, industry, and government.

AB  - Like other coastal zones around the world, the inland sea ecosystem of Washington (USA) and British Columbia (Canada), an area known as the Salish Sea, is changing under pressure from a growing human population, conversion of native forest and shoreline habitat to urban development, toxic contamination of sediments and species, and overharvest of resources. While billions of dollars have been spent trying to restore other coastal ecosystems around the world, there still is no successful model for restoring estuarine or marine ecosystems like the Salish Sea. Despite the lack of a guiding model, major ecological principles do exist that should be applied as people work to design the Salish Sea and other large marine ecosystems for the future. We suggest that the following 10 ecological principles serve as a foundation for educating the public and for designing a healthy Salish Sea and other coastal ecosystems for future generations: (1) Think ecosystem: political boundaries are arbitrary; (2) Account for ecosystem connectivity; (3) Understand the food web; (4) Avoid fragmentation; (5) Respect ecosystem integrity; (6) Support nature's resilience; (7) Value nature: it's money in your pocket; (8) Watch wildlife health; (9) Plan for extremes; and (10) Share the knowledge.

AB  - Preliminary impact assessment of two large oil spill incidents at Bodo Creek, in the Niger Delta, was undertaken, focusing on intertidal macrozoobenthos. Post-spill number of species and abundance were measured against recent pre-spill baseline data from the same study area. Results show that surface and infauna communities suffered severe reduction in abundance and number of species reduced by 81% after the spills, with two of the resampled sites having no taxa at all. Capitella capitata populations increased several-fold over pre-spill numbers. The impact of the oil spills is discussed in relation to local livelihoods and ecosystem integrity. The Niger Delta endemic lucinid, Keletistes rhizoecus, is proposed as a potential bioindicator for monitoring hydrocarbon contamination in Niger Delta estuaries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forest monitoring is essential to maintain the integrity of protected areas, which has become a more pressing issue due to anthropogenic pressures and global climate change. Birds are widely used for this purpose, and as bird diversity is correlated with acoustic indices, it has been suggested that sounds can be used as an ecological indicator of ecosystem complexity and environmental changes. However, previous studies yield controversial results. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of six acoustic indices compared with the results obtained from a traditional point-counts survey for forest monitoring in an Atlantic rainforest fragment in Southern Bahia, Brazil. We also determined differences between acoustic indices calculated in the presence and absence of the researcher in the field to quantify the bias caused by human presence during data collection. There was a moderate correlation between the number of bird species just with the acoustic evenness index, from the six acoustic indices evaluated. We also determined that the presence of the researcher in the field at the point-count survey caused bias in acoustic indices. Therefore, more research must be done with autonomous recording units and the acoustic indices before they can be widely adopted for monitoring purposes in complex and diverse habitats such as the Atlantic tropical rainforest.

AB  - Using a large pan-European dataset, we compared least disturbed sites to sites impacted by human pressures across broad river types to assess which aspects of bio-ecological traits of the fish assemblage are most sensitive to alterations of the river ecosystem. To control for variation across river types and large-scale environmental gradients, we began by clustering the least disturbed sites (n = 716) into four homogenous fish assemblage types (FATs) differing by four fish metrics, i.e., lithophilic, rheophilic, omnivorous, and potamodromous fish. We predicted these FATs (headwater streams, medium gradient rivers, lowland rivers, and Mediterranean streams) using environmental variables, i.e., altitude, river slope, temperature, precipitation, latitude, and longitude for impacted sites in our dataset (n = 2,389). Using tests of sensitivity and intensity, 17 fish metrics showed a clear reaction to human pressures. However, 12 metrics responded exclusively within only one of the four FATs. Hence we observed a divergent reaction of fish metrics to human pressures in, e.g., headwater versus lowland rivers. Type-specific reactions are useful in customizing impact assessment for particular river types. It is of primary importance to understand the comparative sensitivity and efficiency of fish-based indicators of water quality for detecting human-induced degradation of river ecosystems.

AB  - During the 2010-2011 ` Impacts of Climate Change on the EcoSystems and Chemistry of the Arctic Pacific Environment' project, we measured photosynthetic parameters in natural Arctic phytoplankton assemblages from the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Water-column samples were taken from the near surface (3.1 +/- 0.9 m) and subsurface (28 +/- 10.3 m) at similar to 85 stations each year representing a wide range of ecological conditions, including under sea ice (UI) and in open water (OW). The physiological response of phytoplankton to light was used to assess photo-acclimation, photosynthetic efficiency, and maximum chlorophyll a (Chl a) normalized rates of carbon fixation. Phytoplankton from the subsurface were acclimated to lower irradiance, as evidenced by higher photosynthetic efficiencies (alpha*), reduced mean absorption spectra ((a) over bar*) associated with heavy pigment packaging, higher maximum quantum yields of photosynthesis (Phi(m)), increased Chl a content (Chl a : POC), and higher potential growth rates (mu m) than surface samples. In addition, phytoplankton growing in the UI subsurface had higher mu m, increased Phi(m), and higher Chl a content, as well as reduced (a) over bar* compared with those found in OW. P*(m) did not vary between habitats despite vastly different nutrient and light conditions (averaging similar to 1 mg C mg(-1) Chl a h(-1)), except where nitrate exceeded > 10 mg m(-3), in which case P*(m) averaged 5-6 mg C mg(-1) Chl a h(-1). Results from a stepwise regression analysis of photosynthetic parameters vs. environmental factors indicate that the concentration of inorganic nitrogen (significant relationships with P*(m), alpha*, Phi(m), mu(m), and Chl a : POC) and temperature at sample depth (a strong indicator of habitat type; significant relationship with beta*, (a) over bar*, Phi(m), mu(m), and Chl a : POC) are the best predictors of photosynthetic variables. In addition, the amount of light available at sample depth significantly predicted both E-k and Chl a : POC. Our results suggest that it is the balance between light and nutrient availability in the various environments encountered in the seasonal sea ice zone that result in the pattern of photo-physiological data presented here. A significant proportion of primary production has now been observed to occur under the sea ice; therefore, our results may be a change from prior conditions in the region.

AB  - The evaluation of the effects of environmental factors on natural communities has been one of the principal approaches in ecology; although, over the past decade, increasing importance has been given to spatial factors. In this context, we evaluated the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors for the structuring of the local odonate communities in preserved and altered streams. Adult Odonata were sampled in 98 streams in eastern Amazonia, Brazil. The physical features of each stream were evaluated and spatial variables were generated. Only environmental factors accounted for the variation in the Odonata community. The same pattern was observed in the suborder Zygoptera. For Anisoptera, environmental factors alone affect the variation in the community, considering all the environments together, and the altered areas on their own. As the two Odonata suborders presented distinct responses to environmental factors, this partitioning may contribute to an improvement in the precision of studies in biomonitoring. We thus suggest that studies would have a greater explanatory potential if additional variables are included, related to biotic interactions (e.g., competition). This will require further investigation on a finer scale of environmental variation to determine how the Odonata fauna of Amazonian streams behaves under this analytical perspective.

AB  - Synopsis One of the major challenges for conservation physiologists is to determine how current or future environmental conditions relate to the health of animals at the population level. In this study, we measured prevalence of disease, mean condition of the body, and mean resting levels of corticosterone and testosterone in a total of 28 populations across the years 2011 and 2012, and correlated these measures of health to climatic suitability of habitat, using estimates from a model of the ecological niche of the wood frog's geographic range. Using the core-periphery hypothesis as a theoretical framework, we predicted a higher prevalence and intensity of infection of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and ranaviruses, two major amphibian pathogens causing disease, and higher resting levels of circulating corticosterone, an indicator of allostatic load incurred from living in marginal habitats. We found that Bd infections were rare (2% of individuals tested), while infections with ranavirus were much more common: ranavirus-infected individuals were found in 92% of ponds tested over the 2 years. Contrary to our predictions, rates of infection with ranaviruses were positively correlated with quality of the habitat with the highest prevalence at the core of the range, and plasma corticosterone concentrations measured when frogs were at rest were not correlated with quality of the habitat, the prevalence of ranavirus, or the intensity of infection. Prevalence and mean viral titers of ranavirus infection were higher in 2012 than in 2011, which coincided with lower levels of circulating corticosterone and testosterone and an extremely early time of breeding due to relatively higher temperatures during the winter. In addition, the odds of having a ranavirus infection increased with decreased body condition, and if animals had an infection, viral titers were positively correlated to levels of circulating testosterone concentration. By resolving these patterns, experiments can be designed to test hypotheses about the mechanisms that produce them, such as whether transmission of the ranavirus and tolerance of the host are greater or whether virulence is lower in populations within core habitats. While there is debate about which metrics serve as the best bioindicators of population health, the findings of this study demonstrate the importance of long-term monitoring of multiple physiological parameters to better understand the dynamic relationship between the environment and the health of wildlife populations over space and time.

AB  - The ecological status of streams depends on an equilibrium between hydrological processes and biological dynamics. Water discharge is the main requisite fora wealthy riparian habitat. Nevertheless, human practices severely affect water availability through stream water derivation and groundwater withdrawal. In this sense, impacts upon aquifer water storage and its effects on base flow generation have a significant effect on stream biology. Consequently, biological indicators will point out poor conditions resulting from such human impacts. In this paper, the effects of groundwater exploitation on stream discharge and surface water quality are evaluated and compared to biological indicators in a Mediterranean catchment.
   The stream-aquifer relationship is investigated by considering the hydrological context of each river reach, including human pressures, and the hydraulic head in the contiguous alluvial aquifer, where it exists. These data allow us to differentiate distinct types of reaches that are defined according to a "Stream-Aquifer relationship and chemical Pressure" (SAP) classification, which is used later on to standardize the different hydrochemical and biological features of the sampling points.
   Stream water and groundwater hydrochemistry are compared to depict the hydraulic behavior of the sampled watercourses during wet and dry periods. Specific elements are used as tracers of groundwater inputs, wastewater influence, or even stagnant conditions during the dry season. This dataset defines a framework to interpret the biological status of each reach based on the Iberian biological monitoring working party indicator (IBMWP). Affinities between hydrological and hydrochemical conditions with biological indicator values allow the causal effects of groundwater exploitation on stream ecology to be defined.
   The use of multivariate principal component analysis shows that the dataset variance is distributed according to the SAP classification, and that variable grouping is in agreement with the observed hydrological processes and their effects on biological indicator values.
   This work provides evidence of the importance of groundwater dynamics on biological indicators in a human-modified environment. When using the SAP classification, biological indicators acquire a broader meaning as they reveal the status of biological processes and the causal references. Such information is relevant for water management assessment within the context of the European Water Framework Directive, as it emphasizes the control of groundwater exploitation as a key parameter in the preservation of stream ecological status and the achievement of the objectives of the directive.

AB  - Arctic wetlands store nearly half of the world's soil organic carbon and are crucial to the global carbon cycle. However, most Earth system models fail to account for wetlands given heterogeneity and uncertainty surrounding the response of different wetland types to climate change. We analyzed summer (June-August) carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange, meteorological conditions, and ecological conditions at four Arctic wetlands. Micrometeorological flux tower data were used to assess CO2 exchange and meteorological conditions across 7 to 9years of data. Climate data were used to assess meteorological conditions across 30years of data. Satellite data described ecological conditions. Each site acted as a CO2 sink, but strength varied, ranging from -49 to -93gC/m(2) per summer. A trend analysis was used to investigate how CO2 balance and surrounding conditions may have changed. CO2 exchange significantly changed at one site, becoming a stronger sink. Changes in meteorological conditions were variable across sites with the exception of air temperature which, when considering significant trends, unanimously increased across sites. Ecological conditions suggested increased vegetation cover regardless of statistical significance at all sites. A conditional random forest algorithm was used to evaluate drivers of CO2 exchange. Cumulative precipitation and evapotranspiration were the main drivers of net ecosystem exchange and gross primary productivity, while ecosystem respiration was primarily driven by air temperature, suggesting that projected changes in temperature and precipitation patterns will influence the carbon balance of Arctic wetlands. Variability across sites emphasizes the need for long-term observations across wetland types and climatic gradients.

AB  - Mercury contamination is a major threat to the global environment, and is still increasing in some regions despite international regulations. The methylated form of mercury is hazardous to biota, yet its sublethal effects are difficult to detect in wildlife. Body condition can vary in response to stressors, but previous studies have shown mixed effects of mercury on body condition in wildlife. Using birds as study organisms, we provide the first quantitative synthesis of the effect of mercury on body condition in animals. In addition, we explored the influence of intrinsic, extrinsic and methodological factors potentially explaining cross-study heterogeneity in results. We considered experimental and correlative studies carried out in adult birds and chicks, and mercury exposure inferred from blood and feathers. Most experimental investigations (90%) showed a significant relationship between mercury concentrations and body condition. Experimental exposure to mercury disrupted nutrient (fat) metabolism, metabolic rates, and food intake, resulting in either positive or negative associations with body condition. Correlative studies also showed either positive or negative associations, of which only 14% were statistically significant. Therefore, the overall effect of mercury concentrations on body condition was null in both experimental (estimate +/- SE = 0.262 +/- 0.309, 20 effect sizes, five species) and correlative studies (-0.011 +/- 0.020, 315 effect sizes, 145 species). The single and interactive effects of age class and tissue type were accounted for in meta-analytic models of the correlative data set, since chicks and adults, as well as blood and feathers, are known to behave differently in terms of mercury accumulation and health effects. Of the 15 moderators tested, only wintering status explained cross-study heterogeneity in the correlative data set: free-ranging wintering birds were more likely to show a negative association between mercury and body condition. However, wintering effect sizes were limited to passerines, further studies should thus confirm this trend in other taxa. Collectively, our results suggest that (i) effects of mercury on body condition are weak and mostly detectable under controlled conditions, and (ii) body condition indices are unreliable indicators of mercury sublethal effects in the wild. Food availability, feeding rates and other sources of variation that are challenging to quantify likely confound the association between mercury and body condition in natura. Future studies could explore the metabolic effects of mercury further using designs that allow for the estimation and/or manipulation of food intake in both wild and captive birds, especially in under-represented life-history stages such as migration and overwintering.

AB  - The world's extensive and often remote arid landscapes are receiving increasing attention to maintain their ecological and productive values. Monitoring and management of these lands requires indicators and evidence of ecosystem condition and trend, generally derived from widely distributed and infrequently repeated site-based records. However adequate geographic representation and frequent site revisits are difficult to achieve because of the remoteness and vast extent of these landscapes. Interpreting such sparse ecological indicators is difficult, particularly within landscapes that are highly variable in space and time. To interpret ecological indicator data collected in such environments long-term patterns of natural landscape variability need to be understood.
   This paper presents a framework of landscape spatio-temporal variability within which to interpret ecological indicator data. This framework is based on long-term patterns of vegetation growth across the Australian arid zone, derived from twenty-five years of high temporal resolution National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite imagery. We present a case study of the extensive Alinytjara Wilurara (AW) Natural Resource Management (NRM) region in far western South Australia to illustrate new insights about landscape function gained from this approach, and their implications for collection and interpretation of ecological indicator data. We illustrate how variability in vegetation response is expressed across the region, and how stratification based on active vegetation response differs from more commonly used biogeographic stratifications in this region. Lastly we demonstrate the unique patterns of long-term vegetation response for the major vegetation response classes. Average amount, seasonality, magnitude, timing and variability of vegetation response over time are used to characterise the natural "envelope" of variability of the new landscape classes.
   The study region showed low vegetation response in summer and higher response in winter. Onset of growth was earlier in the north and in ecosystems dominated by mallee vegetation. Cyclonic influence from the west was evident at the southern margin of the study region. The study demonstrates the landscape functional response of the study region, and presents a method whereby remote sensing reveals the landscape context within which to better interpret ecological indicator data collected in a highly variable landscape.

AB  - While sustainability is an essential concept to ensure the future of humanity and the integrity of the resources and ecosystems on which we depend, identifying a comprehensive yet realistic way to assess and enhance sustainability may be one of the most difficult challenges of our time. We review the primary environmental sustainability assessment approaches, categorizing them as either being design-based or those that employ computational frameworks and/or indicators. We also briefly review approaches used for assessing economic and social sustainability because sustainability necessitates integrating environmental, economic, and social elements. We identify the collective limitations of the existing assessment approaches, showing that there is not a consistent definition of sustainability, that the approaches are generally not comprehensive and are subject to unintended consequences, that there is little to no connection between bottom-up and top down approaches, and that the field of sustainability is largely fragmented, with a range of academic disciplines and professional organizations pursuing similar goals, but without much formal coordination. We conclude by emphasizing the need for a comprehensive definition of sustainability (that integrates environmental, economic, and social aspects) with a unified system-of-systems approach that is causal, modular, tiered, and scalable, as well as new educational and organizational structures to improve systems-level interdisciplinary integration.

AB  - Assessing the biodiversity of macroinvertebrate fauna in freshwater ecosystems is an essential component of both basic ecological inquiry and applied ecological assessments. Aspects of taxonomic diversity and composition in freshwater communities are widely used to quantify water quality and measure the efficacy of remediation and restoration efforts. The accuracy and precision of biodiversity assessments based on standard morphological identifications are often limited by taxonomic resolution and sample size. Morphologically based identifications are laborious and costly, significantly constraining the sample sizes that can be processed. We suggest that the development of an assay platform based on DNA signatures wilt increase the precision and ease of quantifying biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems. Advances in this area will be particularly relevant for benthic and planktonic invertebrates, which are often monitored by regulatory agencies. Adopting a genetic assessment platform will alleviate some of the current limitations to biodiversity assessment strategies. We discuss the benefits and challenges associated with DNA-based assessments and the methods that are currently available. As recent advances in microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies will facilitate a transition to DNA-based assessment approaches, future research efforts should focus on methods for data collection, assay platform development, establishing linkages between DNA signatures and well-resolved taxonomies, and bioinformatics.

AB  - The global expansion of energy demands combined with abundant rainfall, large water volumes and high flow in tropical rivers have led to an unprecedented expansion of dam constructions in the Amazon. This expansion generates an urgent need for refined approaches to river management; specifically a move away from decision-making governed by overly generalized guidelines. For the first time we quantify direct impacts of hydropower reservoir establishment on an Amazon fresh water turtle. We conducted surveys along 150 km of rivers upstream of a new dam construction during the low water months that correspond to the nesting season of Podocnemis unifilis in the study area. Comparison of nest-areas before (2011, 2015) and after (2016) reservoir filling show that reservoir impacts extend 13% beyond legally defined limits. The submerged nesting areas accounted for a total of 3.8 ha of nesting habitat that was inundated as a direct result of the reservoir filling in 2016. Our findings highlight limitations in the development and implementation of existing Brazilian environmental impact assessment process. We also propose potential ways to mitigate the negative impacts of dams on freshwater turtles and the Amazonian freshwater ecosystems they inhabit.

AB  - This study evaluates five benthic indicators (total abundance, number of taxa, redox potential, total free sulfides, total organic matter) and ten biotic indices (Margalef's d. Peilou's J', Shannon H', AMBI, M-AMBI, MEDOCC, BENTIX, BOPA, ITI, BQI), to identify those that best define organic enrichment gradients under different flow regimes. Performance was measured against Enrichment Stage (ES), a continuous variable characterising the full range of sediment conditions (natural to azoic). None of the 15 metrics were able to consistently discriminate over the full enrichment gradient for both flow environments. The most versatile indices were BQI > M-AMBI > AMBI > Log(N) > BENTIX. Of these, M-AMBI best catered for different flow environments, while the BQI was the most effective under highly enriched conditions. Under strong enrichment, i.e. when macrofauna abundance is in decline, changes in redox, sulfides, number of taxa and abundance were reasonably clear. However, the more complex biotic indices were relatively insensitive at this level, highlighting a limited applicability beyond the 'peak of opportunists' (PO). Conversely, in high flow regimes, some of the biological indicators were relatively sensitive to low-to-moderate levels of enrichment that were not well discerned by the physico-chemical variables. A useful subset of variables for assessing enrichment status is recommended, comprising two of the best performing biotic indices that are based on alternative/independent classification schemes (i.e. EG's and ES50(0.05)), total abundance, to aid in discerning PO, and a geochemical variable (redox or S2-). Inconsistencies between metrics were found to be more significant than the variability surrounding the predictive capacity of individual indicators, and as a result there is a risk of ES misclassification where only a single index is used. Whilst there is a recognised need to use combinations of indicators, this study also stresses the importance of focusing on a few regionally validated measures and down-weighting the importance placed on any that are not. Additionally, although using a combination of different indicators may produce a 'safe' average result, it may be inefficient, and the averaging effect has the potential to mask extreme conditions. Hence, there remains a need for expert judgement to select and appropriately weight indicator variables, to identify any erroneous results, and to reliably assess ecological quality status.

AB  - Land use changes and riparian corridor degradation strongly influence the water quality of low-order streams at different spatial scales. Stream water quality can be analyzed by chemical and biological indicators, but which are generally evaluated separately. Here, we evaluated if anthropogenic alterations at distinct spatial scales (estimated by land use, riparian zone composition, and riparian forest structure) influenced stream water quality according to chemical and biological (e.g., fish and macroinvertebrate) indicators in a tropical rural landscape (SE Brazil). We found higher total nitrogen concentrations and electric conductivity in streams with land use dominated by pasture and narrower riparian forests, higher diversity of macroinvertebrates and dissolved oxygen concentrations in streams with higher cover and width of riparian forests although land use was dominated by sugarcane, whereas fish diversity was related with natural vegetation cover at the watershed scale. Thus, stream water quality indicators responded to variation at both scales studied, with interactions between land use and riparian corridor characteristics. These results suggest that different degradation drivers may account for variation of different types of indicators (chemical vs. fishes vs. macroinvertebrates) at distinct spatial scales.

AB  - A method was developed to characterize ecological integrity of riparian sites based on the abundance of hydric species. This wetland index can be calculated with species data, or with community type data as performed here. Classified riparian community types were used to describe vegetation at 14 livestock exclosures and adjacent grazed areas. Community type wetland index values were generated and used to calculate site wetland index values. It was hypothesized that removal of livestock would result in higher wetland index values because of release from herbivory and decreased physical disturbance of vegetation, streambanks, and soil. The wetland index for exclosures was about 12% higher than grazed sites; differences were statistically significant (p < 0.01) based on paired t-tests. The increase in hydric vegetation after livestock exclusion may have contributed to the greater bank stability (p= 0.002) and smaller width-to-depth ratio (p= 0.005) in exclosures. Challenges were encountered in using community types to describe and compare site vegetation, which could be avoided with species data collection. The wetland index can be a tool to monitor sites over time, compare sites with similar environments, or compare sites for which environmental differences can be accounted.

AB  - In this study we comprehensively assessed Collembola biodiversity at Three Gorges Area, one of most diverse habitat regions in China. In total, 3,796 Collembola specimens comprising 9 families, 45 genera, and 103 species (including 14 new species and new records in China) were collected from three primary sampling areas: one nature reserve and two rural and urban areas representing different degrees of human influence. Each sampling area was further divided into nine sampling sites associated with different habitats and altitudes. Analyses of biodiversity data showed that individual abundance was highest in the nature reserve followed by mildly human influenced areas, and then highly influenced areas, and species richness was lowest in highly influenced areas. Hence, we suggest Collembola biodiversity is systematically lost after urbanization. In the nature reserve, altitude significantly influenced both the species richness and individual abundance, whereas in rural and urban areas, both altitude and the human-altered environmental gradient were influential. We also measured sampling efficiency and estimated potential species richness in these areas. This study serves as both a fundamental survey of Collembola biodiversity, as well as an assessment of human/environmental influence on the Collembola community, and can provide further insight into protecting the soil integrity of the Three Gorges Area.

AB  - With increased interest in urban forests on behalf of city dwellers and urban planners, there is a growing need for comprehensive information on urban tree condition. This study examines the potential of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for evaluating tree condition in the urban center of Surrey, Canada. An approach to detecting and outlining free-growing trees from LiDAR data augmented by a municipal tree inventory was developed and validated. Once the trees were located, LiDAR was used to estimate two field-measured indicators of tree condition: crown density and tree height. Tree heights estimated by LiDAR were, as expected, well correlated with field measurements (Pearson's r = 0.927, p < 0.001), indicating accurate height estimates of successfully detected trees. Two LiDAR metrics, the percentage of non-ground LiDAR returns and the coefficient of variation of return height, were examined as predictors of crown density. While the percentage of non-ground returns performed relatively poorly (r(2) between 0.005 and 0.23 across multiple tree height classes), the coefficient of variation of return height was able to predict crown density with an r(2)=0.617 for trees over 8 m. In addition, residuals derived using expected height growth from the known planting date and their LiDAR-derived height was found to be a useful tree condition metric. We conclude that despite the complexity of urban tree condition assessment, airborne LiDAR is a promising tool for detecting trees in an urban environment and measuring indicators of their condition.

AB  - Freshwater contamination by pesticides in agricultural landscapes is of increasing concern worldwide, with strong pesticide impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and ultimately human health (drinking water, fishing). In addition, the excessively large number of substances, as well as their low - and temporally variable - concentrations in water, make the chemical monitoring by grab sampling very demanding and not fully representative of the actual contamination. Tools that integrate temporal variations and that are ecologically relevant are clearly needed to improve the monitoring of freshwater contamination and assess its biological effects. Here, we studied pesticide contamination and its biological impacts in 10 stream sections (sites) belonging to 3 agricultural catchments in France. In each site, we deployed a combination of pesticide integrative samplers, biocenotic indicators based on benthic macroinvertebrates, and functional indicators based on leaf litter decomposition and associated fungal communities. The 3 approaches largely proved complementary: structural and functional indicators did not respond equally to different agricultural impacts such as pesticide contamination (as revealed by integrative samplers), nutrients, or oxygen depletion. Combining chemical, structural, and functional indicators thus seems an excellent strategy to provide a comprehensive picture of agricultural impacts on stream ecosystems.

AB  - High demand for outdoor recreation and increasing diversity in outdoor recreation participants have imposed a great challenge on the National Park Service (NPS), which is tasked with the mission to provide open access for quality outdoor recreation and maintain the ecological integrity of the park system. In addition to management practices of education and restrictions, building a sense of natural resource stewardship among visitors may also facilitate the NPS ability to react to this challenge. The purpose of our study is to suggest a segmentation approach that is built on the social marketing framework and aimed at influencing visitor behaviors to support conservation. Attitude toward natural resource management, an indicator of natural resource stewardship, is used as the basis for segmenting park visitors. This segmentation approach is examined based on a survey of 987 visitors to the Padre Island National Seashore (PAIS) in Texas in 2003. Results of the K-means cluster analysis identify three visitor segments: Conservation-Oriented, Development-Oriented, and Status Quo visitors. This segmentation solution is verified using respondents' socio-demographic backgrounds, use patterns, experience preferences, and attitudes toward a proposed regulation. Suggestions are provided to better target the three visitor segments and facilitate a sense of natural resource stewardship among them.

AB  - Calcium occupies a unique position among plant nutrients both chemically and functionally. Its chemical properties allow it to exist in a wide range of binding states and to serve in both structural and messenger roles. Despite its importance in many plant processes, Ca mobility is low, making Ca uptake and distribution rate a limiting process for many key plant functions. Ca plays an essential role in regulating many physiological processes that influence both growth and responses to environmental stresses. Included among these are: water and solute movement, influenced through effects on membrane structure and stomatal function; cell division and cell wall synthesis; direct or signaling roles in systems involved in plant defense and repair of damage from biotic and abiotic stress; rates of respiratory metabolism and translocation; and structural chemistry and function of woody support tissues. Forest trees, because of their size and age capacity, have been examined for evidence of limitations imposed by the timing and level of Ca supply. Examination of Ca physiology and biogeochemical cycling for forested systems reveals many indications that Ca supply places important limitations on forest structure and function. These limitations are likely to be most significant with older trees, later successional stages, high levels of soil acidity and/or high canopy Ca leaching losses, or under conditions vc here plant competition is high or transpiration is limited by high humidity or low soil moisture. Evidence of structural and physiological adaptations of forests to limited Ca supply; indicators of system dysfunction at many levels under reduced Ca supply; and the positive responses of diverse indicators of forest vitality in liming experiments indicate that Ca is more important to forest function and structure than has generally been recognized. Lack of recognition of Ca limitations is due in part to that fact some important plant functions are controlled by changes in very small physiologically active pools within the cytoplasm, and whole-leaf Ca levels may not reflect these limitations. An additional aspect is the fact that Ca availability has declined significantly for man!, forests in just the past few decades. Additional research on the role of Ca supply in resistance of forests to disease, changes in structural integrity of woody tissues, restrictions on rooting patterns and function, and uptake of other nutrients, notably N, is needed. Increased understanding of the physiological ecology of Ca supply can be anticipated to provide important insights that will aid in future protection and management of both natural and commercial forest systems.

AB  - The savannah biome supports unique biodiversity and provides a multitude of ecosystem services. Defining background concentrations for trace elements in the environment is beneficial for the determination of nutrient deficiencies/hotspots and for the management of pollution. Sediment and corresponding vegetation samples were collected around 48 surface water points in two savannah wildlife areas for assessment and comparison of 20 trace elements using ICP-MS. Site-specific and matrix-specific differences were evident for essential B, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se and Zn, potentially toxic As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb and V and additional elements Al, Ba, Sb, Sn and Sr analysed. Sediment and vegetation from all sampled locations at both sites contained single or multiple potentially toxic elements at various concentrations. Although the presence of all elements can be linked to underlying geology and geochemistry specific to each site, evidence of anthropogenic cause was also evident at both sites. This paper covers the widest range of trace elements assessed in protected terrestrial wildlife reserves in the South African savannah biome to date and highlights the potential for deleterious consequences of trace element contamination of the environment.

AB  - Prior to European settlement, the portion of north and central Florida corresponding to the historic range of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) was dominated by fire-dependent, herbaceous and open woodland plant communities. Economic development coupled with fire suppression lead to a drastic decline in the abundance, contiguity and integrity of these natural communities. We present a classification and description of natural, fire-maintained pineland communities of this highly fragmented landscape. Plot locations were stratified by region and topographic position to assure comprehensive coverage of compositional variation associated with local and regional gradients of environmental and geographic variation. Our focus was description of groundcover vegetation, which harbors most of the plant diversity. We censused all plant species within 293 vegetation plots of 1,000 m(2). We then developed a comprehensive vegetation classification based on floristic similarity using K-means cluster analysis and ordination. Sixteen distinct "communities" are recognized, corresponding to plant assemblages that we deem readily discernable in the field. These communities were grouped into five ecological "series" corresponding to those of Peet: Xeric Sandy Uplands (2 communities), Subxeric Sandy Uplands (2 communities), Silty Uplands (2 communities); Flatwoods (3 communities); and Wetlands (7 communities). For each community we summarize species diversity, woody plant structure, diagnostic (indicator) species, and environmental and physiographic characteristics. Floristic variation within and between series is described relative to geographic variation and edaphic characteristics.

AB  - We identify policies that would provide a solid foundation in key international negotiations to ensure that primary forests persist into the 21st Century. A novel compilation of primary forest cover and other data revealed that protection of primary forests is a matter of global concern being equally distributed between developed and developing countries. Almost all (98%) of primary forest is found within 25 countries with around half in five developed ones (USA, Canada, Russia, Australia, and NZ). Only approximate to 22% of primary forest is found in IUCN Protected Areas Categories I-VI, which is approximately 5% of preagriculture natural forest cover. Rates of deforestation and forest degradation are rapid and extensive, and the long-term integrity of primary forest cannot be assumed. We recommend four new actions that could be included in climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable development negotiations: (1) recognize primary forests as a matter of global concern within international negotiations; (2) incorporate primary forests into environmental accounting; (3) prioritize the principle of avoided loss; and (4) universally accept the important role of indigenous and community conserved areas. In the absence of specific policies for primary forest protection, their unique biodiversity values and ecosystem services will continue to erode.

AB  - Microbial communities are major players in the biogeochemical processes and ecosystem functioning of river networks. Despite their importance in the ecosystem, biomonitoring tools relying on prokaryotes are still lacking. Only a few studies have employed both metabarcoding and quantitative techniques such as catalysed reported deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) to analyse prokaryotic communities of epilithic biofilms in river ecosystems. We intended to investigate the efficacy of both techniques in detecting changes in microbial community structure associated with environmental drivers. We report a significant correlation between the prokaryotic community composition and pH in rivers from two different geographical areas in Norway. Both CARD-FISH and metabarcoding data were following the pattern of the environmental variables, but the main feature distinguishing the community composition was the regional difference itself. Beta-dispersion analyses on both CARD-FISH abundance and metabarcoding data revealed higher accuracy of metabarcoding to differentiate regions and river systems. The CARD-FISH results showed high variability, even for samples within the same river, probably due to some unmeasured microscale ecological variability which we could not resolve. We also present a statistical method, which uses variation coefficient and overall prevalence of taxonomic groups, to detect possible biological indicators among prokaryotes using metabarcoding data. The development of new prokaryotic bioindicators would benefit from both techniques used in this study, but metabarcoding seems to be faster and more reliable than CARD-FISH for large scale bio-assessment.

AB  - Free-living nematodes are efficiently used as bio-indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in marine ecosystems. Among various criteria, functional traits may represent useful tools for monitoring environmental impact in coastal areas. A study of nematode assemblages was carried out in three locations of the Central Adriatic Sea (Italy), one at the mouth of the Foglia River (Baia Flaminia) and two enclosed in the Monte San Bartolo Natural Park (Monte Brisighella and Fiorenzuola di Focara). Taxonomic composition and the functional traits of the nematode assemblage revealed a possible influence of the organic load of the Foglia River. Biotic data, as well as environmental parameters, suggested a particularly negative impact of the river on the assemblage at Baia Flaminia. Here, the increasing impact of the river led to a rise in the relative abundance of r-strategist genera like Chromadora, Sabatieria and Viscosia. Poor ecological conditions were also present at Brisighella, where the river might exert its influence due to the presence of long shore currents. In contrast, the results revealed that the best ecological quality was at Fiorenzuola di Focara, where the impact of anthropogenic activities was generally irrelevant. This study documents how nematodes can be used as an early warning indicator with which to monitor the health quality of vulnerable littoral areas.

AB  - The estimation of collection samples of naked oats by productivity and parameters of ecological plasticity in the conditions of the Northern TRANS Urals for 2012-2015 is given. The objects of the study were 34 samples of naked oats of different ecological and geographical origin, obtained from VNIIR im. N. I. Vavilova. The Eberhart and Russell method was used to characterize the ecological plasticity of the varieties of naked oats. It is based on the calculation of two parameters: the linear regression coefficient (bi) and the variance (sigma 2d). The first shows the response of the genotype to the improvement of growing conditions, and the second characterizes the stability of the variety in various environmental conditions. Assessment of the ecological plasticity of the varieties of naked oats by the linear regression coefficient (bi) showed that all varieties respond well to changes in growing conditions. We selected breeding material with high responsiveness to environmental conditions and a consistently high yield. These varieties should be used as sources in the selection process to obtain new genotypes with high adaptive properties.

AB  - A critical element of the ongoing effort to restore the ecological integrity of Florida's Kissimmee River ecosystem is the reestablishment of pre-channelization habitat structure and function. Restoration of habitat will form the basis for responses by most biological components of the ecosystem and will provide a key indicator of the success of the restoration effort. This paper evaluates the relative importance of a range of abiotic and biotic habitat parameters in the existing and historic Kissimmee River ecosystem and provides a conceptual framework for predicting expected spatial and temporal responses of river and floodplain habitats to the restoration project. Among the ecological factors and processes that influenced the development, dynamics, and maintenance of river and floodplain habitat structure, hydrology is expected to be of central importance in eliciting restoration responses in the Kissimmee River ecosystem. Based on the assumption that the restoration plan will reestablish historic hydrologic characteristics, predictions are made of expected responses by geomorphic and vegetative components of the Kissimmee River's habitat structure. Recommendations are made regarding key habitat parameters requiring long-term tracking and analysis and utilization of a geographic information system (GIS). A hierarchical habitat classification scheme is provided as a foundation for all components of the restoration evaluation program.

AB  - Assessing benthic quality status of marine and transitional water habitats requires to set up both: (i) tools (i.e. indices) to assess the relative quality of the considered habitat, and (ii) reference conditions for which such indices can be computed and used to infer the absolute ecological status (ES) of the considered habitat. The development of indices, their comparison and the assessment of the causes of their discrepancies have been largely discussed but less attention has been paid to the methods used for the setting of adequate reference conditions, although this step is clearly crucial for the sound assessment of ES. This contribution reviews the approaches available in setting both reference conditions (pristine areas, hindcasting, modelling and best professional judgment) and targets (baseline set in the past, current baseline and directional/trends). We scored the use of pristine or minimally impacted conditions as the best single method; however, the other methods were judged as adequate then combined with best professional judgment. The case of multivariate AMBI (AZTI's Marine Biotic Index) is used to highlight the importance of setting correct reference conditions. Hence, data from 29 references, including 14 countries from Europe and North America, and both coastal (15 cases) and transitional (17 cases) waters, have been used to study the response of multivariate AMBI to human pressures. Results show that the inability of this index to detect human pressure is in most cases linked with the use of inappropriate methods for setting reference conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban areas and their development depress water physicochemical properties, river habitats and aquatic biotic integrity world wide. Benthic macroinvertebrates at 61 sites representing three types of river reach locations (upstream rural areas, intermediate and downstream of urban areas) on the Liangtan River, a rapidly urbanized river with untreated sewage discharge in southwest China, were examined to compare their community composition and diversity. Their relationships with environmental variables were also explored. The results indicate a significant reduction in sensitive EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) species, dominance by a few tolerant taxa (Oligochaeta and Chironomidae), a significant decline in biodiversity and dominance of collector-gatherers at intermediate and downstream urban sites compared with aquatic macroinvertebrates at rural sites. The community composition of urban sites were different from those of rural sites and were quite similar to those of down stream sites, but maintained a much higher Oligochaeta density. The species-environment relation was predominately explained by the percentage of impervious area (PIA) and farmland at the catchment scale. At the local scale chemical oxygen demand (COD) and pH-value explained this relationship. Six community indicators, including richness, the Shannon-Wiener index, EPT(%), collector-filterers(%), scrapers(%) and collector-gatherers(%), had exponential relationships with PIA. Density of macroinvertebrates, Oligochaeta density, Oligochaeta(%), predator(%) and shredder(%) exhibited stepped threshold response patterns with PIA. Pielou's index had an approximately negative linear relationship with PIA. For exponential pattern, a threshold value of PIA between 10.6% and 14.4% was found. For stepped threshold response pattern, the first threshold was between 11.2% and 13.8%, and the second threshold was 23.8%. Our study indicates particularly great influences of urbanization with untreated sewage on macroinvertebrates and river ecosystems. PIA also showed to be a good indicator of urbanization and an accurate predictor of urban impacts on river macroinvertebrate integrity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid developments in computer techniques and the availability of large datasets open new perspectives for vegetation analysis aiming at better understanding of the ecology and functioning of ecosystems and underlying mechanisms. Information systems prove to be helpful tools in this new field. Such information systems may integrate different biological levels, viz. species, community and landscape. They incorporate a GIS platform for the visualization of the various layers of information. enabling the analysis of patterns and processes which relate the individual levels. An example of a newly developed information system is SynBioSys Europe, an initiative of the European Vegetation Survey (EVS). For the individual levels of the system, specific sources are available, notably national and regional Turboveg databases for the community level and data from the recently published European Map of Natural Vegetation for the landscape level. The structure of the system and its underlying databases allow user-defined queries. With regard to its application, such information systems may play a vital role in European nature planning, such as the implementation the EU-program Natura 2000. To illustrate the scope and perspectives of the program, some examples from The Netherlands are presented. They are dealing with long-term changes in grassland ecosystems, including shifts in distribution, floristic composition, and ecological indicator values.

AB  - Benthic nematodes are recognized as suitable organisms to provide valuable information on the potential ecological effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances in aquatic ecosystems. The biomass and morphometric attributes of nematodes (body length, width, and length/width) collected in the Mira estuary (SW Portugal) were analysed before the collapse and during the natural recovery process of the Zostera noltii bed. In addition, their relationship with community characteristics and environmental variables was studied. Moreover, biomass and morphometric attributes were investigated for their potential use as a complementary tool to the classical descriptor "density" (from which several other descriptors are derived) when studying nematodes as biological indicators. Nematode biomass and morphometric attributes proved to be valuable as correlate with the environmental changes associated with the Z. noltii collapse. High values of nematode biomass, length, width, and length/width ratio were observed during the early recovery process of Z. noltii, contrasting with nematode densities, which showed consistently higher values before the collapse. These findings suggest that biomass and morphometric attributes indicate a functional adaptation of nematode communities to the new environmental conditions in the early recovery process of Z. noltii. Therefore, these traits may be used to provide complementary information to standing stocks of nematode assemblages so as to assess ecological changes over spatial and temporal scales in marine ecosystems, particularly within seagrass bed habitats.

AB  - Since the 1960s the urgency to steer mankind towards a more sound environment has grown. Currently humanity is in a transition period between today's old paradigm - business as usual - and the new one, aiming at operationalise sustainable development goals. There is a growing understanding, that to move towards sustainable development, ecological sustainability is necessary but not sufficient. Steering society in this direction necessitates making decisions that at least do not counteract sustainability.
   Such decisions have to rest firmly on a natural scientific basis. Natural laws, such as thermodynamics, and conditions set by ecosystems can therefore not been ignored, when (a) searching for technical solutions to environmental problems and to fully understand the consequences of such solutions, and (b) improving steering instruments to guide human actions.
   Over the years a number of models/methods/systems have been developed to underpin sustainable decision-making, such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Ecological Footprints, and Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA). Ecological modelling contributes or complements such methods. Emergy analysis, an environmental accounting and assessment method takes a wider grip embracing both ecology and economy. Less known is environmental legal modelling.
   This paper puts ecological models in the context of societal steering systems for sustainable development, and focuses on a legal model for implementing environmental policy goals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding ecosystem functioning in a farmland context by considering the variety of ecological strategies employed by arthropods is a core challenge in ecology and conservation science. We adopted a functional approach in an assessment of the relationship between three functional plant groups (grasses, broad-leaves and legumes) and the arthropod community in winter wheat fields in a Mediterranean dryland context. We sampled the arthropod community as thoroughly as possible with a combination of suction catching and flight-interception trapping. All specimens were identified to the appropriate taxonomic level (family, genus or species) and classified according to their form of feeding: chewing-herbivores, sucking-herbivores, flower-consumers, omnivores, saprovores, parasitoids or predators. We found, a richer plant community favoured a greater diversity of herbivores and, in turn, a richness of herbivores and saprovores enhanced the communities of their natural enemies, which supports the classical trophic structure hypothesis. Grass cover had a positive effect on sucking-herbivores, saprovores and their natural enemies and is probably due to grasses' ability to provide, either directly or indirectly, alternative resources or simply by offering better environmental conditions. By including legumes in agroecosystems we can improve the conservation of beneficial arthropods like predators or parasitoids, and enhance the provision of ecosystem services such as natural pest control.

AB  - Farming, including family farming, is now dominated by vertically controlled operations that deplete the soil, pollute water, and produce food designed more to satisfy marketing requirements than human nutritional needs. Agricultural practices today are a result of abdicating control over our lives to a thoroughly industrialized culture, in which institutions are governed by the single criterion of efficiency--finding least-cost solutions. Standardization is a major part of that process. But living systems cannot be standardized. They require diversity and some degree of redundancy to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In the cultural contest between the machine and the garden, the machine has definitely won, but if we do not make room for the garden again, our victory will be our own funeral. New Agrarianism seeks to encourage diversity of species on each farm and across farms within entire landscapes. But farmers cannot carry out the restoration of ecologically-oriented agriculture on their own. They need support from cities: 1) in the form of markets to sell locally-grown produce at prices that will support their work, 2) in a new understanding of ecosystems that focuses on inhabited spaces and not just wilderness, and 3) in an orientation that questions whether efficiency should be the paramount value of our culture. Finally, the transition to more biologically-diverse human settlements can come about only if economic incentives are modified to remove the unrelenting pressure on farmers to expand their operations or go out of business.

AB  - Mayflies (Ephemeroptera) are a merolimnic insect order (part of the life cycle is aquatic) and play an important role as biological indicators of river ecosystem health. In the Afrotropical realm (including sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar), this order presently encompasses 122 genera and more than 400 species; all species and 85% of the genera are endemic to the Afrotropics. A great part of the diversity still remains unknown. The specific and generic diversity of mayfly families from Madagascar and from 4 sub-Saharan African subregions (West Africa, western Central Africa, eastern Central Africa, and southern Africa) is presented. A concurrent comparison of this diversity with the level of taxonomic knowledge for each subregion highlights inadequacy of knowledge. It is important for freshwater conservation biologists and ecologists, and for biomonitoring programs, to have a level of certainty when identifying taxa. This preliminary synthesis is intended to stimulate future taxonomic research and collecting efforts in understudied regions that will lead to species descriptions and recognition of the biodiversity of these regions. This information will feed into regional identification keys and enable more accurate species identification. Greater understanding of the diversity of organisms, the foundation for all ecological studies, can be used to refine biomonitoring protocols for freshwater organisms.

AB  - South African water law as well as the country's water resource management policies are currently under review. The Water Law Principles, which were established as part of this review process, indicate a commitment to sustainable development of water resources and the protection of an ecological "reserve." Such policy goals highlight the limitations of traditional and current water-quality management strategies, which rely on stressor monitoring and associated regulation of pollution. The concept of an assimilative capacity is central to the implementation of the current water-quality management approach. Weaknesses inherent in basing water management on the concept of assimilative capacity are discussed. Response monitoring is proposed as a way of addressing some of the weaknesses.
   Following a global trend, the new policy goals emphasize the need to protect rather than to use the ability of ecosystems to recover from disturbances. This necessitates the adoption of response measurements to quantify ecological condition and monitor ecological change. Response monitoring focuses on properties that are essential to the sustainability of the ecosystem. These monitoring tools can be used to establish natural ranges of ecological change within ecosystems, as well as to quantify conceptually acceptable and unacceptable ranges of change. Through a framework of biological criteria and biological impairment standards, the results of response monitoring can become an integral part of future water resource management strategies in South Africa.

In addition to addressing the multitude of stakeholder interests, the regulation plan review also considers environmental sustainability and integrity of wetlands and various ecosystem components. The present paper outlines the general approach, scientific methodology and applied management considerations of studies quantifying the relationships between hydrology and wetland plant assemblages (% occurrence, surface area) in Lake Ontario and the Upper and Lower St. Lawrence River. Although similar study designs were used across the study region, different methodologies were required that were specifically adapted to suit the important regional differences between the lake and river systems, range in water-level variations, and confounding factors (geomorphic types, exposure, sediment characteristics, downstream gradient of water quality, origin of water masses in the Lower River). Performance indicators (metrics), such as total area of wetland in meadow marsh vegetation type, that link wetland response to water levels will be used to assess the effects of different regulation plans under current and future (climate change) water-supply scenarios.

AB  - Despite immense diversity, insect conservation is typically species specific. Effective insect conservation will require efforts that capture insect species and communities at all levels of biological organization. Surrogate conservation targets, such as habitat based conservation planning tools were designed to capture poorly understood taxa such as invertebrates. We evaluated a botanically-based community filter across disturbance gradients in NW Indiana to determine if moth communities (Lepidoptera) responded similarly to vascular plant assemblages. Our 13 sample sites included high-quality ecosystem remnants (sand prairies and oak barrens) and their local degradation endpoints (exotic old fields and fire-suppressed oak woodlands). Monthly, we quantitatively sampled moths using ultraviolet light traps and inventoried vascular plant species at each sample site. Analysis of moth and plant community relationships using Bray-Curtis coefficients of dissimilarity produced statistically congruent relationships between moth and plant assemblages at. the sample sites indicating that these two taxonomic groups respond to ecological gradients and disturbance similarly. Other measures of botanical community integrity used to select conservation areas such as floristic quality assessment index and diversity indices do not translate directly to measures of moth species richness or diversity:We suggest that, in this system, vascular plant assemblages are a reasonable conservation surrogate for moth communities.

AB  - Society increasingly asks forestry agencies to consider maintenance of biodiversity alongside tree growth and wood supply when managing forests. In this paper we explore the mechanisms that managers currently have available to meet this expectation. When assessing three key indicators (trends in ecosystem and habitat extent, trends in distribution and abundance of species, and changes in status of threatened species), we found that managers lack the information for consistent, scientifically rigorous, unbiased reporting on the impact of their management on biodiversity in Canada. We outline the key characteristics of a controversial biodiversity monitoring approach that is taxonomically broad and cumulative-effects oriented. We argue that programs designed specifically to monitor biodiversity, although sometimes criticized as inefficient and ineffective, are statistically and biologically robust in the long term, especially compared to the status quo. Given the nature of biodiversity and the diversity of human impacts, if forest management agencies are sincere in their desire to manage biodiversity, they need to devote the same effort and scientific rigor used to monitor tree growth and harvest rates to develop standardized protocols and rigorous sampling designs for biodiversity monitoring. Federal and provincial governments, as well as the scientific community, will need to cooperate with and support forest managers in this new endeavour. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a rising urban age planning for cities around the globe is increasingly based on assessments of ecosystem services, making enhanced considerations of ecosystem service justice critically important. Yet, justice remains a 'blind spot' in urban ecosystem service models and research, which can be traced back to the ecological and economic legacies of the concept itself. This legacy reproduces the normative focus on natural capital as a guarantee of sustaining ecosystem services, enforces a static understanding of nature that insufficiently considers human agency, and conceptualizes ecosystem service flows from nature to humans in a way that does not reflect the social-ecological structure and constantly shifting priorities of the urban realm. In response, this conceptual paper aims at broadening the analytical foundation for justice in urban ecosystem service assessments by presenting a model that links the co-production of urban ecosystem services (including infrastructure, institutions, and perceptions) with established lines of recognition, procedural, and distributional justice. It further highlights the need to embed these classical dimensions of justice within both spatial (downscaled and inter-scalar approaches) and temporal (interrelated past, present, and future conditions) justice frames. Relying on urban environmental, social, spatial and temporal justice theory as well ecosystem service scholarship, we outline theoretical entry points and provide practical examples for weaving notions of justice into urban ecosystem service research and practice, while highlighting future research needs.

AB  - The present study examined air pollution effects on soil health applying microbiological parameters. It was carried out near the Angren heavy industry complex in a semiarid region of Uzbekistan. This area was selected in order to establish a national monitoring program for assessing environmental condition of areas remote but downwind from greater emission sources. Moreover, little information exists about how air pollution affects microbiological functioning of soils in semiarid and arid regions of the world, and especially those of Central Asia.
   Soil samples were collected in May 2005 along a 20-km NE-SW river valley transect downwind from the industrial complex. Soil chemical analyses included electrical conductivity, pH, water soluble Na, Ca, and K, total soluble nitrogen, and mineralizable nitrogen content upon a 1:2 digestion by deionized water. Major elements and heavy metal inventory in solids was measured by X-ray fluorescence and atomic absorption spectrometry. Microbiological ecosystem properties were assessed by biological indicators such as basal respiration (R (B)), microbial biomass related C and N contents, and microbial community functioning coefficients like the metabolic quotient qCO(2).
   There was a significant spatial dependence and differences for all soil chemical and microbiological parameters tested. The highest contents were found for the relatively volatile metals Zn (a parts per thousand currency sign1,136 mg/kg) and Pb (a parts per thousand currency sign373 mg/kg) in upper soil layers near the power station suggesting that the metal pollutants are derived from local stack emissions. Soil microflora was obviously affected by heavy metals. Significant positive correlations (p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.001) were found between the metal content, R (B), and qCO(2), while a negative one was found for the mineralizable N and C (mic)/C (org) ratio. A high total number of nematodes was found only most distant from the industrial emission sources.
   The results disclosed remarkable spatial dependence not only of the heavy metal impact onto the soil but also of microbiological soil properties in the study area. The latter suggests bioavailability of the anthropogenic metals in the soil affecting the soil microbial community. This is suggested by less biomass formation and higher qCO(2) values in heavy metal-contaminated compared to less-polluted soil plots.
   Knowledge of these spatial ecosystem functioning patterns and dependence could be very useful in determining and delineating specific land use and management programs that would be suited and feasible for the highly polluted area. Results of this study can be utilized to develop a monitoring program that may quantify harmful effects on the soil health and impact of any future remediation activities.
   Studies on the relationship between soil biota and pollution levels have raised the question regarding the status of natural soil microbial health, stressing the importance of background data of environmental conditions, and elucidating the importance of this environmental monitoring approach even in semiarid and arid regions. Soil microbiological parameters, in particular the metabolic quotient qCO(2) as one of the most sensitive bioindicators identified for that region, should clearly become part of the national environmental monitoring program.

AB  - Stormwater ponds ("SWPs") are artificial roadside structures, conceived to retain and clean polluted runoff water, before its release to the environment. SWPs were not designed as suitable habitats for wildlife. However, SWPs in Europe are frequently used as breeding sites by amphibians, especially by the European green frog (Pelophylax sp.). Yet, the potential long-term effects of pollutants within SWPs on the populations of this species are unknown. In this study, we investigated the suitability of SWPs as a habitat for European green frogs living in Alsace, NE France, a region with a highly modified landscape that mainly consists of croplands with few natural wetlands remaining. We compared various biological indicators of individual health in 709 green frogs belonging to different life history stages, living in 9 semi-natural ponds (SNPs) and in 25 SWPs. There were no differences between these two pond types for most of the indicators investigated. However, juveniles had a lower body condition (-124%) in SWPs, while adults were 8.3% larger and 41.4% heavier in SWPs. Based on these results, we suggest that SWPs are not a suitable habitat for the development of European green frogs (i.e. juveniles), but may serve as a substitute habitat for adults in a highly modified landscape with few natural wetlands remaining. SWPs may especially act as relay sites, allowing frogs to colonize relict wetlands.

AB  - This paper outlines two of the dominant ecosystem-management paradigms, one based on the traditional paradigm of ecological risk assessment and the other based on the health paradigm of ecological risk assessment. After showing the central ethical strengths and weaknesses of the traditional paradigm and the health paradigm, the essay argues that the uncertainties surrounding these two paradigms require ecosystem management to focus on default assumptions. The argument is that, just as most of the major battles of risk management are being fought on the ground of stakeholder participation and default assumptions, so most of the important battles of ecosystem management need to be fought on the battleground of stakeholder participation and default assumptions. Otherwise massive scientific uncertainties will compromise the credibility of both ecology and environmental management. Coping with problems from dioxin to nuclear power, the contemporary risk-management community is witnessing a dramatic battle between 'environmental hypochondriacs' and 'industrial cannibals' [Shrader-Frechette, K., 1994. Risk and ethics. In: Lindell, B. (Ed.), Comprehending Radiation Risks. Swedish Risk Academy, Stockholm, pp. 167-182]. The environmental hypochondriacs often argue that only zero risk is ethically and environmentally acceptable. They forget that virtually nothing has zero risk, provided analysis can detect the smallest threats. The industrial cannibals frequently maintain that almost any level of risk is justifiable, provided that the economic benefits are substantial enough. They forget that not everything has a price. In more sophisticated and realistic risk-management circles, a similar battle pits the wholists against the reductionists. The wholists believe that risk is a multiattribute concept. For them, health and environmental risks are complex and extra-scientific, involving not only threats to human and planetary safety but also threats to values-to trust, autonomy, sustainability, cultural integrity, equal protection, due process, future generations, and free informed consent [Slovic, p., Flynn, J., Layman, M., 1991. Perceived risk, trust, and the politics of nuclear waste. Science, 254, pp. 1604-1605; Shrader-Frechette, K., 1991. Risk and Rationality. Univ. of California Press, Berkeley]. The wholists believe that we manage health and environmental risks by reducing them and by enlisting the active participation of stakeholders in risk management. The reductionists, following part of the classic National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences 'Redbook' account of risk, maintain that risk is a scientific concept. For them, health and environmental risks must be assessed scientifically, typically as an average annual probability of fatality [National Research Council, 1983. Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process. National Academy Press, Washington, DC]. Following this definition, many reductionists believe that we handle health and environmental risks by educating members of the public-who supposedly are irrational, scientifically ignorant, and paranoid [Weinberg, A., 1988. Risk assessment, regulation, and the limits. In: Woodhead, A., Bender, M., Leonard, R. (Eds.), Phenotypic Variation in Populations. Plenum, New York, pp. 126-127]-and by having technical experts control risk management. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The study was conducted as a part of the selection of the objects of phytomonitoring for the environmental assessment on the value of fluctuating asymmetry of bilateral morphological parameters. The territorial structure of flora of tree layer in Akhtubinsk and its local areas was determined as of 2013. The living conditions and species and quantitative composition of the tree layer of urban landscape were examined. The vital status of trees was assessed on a ten-point scale of the categories: good condition; satisfactory; weakened plants (Bukharina and Dvoeglazova 2010). The quantitative assessment of biodiversity of tree layer was made on the basis of conventional indices of individual dominance and dominating structures, as well as the method of multivariate statistical analysis. This is an objective method that has been used by other authors in a variety of the environmental studies for a long time, but it has not been actively used in the studies of the Astrakhan area vegetation yet. The results of the study make it possible to believe that the most appropriate indicator of tree vegetation for biomonitoring of intact floodplain, residential and recreational areas in the urban territory in the arid climate of the Volga-Akhtuba floodplain is the Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia Jacq.), as the most widespread, numerous and sensitive. It is noted that the tree vegetation cannot be a universal bioindicator of the urban environment in Akhtubinsk and its local areas by fluctuating asymmetry of bilateral morphological parameters.

AB  - For sustainability of a region, a holistic view is necessary to understand its dynamics and the conditions surrounding cities and beyond. Conservation activity indicators can be instrumental in this context, yet they can be simultaneously counterproductive in areas where intra-city sectionalisms exist. With regard to urban biodiversity, Singapore proposed an index to evaluate the biodiversity, ecosystem services, and governance specific for the cities. The index, known also as "City Biodiversity Index," is currently applied worldwide. We analyzed the relationships between local biodiversity management in twenty populated cities in Japan and their social and ecological characteristics in order to identify the characteristics necessary for the smooth functioning of indicator-based management practices. As a result, cities with high percentages of built-up areas (with limited natural resources) tended to implement quantitative evaluations for biodiversity, although most of the twenty analyzed cities conducted participatory monitoring with stakeholder involvement. Furthermore, we identified that collaborations among different government sectors can be linked to certain ecological conditions; municipalities with relatively large amounts of forest land per capita (with many natural resources) tend to implement collaborations. Our findings suggest that indicator-based monitoring and management practices conducted through collaborations among different sectors are common challenges in municipal biodiversity management. Using the indicators could promote dealing with these challenges and contribute toward maintaining biodiversity in a wider range of regions.

AB  - Understanding the structure and function of urban landscapes requires integrating social and ecological research. Here, we integrate parallel social and ecological assessments of natural areas within New York City. We examined social data (from a rapid assessment of park use and meaning, collected at a park zone level) alongside ecological data (from a plot-based assessment of forest structure and diversity). In-depth interviews with researchers and managers (n=11) involved with the social and ecological assessments revealed commonly-held values considered critical for integration, including clear communication, openness, trust, and shared goals and also identified barriers to the integration process, including the scales at which each dataset was collected. We applied an informed, shared problem framing to investigate the relationships between visitor use and ecological condition in urban natural areas. We began with fuzzy cognitive modeling, where researchers developed models of defining a healthy urban forest. We then developed two social-ecological typologies to examine the integrated dataset in relation to how visitors may affect or perceive ecological health and threat. Typologies identify NYC natural areas where social indicators (number of visitors, diversity of park use motivations) are either high or low and ecological condition is either high or low. Examination of these typologies led to exploring correlations between social and ecological variables, to team discussions, and to developing new research questions. We conclude this paper with a discussion of tradeoffs of this type of emergent, integrative approach to social-ecological synthesis research.

AB  - The potential toxic risk of mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) in the soils of mining regions and other artificially disturbed lands receives considerable research attention. However, limited investigation has been conducted into the surface soils of natural globally distributed ecosystems, for example peatlands. In this study, we examine the distribution, controlling factors, sources, and potential ecological risks of Hg and As in 96 samples from 42 peatlands in the Changbai Mountains of northeastern China. The results showed that average concentrations (dry weight) of Hg and As at the samples sites were 169.1 +/- 0.1 mu g kg(-1)and 13.0 +/- 7.7mgkg(-1), respectively. The distribution of Hg is largely determined by latitude and altitude, while As is controlled more by pH, total organic carbon (TOC), and ratio of TOC and nitrogen (C/N) at the regional scale. Variations in TOC, C/N ratio, and redox conditions contribute to determining the distribution of Hg, while TOC and redox conditions mainly affected the distribution of Arsenic at the local scale. Mercury mostly comes from regional atmospheric wet deposition, whereas elevated concentrations of As are related to local anthropogenic activities. Overall, Hg and As in the peatlands of the Changbai Mountains pose a moderate level of potential risk to ecological health.

AB  - An assessment of the potential risks to ecological resources from remediation activities or other perturbations should involve a quantitative evaluation of resources on the remediation site and in the surrounding environment. We developed a risk methodology to rapidly evaluate potential impact on ecological resources for the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford Site in southcentral Washington State. We describe the application of the risk evaluation for two case studies to illustrate its applicability. The ecological assessment involves examining previous sources of information for the site, defining different resource levels from 0 to 5. We also developed a risk rating scale from non-discernable to very high. Field assessment is the critical step to determine resource levels or to determine if current conditions are the same as previously evaluated. We provide a rapid assessment method for current ecological conditions that can be compared to previous site-specific data, or that can be used to assess resource value on other sites where ecological information is not generally available. The method is applicable to other Department of Energy's sites, where its development may involve a range of state regulators, resource trustees, Tribes and other stakeholders. Achieving consistency across Department of Energy's sites for valuation of ecological resources on remediation sites will assure Congress and the public that funds and personnel are being deployed appropriately.

AB  - Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, has been facing shrinkage and environmental problems in recent years, making it imperative to assess the status of its ecosystem. In this study, such an assessment was conducted based on the trophic status index, phytoplankton biomass, the ratio of zooplankton biomass to phytoplankton biomass, eco-exergy, structural eco-exergy, and ecological buffer capacity to total phosphorus for phytoplankton. First, the spatial and temporal variations of the ecosystem status in Poyang Lake were assessed based on these six indicators. Then, cluster analysis was utilized to classify the 15 sites based on the various indicators and to identify the most influential indicators. The results showed that the ecological status of Poyang Lake was affected not only by eutrophication but also by hydrological characteristics. All of the 15 sites had deteriorated to a certain degree. An analysis of the relative spatial ecological status showed that the status of the water in the rivers was superior to the status of water in the central lake. Furthermore, the relative ecological status was found to be best in summer and second best in autumn with ecological status deteriorating in winter. There was no significant correlation between eco-exergy and trophic status index, but a very strong relationship was found between eco-exergy and macrozoobenthos biomass with an R-2 of 0.92, indicating that macrozoobenthos contributed greatly to the eco-exergy.

AB  - Biological monitoring and assessment are the first and most fundamental steps towards diagnosing ecological or environmental quality. Increasing anthropogenic impact on urban ecosystems has prompted the development of less expensive and more efficient bioassessment approaches. Generally, a morphospecies based approach is effective for plants and large organisms but challenging for the microbial biosphere. To overcome this challenge, we used high-throughput DNA sequencing for predicting anthropogenic effects on microeukaryotic communities in urban waterbodies along a pollution gradient in Wuhan City, central China in summer 2019. Our results indicated that microeukaryotic community structure was distinct between non-urban polluted reservoir and urban polluted waterbodies. The heterogeneity of environmental condition significantly affected the microeukaryotic diversity, community structure, and species interactions. Integrated co-occurring network analysis revealed that the pollution gradient has a significant adverse impact on network complexity and network dissimilarity. These results revealed that the significant variation in anthropogenically-driven environmental condition shaped microeukaryotic communities in urban freshwater ecosystems. Furthermore, we observed that the relative abundance of indicative OTUs were significantly and negatively correlated with pollution level and these indicative OTUs could be used to predict the water quality status with up to 77% success. Thus, our multiple approaches combining 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing, co-occurring network and indicator species analyses suggest that this study gives a novel approach based on microeukaryotic communities to assess and predict the water quality status of urban aquatic environments.

AB  - The interest in benthic indicators for soft-bottom marine communities has dramatically increased after a rather long period of relative stagnation due to the need for new tools to assess the status of marine waters, called for by the Clean Water Act and the Water Framework Directive. Our expertise on benthic communities has permitted us to gather a vast amount of data from diverse water bodies under unpolluted and polluted conditions (e.g.. accidental oil spill, sewage, long-term anthropogenic estuarine constraints) in tidal estuaries, harbours, and on the coastal shelf from Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. We compared the results of four biotic indices on the various available datasets: Shannon-Wiener H' diversity, AMBI and BO2A, which divide the species into Ecological Groups, and ITI, which divides the species into trophic groups, and the agreement of Best Professional Judgement (BPJ) on the assessment of ecological conditions. Benthic indicators as "sentinel species", which is a particular species that by its presence or its relative abundance warns of possible unbalances in the surrounding environment or distortions in community functions, was also tested. Indicators. BPJ and opportunist sentinel species gave similar ECoQS for the different sampling sites. We discuss the use of Biological Indicators as 'objective' or 'subjective' alternatives for assessing soft-bottom communities, and propose to employ simple methods such as BPJ and taxonomy sufficiency in such diagnostic approaches.

AB  - Songnen Plain is originally one of the three major glasslands in China and has now become one of the three most concentrated distribution areas of sodic-saline soil worldwide. The soil is continuously degraded by natural and anthropogenic processes, which has a negative impact on agricultural production. The investigation of microbial diversity in this degraded ecosystem is fundamental for comprehending biological and ecological processes and harnessing the potential of microbial resources. The Illumina MiSeq sequencing method was practiced to investigate the bacterial diversity and composition in saline-alkali soil. The results from this study show that the change in pH under alkaline conditions was not the major contributor in shaping bacterial community in Songnen Plain. The electrical conductivity (EC) content of soil was the most important driving force for bacterial composition (20.83%), and the second most influencing factor was Na+ content (14.17%). Bacterial communities were clearly separated in accordance with the EC. The dominant bacterial groups were Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes among the different salinity soil. As the salt concentration increased, the indicators changed from Planctomycetes and Bacteroidetes to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Our results suggest that Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the main indicator species reflecting changes of the main microbial groups and the EC as a key factor drives the composition of the bacterial community under alkaline conditions in saline-alkali soil of Songnen Plain.

AB  - Shallow lakes are ecologically and economically important ecosystems because they are significant for biodiversity and they provide many ecosystem services, but most of them are under the eutrophication and desiccation hazard. The first approach towards the evaluation of ecologic conditions of a lake is to determine the patterns of the biological communities, and zooplankton is one of the best indicators. Zooplankton have an important position in the food web between the upper and lower layers both as prey and consumer. Therefore, the determination of species composition and the diversity of zooplankton in a shallow lake can be used as a biological indicator of ecosystem health. In the present study, monthly (except snow covered months) zooplankton variation of Lake Hafik (Sivas, Turkey), and their interaction with the environmental conditions were studied for the first time. Lake Hafik is a mesotrophic lake based on its limnological variables. A total of 19 zooplankton species were recorded with Crustaceans (86% of the total zooplankton abundance) were being dominant. The main abundant taxa (N% > 5 of the total zooplankton abundance) were copepod nauplii, Arctodiaptomus bacillifer (Koelbel, 1885), Keratella quadrata (Muller, 1786), and Daphnia (Daphnia) cucullata Sars, 1862, respectively. The high density and biomass of the zooplankton were determined in May. In terms of diversity, Lake Hafik was not rich. Statistically, the rotifer density and biomass were mainly affected by physical variables (temperature, DO, and pH), whereas the crustaceans was primarily related to nutrients and EC.

AB  - Changes in the abundance and distribution of marine benthic hydrozoan species are indicative of variations in environmental conditions in the marine realm. The comparative analysis of such assemblages can improve our understanding of environmental and ecological conditions in the Sea of Marmara, a strongly stratified and heavily populated inland sea connecting the Aegean and Black seas, on route of national and international maritime traffic. We compared the hydrozoan assemblages occurring in harbours with those developed at natural sites, as well as the assemblages associated with the Black Sea water mass versus the Mediterranean water mass in the vicinities of the Prince Islands, the north-easternmost section of the Sea of Marmara. Sampling took place at 12 stations, once in March 2015 and once in August 2015 in order to cover species with both warm and cold water affinities. Multivariate analyses showed that benthic hydroid assemblages with both affinities differed significantly between the heavily trafficked harbours of the Prince Islands (connected to the metropolis of Istanbul) and areas without human settlements and maritime traffic. In addition, highly distinct hydroid assemblages were found characterizing both areas with water of Mediterranean origin and areas with water from Black Sea origin. Based on our results, we discuss the potential for the use of these organisms as indicators of water masses and anthropogenic impact at the regional level.

AB  - The ability to cope with environmental stress may be expensive in terms of energy and this cost of tolerance is suspected to have negative counterparts such as reduced growth and fecundity. To date, condition indices based on biometric measurements are currently used in bivalves or fish but do not exist in endobenthic worms, despite their interest as bioindicators for the sedimentary compartment in which the major part of pollutants is stored in aquatic environments. In the present work, several biometric variables (jaw and total body length, number of segments, the length of the first three segments L3, wet or dry weight) were measured in the ragworm Nereis diversicolor originating from clean (Authie) and polluted (Seine) estuaries (France) to study size-weight relationships. The production of oocytes by females (which represent 80-90% of the population) was quantified in the same specimens. In females from the polluted site, the condition was shown to be altered and, in parallel, the production of oocytes was lower than in females from the comparatively clean site. From an operational point of view, we recommend the use of the length L3 and the wet weight. Because fecundity is mainly dependent on size and weight in N. diversicolor, biometric measurements would be useful tools for assessing the biological quality of estuarine sediments.

AB  - Biochar has various ecological effects on heavy metal-contaminated soils. Biochar can passivate the activity of heavy metals and improve environmental conditions for microbial growth. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to explore the diversity of microbes in red soil under cadmium (Cd) stress following the application of wheat straw biochar. The contaminant Cd was prepared at 2.5 mg kg(-1) with deionized water to simulate the heavy metal pollution of red soil under natural conditions, and the proportions of wheat straw biochar used were 2.5% and 10%. The complete genetic diversity of red soil bacteria in this study was evaluated using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the bacterial genetic diversity of Cd-contaminated red soils was restored with biochar treatment, and recovery with 2.5% biochar was significant. Biochar significantly affected the richness of soil bacteria by 6.79%-21.04%. Forty-three phyla of bacteria, including Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes, constituted the bacterial community in the red soils. Further principal component analysis showed that Cd pollution and biochar application collectively affected the bacterial genetic diversity. Hydrogenophaga, Rubrivivax, Haliscomenobacter, Citrobacter, Methylibium and Azospirillum were indicator strains for Cd-contaminated red soils, while Steroidobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Anaerolinea, Chloronema Dubinina and Gorlenko were key strains for the biochar remediation of Cd contamination. In conclusion, for soil polluted with 2.5 mg kg Cd-1, the application of 2.5% wheat straw biochar significantly increases soil microbial abundance and genetic diversity and plays an active role in improving the soil micro-ecosystem.

AB  - Current regulatory practice for chemical risk assessment suffers from the lack of realism in conventional frameworks. Despite significant advances in exposure and ecological effect modeling, the implementation of novel approaches as high-tier options for prospective regulatory risk assessment remains limited, particularly among general chemicals such as down-the-drain ingredients. While reviewing the current state of the art in environmental exposure and ecological effect modeling, we propose a scenario-based framework that enables a better integration of exposure and effect assessments in a tiered approach. Global-to catchment-scale spatially explicit exposure models can be used to identify areas of higher exposure and to generate ecologically relevant exposure information for input into effect models. Numerous examples of mechanistic ecological effect models demonstrate that it is technically feasible to extrapolate from individual-level effects to effects at higher levels of biological organization and from laboratory to environmental conditions. However, the data required to parameterize effect models that can embrace the complexity of ecosystems are large and require a targeted approach. Experimental efforts should, therefore, focus on vulnerable species and/or traits and ecological conditions of relevance. We outline key research needs to address the challenges that currently hinder the practical application of advanced model-based approaches to risk assessment of down-the-drain chemicals.

AB  - Short-term variations of soil conditions affect the form, mobility and bioavailability of metal pollutants. Released metals migrate toward depth where they are intercepted or precipitate, leading to variable spatial metal distribution patterns, at a macro-, meso- and microscale. Studies at a mesoscale give access to trace metal (TM) associations induced by pedological processes. Although scarcely documented, such meso-scale studies represent an essential step for relevant environmental risk assessment, halfway between field- and molecular-scale investigations. We argued for such approach by performing optical microscopy and micro-X-ray fluorescence on thin sections from two soils, contaminated either by industrial zinc-smelter waste or by urban wastewater. Consistent correlation between key indicators of pedological processes (Fe, Mn, and Ca) and trace metals (Zn, Pb, and Cu) on some 20 elemental maps of TM-hosting soil constituents and pedofeatures reveal distinct coinciding localizations, illustrating TM-accumulation via interception or (co)-precipitation processes. Micromorphological interpretation of characteristic pedofeatures in subsurface horizons (crystals, argillans, ferrans, and mangans) containing significant amounts of TM provide valuable insight into the contaminant dynamics in terms of lixiviation, colloidal transport, redox conditions, or fungal activity. Our mesoscale approach stresses the importance of pedology-based sampling strategies, instead of systematic soil-depth sampling, for soil contamination research in natural ecosystems.

AB  - Despite intensive efforts for more than a decade to develop Water Framework-compliant assessment systems, shortcomings continue to appear. In particular, the lack of reference conditions has hindered the development of assessment systems capturing the heart of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) - that ecological status should be set as the deviation from the natural, undisturbed condition. Recently, the Danish Stream Plant Index (DSPI) was developed. This system contrasts existing systems in that it builds on an expert interpretation of the normative definitions of ecological status classes in the WFD without taking pressure-impact relationships into account. Here, we substantiate the approach taken in the development of DSPI and examine whether the DSPI class decreases with increasing level of anthropogenic stress and, additionally, whether the deviation from the natural undisturbed condition increases with decreasing DSPI class sensu WFD using trait composition of plant assemblages from Danish streams around year 1900 as a reference. We furthermore examine the trait composition of the vegetation in sites classified into different DSPI status classes to explore whether predictable patterns exist that can be used to identify the ultimate cause(s) of failure to meet ecological goals and help guide the selection of appropriate mitigation measures. We observed that DSPI declined with several parameters indicative of environmental stress in Danish streams and, furthermore, that the deviation from the natural undisturbed condition regarding the trait composition of plant communities declined with increasing DSPI, implying that the trait composition of plant communities in the high DSPI status class was most similar to those occurring in Danish streams around year 1900. We also found that trait characteristics capable of disentangling important stressors in Danish streams varied consistently among sites classified into different DSPI classes.
   Based on our findings, we call for new thinking. We suggest that more effort should be directed at describing reference conditions and interpreting the normative definitions of good, moderate, poor and bad instead of focusing solely on developing assessment systems using pressure-impact frameworks. We find this particularly important with respect to streams as these are seldom impacted by only a single stressor.

AB  - Condition-dependent sexually selected traits are thought to indicate an individual's quality or breeding value for fitness. Variation in developmental environments, however, introduces much complexity to resource allocation, and therefore, to phenotypic expression. The extent to which environment-specific developmental tactics interact with resource allocation and impinge on the relationship between condition and adult phenotype remains largely untested. Here, we used the black field cricket (Teleogryllus commodus), a species known to modify allocation tactics in response to both nutrition and social environments, to examine whether socially cued plasticity affects condition-dependent trait expression. We reared juvenile males in a 2 by 2 factorial experiment, crossing 2 social environments with 2 diets, and examined allocation toward life-history, morphological traits and costly sexual signaling (i.e., calling) in adulthood. Although diet significantly affected phenotypes during the second-last juvenile stadium, shifts in development rate in response to both the nutrient and social environment during the last juvenile stadium obscured the effects of condition on male phenotypes. Our results suggest that sexually selected signals may be poor indicators of individual quality due to interactions among sources of environmental variance. We suggest that the correlation between trait expression and condition is more complex under natural environments than most literature in this area assumes.

AB  - Standard weight (W-s) equations were developed for sardine (Sardinops sagax) in the southern Benguela ecosystem and used to provide fixed baselines for calculating relative weight (W-r) indices. The method was applied to a database of sardine length and weight measurements collected from South African coastal waters from 1953 to 2010. Statistical properties of the standard weight equations were investigated, as well as their application to sardine. Four quadratic standard-weight equations were established, using medians, means and first and third quartiles of log(10)-transformed weight measurements (Y) per log(10)-transformed caudal length class (X). A model using medians (Y = -1.825 + 2.679X + 0.224X(2)) is proposed as the preferred baseline for W-s, values for southern Benguela sardine, and is used to calculate W-r values over time and space. The W-r indices showed periods and areas of varied fish condition, with W-r ranging from 50 to 150 for individual fish and 97 to 106 for annual averages. The mean annual W-r index was low during the 1950s and increased to peak levels during the 1970s and 1980s, after which it showed a steady decline to 2010. There were pronounced spatial differences in sardine W-r, with both the lowest and the highest mean values seen in sardine from the upper and lower west coast, respectively, and fish from the southwest and south coast showing little difference in mean W-r. Possible causes of these temporal and spatial dynamics include environmental and ecological factors. Using sardine as an example of an exploited fish species in a changing ecosystem, we show how the W-r index could indicate the status of the population's body condition.

AB  - This article is devoted to the ecological problem of effective urban landscaping and increasing the role of green plantings in stabilizing the environment. The paper summarizes the material on the complex bioecological assessment of functionally different urban green areas of Vladivostok. There are six types of urban plantings: ordinary plantings, squares, intraquarter gardening, old city public gardens, city parks, and intraurban recreational forests. The questions of the specificity of their species composition, conditions of growth, and the intensity of influencing anthropogenic press are considered. An almost fourfold increase of environmental stress in the following series is noted: city parks -> intra-quarter gardening -> intraurban recreational forests -> old city public gardens -> line plantings -> squares. Most attention is paid to a comparative analysis of tree-shrub species and plantation accumulation of heavy metals: the main markers of technogenic pollution of the urban environment. The correlation regularities in the accumulation of heavy metals by plants in the conditions of Vladivostok urban ecosystems were found and a geochemical association of the main metal pollutants was established: Fe-4.1 Zn-2.0 Pb-1.9 Cu-1,Cu-4 Ni-1.3. It is shown that the intensity of heavy-metal transformation by green plantings increases 3 times in a ranked series: intraurban recreational forest -> city parks -> old city public gardens -> intra-quarter gardening -> squares -> line plantings. On the basis of the research and earlier results, a complex assessment of the functional condition of city green plantings is performed. For a practical solution, the author offers the functional status index (IFS) of plantings as an integral indicator of the ecological condition of vegetation and soils of green plantings and their capability for heavy-metal transformation in the conditions of the urbanized environment. The high functional status of ordinary plantings and squares, caused mainly by the active accumulation of heavy metals by soils and plants, is noted. This index is one and a half times lower for old city gardens and intraurban recreational forests. In conclusion, the author recommends using the results in the organization of a rational system of urban landscaping and differentiated measures of care for plantations of various functional purposes.

AB  - The study dealt with the patterns of adaptation of the genus Berberis L. low-abundant alien plants to the climatic conditions of the steppe zone of Ukraine. The success of the introduction, which was conducted on the territory of the Botanical Garden of Oles Honchar Dnipro National University (city of Dnipro) near 60 years ago, was evaluated by a set of indicators. According to the study of phenological rhythms, introduced plants can be characterized as plants with a relatively short growing season, a relatively long shoot growth, a short flowering period and a long maturing period. This indicates the lability of the phenological rhythms of the introduced plants, which respond to changes in environmental conditions in terms of the beginning and end of the phenological phases. The aquatic regime of introduced plants reflects the level of their adaptation to the environment due to the ability of plant organism to withstand water consumption. The study of water exchange features of Berberis L. plants revealed a moderate decrease in the intensity of transpiration and a moderate water deficit in the plant leaves, which indicates the adaptation of the species to the difficult climatic conditions of the steppe zone. The response of introduced plants to the level of moisture in the steppe region confirmed the universal mechanism of plant adaptation to arid conditions. Comparative analysis of the reproductive ability of introduced plants of the genus Berberis L. in the conditions of the Botanical Garden revealed a significant variability of quantitative indicators. The weight of 100 fruits ranged from 12.5 g (B. vulgaris) to 16.3 g (B. declinata). Seed length varied from 4.5 mm (B. canadensis) to 5.2 mm (B. declinata, B. amurensis), seed width varied from 1.8 mm (B. amurensis, B. vulgaris) to 2.1 mm (B. koreana). The highest mass of 1000 seeds was observed in the species B. koreana. To compare sample averages, the criterion for the significant difference of Tukey's group averages was used. The investigated plants of the genus Berberis L. can be recommended for the introduction into large-scale and individual gardening in order to expand the range of fruit products and obtain biologically valuable raw materials for the industrial production of functional products.

AB  - GIS technologies are considered to be important tools for the assessment of environmental conditions and for decision making in coal-mining regions with high anthropogenic load in foreign countries. The geodata base that has been developed for the Kizel coal basin (Perm krai) abandoned at the beginning of the XXI century is an information basis to solve some spatial tasks. Among them are monitoring, assessment and forecast of negative consequences of anthropogenic activity, development of new approaches to an objective analysis of ecological damage, a spatial analysis and a hazard level assessment of natural component pollution. The tasks also include scientific substantiation and planning of recultivation measures and other applied tasks.

AB  - The anhydrosugars, levoglucosan, mannosan and galactosan, are regarded as suitable molecular indicators of natural biomass combustion. Here, we evaluate summed anhydrosugars (SAS) as a paleofire indicator in a 6000 year-long fossil core from Agios Floros fen, Peloponnese, Greece, by analyzing charcoal fragments in parallel, throughout the sediment sequence. Modern surface soil samples from the same region were analysed for the presence of SAS, confirming the biomarker as an indicator of recent fire activity. The highest SAS concentrations in the fossil core were found in sections representing periods of wet conditions, both on local and regional scales and regionally widespread arboreal vegetation. Low amounts, or the absence, of SAS in the fossil core were associated with periods of dryness, regional dominance of non-arboreal vegetation and the presence of a fen rather than a lake ecosystem at the site. Micro-charcoal fragments were generally more abundant under these conditions. This suggests that SAS yield and deposition may vary with fuel availability and fire behavior, which in turn is affected by climate, local moisture and vegetation type. Forest fires result in more SAS compared to grass fires. SAS yield is also favored by low-temperature fires sustained under wet climate conditions. Preservation of SAS is likely to be compromised in the only seasonally wet fen ecosystem under the dry and warm Mediterranean climate conditions. The moist and shallow conditions in the wetland during hot summer months probably promote oxidation and biodegradation of the labile SAS molecules, compared to the more robust charcoal fragments. Thus, a multiproxy approach - using several proxies, both for fire, hydroclimate and vegetation change - is preferred when aiming to reconstruct past biomass burning from wetland ecosystems in a Mediterranean environment. The micro-charcoal record from Agios Floros reveals significant fire activity between 4400 and 2800 cal yr BP. This partly overlaps the Bronze Age period, associated with intense human environmental interaction and climate change in this area of Peloponnese, Greece. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Definitions for "forest" and "woodland" are heterogeneous around the world. Great diversity and diffuse thresholds among ecosystems hinder the construction of criteria for the definition of woodlands. The focus of this review is to deconstruct structural definitions for forests and woodlands. Three fundamental conditions are proposed. A synthesis of the most relevant criteria for the definition and evaluation of forests and woodlands is presented, describing the basic functional aspects for the construction of sustainability indicators. Three conditions are defined: self-organization, dynamics and teleonomy; including different criteria: diversity, reliability and redundancy, fragmentation, connectivity, resilience and stability, and regeneration. Woodlands functioning should be the main condition for its inclusion in natural resources laws for the management and conservancy, according to the local context. Generalization of conditions for all woodlands in the world or in a particular country is unpractical and should encompass the expected functional criteria according to local context.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are open, complex, adaptive, and hierarchical systems highly integrated through the exchange of matter and energy flows. This flows exchange allows marine ecosystems to operate at different scales acting as dissipative structures, building natural capital stocks capable of generating several ecosystem services vital for human well-being. Humans derive a wide range of goods and services from marine ecosystems while, at the same time, generate several impacts causing biodiversity loss and seriously affecting their capacity to provide benefits to humans. Effective management strategies are crucial to conserve healthy and diverse marine and coastal ecosystems, maintain the valuable functions and services they provide, and allow for sustainable human activities. In recent years, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been increasingly acknowledged worldwide as important tools to conserve biodiversity and achieve human well-being and sustainable development goals. Assessing the value of natural capital and ecosystem services is crucial to raise awareness on their importance, support conservation strategies, and ensure the sustainable management of marine ecosystems. This study aimed at calculating biomass and emergy-based indicators to assess the value of natural capital stocks in a Mediterranean MPA. The assessment was performed through a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model fed with field biomass data collected through ad hoc sampling campaigns performed in the MPA. Four main macro-habitats were investigated: sciaphilic hard bottom (coralligenous bioconstructions), photophilic hard bottom, soft bottom, and Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds. The biomass density of the main autotrophic and heterotrophic taxonomic groups identified in the four macro-habitats of the MPA was evaluated. Based on this biomass matrix, the emergy value of natural capital stocks was assessed. The Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds habitat showed the highest biophysical value (2.32.1019 sej) at MPA scale, while coralligenous bioconstructions resulted the habitat with the highest biophysical value per unit area (2.72.1012 sej m-2). In addition, to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective, the emergy-based indicators were converted into monetary units. The total value of natural capital of the whole MPA resulted in about 46 Meuro. The results of this study can support local managers and policy makers in the development of management strategies to ensure nature conservation and sustainable human activities. They can be also used as a benchmark for the assessment of natural capital value at larger scales in support of a proper consideration and inclusion of nature value into processes of policy making.

AB  - Healthy, resilient, and diverse marine ecosystems are capable of generating the biotic and abiotic components of natural capital stocks interacting and providing a bundle of ecosystem services vital to human well-being. Increasing pressures and impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems cause habitat degradation and biodiversity loss, and, as a consequence, seriously affect their capacity to provide benefits to humans. Integrated approaches capable of combining ecological and socioeconomic aspects are much needed to protect natural capital stocks and ensure the delivery of ecosystem services. In this context, marine protected areas (MPAs) are important tools for conserving biodiversity while promoting sustainable human activities. In this study, an interdisciplinary approach to the assessment of natural capital and ecosystem services in marine ecosystems was adopted. In particular, the emergy and eco-exergy accounting methods were jointly used to account for the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the Mediterranean MPA "Punta Campanella", located in Southern Italy. The assessment focused on four main macro-habitats: sciaphilic hard bottom (coralligenous bioconstructions), photophilic hard bottom, soft bottom, and Posidoniad oceanica seagrass beds. The habitat Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds showed the highest value of eco-exergy density (3.58 center dot 10(6) kJ m(-2)) while the highest value of emergy density resulted for the sciaphilic hard bottom habitat (4.94 center dot 10(12) sej m(-2)). The high eco-exergy value of Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds habitat is mainly due to the complex evolutionary history and high biomass density of the Posidonia oceanica seagrass. On the other hand, the high emergy value calculated for the sciaphilic hard bottom habitat reflects the high convergence of natural input flows for the generation of its biomass stocks and high biodiversity. In addition, to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective, the emergy values of natural capital stocks were also converted into monetary units. The total value of natural capital stocks in the MPA resulted about 12 M(sic). Furthermore, a set of ecosystem services generated by Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and Coralligenous bioconstructions was identified and their economic value was estimated (3.05 M(sic) and 0.62 M(sic), respectively). Finally, the value of natural capital and ecosystem services was also estimated by using a 3D bionomic map to consider the presence of Coralligenous bioconstructions and other habitats on cliffs characterizing the investigated MPA. This study highlighted the importance of Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds and Coralligenous bioconstructions in terms of both natural capital stocks and delivery of ecosystem services, confirming the need for their protection and conservation in marine and coastal management. The biophysical and economic values of natural capital stocks and ecosystem services, together with their spatial distribution in the MPA, can support local managers and policy makers in implementing and developing nature conservation strategies while ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources.

AB  - The identification of principles explaining the development of ecosystems has been a major target of systems ecology and ecological modelling. Among these principles, the thermodynamic goal functions (GFs) named emergy and eco-exergy are recognised as methods unfolding the role of matter and energy flows in the functioning of ecological systems. The biophysical assessment of natural capital stocks is based on the evaluation of matter and energy flows invested by nature for their generation. In this paper, the emergy and eco-exergy methods were used to account for the natural capital value of two Mediterranean Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) located in Southern Italy. In particular, the assessment focused on four main habitats: 1) sciaphilic hard bottom (coralligenous bioconstruction), 2) photophilic hard bottom, 3) soft bottom, and 4) Posidonia oceanica seagrass bed. The emergy method allowed the assessment of natural capital in terms of direct and indirect solar energy flows invested for its generation, while the eco-exergy method accounted for the chemical energy stored in organic matter and the genetic information embodied in biomass stocks. The sciaphilic hard bottom showed a high emergy density value in the two MPAs (2.0610(12) and 7.22.10(11) sej m(-2)), confirming the high convergence of input resource flows in the formation of this habitat. This high value reflects the effort of nature in the formation of this habitat and therefore it suggests the need for its consideration in conservation strategies. Instead, Posidonia oceanica seagrass bed showed the highest value of eco-exergy density in both MPAs (3.56.10(6) and 3.54.10(6) kJ m(-2)). The eco-exergy results were influenced by two main factors: 1) the large biomass density of Posidonia oceanica, and 2) the high beta value of Posidonia oceanica reflecting its evolutionary history that involved the acquisition of key adaptations for the successful colonization of marine environments. The integration between emergy and eco-exergy methods resulted in a useful approach to account for different nature values based on a biophysical perspective. Such a perspective could complement economic evaluations based on market criteria, thus supporting decision making processes oriented to the sustainable management of marine resources.

AB  - Land-water interactions were examined in three regions in the Virginian Biogeographic Province; the southern shore of Cape Cod, Massachusetts; the Hudson/Raritan region of New York; and the eastern shore of the Delmarva (Delaware/Maryland/Virginia) Peninsula. Cumulative distribution functions were used to evaluate similarity in environmental condition among estuaries. Spatial-setting variables (location in a river, coastal lagoon, or in open waters) were associated with variation for some measures of estuarine condition. Patterns of coastal urban and agriculture gradients were measured and their relationship with indicators of estuarine condition was modeled statistically. When estuaries were pooled, the highest variation explained by spatial-setting variables was found for dissolved oxygen (DO, R-2 = 0.44) and salinity (R-2 = 0.58), with DO decreasing in river locations and salinity decreasing with rainfall and sampling locations near rivers. The explanatory power for the other indicator variables was low and varied from 6% to 27%. Rainfall explained some of the variation (R-2 = 0.23) in total suspended solids. Moderate (0.4 < vertical bar r vertical bar < 0.7) to strong (vertical bar r vertical bar 0.7) linear associations were found between total urban area and measures of estuarine condition. Within regions, total urban area was positively associated with Silver (r = 0.59), Cadmium (r = 0.65), and Mercury (r = 0.47) in Cape Cod, and inversely related to DO (r = -0.65) in the Hudson/Raritan region. No associations were found in the Delmarva Peninsula study area. Total area of agriculture showed a moderate association with Arsenic in Cape Cod, but no other associations were found in the other two regions. Our analyses show a measurable impact of urban land use on coastal ecosystem condition over large areas of the northeastern United States. This pattern was most evident when many different landscapes were considered simultaneously. The relationship between urban development and estuarine condition were weaker within the individual regions studied. The use of land use/cover models for predicting estuarine condition is a challenging task that warrants enhancements in the type, quantity, and quality of data to improve our ability to discern relationships between anthropogenic activities on land and the condition of coastal environments.

AB  - The Environment Agency manage over 10 000 km of raised flood defence assets (embankments, walls and structures) in England and Wales. These assets are managed to minimum targets that are expressed as a condition grade: a number between 1 (Very Good) and 5 (Very Poor) that is determined by visual inspection according to the Condition Assessment Manual. This paper discusses the good performance of the defences during the flood events of summer 2007: 1000 km of defences were tested, about 500 km was overtopped, but only four breaches occurred. The events have also shown that breaches can have various causes and that condition grade is only one indicator of performance. The paper then presents an analysis of the fragility of defences leading to the conclusion that in most cases, lower minimum condition grades are acceptable. This should enable more effective use of limited available funds, for example for data collection, analysis or improvement works.

AB  - Marine caves are characterized by wide environmental variability for the interaction between marine and continental processes. Their conditions may be defined as extreme for inhabiting organisms due to the enclosed morphology, lack of light, and scarcity of nutrients. Therefore, it is necessary to identify reliable ecological indicators for describing and assessing environmental conditions in these habitats even more than elsewhere. This review aims to provide the state of art related to the application of benthic foraminifera as proxies in the (paleo)ecological characterization of different habitats of marine caves. Special attention was addressed to a research project focused on Mediterranean marine caves with different characteristics, such as extent, morphology, freshwater influence, salinity, sediment type, oxygenation, and organic matter supply. This review aims to illustrate the reliability of foraminifera as an ecological and paleoecological indicator in these habitats. They respond to various environmental conditions with different assemblages corresponding to a very detailed habitat partitioning. Because marine caves may be considered natural laboratories for environmental variability, the results of these studies may be interpreted in the perspective of the global variability to understand the environmental drivers of future changes in marine systems.

AB  - Eleven conodont zones are established for the Lower Triassic of the Motianling section in the Nanpanjiang Basin, South China. Detailed size measurements on 2244 P-1 conodont elements demonstrate dynamic size variation patterns during the Early Triassic that are calibrated to the Early Triassic timescale and conodont zonation. Correlation of conodont size variation with various environmental indicators shows that these size changes are primarily controlled by rapidly changing and episodic environmental conditions and ecological recovery in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. Decreasing size trends occur in the early Griesbachian, late Griesbachian and at the Smithian-Spathian boundary. Episodes of size increase (rebounds) occur in the middle Griesbachian, Induan-Olenekian boundary and middle-late Spathian. The observed temporal size variations indicate that conodont animals were significantly affected by rapidly changing environmental conditions (mainly temperature and redox conditions) during the Early Triassic and recurrent size increases (rebounds) occurred during periods of environmental and climatic amelioration (climatic cooling and oxygenation), demonstrating a complicated recovery history of marine ecosystems in the aftermath of the largest Phanerozoic biotic crisis.

AB  - Using a novel approach to the assessment of ecological quality status of estuarine ecosystems, this study hypothesizes that compared to adult fishes and other components, the younger fish stages will be more sensitive and act as an early warning and will reflect more effectively the ecological status of estuaries. Larval stages of fishes were used to assess the ecological quality status (EQS) of four NW Portuguese estuaries, with different types and magnitudes of human pressures. The larval fish assemblages, together with water column characteristics and pollution indicators (faecal contamination and nutrient load) were sampled in the Lima, Cavado, Ave and Douro estuaries, during spring and autumn 2009. The four estuaries were classified in terms of human pressures by a global pressure index that identified the Cavado estuary as the least impacted estuary, followed by the Ave and Lima, both classified as moderately impacted system, while the Douro was classified as a highly impacted system. The Ave emerged as the most polluted system, carrying the highest nutrient load and sewage contamination. Larval fish assemblages included estuarine species, marine migrants, marine stragglers and the larger estuaries had higher species richness. Compared to adult fishes, three multimetric fish-based indices classified the Cavado, Ave and Douro estuaries with a lower ecological status when fish larvae were used. Similarly, the EQS assessed by macroinvertebrates were equal or higher when compared with fish larvae results. The EQS assessed by fish larvae was negatively correlated with sewage contamination and nitrogen nutrients, but did not reflect other anthropogenic pressures expressed by the global pressure index, which was only detected by adult fish. Fish larvae assessments were able to detect short-time events of hydrological manipulations observed in the Cavado estuary, as well as a seasonal decrease of water quality especially evident in the Ave estuary. The indices used denoted some limitations to the use of fish larvae data, thus emphasising the need for new indices to test the observed tendency for lower EQS given by fish larvae. The advantages and disadvantages of using fish larvae as more sensitive and accurate bioindicators of ecosystem integrity is also discussed as a means of providing strategically important information for improved estuarine management.

AB  - Management of natural forests in Costa Rica allows timber extraction in so far as it is guaranteed that the logging activities comply with diverse Sustainability Principles, Criteria and Indicators (PCIs). These are hierarchical and complex systems used, ex-ante in the formulation and approval of the Management Plan but have not been used for ex-post evaluation of managed forests. Development of sustainability evaluation systems that include few criteria is highly recommended. In that sense, the choice experiments contribute to simplification of the initial system of decision making, complementing a complex system of PCIs that permits detailed analysis of the management units. In this study, a choice experiment was included in a Delphi application and 5 key variables were identified to evaluate the sustainability of managed natural forests. These variables are, in order of importance-technical, legal and administrative conditions; external financing conditions; production performance; costs of preparing the Management Plan; and payment mechanisms for environmental services. The definition of these variables confirms not only that the technical, legal and administrative conditions are critical for sustainability but also that they could reflect the type of governance involved in sustainability forest management.

AB  - Desertification involves many countries featuring different ecological, economic, and social conditions. In Mediterranean Europe, high human pressure, economic development, and climatic changes combine to produce land consumption, soil erosion, salinization, and fire risk, all considered as key factors to start desertification processes. For many years the term desertification has been strictly associated to geo-physical conditions, but in very complex ecosystems the study of the interaction of physical patterns with population and social characteristics is necessary to better delineate areas at risk. The aims of this paper are therefore (i) to review recent findings in term of desertification processes and risk assessment in the Mediterranean basin, (ii) to illustrate a simplified model in which social and economic variables may significantly accelerate land degradation leading to desertification, (iii) to suggest a set of demographic, economic, and institutional indicators suitable to contribute to the assessment of desertification risk in the Mediterranean basin, (iv) to built a synthetic index based on a multivariate approach and, finally, (v) to compare such index with a standard index of desertification risk only referring to geo-physical conditions. As a conclusion, new findings to be achieved in the context of human impact on environment as an original contribution to the study of desertification were delineated.

AB  - Integrity of freshwater surface-and groundwater ecosystems and their ecological and qualitative status greatly depends on ecological processes taking place in streambed sediments overgrown by biofilm, in the hyporheic zone (HZ). Little is known about the interactions and effects of multiple stressors on biologically driven processes in the HZ. In this study, machine learning (ML) tools were used to provide evidence-based information on how stressors and ecologically important environmental factors interact and drive ecological processes and microbial biomass. The ML technique of decision trees using the J48 algorithm was applied to build models from a data set of 342 samples collected over three seasons at 24 sites within the catchments of five gravel-bed rivers in north-central Slovenia. Catchment-scale land use data and reach-scale environmental features indicating the HZ morphology and physical and chemical characteristics of water were used as predictive variables, while respiration (R) and microbial respiratory electron transport system activity (ETSA) were used as response variables indicating ecological processes and total protein content (TPC) indicating microbial biomass. Separate models were built for two HZ depths: 5-15 cm and 20-40 cm. The models with R as a response variable have the highest predictive performance (67-89%) showing that R is a good indicator of complex environmental gradients. The ETSA and TPC models were less accurate (42-67%) but still provide valuable ecological information. The best model show that temperature when combined with selected water quality elements is an important predictor of R at depth of 5-15 cm. The ETSA and TPC models show the combined effects of temperature, catchment land use and selected water quality elements on both response variables. Overall, this study provides new knowledge on how ecological processes occurring in the HZ respond to catchment and reach-scale variables, and provides evidence-based information about complex interactions between temperature, catchment land use and water quality. These interactions are highly dependent on the selection of the response variable, i.e., each response variable is influenced by a specific combination of predictive environmental variables.

AB  - The distribution and abundance of orchid populations depend on a suite of biological and ecological factors, including seed production and dispersal, availability of mycorrhizal fungi and appropriate environmental conditions, with the weighting of these factors depending on the spatial scale considered. Disentangling the factors determining successful orchid establishment represents a major challenge, involving seed germination experiments, molecular techniques and assessment of environmental conditions. Identification of fungi from large-scale surveys of mycorrhizal associations in a range of orchid species has shown that mycorrhizal fungi may be widespread and occur in varied habitats. Further, a meta-analysis of seed introduction experiments revealed similar seed germination in occupied and unoccupied habitat patches. Orchid rarity was also unrelated to mycorrhizal specificity. Nonetheless, seed germination within sites appears to depend on both biotic and abiotic conditions. In the few cases that have been examined, coexisting orchids have distinct mycorrhizal communities and show strong spatial segregation, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi are important drivers of niche partitioning and contribute to orchid coexistence. A broader investigation of orchid mycorrhizal fungus distribution in the soil, coupled with fungus and recruitment mapping, is needed to translate fungal abundance to orchid population dynamics and may lead to better orchid conservation.

AB  - We tested the species-energy and environmental-stability hypotheses to evaluate if they explain the species richness patterns of terrestrial vertebrates in Caatinga, an arid biome in northeast Brazil. Furthermore, we determined which climate conditions constrain richness patterns in different taxonomic groups, taking into account their ecological and life-history characteristics. Amphibian richness and reptile richness were best explained by environmental instability and were constrained by the driest environmental conditions, whereas bird richness and mammal richness were driven by environmental energy and constrained by the hottest environmental conditions, highlighting their limited physiological budgets for handling high temperatures. Thus, our results revealed the primary climatic factors driving the species richness of vertebrates in this arid environment and determined, for each vertebrate group, which climate variable constrains its distribution. These findings can also be used to help improve conservation strategies in Caatinga by recognizing that the alteration of natural habitats for human dwellings, as well as changes in the global climate, could enhance desertification processes in this region and threaten the region's biodiversity.

AB  - The theoretical concept for the use of mosaic indicators for species diversity in agricultural landscapes is illustrated on the basis of a practical example. A method to organise data on the specific regional natural conditions on the basis of an existing organisational chart of natural areas in Germany, digital results of biotope mapping and aerial views was developed for a selection of indicators (species, ecological groups) appropriate to given natural conditions on the regional scale. The use of the mosaic indicator concept was demonstrated for the example of bird species in a selected mosaic landscape characterised by a typical regional biotope structure-a special density of hedges and small bodies of water. On the basis of the indicator species, measures for the improvement of the habitat situation were derived with the goal of maintaining the landscape peculiarities and promoting specific diversity adapted on these special site conditions.
   The methods developed to regionalise the landscapes while taking into account spatial variations make it possible for farmers throughout Germany, no matter what natural characteristics each individual farm may have, to participate in programs to promote biological diversity and make a contribution to natural conservation.

AB  - We examine the concept of "conservation value" (CV), its use in conservation biology and environmental management, and its quantification in the literature (1976-2015). We find that the concept has been applied to several different entities (e.g., species, communities, natural habitats, or human-made ecosystems, such as agroecosystems), has many different meanings, and is measured using a variety of metrics (e.g., species richness, abundance/density, habitat use, or rarity/uniqueness). In most cases, the meanings of CV used must be inferred from a paper's context. Actual and inferred meanings of CV are broadly grouped into eight categories, which are clearly possibly overlapping. Most papers (86%) provide a sufficient explanation of their CV metric(s), but only 25% of all papers actually provide the explicit definitions of CV. We use multivariate analyses firstly to detect the associations between meanings and entities, and find some strong associations. For example, when considering the CV of communities/regions, the meaning used tends to be either (1) a tool to prioritize the conservation efforts or (2) an indicator of endangerment. When considering, however, other entities, such as agroecosystems, the associated meanings are (1) the provision of habitat and food supply to wildlife or (2) the capacity of these entities to complement other kinds of conservation. We use multivariate methods also to examine the associations between metrics and meanings. The well-known metrics of species richness, diversity, and abundance are associated with (1) the provision of habitat and food supply to wildlife or (2) the capacity of agroecosystems to complement other kinds of conservation. In general, CV applied to natural systems is a far more nebulous concept (both in meanings and in metrics) than when it is applied to anthropic or human-made ecosystems. We conclude that CV is an evolving concept adapting to new conservation and management scenarios. Given the diversity of meanings and metrics present, it would be useful to recognize CV more formally as an umbrella concept. Using CV as an umbrella concept would also enable researchers to find and compare CV methodologies more easily and thus facilitate the development of new ones.

AB  - The accumulation of organic and inorganic pollutants in biological specimens depends, in many cases, not only on the atmospheric deposition or immission and contamination of the biotop, but also on the dynamic properties of the indicator. Thus the analytical data assume properties of process variables. In order to compare them in relation to space and time, it is often practical to refer them to defined conditions of the indicator (stationary phases, time cycles of low dynamics). If the accumulation varies consistently under identical conditions of contamination and if clear functional relations exist to the features of the indicator, for instance age, weight or ecological processes, it is necessary to normalize the analytical data, i.e. to refer them to a condition of the indicator which is defined meaningfully with regard to the ecology. Interactions with other inputs of substances may result in a differentiation of accumulation and leaching processes which is more or less specific for each element. Such knowledge is important for specifying the standard operation procedures and the evaluation as well as interpretation of analytic data, in particular, in the clarification of the ecotoxicological relations between the pollutant accumulation and the reaction of populations and ecosystems.

AB  - In Australia, as elsewhere, there is a growing need for information relating to soil condition, its current status, and the nature and direction of change in response to management pressures. This information is required by land managers, and regional, State and, national agencies to inform modified land-use practices and investment to maintain and improve the soil resource. Here, we present data relating to soils under 3 land-use types at 6 properties the north-western slopes of New South Wales. We aimed to quantify the range of soil condition states that exist across the region and to test a range of potential soil condition indicators and their suitability to detect differences in soil condition between these land-use types. A range of soil properties showed no significant difference between land-uses and could be rejected as indicators. However, significant differences existed between the land-uses and soil depths for a range of the other soil parameters determined ( bulk density, C, N, P, EC, and Na). Soil C, N, P, and Na concentration and total soil C were typically higher in woodland soils compared with other land-uses, while bulk density, pH, and EC were lower in the woodland soils. The depth at which these differences existed varied between soil parameters. Correlation and principal components analysis suggested that a minimum dataset of soil parameters including soil bulk density, pH, C, P, and Na would discern much of the difference in soil condition between the land-uses studied. It is proposed that these parameters be used as a minimum dataset of indicators for soil condition assessment on soils of the type across this region. Work continues under the New South Wales Land and Soil Condition Monitoring Program to further re. ne the selection of appropriate soil indicators in this and other regions of New South Wales.

AB  - Estuaries and other coastal ecosystems depend on freshwater inflow to maintain the gradients in environmental characteristics that define these transitional water bodies. Freshwater inflow (FWI) rates in many estuaries are changing due to changing land use patterns, water diversions for human consumption, and climate effects, but there are no standard criteria to determine minimum inflow rates. An ecological indicator is required so models can be produced to predict how changing hydrology might affect estuarine metabolic rates, productivity, or impairment. One indicator of estuarine metabolic rates is net ecosystem metabolism (NEM). It is hypothesized that metabolic rates (as indicated by NEM) will depend on recently delivered FWI. To test this hypothesis, daily NEM was calculated from high frequency changes in dissolved oxygen measurements in a shallow water estuary, Lavaca Bay, Texas, USA and related to FWI and other environmental conditions. There was a significant relationship between NEM and cumulative ten-day FWI in upper Lavaca Bay, with more heterotrophic conditions occurring after high FWI events. No significant relationship existed between NEM and FWI in lower Lavaca Bay, where other environmental conditions, such as tidal forcing, may be more influential. An empirical model simulating NEM's response to FWI in upper Lavaca Bay was more accurate during moderate to high flows than during low base-flow conditions. Thus, quantity of FWI and distance from the inflow point source constrained the dependence of NEM on FWI. NEM can be quite variable over time and within a bay dominated by a river at one end and ocean exchange at the other end. The range of environmental gradients over time and within an estuary will determine how representative NEM at a single location is for an entire estuary. However, during high flow period pulses NEM can accurately predict shifts from balanced to heterotrophic conditions. Therefore, use of the NEM model as an indicator of FWI effects is constrained to regions in estuaries that are most effected by FWI because of proximity to the source or the size of FWI pulse events. The unique geologic, geographic, and climate signature's of individual estuaries will dictate the fit of this model in space and time. Inclusion of other environmental factors, such as temperature or irradiance, is necessary to improve the NEM model during low base-flow conditions. It is concluded that the NEM model does provide a useful indicator of FWI effects on ecosystem metabolic rates as it works well in the upper regions of Lavaca Bay and during freshwater inflow pulses where and when freshwater inflow has more influence than other environmental factors.

AB  - A set of multi-scale, process-based hydromorphological indicators of river character and dynamics has been developed to support river management and restoration activities. Indicators are selected to represent key hydromorphological processes at each spatial scale, i.e., catchment, landscape unit, river segment, river reach. Their evaluation allows identification of the cascade of these processes through the spatial units and the historical changes in their propagation as a consequence of natural or human induced hydromorphological changes. The approach is deliberately open-ended so that it can be adapted to local environmental conditions and management, and it can make the most effective use of available data sets. The indicators support assessments of the current condition of the river and its catchment; past changes within the catchment and their impacts on river reaches. Therefore, they represent a sound foundation for assessing the way the catchment to reach scale units and the geomorphic units within reaches may respond to future natural changes or human interventions. The procedure is illustrated using the example of the river Frome (UK).

AB  - Environment functions in various aspects including soil and water conservation, biodiversity and habitats, and landscape aesthetics. Comprehensive assessment of environmental condition is thus a great challenge. The issues include how to assess individual environmental components such as landscape aesthetics and integrate them into an indicator that can comprehensively quantify environmental condition. In this study, a geographic information systems based spatial multi-criteria decision analysis was used to integrate environmental variables and create the indicator. This approach was applied to Fort Riley Military installation in which land condition and its dynamics due to military training activities were assessed. The indicator was derived by integrating soil erosion, water quality, landscape fragmentation, landscape aesthetics, and noise based on the weights from the experts by assessing and ranking the environmental variables in terms of their importance. The results showed that landscape level indicator well quantified the overall environmental condition and its dynamics, while the indicator at level of patch that is defined as a homogeneous area that is different from its surroundings detailed the spatiotemporal variability of environmental condition. The environmental condition was mostly determined by soil erosion, then landscape fragmentation, water quality, landscape aesthetics, and noise. Overall, environmental condition at both landscape and patch levels greatly varied depending on the degree of ground and canopy disturbance and their spatial patterns due to military training activities and being related to slope. It was also determined the environment itself could be recovered quickly once military training was halt or reduced. Thus, this study provided an effective tool for the army land managers to monitor environmental dynamics and plan military training activities. Its limitation lies at that the obtained values of the indicator vary and are subjective to the experts' knowledge and experience. Thus, further advancing this approach is needed by developing a scientific method to derive the weights of environmental variables.

AB  - The article focuses on the method of determining the level of intensity of an agricultural crop on the example of sunflower hybrids under the conditions of a particular farm, taking into account the quantitative impact of weather conditions on crop yields. It has been proved that the level of intensity of any new variety or hybrid is of great relevance both for planning the crop cultivation and evaluating the results of production activities. It is understood that the value of this indicator is defined as the ratio between the actual crop yield for three - five years and the standard or calculated one. This statement of the problem assumes that the average value of both weather conditions and crop yields for these years will be close to the average weather conditions in this area. The standard crop yield is calculated and, in general, comprised of yield that may be formed at the expense of natural soil fertility and the direct effect and aftereffect of organic and mineral fertilizers. It has been established that in case of the analysis of agricultural crop yields in the industrial sowing, when the number of years (repetition) is insufficient under one or another condition, it is possible to use a special method of assessing the quantitative impact of weather conditions on crop yields (V.D. Dmytrenko, A. M. Poliovyi). Its essence lies in the fact that any deviation of weather conditions from the optimal values for all growing periods leads to a decrease in the productivity coefficient or the level of impact on crop yields. At the same time, ultimately all the definitions and calculations should be recalculated based on the average data of weather conditions of the area of impact of a particular weather station. From the point of view of environmental constraints, it is necessary to maintain a deficit-free balance of humus and basic fertilizer element.

AB  - In order to assess ecological values of Lower Rhine and Meuse floodplain habitats we studied the spatial and seasonal variation in diversity, species assemblages and feeding traits of caddisfly larvae in water bodies over the lateral connectivity gradient: eupotamon: main and secondary channels: parapotamon: channels connected permanently with the main channel only at their downstream ends; plesiopotamon: disconnected channels close to the main channel; paleopotamon: abandoned meanders at a greater distance from the main channel.
   Spatial variety was studied by analyzing the summer species composition in 70 Lower Rhine and Meuse water bodies which were categorized in connectivity habitats, whereas seasonal variety was studied in Lower Rhine water bodies along a connectivity gradient by monthly sampling over a whole year. Physico-chemical data and environmental parameters were recorded for each water body during sampling. Diversity and species assemblages of caddisfly larvae varied in relation to connectivity, macrophyte diversity and abundance and stream velocity. A comparison with historical records and species lists from less disturbed rivers showed that diversity in the main channel was very low.
   Caddisfly larvae species assemblages varied over the connectivity gradient. Lotic habitats (eupotamon) were separated from the lentic ones, and the well vegetated paleopotamon from the sparsely vegetated parapotamon and pleisopotamon habitats, indicating the overall importance of vegetation and current velocity for the species assemblages. Hydropsychidae have been found in the eupotamon exclusively, whereas Limnephilidae, Hydroptilidae and Polycentropodidae have been found predominantly in the paleopotamon water bodies. Leptoceridae were found in all floodplain water body categories. A similar pattern of distribution of families along the lateral connectivity gradient was found in more natural rivers.
   Caddisfly larvae species feeding traits showed a clear differentiation over the lateral connectivity gradient with filter-feeders and scrapers most important in the eupotamon and parapotamon, and shredders, piercers and predators most dominant in the paleopotamon habitats, indicating the importance of nutritional resources in relation to hydrological connectivity for the structure and functioning of caddisfly larvae species assemblages. The analysis of the species feeding traits allows generalizations towards the entire aquatic community and general prognoses for other floodplain ecosystems. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Potential Disconnect Between Observations of Hydrophytic Vegetation, Wetland Hydrology Indicators, and Hydric Soils in Unique Pitcher Plant Bog Habitats of the Southern Gulf Coast
T2  - SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST
LA  - English
AB  - The Sarracenia spp. (pitcher plant) bogs located along the southern Gulf of Mexico represent a unique natural resource characterized by endangered and endemic wetland floral communities that include a number of carnivorous plants (e.g., pitcher plants and Drosera spp. [sundews]). Despite the prevalence of obligate wetland plant species and indicators of wetland hydrology, the soils underlying this niche ecosystem often lack clear indicators of hydric soil morphology, posing challenges to wetland delineation and resource management. The National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils and an interagency team of soil scientists investigated saturated conditions and anaerobic soil conditions in pitcher plant bogs. Our results demonstrate that many of the pitcher plant-bog soils examined failed to meet an approved hydric soil indicator. Herein, we discuss potential factors preventing the formation of typical hydric soil morphologies including: low organic-matter content, high iron-concentrations, extensive bioturbation, presence of high-chroma minerals (e.g., chert), and short saturation-intervals. Our examination of soil morphology and condition in these unique and ecologically valuable habitats indicates that additional studies are required to address the apparent disconnect between observations of soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and indicators of wetland hydrology to ensure the appropriate management of these endemic natural resources.

AB  - In the past decade, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill triggered a spike in investigatory effort on the effects of crude oil chemicals, most notably polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), on marine organisms and ecosystems. Oysters, susceptible to both waterborne and sediment-bound contaminants due to their filter-feeding and sessile nature, have become of great interest among scientists as both a bioindicator and model organism for research on environmental stressors. It has been shown in many parts of the world that PAHs readily bioaccumulate in the soft tissues of oysters. Subsequent experiments have highlighted the negative effects associated with exposure to PAHs including the upregulation of antioxidant and detoxifying gene transcripts and enzyme activities such as Superoxide dismutase, Cytochrome P450 enzymes, and Glutathione S-transferase, reduction in DNA integrity, increased infection prevalence, and reduced and abnormal larval growth. Much of these effects could be attributed to either oxidative damage, or a reallocation of energy away from critical biological processes such as reproduction and calcification toward health maintenance. Additional abiotic stressors including increased temperature, reduced salinity, and reduced pH may change how the oyster responds to environmental contaminants and may compound the negative effects of PAH exposure. The negative effects of acidification and longer-term salinity changes appear to add onto that of PAH toxicity, while shorter-term salinity changes may induce mechanisms that reduce PAH exposure. Elevated temperatures, on the other hand, cause such large physiological effects on their own that additional PAH exposure either fails to cause any significant effects or that the effects have little discernable pattern. In this review, the oyster is recognized as a model organism for the study of negative anthropogenic impacts on the environment, and the effects of various environmental stressors on the oyster model are compared, while synergistic effects of these stressors to PAH exposure are considered. Lastly, the understudied effects of PAH photo-toxicity on oysters reveals drastic increases to the toxicity of PAHs via photooxidation and the formation of quinones. The consequences of the interaction between local and global environmental stressors thus provide a glimpse into the differential response to anthropogenic impacts across regions of the world.

AB  - The 187 million hectares of pasturelands in Kazakhstan play a key role in the nation's economy, as livestock production accounted for 54% of total agricultural production in 2010. However, more than half of these lands have been degraded as a result of unregulated grazing practices. Therefore, effective long term ecological monitoring of pasturelands in Kazakhstan is imperative to ensure sustainable pastureland management. As a case study in this research, we demonstrated how the ecological conditions could be assessed with remote sensing technologies and pastureland models. The example focuses on the southern Balkhash area with study sites on a foothill plain with Artemisia-ephemeral plants and a sandy plain with psammophilic vegetation in the Turan Desert. The assessment was based on remotely sensed imagery and meteorological data, a geobotanical archive and periodic ground sampling. The Pasture agrometeorological model was used to calculate biological, ecological and economic indicators to assess pastureland condition. The results showed that field surveys, meteorological observations, remote sensing and ecological models, such as Pasture, could be combined to effectively assess the ecological conditions of pasturelands and provide information about forage production that is critically important for balancing grazing and ecological conservation.

AB  - The Great Australian Bight Research Program has generated extensive new knowledge about the Great Australian Bight (GAB) system. Integrating disparate datasets (including old and new knowledge) is a challenge for any location, but is increasingly important given the expansion of the marine industries constituting the blue economy. This is particularly so when industries operate in frontier, or remote regions with high conservation significance. Ecosystem models are an integration tool that can give insight into the structure and function of marine systems and act as a testbed for exploring scenarios of development for the region. Two of the most widely used ecosystem models (Atlantis and Ecopath with Ecosim) were implemented for the GAB, to allow an exploration of development scenarios and to provide tools in support of future management of the GAB's socioecological systems. The models were used to evaluate the vulnerability of key species, food webs, habitats and animal groupings to ecosystem stressors such as climate change, fisheries, disease, changing spatial management, aquaculture and oil spills. The models' responses to cessation of fishing indicate that the anthropogenic signature is not 'untouched', but is not yet substantially degraded. The complexity and confined area of much of the natural and anthropogenic activity in the region, which is highly concentrated in the gulfs and along the shoreline, means the system is sufficiently interlinked for cumulative nonlinear outcomes to occur if the system is sufficiently stressed. Scenarios of increased fishing pressure had the greatest impacts on individual functional groups, while scenarios of ocean warming had the greatest influence on ecosystem structure and integrity. Oil spill scenarios (e.g. caused by potential off-shore shipping accidents) had potential impacts on seabirds, pelagic fishes and marine mammals, with flow-on effects to the whole ecosystem, but only in a confined area immediately around the incident's footprint. These results give scientists and managers insights into how expanding the blue economy could impact ecosystem services and the societies currently dependent on them. This work also provides a set of tools for the GAB that can act as a launch point for systems analysis and can facilitate future assessments or planning for the region.

AB  - Bioindicators could act as early warning indicators of environmental changes, ecosystem stress or taxonomic diversity. Pseudoscorpions have rarely been used as bioindicators, due to lack of information about their ecology, habitat selection, niche preferences and requirements, especially in southern Nothofagus forests. We studied the distribution and abundance of a pseudoscorpion species, Neochelanops michaelseni (Simon 1902), in different vegetation types (Nothofagus antarctica and N. pumilio forests, grasslands and peatlands) and examined how this species responded to different forest uses (harvesting and silvopastoral management), to explore its utility as a bioindicator. The study was conducted on long-term plots located at two ranches in Tierra del Fuego, using pit-fall traps during one summer. Neochelanops michaelseni abundance was higher in Nothofagus forests than in open ecosystems, which could be attributed to their affinity for litter and coarse woody debris. In N. pumilio forests, the pseudoscorpions were sensitive to harvesting, with similar abundances in harvested forests (aggregated and dispersed retentions) and grasslands. In N. antarctica forests, differences were not detected among unmanaged and silvopastoral managed forests, probably due to higher understory plant growth, and lesser diminishing of litter and debris by thinning than by harvesting. We conclude that the pseudoscorpion, N. michaelseni, can be a good bioindicator for ecosystem conservation and for evaluating recovery rate in the ecological conditions of impacted Nothofagus forests, and that management practice intensities should be regulated to create more suitable habitats for pseudoscorpion diversity conservation.

AB  - The relationship between flow dynamics and biological communities becomes especially relevant in Mediterranean rivers. Given their natural variability and growing anthropogenic pressures, their low sections are subjected to multiple impacts. The definition of ecohydrological relationships in Mediterranean rivers may constitute a useful management tool. Historically, fishes were the first group used to assess community-level ecological quality, and different indices and metrics have been proposed. However, up to date many of these indicators have showed to be insensitive to flow regime changes or hydrological alteration. There is therefore a need to deepen into the ecohydrological relationships between such indicators and flow regimes in Mediterranean (and other) rivers. This study presents an analysis of the relationship between interannual flow regimes in the lower section of the Ebro River, defined using a set of daily and hourly hydrological indices, and ecological quality based on fish community, assessed through indices designed to fulfill the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in Europe: the Indices of Biotic Integrity in Catalan rivers (IBICAT2010 and IBICAT2b) and the new European Fish Index (EFI+). In order to identify spatiotemporal patterns, hydrological indices were computed using time periods of different amplitude and ecological quality was obtained in different transects along the river section, even within the same water units or 'water masses' (subdivisions of surface waters to fulfill the WFD in Spain). Our results showed that IBICAT2010 was the most correlated with hydrological indices, followed by IBICAT2b and EFI +. The latter showed an almost null correlation with hydrological indices, which may be due to issues associated with the sampling technique, the definition of transects and because it does not uses stream typologies. Correlations among some hydrological and biological indices were observed, with temporal and spatial patterns. On one hand, daily hydrological indices showed relationship with ecological quality when they were computed using between 9 and 36 months of flow records (previous to the sampling date) whereas subdaily indices responded better to periods between 3 and 9 months of records. On the other hand, some sampling transects showed clearer relationships than others, even within the same water mass, which suggests an influence of hydromorphological variability on the obtained ecological quality scores.

AB  - Preventive and/or manipulative practices will be needed to maintain soil's biological, physiochemical, nutritional, and structural health in natural, managed, and disturbed ecosystems as a foundation for rood security and global ecosystem sustainability. While there is a substantial body of interdisciplinary science on understanding function and structure of soil ecosystems, key gaps must be bridged in assessing integrated agro-biological, ecological, economical, and environmental efficiency of soil manipulation practices in time and space across ecosystems. This presentation discusses the application of a fertilizer use efficiency (FUE) model for assessing agronomic, economic, ecological, environmental, and nematode (pest) management efficiency of soil amendments. FUE is defined as increase in host productivity and/or decrease in plant-parasitic nematode population density in response to a given fertilizer treatment. Using the effects of nutrient amendment on Heterodera glycines population density and normalized difference vegetative index (indicator of physiological activities) of a soybean cultivar 'CX 252', how the FUE model recognizes variable responses and separates nutrient deficiency and toxicity From nematode parasitism :is troll as suitability of treatments designed to achieve desired biological and physiochemical soil health conditions is demonstrated. As part of bridging gaps between agricultural and ecological approaches to integrated understanding and management cif soil health, modifications of the FUE model for analyzing the relationships amongst nematode community structure, soil parameters (eg. pH, nutrients, %OM), and plant response to soil amendment is discussed.

AB  - Bioassays as well as biochemical responses (biomarkers) in ecosystems due to environmental stress provide us with signals (environmentally signalling) of potential damage in the environment. If these responses are perceived in this early stage in ecosystems, the eventual damage can be prevented. Once ecosystem damage has occurred, the remedial action processes for recovery could be expensive and pose certain logistical problems. Ideally, "early warning signals" in ecosystems using sensing systems of biochemical responses (biomarkers) would not only tell us the initial levels of damage, but these signals will also provide us with answers by the development of control strategies and precautionary measures in respect to the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Clear technical guidelines or technical specifications on monitoring are necessary to establish and characterise reference conditions for use in an ecological status classification system for surface water bodies. For the Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment (ERA) of endocrine effects we used an approach of the exposure - dose - response concept. Based on the "Ecototoxicological Classification System of Sediments" that uses pT-values to classify effects in different river systems, we transferred the bio-monitoring data to the five-level ecological system of the WFD. To understand the complexity of the structure of populations and processes behind the health of populations, communities and ecosystems an ERA should establish links between natural factors, chemicals, and biological responses so as to assess causality. So, our ecological monitoring assessment has incorporated exposure & effects data.

AB  - Because benthic ecosystems of seamounts support vulnerable biota that are increasingly threatened by mining and fishing, assessments of ecological conditions and impacts are important to balance resource extraction with biological conservation. These assessments rely on ecological metrics generated from physical collections of fauna with sleds or similar gears, or by surveying the seafloor with cameras. If different gears (sled or cameras) "sample" the benthos differently, derived ecological metrics will also differ. Here, we test this hypothesis by comparing data provided by a robust benthic sled and a quantitative towed camera from colocated transects on seamounts off Tasmania (Australia). Our comparison showed these tools provide complementary but not interchangeable metrics of seamount benthic diversity and abundance. Choice of sampler(s) needs to be determined by survey objectives and consider the following trade-offs: (1) sleds will detect more species than image-based techniques; (2) specimens obtained by physical sampling (sleds) can considerably extend the scope of ecological analysis through genetic, isotopic, and other analysis of biological material not available from camera surveys; (3) image-derived data provide significantly and often considerably, higher estimates of megabenthos abundance; and (4) environmental impacts are much lower in camera surveys and therefore are arguably more ethical-an important consideration when repeat surveys are required, especially in areas of high conservation importance or heightened sensitivity. Undersampling by sleds of corals and sponges is an important aspect of gear selectivity because these taxa are consistently prominent indicators in protocols that identify benthic "vulnerable marine ecosystems" in assessments of human impacts.

AB  - White clams (Dosinia ponderosa) were collected near an effluent outlet of shrimp farms to measure the impact of the discharge. Clams were collected at 50, 150, and 300 m from the discharge area. Environmental parameters at each sampling site were determined and the physiological, stress, and health conditions of the clams were recorded. Water and sediment qualities were negatively affected by effluent discharge at 50 and 150 m. Similarly, physiological and stress conditions of clams from the impacted areas were impaired at 50 and 150 m from the discharge zone. Glucose, lactate, cholesterol, and alanine aminotransferase levels were altered and transcription of heat shock proteins 70 and 90 were over-expressed in these clams. The health condition of clams was not affected: bacterial loads of aerobic mesophiles, fecal coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella sp., and Vibrio cholerae remained below international safety levels. No effects of effluents were detected on most of the parameters at 300 m. In summary, discharge of effluents by shrimp farms had a negative impact on environmental quality and on physiological conditions of white clams within a radius of at least 150 m from the outlet.

AB  - Vegetated coastal wetlands, including seagrass, saltmarsh and mangroves, are threatened globally, yet the need to avert these losses is poorly recognized in international policy, such as in the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. Identifying the impact of overlooking coastal wetlands in ecosystem assessment frameworks could help prioritize research efforts to fill these gaps. Here, we examine gaps in the recognition of coastal wetlands in globally applicable ecosystem assessments. We address both shortfalls in assessment frameworks when it comes to assessing wetlands, and gaps in data that limit widespread application of assessments. We examine five assessment frameworks that track fisheries, greenhouse gas emissions, ecosystem threats, and ecosystem services. We found that these assessments inform management decisions, but that the functions provided by coastal wetlands are incompletely represented. Most frameworks had sufficient complexity to measure wetland status, but limitations in data meant they were incompletely informed about wetland functions and services. Incomplete representation of coastal wetlands may lead to them being overlooked by research and management. Improving the coverage of coastal wetlands in ecosystem assessments requires improving global scale mapping of wetland trends, developing global-scale indicators of wetland function and synthesis to quantitatively link animal population dynamics to wetland trends. Filling these gaps will help ensure coastal wetland conservation is properly informed to manage them for the outstanding benefits they bring humanity.

AB  - In the Anthropocene, coupled human and natural systems dominate and only a few natural systems remain relatively unaffected by human influence. On the one hand, conservation criteria based on areas of minimal human impact are not relevant to much of the biosphere. On the other hand, conservation criteria based on economic factors are problematic with respect to their ability to arrive at operational indicators of well-being that can be applied in practice over multiple generations. Coupled human and natural systems are subject to economic development which, under current management structures, tends to affect natural systems and cross planetary boundaries. Hence, designing and applying conservation criteria applicable in real-world systems where human and natural systems need to interact and sustainably coexist is essential. By recognizing the criticality of satisfying basic needs as well as the great uncertainty over the needs and preferences of future generations, we sought to incorporate conservation criteria based on minimal human impact into economic evaluation. These criteria require the conservation of environmental conditions such that the opportunity for intergenerational welfare optimization is maintained. Toward this end, we propose the integration of ecological-biological thresholds into decision making and use as an example the planetary-boundaries approach. Both conservation scientists and economists must be involved in defining operational ecological-biological thresholds that can be incorporated into economic thinking and reflect the objectives of conservation, sustainability, and intergenerational welfare optimization.

AB  - An aim of organic farming is to reduce negative impacts of agricultural management practices on physical, chemical, and biological soil properties. A growing number of organic farmers is trying out methods of reduced tillage to save costs, protect humus and to foster natural processes in the soil. Furthermore, techniques like increasing crop rotation diversity and reduced tillage are discussed under the topics of agroecology or ecological intensification also for implementation in non-organic farming systems.
   The question arises as to whether these practices are positively impacting on soil ecosystems and which indicators can be used to describe these impacts. Collembolans are a widely distributed group of the soil mesofauna. They are mainly characterised as secondary decomposers feeding on fungi and other microorganisms. We investigated the influence of different long-term organic crop rotations (mixed farming with animal husbandry versus stockless arable) and the short term effects of two years of different tillage systems (conventional tillage versus reduced tillage) on the abundance, species richness, species composition, and selected species traits (life forms) of collembolan communities.
   Although not significant, some trends are evident. Species composition of collembolan communities responded to expected alterations in soil moisture mediated by different crop sequences and inter-annual effects rather than to different management practices. The proportion of euedaphic collembolan individuals tended to increase in soil environments that offered more stable habitat conditions from increased availability of organic matter.

AB  - Neurotoxicity effects of industrial contaminants are currently significantly under investigated and require innovative analytical approaches to assess health and environmental risks at individual, population and ecosystem levels. Behavioral changes assessed using small aquatic invertebrates as standard biological indicators of the aggregate toxic effects, have been broadly postulated as highly integrative indicators of neurotoxicity with physiological and ecological relevance. Despite recent increase in understanding of the emerging value of behavioral biotests, their wider implementation especially in high-throughput environmental risk assessment assays, is largely limited by the lack of advances in analytical technologies. To date, most of the behavioral biotests have only been performed with larger-volumes and lacked dynamic flow-through conditions. They also lack features necessary for development of higher throughput neuro-behavioral ecotoxicity assays such as miniaturization and integration of automated components. We postulate that some contemporary analytical limitations can be effectively addressed by innovative Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) technologies, an emerging and multidisciplinary field poised to bring significant miniaturization to aquatic ecotoxicity testing. Recent developments in this emerging field demonstrate particular opportunities to study a plethora of behavioral responses of small model organisms in a high-throughput fashion. In this review, we highlight recent advances in this budding new interdisciplinary field of research. We also outline the existing challenges, barriers to development and provide a future out-look in the evolving field of neurobehavioral ecotoxicology. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare cancer predisposition disease caused by mutations in at least 12 genes encoding proteins that cooperate to maintain genomic integrity. Variants of FA genes, including FANCG, have been identified in human population screening, but their potential reduction in protein function and role in cancer susceptibility is unclear. To test for possible dysfunction, we constructed plasmids containing four FANCG polymorphisms found in the human population and introduced them in the Fancg-deficient (fancg) KO40 line derived from AA8 hamster CHO cells. Expression of wild-type human FANCG provided fancg cells with complete phenotypic correction as assessed by resistance to the DNA crosslinking agent mitomycin C (MMC), thus providing a sensitive test for detecting the degree of complementation activity for the FANCG variants. We found that all four variants conferred levels of mitomycin C resistance as well as restoration of monoubiquitination of Fancd2, a key indicator of a functional FA protein pathway, similar to those observed in wild-type transfectants. Under the same conditions, the L71P amino acid substitution mutant, identified in an FA patient, gave no complementation. Using this novel system for determining FANCG functionality, we detect no decrement in function of the human FANCG polymorphic variants examined. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The environmental setting (e.g., climate, topography, geology) and land use affect stream physical characteristics singly and cumulatively. At broad geographic scales, we determined the importance of environmental setting and land use in explaining variation in stream physical characteristics. We hypothesized that as the spatial scale decreased from national to regional, land use would explain more of the variation in stream physical characteristics because environmental settings become more homogeneous. At a national scale, stepwise linear regression indicated that environmental setting was more important in explaining variability in stream physical characteristics. Although statistically discernible, the amount of variation explained by land use was not remarkable due to low partial correlations. At level II ecoregion spatial scales (southeastern USA plains, central USA plains, and a combination of the western Cordillera and the western interior basins and ranges), environmental setting variables were again more important predictors of stream physical characteristics, however, as the spatial scale decreased from national to regional, the portion of variability in stream physical characteristics explained by basin land use increased. Development of stream habitat indicators of land use will depend upon an understanding of relations between stream physical characteristics and environmental factors at multiple spatial scales. Smaller spatial scales will be necessary to reduce the confounding effects of variable environmental settings before the effects of land use can be reliably assessed.

AB  - The concept of sustainability typically encompasses social, economic, political and environmental components. This paper focuses on the measurement of factors that help predict whether a region is moving toward or away from environmentally sustainable paths. Examples of natural capital are provided along with the rationales for using a natural capital approach. Indicators assist in the assessment of conditions and trends, facilitate informed discussion among diverse groups within the community, provide input into the policy process, and help communities identify important tradeoffs they may face in all sorts of decisions that affect sustainability, including land use, transportation infrastructure and fiscal policies.

AB  - Net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) is becoming a commonly used ecological indicator of estuarine ecosystem metabolic rates. Estuarine ecosystem processes are spatially and temporally variable, but the corresponding variability in NEM has not been properly assessed. Spatial and temporal variability in NEM was assessed in four western Gulf of Mexico shallow water estuaries. NEM was calculated from high-frequency dissolved oxygen measurements. Interbay, intrabay, and water column spatial scales were assessed for NEM, gross primary production (GPP), and respiration (R) rate variability. Seasonal, monthly, and daily temporal scales in NEM, GPP, and R were also assessed. Environmental conditions were then compared to NEM to determine which factors were correlated with each temporal and spatial scale. There was significant NEM spatial variability on interbay, intrabay, and water column spatial scales. Significant spatial variability was ephemeral, so it was difficult to ascertain which environmental conditions were most influential at each spatial scale. Significant temporal variability in NEM on seasonal, monthly, and daily scales was found and it was correlated to temperature, salinity, and freshwater inflow, respectively. NEM correlated strongly with dissolved oxygen, temperature, and salinity, but the relationships where different in each bay. The dynamics of NEM on daily scales indicate that freshwater inflow events may be the main driver of NEM in the semiarid estuaries studied. The variable nature of NEM found here is further evidence that it is not valid to use single station monitoring deployments for assessment of whole estuarine ecosystem metabolic rates in large ecosystems. The relationship between NEM and temperature, salinity, and freshwater inflow events could drive predictive models assessing the potential influence of projected climate change and watershed development scenarios on estuarine metabolic rates.

AB  - Heightened concerns regarding the protection of terrestrial ecosystems at a national level has increased the need to develop a suite of indicators capable of assessing the quality, integrity and fertility of soils. Of the assays currently available, tests that measure aspects of soil function and associated parameters are among the most promising, since these integrate effects on soil quality at the highest level of organisation. In this study we describe results of the deployment of an indicator of soil functional integrity (the bait lamina test) that is designed to measure the feeding activity of soil invertebrates. Bait lamina was used at six grassland sites located along a transect from a smelter at Avonmouth (South-West England) used in the EU funded BIOPRINT II project. Results indicated highest bait removal (feeding) at sites furthest from the factory, intermediate feeding activity at intervening sites and extremely low activities at the two sites closest to the smelter. The strong decline in activity for the group of sites closest to the smelter corresponded with increasing metal concentrations suggesting a clear impact of metals on detritivorous invertebrate feeding. Comparisons of the results of the bait lamina study to previous invertebrate survey work suggested that the differences in observed bait removal can be attributed to direct effects of metals on the abundance and biodiversity of key decomposer groups such as earthworms, isopods, molluscs, myriapods, springtails and mites.

AB  - Modification of Indus River flows to meet anthropogenic needs has seriously undermined the ecological benefits the river generates in the deltaic region. This paper provides an assessment of ecological conditions of the Indus Delta under different climate change scenarios by using ecological health of the Indus River as a proxy. First, we assessed the existing state of deltaic ecology and categorised it into an arbitrary environmental management class (EMC). Then, using Global Environmental Flow Calculator, we determined the Environmental Flows (E-flows) that are required for the Indus delta in (i) the present, and (ii) in the future under two climate change scenarios. Our analysis shows that due to inadequate and inconsistent release of E-flows downstream of Kotri barrage, deltaic ecosystems have deteriorated overtime. Our analysis reveals that under climate change Scenario 1, more flows may be available that can bring river flows close to natural E-flows. Under Scenario 2, there may be reduced river flows to the extent that E-flows required under prevailing conditions would not be possible. The study concludes that if the current deterioration of aquatic ecology continues, it will be challenging to maintain present, or achieve higher ecological management class (EMC), regardless of the changes in river flows in the future. In this light, there is a need to interlink economic and development needs of communities with environmental needs of Indus River in the deltaic region. Most importantly, there is a need for ensuring climate-compatible e-flows in water regulating sites such as Kotri Barrage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Through the use of safety factors, the use of single-species test data has been adequate for use in protective hazard assessments and criteria setting but, because hazard quotients do not consider the presence of multiple species each with a particular sensitivity or the interactions that can occur between these species in a functioning community, they are ill-suited to environmental risk assessment. Significant functional redundancy occurs in most ecosystems but this is poorly considered in single-species tests conducted under laboratory conditions. A significant advance in effects assessment was the use of the microcosm as a unit within which to test interacting populations of organisms. The microcosm has allowed the measurement of the environmental effect measures such as the NOAEC(community) under laboratory or field conditions and the application of this and other similarly derived measures to ecological risk assessment (ERA). More recently, distributions of single-species laboratory test data have been used for criteria setting and, combined with distributions of exposure concentrations, for risk assessment. Distributions of species sensitivity values have been used in an a priori way for setting environmental quality criteria such as the final acute value (FAV) derived for water quality criteria. Similar distributional approaches have been combined with modeled or measured concentrations to produce estimates of the joint probability of a single species being affected or that a proportion of organisms in a community will be impacted in a posteriori risk assessments. These techniques have not been widely applied for risk assessment of dredged materials, however, with appropriate consideration of bioavailability and spatial and nature of the data these techniques can be applied to soils and sediments.

AB  - Sediments record the history of contamination to estuaries. Analysis of the concentrations of toxic organic compounds, contaminant and crustal metals, organic carbon content and isotopic composition in sediment cores from two estuarine systems in Buzzards Bay allowed reconstruction of human impacts over 350 years. Vertical distributions of the contaminants correlate with changes in the nature of watershed/estuarine activities. All contaminants were highly enriched (tens to hundreds times background) in modem New Bedford Harbor sediments. Enrichment began around the turn of the 20th century for all but PCBs, which were first synthesized in the 1930s. An increase in organic carbon content and a shift of carbon isotopes toward a more terrestrial signature illustrates increasing anthropogenic impact in New Bedford as population grew along with the industrial base. Institution of environmental protection measures in the late 20th century was reflected in decreased, although still substantially elevated, concentrations of contaminants. A lack of industrial development in Apponagansett Bay resulted in much lower concentrations of the same indicators, although specific contaminants related to the early whaling industry increased significantly above background as early as the late 18th century. The similarity of indicators in older portions of cores from NBH and unimpacted Apponagansett Bay demonstrates that cores can be used to establish reference conditions as successfully as using separate sites judged a priori to represent the reference state. The historical reconstruction approach provides the basis for establishing relationships between environmental stressors and factors that drive the stressors, as well as a framework for the assessment of ecological response(s) to environmental stressors over a range of time and/or exposure scales.

AB  - Within the scope of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), the scientific community recognized clear opportunities to take advantage of the use of ecotoxicological tools in water quality assessments. In this perspective, bioassays and biomarkers were suggested to contribute to the integration of the chemical and biological conditions, and thus to provide an overall insight into the quality of a water body. This study aimed to assess whether current bioassays as feeding rate assays with Daphnia longispina and growth inhibition assays with Lemna minor are suitable to detect potential ecotoxicity, using waters from Portuguese reservoirs. Several sampling sites were defined in reservoirs (Miranda, Pocinho, and Alqueva). The samplings were conducted in autumn of 2018 and spring of 2019. Total chlorophyll, lipid peroxidation, and proline content were also evaluated in L. minor. Results demonstrated that D. longispina showed some sensitivity to water treatments; however, the results were difficult to interpret since no reason or trend can be accurate. All parameters of L. minor did not show sensitivity to detect potential ecotoxicological risks associated with natural water understudy, since no discrimination among the water treatments was recorded. However, biomarkers/bioassays proved to be concordant to each other. Under the conditions evaluated here (reservoirs and sampling periods), the biological responses observed were not consistent, clear, and coherent with the physical-chemical parameters and chemical analyses performed, suggesting that the ecotoxicological tools selected were not sensitive to assess water quality in this type of ecosystems. In this sense, species of different trophic levels are recommended for ecotoxicological analyses due to differences in species sensitivities.

AB  - Structural integrity assessment of pipeline girth welds subjected to high strain levels which arises from the reel-lay method relies on precise crack driving force estimation procedures. Recent developments in subsea technology favor the use of high strength carbon steel pipelines with an internal corrosion resistant layer to increase protection against corrosive fluids. In contrast to homogeneous structural components, the bimetal configuration may induce the occurrence of weld strength undermatch, with a strong impact on the relationship between remote applied load and crack tip constraint. This work explores the development of a crack driving force estimation procedure based on a strain-based version of the EPRI J estimation scheme coupled with the equivalent stress-strain relationship method (ESSRM) and a weld geometry simplification procedure. The proposed framework takes advantage of the displacement controlled nature of the reeling process. Extensive 3D analyses provide a large set of fracture parameters applicable to the strain-based EPRI methodology followed by parametric analyses conducted to assess the accuracy of the new procedure. Subsequently, a case study is performed to determine the tolerable crack sizes in an idealized pipe installation. The procedure shows an overall good agreement to the benchmark analyses and increased accuracy when compared to the recommended approach proposed by DNV. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The identification of proxy indicator for groundwater infiltration and bacterial contamination is an important step in managing groundwater resources and hazard assessment. The objective of the present study was to estimate the hydro-chemical data of Khyberpass, Delhi, location to explore the preliminary, chemical and microbial contamination of groundwater samples through setup lysimetric experiments which were mimicking natural field conditions. The calculated mean values of physico-chemical and microbial parameters in control leachate, drain leachate and drain samples exceeded permissible limits of World Health Organization (WHO). All the groundwater samples for preliminary test were found within WHO permissible limits, whereas drain, drain leachate and control leachate exceeded from WHO permissible limits. Physico-chemical contaminations in drain leachate were significantly higher in groundwater samples as electrical conductivity (272 %), total dissolved solid (230 %), total hardness (420 %), alkalinity (166 %), biological oxygen demand (265 %) and chemical oxygen demand (651 %) and dissolved oxygen (87 %). Significantly different values of spread plate count, pour plate count, total coliform and fecal coliform in drain leachate of Khyberpass were recorded as 3.97 x 10(4), 1.87 x 10(4), 1.13 x 10(3) and 6.74 x 10(3) CFU/ml, respectively, in the groundwater samples. Lysimetric experiments have shown that while passing the water from soil profile, the maximum population of microbial flora as well as the chemical pollutants which would have been adsorbed to the soil (holding capacity) indicating the compact nature of soil structure, nevertheless some fraction of chemical and microbial pollutants leached down to the aquifer from a point source and diluted entire ecosystem. The unlined drains (non concrete) and unsanitary environmental conditions could be additional risk factors for groundwater contamination.

AB  - Paleoecological reconstructions of environmental changes provide important information for Everglades restoration targets. Traditionally this has been achieved using a combination of biological and physical indicators. However, as microfossils may be sporadically abundant in Everglades soils, organic geochemical methods can provide information at the molecular level. To reconstruct vegetation trends over the last century, soil cores from Shark to Taylor Sloughs, the primary flowpaths of the southern Everglades, were examined using several geochemical proxies. The n-alkane derived biomarker Paq effectively distinguished organic inputs from sawgrass and slough habitats. Other proxies examined include Kaurenes, cyclic diterpenoids unique to sawgrass roots; biomarkers of algae (highly branched isoprenoids (C(20)HBIs) and Botryococcenes); lignin phenols as vascular plant indicators; and macrofossils. At all sites, soil profiles from sawgrass marshes showed vegetation had shifted over the last 100 years, from sloughs to sawgrass-dominated marshes, reflecting decreased water levels (shorter hydroperiods) induced by water management. Paleo-assessments of modern sloughs, however, indicate these habitats remained deeper water habitats throughout the period of record, though shifts toward shorter hydroperiod vegetation were observed. In Taylor Slough, evidence of increasingly dry conditions in sloughs was confirmed by seed inputs from woody species. At 3 of the 5 sites, recent increases in C(20)HBIs and Botryococcene concentrations indicated greater periphyton abundance, coincidental with increased mineral concentrations observed in surface waters during the mid-20th Century. Bulk proxies such as organic content and carbon: nitrogen ratios also supported findings of changes in relative contributions of microbial and higher plants in this ecosystem.

AB  - Comparative analysis of trophic networks was carried out to evaluate environmental management actions aimed at countering an environmental crisis in Orbetello Lagoon, Italy. Two mass-balance models of this shallow water coastal system were constructed, for 1995 and 1996. During this period, there was an observed change in the composition of the submerged vegetation that indicated a significant improvement in the lagoon's ecology. Mass-balance models were built using the Ecopath modelling software in order to explain the energy transfer through the trophic levels (TLs) of the lagoon's ecosystem.
   Comparative analysis of the two trophic networks allowed a complete description of the lagoon, and gave clear indications regarding the 'eutrophication level' sensu Nixon and the stage of system maturity sensu Odum of the ecosystem for the 2 years. The turnover rate (production/biomass ratio) of pleustophytes was proposed as an indicator of "environmental health" at the ecosystem level because it allows positioning the submerged vegetation as a whole along an axis of adaptation strategies to natural selection. All the indices of ecosystem maturity and stability examined showed that the lagoon was in a more stable condition in 1996 than in 1995, although the system was still in a condition of stress.
   The effects of management actions carried out in the system were quantified by estimating the changes in primary production and accumulation of detritus in the system. Management of the lagoon as an extensive aquaculture operation was assessed by analysing the fishery catch, the transfer efficiencies at different trophic levels and the impact of cormorants, and it was found to contribute to system stability.

AB  - The exponential growth of the salmonid farming industry during the last 3 decades has created conditions for massive escapes of these exotic species into natural environments in southern Chile. Here, we review and update information about salmonid escapes from 1993 to 2012 and examine their potential environmental, social, and economic consequences. We estimate that more than 1 million salmonids escape each year from marine farms, mainly due to weather conditions and technical and operational failures of net-pens. While a decrease in the magnitude of escaped Atlantic and coho salmon has occurred during the last several years, escaped rainbow trout have not followed the same pattern. Rainbow trout have become a greater threat to native ecosystems due to their greater potential to establish self-sustaining naturalized populations. The main ecological effects of escapees are related to short-term predatory effects upon native fish, long-term effects linked to the likelihood of farmed salmon establishing self-sustainable populations, and disease and pathogen transfer to native fauna. More research is needed to identify and develop reliable indicators to estimate the impact of escapees at the ecosystem level in both marine and freshwater systems. An understanding of the mechanisms of coexistence between native fishes and introduced non-native salmonids may be useful to design effective management strategies aimed at protecting native fish from salmonid introductions. A precautionary approach that encourages local artisanal and recreational fisheries to counteract colonization and naturalization of salmon species in southern Chile may constitute another management option.

AB  - We analyze the impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity at the Barranca de Metztitlan Biosphere Reserve, a xeric ecosystem in central Mexico with a long history of use by humans. We compared the community structure, as well as the alpha and beta diversity between two cover conditions (open and closed vegetation) that represent the impact of grazing within a habitat, and between habitat types (submountainous and crassicaule scrublands). From 576 samples we collected 75,605 dung beetles belonging to 20 taxa. While mean species richness and diversity were different between habitat types, cumulative species richness was not. The effects of grazing on vegetation structure influenced the cumulative species richness and diversity of dung beetles in the submountainous scrubland, where grazing has created land mosaics of a grassland matrix with scrubland patches. This was not the case in the crassicaule scrubland where the impact of grazing is not as evident. Beta diversity significantly responds to the effects of grazing on habitat conditions. We discuss the ecological factors that may promote these responses by landscape diversity components. We also identify the species that could act as useful indicators to monitor the effect of land management on biodiversity. Our results indicate cattle farming maintains a diversified land mosaic, and these areas support more diverse dung beetle ensembles than homogeneous areas of closed, shrubby vegetation cover. Thus, controlled grazing activity could certainly favour the conservation of dung beetle biodiversity and improve ecosystem functioning by maintaining dung decomposition rates.

AB  - Cyanobacteria form spectacular mass occurrences almost annually in the Baltic Sea. These harmful algal blooms are the most visible consequences of marine eutrophication, driven by a surplus of nutrients from anthropogenic sources and internal processes of the ecosystem. We present a novel Cyanobacterial Bloom Indicator (CyaBI) targeted for the ecosystem assessment of eutrophication in marine areas. The method measures the current cyanobacterial bloom situation (an average condition of recent 5 years) and compares this to the estimated target level for 'good environmental status' (GES). The current status is derived with an index combining indicative bloom event variables. As such we used seasonal information from the duration, volume and severity of algal blooms derived from earth observation (50) data. The target level for GES was set by using a remote sensing based data set named Fraction with Cyanobacterial Accumulations (FCA; Kahru & Elmgren, 2014) covering years 1979-2014. Here a shift-detection algorithm for time series was applied to detect time-periods in the FCA data where the level of blooms remained low several consecutive years. The average conditions from these time periods were transformed into respective CyaBI target values to represent target level for GES. The indicator is shown to pass the three critical factors set for marine indicator development, namely it measures the current status accurately, the target setting can be scientifically proven and it can be connected to the ecosystem management goal. An advantage of the CyaBI method is that it's not restricted to the data used in the development work, but can be complemented, or fully applied, by using different types of data sources providing information on cyanobacterial accumulations.

AB  - Grasslands, wet meadows, fens, bogs, and marshes represent important ecosystems that host many orchid species. However, research on the joint effect of the multi-scalar abiotic drivers on orchid distribution and abundance in these habitats is limited. In this study, we investigated factors associated with the occurrence and abundance of 42 orchid taxa in grasslands and herbaceous wetlands of 29 mountains and the surrounding low altitude areas in western Serbia (eastern Dinaric Alps, southeastern Europe). Niche analysis of orchids was performed using outlying mean index analysis (OMI). In addition, we used similarity profile analysis (SIMPROF) to classify orchid taxa into ecological groups, multi response permutation procedure (MRPP) to analyse the differences in orchid composition between vegetation types, and indicator species analysis (ISA) to detect orchids with an affinity to a certain type of vegetation and geological bedrock. The most important gradients that separate orchids within the sampled environmental conditions were moisture, temperature, altitude and soil pH. Moreover, this study underlines the importance of certain vegetation types and geological bedrocks in determining the distribution and abundance of orchids. In total, eight ecological groups of orchids were distinguished. The results have shown that 11 orchid taxa are indicators of specific vegetation types, whereas 13 orchid taxa are indicators of specific bedrock types. The study area provides suitable conditions for survival of some rare and endemic orchid species that have southern limits of their distribution in this part of southeastern Europe. The study suggests that the joint effect of ecological factors, especially vegetation communities and bedrock types, is important to consider in the planning and management of orchid species conservation.

AB  - The ongoing biodiversity decline across taxonomic groups, including insects, is tightly related to land-use changes and habitat degradation. To assess habitat quality, proper bioindicators that allow efficient monitoring of temporal changes in habitat properties and help to understand the role of anthropogenic activities in shaping habitat characteristics, are needed. Orthopterans have been previously proposed as promising bioindicators for grassland ecosystems; however, comprehensive quantitative information on their habitat preferences is lacking, which hinders full utilization of their bioindication potential. In this study, we surveyed orthopteran assemblages and quantified local environmental conditions at 476 grassland sites in Central Europe. To model orthopteran habitat preferences, the Maxent approach was employed, which allowed us to detect continuous species responses to particular habitat characteristics (moisture, vegetation cover, vegetation height, average seasonal temperature, and direct radiation). We calculated ecological niche indices describing niche widths, species optima, and the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a total of 38 analysed species. Evaluation of final Maxent models showed that their predictive power was high for the great majority of investigated species. Red-listed species had significantly narrower niches compared to unlisted orthopterans. In addition, application of the developed quantitative ecological niche indices for ecological and conservation studies was demonstrated on an independent, previously published dataset. The development of quantitative ecological niche indices coupled with the existing time- and cost-effective survey methods, also allowing adoption of citizen science approaches, makes orthopterans an optimal model insect group for assessment of grassland condition and conservation.

AB  - Anthropogenic sensory pollution is affecting ecosystems worldwide. Human actions generate acoustic noise, emanate artificial light and emit chemical substances. All of these pollutants are known to affect animals. Most studies on anthropogenic pollution address the impact of pollutants in unimodal sensory domains. High levels of anthropogenic noise, for example, have been shown to interfere with acoustic signals and cues. However, animals rely on multiple senses, and pollutants often co-occur. Thus, a full ecological assessment of the impact of anthropogenic activities requires a multimodal approach. We describe how sensory pollutants can co-occur and how covariance among pollutants may differ from natural situations. We review how animals combine information that arrives at their sensory systems through different modalities and outline how sensory conditions can interfere with multimodal perception. Finally, we describe how sensory pollutants can affect the perception, behaviour and endocrinology of animals within and across sensory modalities. We conclude that sensory pollution can affect animals in complex ways due to interactions among sensory stimuli, neural processing and behavioural and endocrinal feedback. We call for more empirical data on covariance among sensory conditions, for instance, data on correlated levels in noise and light pollution. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to test animal responses to a full-factorial set of sensory pollutants in the presence or the absence of ecologically important signals and cues. We realize that such approach is often time and energy consuming, but we think this is the only way to fully understand the multimodal impact of sensory pollution on animal performance and perception.

AB  - Coastal recreation and water quality are major contributors to human well-being in coastal regions. They can also interact, creating opportunities for ecosystem based management, ecological restoration, and water quality improvement that can positively affect people and the environment. Yet the effect of environmental quality on human behavior is often poorly quantified, but commonly assumed in coastal ecosystem service studies. To clarify this effect we investigate a water quality dataset for evidence that environmental condition partially explains variation in recreational visitation, our indicator of human behavior. In Puget Sound, WA, we investigate variation in visitation in both visitation rate and fixed effects (FE) models. The visitation rate model relates the differences in annual recreational visitation among parks to environmental conditions, park characteristics, travel cost, and recreational demand. In our FE model we control for all time-invariant unobserved variables and compare monthly variation at the park level to determine how water quality affects visitation during the summer season. The results of our first model illustrate how visitation relates to various amenities and costs. In the FE analysis, monthly visitation was negatively related to water quality while controlling for monthly visitation trends. This indicates people are responding to changes in water quality, and an improvement would yield an increase in the value of recreation. Together, these results could help in prioritizing water quality improvements, could assist the creation of new parks or the modification of existing recreational infrastructure, and provide quantitative estimates for the expected benefits from potential changes in recreational visitation and water quality improvements. Our results also provide an example of how recreational visitation can be quantified and used in ecosystem service assessments.

AB  - Diatom and geochemical data from Crawford Lake, Ontario, have been used to document limnological responses to periods of cultural disturbance resulting from native Iroquoian occupation of the watershed (1268-1486 AD) and Euro-Canadian agriculture and deforestation (1867 AD-present). Here, we further develop the high-resolution nature of the Crawford Lake sediment record to examine the physical, chemical and biological aspects of limnological response to human disturbances in the lake catchment area with exceptional detail. We report detailed diatom abundance and flux data for individual taxa from Crawford Lake, and further describe the relationship between assemblage composition and environmental conditions using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Diatom assemblage data are used to calculate diatom inferred-total phosphorus (DI-TP) concentrations for the past similar to 1,000 years. We also examine the diatom community response during and after periods of disturbance by Iroquoian and Euro-Canadian populations, and compare this response to existing geochemical proxies of lake production and new elemental geochemical indicators of catchment area erosion. In particular, we explore the differing limnological response to the two distinct periods of cultural eutrophication and examine the limnological processes that occurred during the period of low (or no) human activity (1487-1866 AD), when geochemical indicators of lake production recovered to pre-disturbance conditions, but diatom assemblages notably did not. Our results illustrate the highly susceptible nature of diatom communities to periods of anthropogenic disturbance, and emphasize that ecological indicators (such as diatom assemblages) should be included with other proxies (such as nutrient concentrations and physical characteristics) when assessing disturbance and recovery in lake systems.

AB  - Australian farmers are searching for reliable, easily measured indicators of soil health to monitor sustainability of their enterprises. Over the past 5 years earthworms have been promoted as indicators of soil health by some researchers. Others have been reluctant to accept soil macrofauna in general as soil health indicators. Their reluctance is based on the difficulty of interpreting biological data in relation to soil health as there is no clear understanding of the links between soil macrofauna and soil health. The problem is further compounded by the inherent difficulty in studying soil biota, inadequate experimental design, and the lack of long-term commitment to funding such studies. This paper reflects on current research, and maps out conditions and directions for future research if the role of soil macrofauna in soil health is to be better understood. The compilation of adequate baseline data, the appropriate delineation of experimental plots, attention to the totality of environmental conditions including land management practices, the consideration of impact by macrofauna other than earthworms, are some of the directions are outlined. The challenge in the future will be to shift the emphasis of soil macrofauna research towards understanding their function in soil processes essential to ecosystem functioning. Without this sort of experimental evidence scientists cannot indicate to the farmer whether the soil resource is declining in quality, is stable or in a process of renewal based on the presence or absence of certain macrofauna.

AB  - Purpose Land is used and modified in its natural function for the cultivation of food and energy crops, for infrastructure and other production purposes. Despite their global significance, land use impacts are still rarely addressed, although methods for integrating land use into Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This paper describes the development and calculation of regionalized characterization factors based on the LANCA (R) (Land Use Indicator Value Calculation in Life Cycle Assessment) method to be integrated into LCA using a geo information system (GIS). Methods With the publication of the LANCA (R) characterization factors (Bos et al. 2016), land use impacts can be assessed at the country level. However, soil parameters as well as climatic conditions change on a small scale and are very site-specific. Therefore, there is a need for regionalized characterization factors. After a literature review, we describe the development of the five LANCA (R) indicators. Afterwards we present the conceptual framework for the calculation of GIS-based characterization factors and apply this framework to two examples, the indicators of mechanical filtration and physicochemical filtration. Finally, we apply the characterization factors in a case study. Results, application and discussion The region-specific characterization factors are calculated in a GIS environment yielding a map with values for mechanical filtration and physicochemical filtration per grid cell for various land use types. A case study shows that land use impacts fluctuate due to site-specific conditions such as pedological, topographical and climatic conditions. It can be shown that our calculation of regionalized characterization factors in global maps is feasible and facilitates an area's potential for causing lower environmental impacts for a certain land use compared to other areas. Remaining challenges are related to input data quality, the comprehensibility of the results to practitioners that are not land use experts and the technical restrictions of LCA database and software providers. Conclusions Through the presented regionalization of the LANCA (R) framework, a necessary prerequisite to method advancement is met as also region-specific characterization factors can now be calculated. In comparison to the published country-specific characterization factors in Bos et al. (2016), the developed regional GIS-based characterization factors are far more advantageous especially for large countries. Nevertheless, it has to be noted that an LCA including the evaluation of land use does not replace methods and tools like environmental impact assessment. When deciding on a preferable location for a specific land use nature conservation, geographical, geological and building law aspects must also be taken into account.

AB  - The notion that effective environmental governance depends in part on achieving a reasonable fit between institutional arrangements and the features of ecosystems and their interconnections with users has been central to much thinking about social-ecological systems for more than a decade. Based on expert consultations this study proposes a set of six dimensions of fit for water governance regimes and then empirically explores variation in measures of these in 28 case studies of national parts of river basins in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa drawing on a database compiled by the Twin2Go project. The six measures capture different but potentially important dimensions of fit: allocation, integration, conservation, basinization, participation, and adaptation. Based on combinations of responses to a standard questionnaire filled in by groups of experts in each basin we derived quantitative measures for each indicator. Substantial variation in these measures of fit was apparent among basins in developing and developed countries. Geographical location is not a barrier to high institutional fit; but within basins different measures of fit often diverge. This suggests it is difficult, but not impossible, to simultaneously achieve a high fit against multiple challenging conditions. Comparing multidimensional fit profiles give a sense of how well water governance regimes are equipped for dealing with a range of natural resource and use-related conditions and suggests areas for priority intervention. The findings of this study thus confirm and help explain previous work that has concluded that context is important for understanding the variable consequences of institutional reform on water governance practices as well as on social and environmental outcomes.

AB  - Recovery dynamics in a previously disturbed stream were investigated to determine the influence of a series of remedial actions on stream recovery and to evaluate the potential application of bioindicators as an environmental management tool. A suite of bioindicators, representing five different functional response groups, were measured annually for a sentinel fish species over a 15 year period during which a variety of remedial and pollution abatement actions were implemented. Trends in biochemical, physiological, condition, growth, bioenergetic, and nutritional responses demonstrated that the health status of a sentinel fish species in the disturbed stream approached that of fish in the reference stream by the end of the study. Two major remedial actions, dechlorination and water flow management, had large effects on stream recovery resulting in an improvement in the bioenergetic, disease, nutritional, and organ condition status of the sentinel fish species. A subset of bioindicators responded rather dramatically to temporal trends affecting all sites, but some indicators showed little response to disturbance or to restoration activities. In assessing recovery of aquatic systems, application of appropriate integrative structural indices along with a variety of sensitive functional bioindicators should be used to understand the mechanistic basis of stress and recovery and to reduce the risk of false positives. Understanding the mechanistic processes involved between stressors, stress responses of biota, and the recovery dynamics of aquatic systems reduces the uncertainty involved in environmental management and regulatory decisions resulting in an increased ability to predict the consequences of restoration and remedial actions for aquatic systems.

AB  - Ocean climate, environmental and biological conditions vary on several spatio-temporal scales. Besides climate change associated with anthropogenic activity, there is growing evidence of a natural global multi-decadal climate signal in the ocean-atmosphere-biosphere climate system. The spatio-temporal evolution of this signal is thus analyzed during the 20th century and compared to the variability of small-pelagic fish landings. It is argued that the low-frequency global ocean environment and plankton ecosystems must be modified such that small-pelagic populations vary accordingly. A small-pelagic global index or fishing `regime indicator series' RIS) i.e. a small-pelagic abundance indicator) is used. RIS is derived from fish landings data in the four main fishing areas in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Global RIS changes phase from positive to negative values) when SST multi-decadal anomalies are out-of-phase between the eastern Pacific and southern Atlantic. RIS also displays maxima during the mid-30s to early-40s and the late-70s to early-80s when the multi-decadal signal was approximately changing phases Tourre and White 2006 Geophys. Res. Lett. 33 L06716). It is recognized that other factors may modulate fish stocks, including anthropogenic predation. Nevertheless it is proposed that variable climate and environment, and the low-frequency `global synchrony' of small-pelagic landings Schwartzlose et al 1999 S. Afr. J. Mar. Sci. 21 289-347), could be associated with the multi-decadal changes in global ocean climate conditions.

AB  - Located in Central China and the middle reaches of Yangtze River, Hubei Province is distributed in a transitional belt where physical conditions and landscapes are on the transition from north to south and from east to west. It is one of the regions possessing most energetic and greatest potential in both today and future socio-economic development in Central China. Well known as "a land of rice and fish", the region enjoys some of the favorable physical conditions, with a diversity of in natural resources and the suitability for growing various crops. According to analytic hierarchy process (AHP) the indicators' weights of the agricultural systems function system in Hubei Province are worked out. According to Multiple Hierarchies, Targets Fuzzy Comprehensive Measurement Model, Triangle Evaluation Model, the economic function, eco-environmental function and the social function in Hubei Province are all calculated, then the whole agricultural systems function is worked out and the regional differentiation regularity of agricultural systems function is summed up. It is considered that the difference of the agricultural systems function in each county in Hubei Province is great while the regional differentiation of agricultural systems function is regular. According to the difference seven agricultural systems function regions in Hubei Province (Wuhan-Ezhou-Huanggang (1), Northeast of Hubei (11), Southeast of Hubei (111), Jianghan (IV), North of Hubei (V), Northwest of Hubei (VI), and Southwest of Hubei (VII)) are distinguished, their function are identified and studied. Based on the analysis the problems of each of the regions are found out, solutions that can maximize integrated benefits economically, socially and ecologically by enhancing the management of ecosystems and optimizing systematic capability are sought out.

AB  - Drought is one of the major natural hazards affecting the environment and economy of countries worldwide, Reliance on weather data alone is not sufficient to monitor areas of drought, particularly when these data can be untimely, sparse, and incomplete. Augmenting weather data with satellite images to identify the location and severity of droughts is a must for complete, up-to-date, and comprehensive coverage of current drought conditions, The objective of this research was to standardize, by time of year, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to augment drought-monitoring techniques. The Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI) describes the probability of vegetation condition deviation from "normal," based on calculations from weekly NDVI values, The study was conducted with 12 years (1989-2000) of Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite images. Z-scores of the NDVI distribution are used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the present vegetation condition at a given location relative to the possible range of vegetative vigor, historically. The SVI can be interpreted as vegetation condition based on the fact that vegetation is an efficient integrator of climatic and anthropogenic impacts in the boundary layer of the atmosphere. It thereby provides a spatially and temporally continuous short-term indicator of climatic conditions. Findings indicate that the SVI, along with other drought monitoring tools, is useful for assessing the extent and severity of drought at a spatial resolution of 1 km. The SVI is capable of providing a near-real-time indicator of vegetation condition within drought regions, and more specifically areas of varying drought conditions.

AB  - Peatlands in northern Ontario, Canada, archive multiple biological indicators, including macrofossils, algae, testate amoebae, and pollen. These proxies can provide insights concerning the timing and nature of long-term climatic and environmental changes. The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) of central Canada contain one of Earth's largest continuous peatland complexes, and thus comprehensive spatial and temporal studies are needed to understand the implications of climate change on carbon cycling. Diatom assemblages were examined in three cores retrieved from ombrotrophic bogs across two Canadian terrestrial ecozones. Comparisons were made with testate amoebae and macrofossil data previously analyzed from these cores, as well as with regional pollen records from surrounding peatlands. From 2000 to 600 cal. BP, changes in diatom composition likely reflect hydrosere succession within the peatland, including fluctuations in connectivity to the water table and pH changes. From 600 cal. BP to present, the synchronous timing of changes in diatoms and testate amoebae are tracking drying conditions and subsequent microhabitat variations that occur within bogs. It is possible that diatoms are tracking subtle changes in the stability of peat microforms including bog hollows and hummocks, highlighting their sensitivity to small chemical change, whereas testate amoebae are tracking the lowering of a peatland water table and subsequent drying of the peatland. The use of multiple proxies provides a more holistic approach to interpreting past ecological succession and responses to climate within peatlands. When present and well preserved, diatoms can be applied to track drying conditions in bogs, in terms of both hydrosere succession and present climatic change.

AB  - Coral communities worldwide are progressively more stressed by anthropogenic activities that increase fluxes of sediment and other pollutants to nearshore areas. Some nearshore coral reef environments off the Equatorial margin of Brazil, including Pirangi and Maracajau, Rio Grande do Norte (RN, Brazil), seem to be under human-induced stress. However, the horizontal extent of this stress, its effects, and assessment of the environmental response depend on the hydrodynamic conditions (circulation and deposition patterns), sedimentary facies, and the availability of biological indicators. We investigate two Brazilian live reefal corals' communities by examining seven photosymbiont-bearing species (PSB) of Foraminifera, Amphisorus hemprichii, Amphistegina gibbosa, Archaias angulatus, Borelis schlumbergeri, Heterostegina antillarum, Peneroplis carinatus, and Laevipeneroplis proteus, using numerical analysis FORAM Index (FI), grain size, and particulate organic and inorganic carbonate. Here, we show that coarse sand fraction followed by fine sand fraction and high hydrodynamics plays an important role in transportation and deposition of sediments and foraminiferal tests in the study area. According to FI results, conditions at Pirangi are not suitable for coral reef growth. Maracajau has sites that are suitable for coral reef growth and sites where coral could not survive after a stress event. We need long-term assessments to improve our knowledge of the distribution and ecological importance of Brazilian reef-dwelling foraminifers and to extend the application of FI to monitoring management plans of the Pirangi and Maracajau National Marine Parks by providing a first insight into the biodiversity patterns and a reliable tool of the reconstruction of paleo reef health.

AB  - This article surveys the recent literature that has assessed China's ecological restoration programs, including the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) and the Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP). Our presumption is that the performance of these programs should be determined by their effectiveness of implementation and significance of impact. Implementation effectiveness can be measured with such indicators as land area converted or conserved, and survival and stocking rates of restored vegetation, while impact significance can be gauged by the induced changes in ecosystem functionality and stability (erosion control, biodiversity protection, etc.) and socioeconomic conditions. Coupling this matrix with an exhaustive search of the publications, we find that: (1) the implementation effectiveness has not been examined as extensively as the impact significance; (2) efforts to assess the impact significance have concentrated on the SLCP, particularly its socioeconomic effects: growth of income, alternative industry, and employment, and likelihood of re-conversion; and (3) most of the socioeconomic studies are based on rural household surveys and discrete choice and difference in differences models. While much has been learned from previous studies, a lot more needs to be done in improving our understanding of the program execution and impacts. Future work should pay more attention to the NFPP and other programs, and the environmental impacts and the implementation effectiveness of all of them. To these ends, analysts must gather more field data regarding the evolving ecosystem conditions and socioeconomic information of higher aggregation, and conduct their research across scales and disciplines, with better application of geospatial technology and more effective modeling.

AB  - The limited resources available for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services call for prioritisation schemes. For instance, in the process of systematic conservation planning site selection is partly determined by efficiency gains. In this paper we present an alternative method for global spatial priority-setting based on ecological indicators, combined with social and economic conditions that influence the effectiveness of conservation, and measures for the long-term persistence of biodiversity. In the analysis the assumption made is that nature conservation should prioritize the effective maintenance of functional ecosystems that do not only provide the most ecosystem services but are also more likely to have a high adaptive capacity towards unavoidable environmental change. Furthermore, the effectiveness and permanence of conservation projects is tied to certain socioeconomic and political conditions that, as we suggest, should be evaluated as part of the conservation priority-setting process. We propose three new priority categories: eco-functionally wise (EcoWise), socioeconomically wise (SocioWise) and proactive allocation of conservation resources considering future climate change (ClimateWise) expressed as indices based on 16 different indicators. Analysing the combined effects of these three categories (EcoSocioClimateWise), in a spatially explicit way highlights the importance of tropical, subtropical but also some temperate and boreal forest areas all of which are characterized by high values of vegetation density, tree height and carbon storage. Our recommendations for policy makers prompt a shift in conservation planning towards advocating the use of ecological and socioeconomic indicators in combination with proxies for the vulnerability to future climate change impacts.

AB  - Researchers have long assessed the ecological impacts of metals in running waters, but few such studies investigated multiple biological groups. Our goals in this study were to assess the ecological impacts of metal contamination on macroinvertebrates and fishes in a northern Japanese river receiving treated mine discharge and to evaluate whether there was any difference between the metrics based on macroinvertebrates and those based on fishes in assessing these impacts. Macroinvertebrate communities and fish populations were little affected at the downstream contaminated sites where concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd were 0.1-1.5 times higher than water-quality criteria established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We detected a significant reduction in a few macroinvertebrate metrics such as mayfly abundance and the abundance of heptageniid mayflies at the two most upstream contaminated sites with metal concentrations 0.8-3.7 times higher than the water-quality criteria. There were, however, no remarkable effects on the abundance or condition factor of the four dominant fishes, including masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou). These results suggest that the richness and abundance of macroinvertebrates are more sensitive to metal contamination than abundance and condition factor of fishes in the studied river. Because the sensitivity to metal contamination can depend on the biological metrics used, and fish-based metrics in this study were limited, it would be valuable to accumulate empirical evidence for ecological indicators sensitive to metal contamination within and among biological groups to help in choosing which groups to survey for general environmental impact assessments in metal-contaminated rivers.

AB  - Regional lists of protected species commonly include rare plant species that are found in small, isolated populations at the range margin or disjunct. However, such populations often have suspicious origins and may have been historically introduced and now falsely viewed as native. Here I use a simple community ecology approach to assess whether plant community composition and site features can indicate whether local populations of a rare cryptogenic species are more likely of natural or introduced origin. I took the vernal geophyte Leucojum vernum L. in North France as a case study. Using multivariate analyses I show that L. vernum occurs in various plant communities, which correspond to different sets of environmental conditions. More specifically, several community types clearly reflect an introduced origin, with a discrepancy between L. vernum's autecology and site features as well as a number of co-occurring anthropophilous species, including xenophytes. These populations are often associated with more or less ancient human artefacts, such as archaeological sites. In contrast, an equal number of community types likely correspond to natural populations, that are all located at the range margin and connected to the core range via a (former) west-flowing river corridor, pleading for a post-glacial re colonization. I conclude that a cryptogenic species, such as L. vernum in this case study, has a "socio-ecological signature" which can indicate whether a given population is more likely native or introduced, and thus informs conservationists on where to prioritize conservation efforts.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the structure of zooplankton in three artificial water reservoirs, the technological function of which is to pre-treat waters from a drainage system of a brown coal open mine by removing inorganic suspension. The background for the zooplankton qualitative and quantitative analyses was the hydrochemical conditions in the individual reservoirs. The greatest zooplankton abundance (N), number of taxa (n), Shannon's diversity (H'), and species eveness (J') was noted in reservoir Chabielice (N-mean = 1311 ind. L-1, n=26, H'= 2.09, J'= 0.64) which was dominated by eurytopic Rotifera species (Keratella cochlearis, Keratella tecta, Keratella valga, Polyarthra longiremis, Filinia longiseta). Their abundance was positively correlated with water pH and nutrient concentrations. Reservoir Kamien was characterized by the highest mean values of total suspension (9.6 mg L-1), chlorophyll a (Chl a) content (10.4 mu g L-1), and water temperature (20.0 degrees C). These factors significantly correlated with crustacean biomass. The thermal-oxygenation conditions, low trophic level, and low productivity of the water (Chl a= 5.4 mu g L-1) in reservoir Polnocny determined the overall low zooplankton abundance (N-mean = 153 ind. L-1). Artificial water bodies of opencast mine drainage systems are biologically unstable, but they do have some characteristics of natural ecosystems, and they do take over their functions. Zooplankton is an indicator of their ecological functionality. Knowledge gained about such reservoirs could contribute to decision-making about strategies for water reclamation and how to manage it.

AB  - Variation in vegetation can provide fundamental information about environment and resources management, especially in mining areas with vulnerable ecosystems. Research has demonstrated that vegetation patterns across river basins, plateaus, and mountains have been affected by climate change. However, variation in vegetation caused by natural conditions and mining activities in arid and semiarid mining areas is rarely examined. Using the Yushenfu mining area as a case study, based on the Sen + Mann-Kendall method, spatiotemporal characteristics of variation in vegetation were first analyzed using normal difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data from 2006 to 2015. For comparison, a traditional linear regression method was applied to characterize NDVI trends, indicating the feasibility of the Sen + Mann-Kendall method. Subsequently, the effect of geomorphology, groundwater depth, and drought index on NDVI was assessed. The same geomorphology or groundwater depth did not correspond to a specific NDVI value, and a relationship between the drought index and NDVI was obtained. Then, unexploited areas and mined areas were compared, revealing that mining activities have a very obvious negative impact on vegetation ecology. Furthermore, the buried depth of the ecosafety groundwater table was determined to be 1.5-5.0 m based on the curve describing the relationship between groundwater depth and NDVI. This analysis produced an ecological sensitivity map with four key zones: primary, secondary, and tertiary sensitive areas and non-sensitive areas. These results provide a theoretical basis for developing fair and equitable outcomes for mineral resource development and environmental protection.

AB  - To understand the ecological status and macrobenthic assemblages of the Xin'an River Estuary and its adjacent waters, a survey was conducted for environmental variables and macrobenthic assemblage structure in September 2012 (Yantai, China). Several methods are adopted in the data analysis process: dominance index, diversity indices, cluster analysis, non-metric multi-dimentional scaling ordination, AMBI and M-AMBI. The dissolved inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus of six out of eight sampling stations were in a good condition with low concentration. The average value of DO ((2.89 +/- 0.60) mg/L) and pH (4.28 +/- 0.43) indicated that the research area faced with the risk of ocean acidification and underlying hypoxia. A total of 62 species were identified, of which the dominant species group was polychaetes. The average abundance and biomass was 577.50 ind./m(2) and 6.01 g/m(2), respectively. Compared with historical data, the macrobenthic assemblage structure at waters around the Xin'an River Estuary was in a relatively stable status from 2009 to 2012. Contaminant indicator species Capitella capitata appeared at Sta. Y1, indicating the animals here suffered from hypoxia and acidification. AMBI and M-AMBI results showed that most sampling stations were slightly disturbed, which were coincided with the abiotic measurement on evaluating the health conditions. Macrobenthic communities suffered pressures from ocean acidification and hypoxia at the research waters, particularly those at Stas Y1, Y2 and Y5, which displays negative results in benthic health evaluation.

AB  - In the spring 2012, post-flotation tailings of the inactive impoundment Lintich (Slovakia) were sampled. In the impoundment sediment and also in its surrounding, we detected concentration of Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, and Ba exceeding limiting values. We detected low values of the microbial biomass carbon and microbial activity in the impoundment sediment (LiS) and its dam (DAM) along with potential respiration stayed relatively low and therefore also substrate availability index and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) were higher in the control sample (REF) than in the LiS and the DAM. The low qCO(2) level indicates that microbial community, despite of dangerously high levels of heavy metals in sediment, is still able to sufficiently utilize sources of available organic carbon. Anyway, we could doubt function of the metabolic index as universal indicator of environment conditions, regarding the anthropogenic substrates. We confirmed changes in composition of the mite communities along gradient dam-impoundment. The percentage of eudominant, recendent, and subrecendent species increased at the expense of dominants and subdominants, all together with decreasing diversity and equitability of the community. We identified species Chamobates borealis, Carabodes rugosior, Metabelba propexa, and Pergalumna nervosa with negative respond under the heavy metal stress. Species Adoristes ovatus was indifferent and Dissorhina sp., Hafenrefferia gilvipes, and Oppiella nova prospered under the loaded conditions. Forty years after experimental afforestation, we expect specific community of actively surviving microorganisms and Oribatida species detected in the DAM are usual in the greatly degraded habitats or on sites in the early succession.

AB  - Benthic polychaetes in the largest intertidal mudflat of Hong Kong were analysed for potentially stressed environmental conditions from pollution. Over a two-year period, a total of 14 species were recorded with the species diversity (H'(log(2))) ranged from 0.54 to 2.4. The community was dominated by two large polychaetes (Neanthes glandicincta and Potamilla acuminata) and a number of small pollution tolerant species (Tharyx, Capitella capitata and Prionospio cirrifera). It was also characterized by both temporal and spatial variations in terms of abundance and species composition with the lowest species number observed at onshore Station B in August and the highest at offshore Station D in February. Two distinct polychaete communities were formed along the intertidal towards subtidal mudflat, particularly the assemblage at onshore Station B showing a significant difference from those at the other three stations (P < 0.05, N = 32). Results of the abundance-biomass comparison (ABC) indicated a typical impacted community at the whole study area, especially at Station B which was close to the Shenzhen River mouth and mangrove forest. The total organic carbon had a significant positive effect on the abundance of Capitella capitata (P = 0.037, N = 8) while sedimentary compositions were statistically related to the abundance of Potamilla acuminata, Tharyx and total abundance of polychaetes (P < 0.05, N = 8). In conclusion, both the polluted Shenzhen River and nearby mangrove may be responsible for the decline in species richness and diversity as well as changes in community structure. Polychaetes can be used as the appropriate indicators in habitat ecological condition assessment instead of the whole benthic community.

AB  - The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) uses Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) calculations, and the associated regulatory process, to manage harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) attributable to non-point source (NPS) pollution. TMDLs are based on response (lagging) indicators (e.g., measurable quantities of NPS (nutrients: nitrogen {N} and phosphorus {P}), and/or sediment), and highlight the negative outcomes (symptoms) of impaired water quality. These response indicators belatedly address water quality issues, if the cause is impaired riparian functions. Riparian functions assist in decreasing the impacts of droughts and floods (through sequestration of nutrients and excess sediment), allow water to remain on the land surface, improve aquatic habitats, improve water quality, and provide a focus for monitoring and adaptive management. To manage water quality, the focus must be on the drivers (leading indicators) of the causative mechanisms, such as loss of ecological functions. Success in NPS pollution control, and maintaining healthy aquatic habitats, often depends on land management/land use approaches, which facilitate the natural recovery of stream and wetland riparian functions. Focusing on the drivers of ecosystem functions (e.g., vegetation, hydrology, soil, and landform), instead of individual mandated response indicators, using the proper functioning condition (PFC) approach, as a best management practice (BMP), in conjunction with other tools and management strategies, can lead to pro-active policies and approaches, which support positive change in an ecosystem or watershed, and in water quality improvement.

AB  - High levels of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus can cause unhealthy biological or ecological conditions in surface waters and prevent the attainment of their designated uses. Regulatory agencies are developing numeric criteria for these nutrients in an effort to ensure that the surface waters in their jurisdictions remain healthy and productive, and that water quality standards are met. These criteria are often derived using field measurements that relate nutrient concentrations and other water quality conditions to expected biological responses such as undesirable growth or changes in aquatic plant and animal communities. Ideally, these numeric criteria can be used to accurately diagnose ecosystem health and guide management decisions. However, the degree to which numeric nutrient criteria are useful for decision making depends on how accurately they reflect the status or risk of nutrient-related biological impairments. Numeric criteria that have little predictive value are not likely to be useful for managing nutrient concerns. This paper presents information on the role of numeric nutrient criteria as biological health indicators, and the potential benefits of sufficiently accurate criteria for nutrient management. In addition, it describes approaches being proposed or adopted in states such as Florida and Maine to improve the accuracy of numeric criteria and criteria-based decisions. This includes a preference for developing site-specific criteria in cases where sufficient data are available, and the use of nutrient concentration and biological response criteria together in a framework to support designated use attainment decisions. Together with systematic planning during criteria development, the accuracy of field-derived numeric nutrient criteria can be assessed and maximized as a part of an overall effort to manage nutrient water quality concerns.

AB  - Some of most used indicators in marine ecology are nucleic acid-derived indices. They can be divided by target levels in three groups: 1) at the organism level as ecophysiologic indicators, indicators such as RNA: DNA ratios, DNA: dry weight and RNA: protein, 2) at the population level, indicators such as growth rate, starvation incidence or fisheries impact indicators, and 3) at the community level, indicators such as trophic interactions, exergy indices and prey identification. The nucleic acids derived indices, especially RNA: DNA ratio, have been applied with success as indicators of nutritional condition, well been and growth in marine organisms. They are also useful as indicators of natural or anthropogenic impacts in marine population and communities, such as upwelling or dredge fisheries, respectively. They can help in understanding important issues of marine ecology such as trophic interactions in marine environment, fish and invertebrate recruitment failure and biodiversity changes, without laborious work of counting, measuring and identification of small marine organisms. Besides the objective of integrate nucleic acid derived indices across levels of organization, the paper will also include a general characterization of most used nucleic acid derived indices in marine ecology and also advantages and limitations of them. We can conclude that using indicators, such RNA: DNA ratios and other nucleic acids derived indices concomitantly with organism and ecosystems measures of responses to climate change (distribution, abundance, activity, metabolic rate, survival) will allow for the development of more rigorous and realistic predictions of the effects of anthropogenic climate change on marine systems.

AB  - Biophysical condition is one indicator of the immediate success of efforts to restore degraded rivers as well as longer-term progress towards improving water quality. In the context of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), the biophysical condition of river systems in the UK also reflects how well international environmental policy translates into improved river management domestically. We assess whether the condition of river systems in the UK has improved or declined over the past two decades, whether regions identified by the first WFD assessment have improved or declined, and thus, how effectively international policy has been implemented nationally. Methods include: statistical and spatial analysis of more than 25,000 habitat condition records collated in the River Habitat Survey over the 1990s and 2000s; computing of an Index of Change for Local Authorities; and comparison of Indices of Change with a sub-sample of 1,727 WFD assessments conducted in 258 Local Authorities. Findings include that three of four measures indicate that biophysical quality has declined, although only the decline in one measure (habitat quality) was statistically significant. Riparian quality has improved, although measures do not consider invasive compared to native coverage. In total, 27 regions were identified with the worst declining quality. Comparative analysis of regions suggests that condition has declined most substantially in regions that were previously in "good" condition. Priorities for future investment include improving degraded sites, protecting high quality sites, and increasing monitoring of "data poor" regions. Our methodology offers an approach for utilising "messy" routinely collated data like the RHS. However, guidelines are needed to support the use of similar datasets for the international river restoration community.

AB  - A methodology of eco-energy analysis of power-intensive equipment, based on the calculation of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, is presented. According to the presented methodology, a comparative eco-energy analysis of vapor compression and ejector air conditioners operating with R245fa and natural refrigerant R600a at different working conditions in China and Ukraine has been undertaken. As a result, new eco-energy indicators, which allow for the determination of the prospects of alternative air conditioning system implementation, have been developed. It is shown that ejector air conditioners have eco-energy prospects for implementation if they are driven by waste heat from several industries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem approaches to management require monitoring of processes and species indicative of the integrity of the system in order to understand the effects of management and other perturbations. We examined the effects of three timber harvest options (single-tree selection, patch cuts, no harvest) on the reproductive biology of a possible indicator of bottomland forest ecosystem integrity, the prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea). Timber harvests reduced the number of available nest cavities, reduced the density of breeding males on the plots, and increased the sizes of male territories. However, timber harvest had no obvious effect on nest predation or brood parasitism frequencies. Brood parasitism was instead related to distance from a nearby levee, a main source of brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) in the area. Productivity remained similar within suitable habitat regardless of treatment. Reproductive success was strongly influenced by annual variation, which we attribute to the timing and extent of annual flooding, a fundamental ecosystem process in floodplain forests. Continued anthropogenic alterations in flooding patterns may have a greater influence than current timber management on the future population levels of prothonotary warblers in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. This species, with others, could play a valuable role in an ecosystem-oriented monitoring program.

AB  - This paper deals with ecological and biological properties of Holm Oak trees (Quercus ilex L.) on the Island of Rab. Forest ecosystems are influenced by numerous local meteorological and climatic conditions. In spring 2006 four experimental plots (2x2 m), one in the middle forest (both seed and coppiced trees) and three in coppices of different age and structure, were established on the Island of Rab.
   Rotronic hygromers for measuring air temperature (degrees C), relative air humidity (%), wet bulb temperature (degrees C) and dewpoint/frostpoint (degrees C) were placed on two sites (middle forest and coppice). The values were measured from May 2006 to May 2007. Lux-meter was used for measuring relative light intensity. In 2006 soil humidity (%) was measured five times with Theta Probes model ML2x at the average depth of Holm Oak seedling rooting. On three occasions 30 Holm Oak seedlings were samples for root analysis. The scanner Epson Expression 10000XL and software WinRHIZO ProLA2400 for the analysis of washed roots were used to determine the total root length (cm), average root diameter (mm), volume (cm(3)), number of tips (pcs), forks (pcs) and crossings (pcs). In order to determine the natural mortality, the seedlings and young plants of Holm Oak were counted on ten occasions during the three years of research (in 2006, 2007 and 2008). The seedling heights were measured at the end of the germination phase and at the end of the first growing season.
   Minimum air temperature in coppice was lower compared to the middle forest. Microclimatic conditions in coppice are less favorable for the growth and development of vegetation than those in the middle forest. Coppice has higher air temperature and lower relative air humidity compared to the microclimate in the middle forest. Large numbers of natural Holm Oak seedlings and young plants were recorded on all the four experimental plots, which can be attributed to favorable climatic factors influencing the yield on the Island of Rab. A large number of seedlings was obtained in coppice (480,000-1,190,000 pcs/ha) compared to the middle forest (465,000 pcs), which can be attributed to the age of the stand, i.e. the size of the fructifying trees and the shrub cover. There is a great variability between the four experimental plots with respect to the end of germination (4/7 - 3/10). The germination of Holm Oak seedlings in the middle forest reached its peak earlier (4 July 2006) than in the coppice (31 July 3 October), which implies the presence of better microclimatic site conditions. On some experimental plots Holm Oak acorns were germinating throughout 2006, which is an indicator of poor germination conditions. The key factor responsible for seed dormancy in this case was the lack of moisture in the soil. Statistically significant larger heights of Holm Oak seedlings were measured in the middle forest compared to the heights in the coppice. The mortality of young Holm Oak plants was also by 8.98% higher in the middle forest than in the coppice. The mortality of Holm Oak seedlings and young plants between 3 October 2006 and 30 January 2008 was 52.35%. The same trend of seedling and young plant mortality was recorded on all the experimental plots. After 27 months a large number of natural young plants of very good vitality survived on all the plots.
   A negative and very high correlation between the root length and average root diameter was obtained for Holm Oak seedlings and young plants (r=-0.7884). With respect to the measurement date there was no significant difference in root volume, which means that in the 20 months of research there was no significant increase in root volume of Holm Oak seedlings and young plants in the soil.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAVs or Drones have made great progress in the field of aerial surveys to study vegetation and farmland. The research focuses on developing smart systems for managing agricultural fields, thus facilitating decision-making, increasing agricultural productivity, improving profitability and protecting the environment. The paper highlights the ability of drones to distinguish agricultural land intended for cultivation and classified as deserted or cultivated or in the germination stage. For the first time in the Nineveh governorate, a Phantom 4 DJI UAV images were used, in addition to using the spatialized Pix4Dfielde program to process these images. Four types of the standard agricultural indices that rely on the visible spectrum have been used (Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI), Triangular Greenness Index (TGI), Synthetic Normalized Differences Vegetation Index (S-NDVI) and Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI)) to test UAVs images and to categorize different types of agricultural land. The results showed that when using the S-NDVI and VDVI indicators, the values 0.16 and 0.14 appeared respectively in certain areas, which indicates the presence and integrity of vegetation cover, unlike other regions, whose indicators showed 0.010 and -0.004, respectively, which indicate that the plant has a bad condition or its absence at all. All results finding in this research reflect and confirm the validity of using UAVs images for agricultural field management and development.

AB  - The overall fish welfare in sea-caged European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) was quantitatively assessed by adapting the Salmon Welfare Index Model (SWIM 1.0). In the model, a total of 16 operational welfare indicators in three segments (i) individual fish-based; (ii) fish-group specific; and (iii) sea cage environment-specific indicators were evaluated. In this study, the welfare indicators for salmon aquaculture which are incompatible with the characteristics of European sea bass were modified. Differently from SWIM 1.0, the welfare indicators of smoltification and salinity were eliminated; however, gill integrity and pH were added in the modified model of this study while the water temperature attributes were also changed in the model proposed. The modified model was tested for two sea cage farms of European sea bass (Farm A and Farm B) in two different locations of Mediterranean Sea for the first time. The overall welfare scores were expressed by a scale from 0-poor to 1-good welfare. The overall welfare assessment calculated by the model yielded the value of 1.0 and 0.81 for Farm A and Farm B, respectively. Based on the scores, Farm A represented the conditions of 'good welfare' while Farm B gave fair warning about welfare status. The methodology developed in the SWIM 1.0 model can be applied to European sea bass in Mediterranean aquaculture with small modifications.

AB  - The importance of riparian forests in maintaining water quality through the retention of sediments and nutrients is well understood; however, little is known about how sediment deposition from upland erosion affects the integrity ' of these systems. The objectives of this study were to compare decomposition rates, net N mineralization rates, microbial biomass, and other soil properties along a gradient of sedimentation rates in headwater systems. These factors were measured in 17 plots situated within riparian forests of ephemeral streams at Ft. Benning, GA. The soils were analyzed for texture, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and bulk density, A decline in soil quality was found with increasing sedimentation rates. Soils in plots with the highest sedimentation rates (highly disturbed or HD) exhibited decreased CEC, temperature, and moisture, and increased bulk density, sand content, and pH. The HD plots also had lower nutrient turnover from decomposition, net N mineralization rates, and microbial C and N. Declines in biogeochemical processes corresponded to sedimentation rates associated with HD plots (1.0 cm yr(-1)). Shifts in biological indicators corresponding to annual variations in climate suggest that the stress of sedimentation may be further exacerbated by drought conditions. The results of this study imply that even low levels of erosional deposition in headwater riparian forests may significantly impact biogeochemical processes in these systems.

AB  - In schizophrenia there is a consistent epidemiological finding of a birth excess in winter and spring. Season of birth is thought to act as a proxy indicator for harmful environmental factors during foetal maturation. There is evidence that prenatal exposure to harmful environmental factors may trigger pathologic processes in the neurodevelopment, which subsequently increase the risk of schizophrenia. Since brain white matter alterations have repeatedly been found in schizophrenia, the objective of this study was to investigate whether white matter integrity was related to the season of birth in patients with schizophrenia. Thirty-four patients with schizophrenia and 33 healthy controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging. Differences in the fractional anisotropy maps of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls born in different seasons were analysed with tract-based spatial statistics. A significant main effect of season of birth and an interaction of group and season of birth showed that patients born in summer had significantly lower fractional anisotropy in widespread white matter regions than those born in the remainder of the year. Additionally, later age of schizophrenia onset was found in patients born in winter months. The current findings indicate a relationship of season of birth and white matter alterations in schizophrenia and consequently support the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of early pathological mechanisms in schizophrenia.

AB  - Ecological restoration has traditionally been evaluated by monitoring the recovery of ecological conditions, such as species abundance and diversity, physical form, and water quality; monitoring the social benefits of restoration is uncommon. Current monitoring frameworks do not track who benefits from restoration or by how much. We investigate how ecological restoration could be monitored to provide indications of improvement in terms of social conditions. We provide suggestions for measuring several categories of social indicators, including access, beneficiaries, and quality of benefit, using information compiled from natural and social science literature. We demonstrate how to evaluate ecological and social indicators over time at a site or landscape scale using multicriteria analysis. We use flood protection and recreation as example benefits to monitor.

AB  - 1. Urbanisation causes important losses in biodiversity and ecosystem of animals. To test whether these negative effects are preceded by unhealthy individuals in urban populations, we evaluated the effects of urbanisation on the abundance and physical condition of the dung beetle Dichotomius guaribensis, an endemic species of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
   2. We sampled beetles in nine forest fragments with different urbanisation degrees, embedded in the urban matrix of the city of Joao Pessoa. Besides testing the abundance in each fragment, we quantified four indicators of physical condition in males and females: body size, body mass, energetic condition, and mite load.
   3. Females tended to be larger, and to have less lipid mass and more mites than males. Urbanisation had no effect on beetle abundance, but it negatively affected body mass and lipid content in males, but not females, revealing different sensitivities for both sexes. Body size and mite load were not affected by urbanisation in males or females. Fragment size had no effect on beetle abundance and physical condition in both sexes, suggesting that urbanisation has a greater impact than fragment size on beetle individual condition.
   4. In this study, we show that individual deterioration precedes population declines in disturbed environments, and our study opens new insights into the proximate causes that leads to the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in urbanised regions.

AB  - Microorganisms have been proposed as early indicators of wetland change; however, there is often too little information to reliably use microbial parameters for this purpose. The objective of this study was to document how nutrient loading, plant community, and season affected arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (expressed as percent colonized root length), other fungi (estimated by ergosterol concentration), and bacteria (quantified by direct counts) in soil and detritus, and thereby to broadly evaluate the potential of native microorganisms to serve as indicators of wetland integrity. Dominant wetland plant communities (Panicum, Cladium, Typha, Salix, mixed herbaceous, and deep-water slough) were sampled seasonally from nutrient-impacted and reference areas of a central Florida wetland with historic nutrient loading (only Cladium occurred in both impacted and reference areas). Nutrient impact increased soil and detrital ergosterol and bacterial counts in some plant communities and seasons (e.g., Cladium sampled in the fall); however, the nutrient effect was confounded by interactions with the plant community and season. Nutrient impact reduced AM root colonization in samples from impacted compared to reference Cladium communities during summer and fall; however, there were again significant interactions with season and other plant communities. We conclude that before soil fungi and bacteria can be used as indicators of wetland integrity background values for each plant community and season need to be well documented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this work is to analyse the possibility to use ordered fuzzy numbers within the frameworks of the TOPSIS method to assess the contractor using selected work health and safety management system criteria. Selection of a contractor is a decision-making problem for a decision-maker as it involves many criteria. In many situations, these criteria may at the same time be highly different: qualitative, quantitative, stimulants, destimulants. Fuzzy number orientation points to the type of criterion which we have to do with while carrying out our assessment. In order to assess and select the contractor, six different work health and safety management system criteria were used: (1) number of persons employed in hazardous work environment conditions, (2) rate of occupational risk assessments completed, 3) number of persons employed in hazardous conditions with reference to whom hazards have been eliminated or reduced over the year down to the level that complies with the standard, (4) indicator of the organisational preventive system usage, (5) training procedure and workplace instruction conformance level, and (6) number of benefits on account of working in conditions that are detrimental or hazardous to health. The criteria and their weights were established taking into account the nature of installation and maintenance works being planned. As a source of information, we used Z-10 annual working conditions reports submitted by companies to GUS [Polish Central Statistical Office], and work health and safety procedures submitted by five contractors. As a result of our research work, we have established that the use of ordered fuzzy numbers within the frameworks of the TOPSIS method makes it possible to streamline the contractors being reviewed from the point of view of selected criteria, and to select the company which meets the adopted work health and safety criteria to the greatest extent.

AB  - Knowledge of the current condition of reef communities is essential for the implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs). In 2014, we assessed the conditions of reefs of two MPAs in the Caribbean: Guanahacabibes National Park (Guanahacabibes), Cuba and Costa Occidental de Isla Mujeres - Punta Cancun - Punta Nizuc National Park (Cancun), Mexico. Within each of the two MPAs studied, we examined two reefs. We took data from fifteen 10-m long transect lines. Indicators included coral cover, diameter of coral colonies, old and recent coral mortalities and coral diseases. The abundance of coral recruits and the density of Diadema antillarum were assessed in 1 m(2) quadrats. The cover of groups of macroalgae was obtained from 25 x 25 cm quadrats. Our data illuminated distinct stages in the loss of reef structure similar to what has been seen by other investigators, particularly the change in the dominance of coral species and the deterioration of the three-dimensional structure of reefs. The Cue-vones site (in Cancun), which has been closed to tourism for fifteen years, remains dominated by corals, with a high coral cover (33.36%), but with a species dominance (principally Porites astreoides), different from the lead species observed in the Caribbean a few decades ago. The reefs of Guanahacabibes (Laberinto and Yemaya) subject to a low diving intensity appear to be at an earlier stage of changes than the Cancun reefs. The coral indicators remains similar to previous reports, so perhaps this can be slowed or reversed. Meanwhile, Manchones in Cancun showed the lowest coral cover (11.49%) and the lowest recruit density (0.6 recruits/m(2)), probably due to the joint action of the natural pressures and to the heavy influx of visitors these reefs receive.

AB  - Nanometer-sized liposomes containing the oxygen-sensitive indicator tris(1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium chloride (Ru(phen)(3)) in their internal compartment have been prepared and tested for their oxygen-sensing capabilities in aqueous solution. A standard injection technique, where a lipid mixture consisting of dimyristoylphospatidylcholine, cholesterol, and dihexadecyl phosphate (molar ratio 5:4:1) all dissolved in dry 2-propanol injected into an aqueous solution of 10 mM Ru(phen)(3) under vortexing, is used to prepare the liposomes. A high uniformity of the liposomes is realized by extruding them back and forth through a 100-nm pore size polycarbonate membrane. TEM images of the liposomes, stained with uranyl acetate, show that the liposomes are unilamellar, round in shape, maintain high structural integrity, and average 70 mn in diameter. Dynamic light-scattering measurements support-this observation. Under our experimental conditions, the entrapment efficiency of Ru(phen)(3), defined as the ratio between the concentration of dye molecules encapsulated in the liposomes and the dye concentration in the solution used for liposome formation, is similar to 1%, The liposomes show high stability with respect to dye leaking at room temperature for 8 days and high photostability when exposed to the excitation light. Individual liposomes are used to monitor the enzymatic oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase in their vicinity. The newly prepared oxygen-sensitive liposomes can be applied for noninvasive oxygen analysis in tissues and single biological cells.

AB  - The permanent risk of environmentally caused accidents, which exceed the design limits of power plant components, makes the evaluation of safety margins against failure a crucial task. The evaluation concepts proposed in technical standards are mostly stress-based. These concepts are usually unable to fully utilize the high ductility of common materials used for power plant components. To overcome this disadvantage, a proposal for a strain-based structural integrity assessment (SIA) concept is given in this paper.
   The SIA concept is based on damage mechanics simulations using the Rousselier model. To cover the influences of stress triaxiality, component size, non-proportional loading and multiple loadings, the standard Rousselier model is enhanced by three extensions. First, the von Mises plasticity law is replaced by a Hosford-like yield criterion to introduce the influence of the Lode angle on the plastic deformation behavior. Second, for the prediction of failure under shear stress conditions, the description of damage evolution is enhanced by an approach developed by Nahshon and Hutchinson. Last, back-stress tensors are added to describe the very low cyclic loading behavior.
   All theoretical extensions are verified on the basis of an extensive experimental program using ferritic steel 20MnMoNi5-5. At the end, the proposed SIA concept is successfully validated using a combined pressure and in-plane bending test of a pipe branch.

AB  - Nowadays, smart cities are using advanced technologies to control and coordinate physical, social, and commercial enterprise systems to deliver high-quality services to their residents while guaranteeing the effective usage of available resources. Numerous major corporations, as well as government bodies, are involved in the construction of smart cities because smart city activities also need information that is obtained from organizations. Blockchain-based technology allows for peer-to-peer exchanges as a public ledger that maintains records of transactions, smart contracts, agreements, and shipments without third-party mediators. In the future, smart cities will be equipped with several innovative technologies, a huge amount of data, a lot of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and a heterogeneous environment. However, data processing among IoT devices in futuristic smart cities is a challenging task. In this paper, the author proposed a blockchain-based big data integrity service framework for IoT devices data processing in smart cities. The author collected the necessary data from various resources and applied three experiments to evaluate the key performance indicators. K-mean algorithm was used to classes the data, and blockchain strategy was applied to ensure secure communication among IoT devices. The framework was simulated and tested using 100 devices. The proposed framework allowed IoT devices to efficiently use information collected from different resources to engage in operational processes and exchange information.

AB  - Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized peptides with antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogenic bacteria that cause spoilage, possessing important potential for use as a natural preservative in the food industry. The novel bacteriocin BM1300 produced byLactobacillus crustorumMN047 was identified after purification in this study. It displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against some selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of BM1300 againstStaphylococcus aureusATCC 25923 andEscherichia coliATCC 25922 were 13.4 mu g/mL and 6.7 mu g/mL, respectively. Moreover, BM1300 showed excellent thermal (between 60 and 120 degrees C), pH (2-11), and chemical (Tween-40, Tween-80, Triton X-100, and EDTA) stabilities. Time-kill curves revealed that BM1300 exhibited bactericidal activity againstS.aureusandE.coli. The scanning and transmission electron microscopy indicated that BM1300 acted by disrupting the cell membrane integrity and increasing cell membrane permeabilization of indicator bacteria. The disruption of cell membrane integrity caused by BM1300 was further demonstrated by the uptake of propidium iodide (PI) and the release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and nucleic acid and proteins. Moreover, BM1300 affected cell cycle distribution to exert antibacterial activity collaboratively. Meanwhile, BM1300 inhibited the growth ofS.aureusandE.coliof beef meat and improved the microbiological quality of beef meat. These findings place BM1300 as a potential biopreservative in the food industry.

AB  - Concern about the impacts of water regulation upon the aquatic environment has led to increasingly stringent regulatory constraints on the quantity and timing of freshwater withdrawals. For the time being these regulatory constraints tend to be articulated in terms of limits upon withdrawals, partly because of limited knowledge of the condition and resilience of the aquatic ecosystems. A more sophisticated approach to regulation would be more directly related to indicators of ecological condition. Moreover, it would consider ecosystem response to climatic events not present in the historical record. In this paper we use a combination of empirical evidence of ecosystem condition with simulation to propose and test reductions to regulatory limits on river water withdrawals and downstream minimum flow requirements. The study uses multi-level linear regression to relate the Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation (LIFE) to antecedent flow statistics observed in the Lee catchment, England. The selected flow statistics included extreme low (Q90) and high (Q10) flows in the summer season (April-Sept), and the median flows observed in the winter season (Oct-Mar). The derived model is used to forecast the response of the macroinvertebrate index to future flow scenarios and demand forecasts, incorporating the uncertainties in ecosystem response. Simulation is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the indices to different regulatory limits. Results indicate that macroinvertebrate health will worsen under 21st Century climate conditions, and that the existing regulation policy must be modified to maintain historically observed LIFE scores into the future. The framework demonstrates how regulations could move from precautionary limits on withdrawals to an approach based on observations, forecasting and simulation, allowing planners to refine the trade-offs between river health and reliable water supply in the face of uncertainty.

AB  - Measurements of littoral vegetation stands and species-level surveys of associated plant communities were made in channels of the Kissimmee River from 1998 through 2008, a period that spanned channelized, non-flowing conditions through 7 years of near-continuous reestablished flow. Dissected by flood control canal C-38 in 1971, the river was virtually without flow until early 2001, when Phase I of the Kissimmee River Restoration Project (KRRP) reestablished flow to a central section of river channel. This study evaluated the effects of reestablished flow on littoral vegetation in river channels as an indicator of system status and progress toward the project goal of ecological integrity. Predictions of vegetation response to reestablished flow included reduction in the width of vegetation stands, and changes in the growth-form composition of littoral stands from near-equal dominance by floating and emergent species to overwhelming dominance by emergent growth forms. Variables included plant cover by species and growth-form, width of vegetation stands, and vegetated percentage of channel. Under the currently incomplete (interim) status of the KRRP, results for littoral vegetation stands indicate trends in the predicted directions of change, and three of four predicted changes have occurred. Vegetation stand widths decreased substantially and littoral plant communities became heavily dominated by emergent species; BACIPS (before-after-control-impact-paired series) analyses indicated significant restoration effects for most littoral stand metrics.

AB  - The present study illustrates how benthic macrofauna indices can be adapted to foraminifera through inter calibration of data from common sites. As an example of how benthic foraminifera can fit into governmental monitoring programs, we focus on Norwegian conditions by proposing a new foraminifera-based multimetric index, NQI(_f). The index is an adaptation of the Norwegian Quality Index (NQI), which is an internationally intercalibrated macrofauna index.
   The study is based on published and new data for soft-bottom benthic foraminifera, macro invertebrates, and associated bottom water dissolved oxygen and sediment total organic carbon (TOC). Paired samples of foraminifera and macrofauna were collected at the same stations, at more or less the same time, along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast, NE North Sea. The intercalibration was based on linear regression and the EcoQS class boundary values for the foraminifera indices were derived from boundary values for the macrofauna indices defined by the Norwegian governmental guidelines. The correlations between foraminifera and macro fauna for the multimetric NQI and the diversity indices H'log(2) and ES100 were all acceptable for intercalibration (according to the Water Framework Directive's guidelines) but NQI showed the best correlation. Both foraminifera- and macrofauna-indices showed significant correlations with the bottom water dissolved oxygen concentration, and for some indices, with the TOC content in the sediment. Overall, the foraminifera and macrofauna indices reflected the environmental conditions similarly but at the most oxygen depleted stations only foraminifera were present. Based on the present findings and on previous studies which show a potential of fossil foraminifera to define in situ reference conditions, we recommend that foraminifera are accepted as a Biological Quality Element within the WFD.

AB  - Forecasting settlements of non-hazardous waste is essential to ensure the integrity and durability of landfill covers over time. Over a short time span, the survey of settlements may also contribute to the investigation of the biodegradation processes. This paper addresses secondary settlements of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), a heterogeneous and time-evolving material.
   An analysis of available experimental data from different pilots and the literature was conducted to quantify the influence of biodegradation on MSW secondary settlements. After making assumptions about the various features of the waste and their constitutive relationships, a one-dimensional biomechanical model to predict the secondary settlement has been developed. The determination of the total secondary settlement was obtained by the addition of two separate parts, the mechanical settlement, due to creep, and the biochemical settlement, due to the degradation of the organic matter. The latter has been evaluated based on the observed biogas production. Using the data from different recent large-scale experiments that provide a monitoring of biogas production, a method for predicting the biochemically-induced settlements is proposed and validated on these tests. The relative contributions of mechanical and biochemical settlements are also calculated and discussed as a function of waste pre-treatment and operation conditions (biological pre-treatment, shredding, leachate injection). Finally, settlement may be considered as a relevant indicator for the state of biodegradation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Located in the hinterland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Three-River Headwaters region (THR) features unique eco-environmental conditions and fragile ecosystems, which are very vulnerable to climate change. To investigate the impacts of varying climate conditions, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was employed as an indicator to reflect the response of the vegetation dynamics. A series of pixel based VEgetation Dynamics Stepwise-cluster Prediction models (VEDSP) were proposed to establish the relations between NDVI and climate conditions through using the data series of remotely sensed precipitation and temperature. The obtained simulation results for training and testing showed very good agreements with the monthly NDVI observations. Rather than air temperature, the precipitation was identified as the critical climatic factor to result in various NDVI values, especially the 2-month consecutive average precipitation. The developed VEDSP models were further applied to predict the temporal and spatial distributions of NDVI values for five future years (2020, 2040, 2060, 2080 and 2100) according to climate projections of Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change Climate Model (CMCC-CM) under the RCP4.5 scenario. The projected changes of NDVI indicated a slightly significant positive trend in annual average NDVI values, while the monthly peak values of NDVI for the entire THR would decrease by 5.34% in the future relative to the historical averages of the time period from 2000 to 2013. Distinct effects of precipitation and temperature on the response of NDVI were further demonstrated. Findings from this study would be used to help analyze the ecological effects of climate change and enhance the understanding of ecological changes in the future.

AB  - Dramatic changes in the physical and biological conditions off Washington and Oregon, USA, have occurred since 1998, including extreme El Nino (warm) and La Nina (cool) years, high and low Columbia River flow years, a major intrusion of subarctic water, and a low oxygen event on the shelf. The occurrence of contrasting environmental conditions provided an excellent opportunity to examine pelagic nekton distributions and their abiotic and biotic associations. Pelagic surface trawl surveys conducted during June and September from 1998 to 2002 off northern Washington to central Oregon revealed a nekton community dominated by Pacific herring (33.5 % of total catch), Pacific sardines (29.9%), and northern anchovy (12.3%). Between 1998 and 2002, species composition shifted from a community dominated by southern species (mackerels and hake) to one dominated by northern species (squid, smelts, and salmon), but the transition was gradual, and small pelagic species (sardines, herring, and anchovy) showed no consistent trends in abundance over time. Species diversity/evenness was highest in September 2002. Cluster analysis identified 7 species and 6 station clusters. Subyearling Chinook salmon, market squid, Pacific sardine, yearling coho salmon, and Pacific saury were the strongest indicator species for 5 of these cluster groups. Cluster group distributions differed between both inshore/offshore and north/south. A 3-dimensional ordination explained 55 % of the total variance with bottom depth, distance from shore, and sea-surface temperature correlated with the first axis, latitude with the second axis, and surface salinity, surface density and stability with the third axis. Our results suggest that the habitats occupied by pelagic nekton species expand and contract in relation to the dynamic nature of the California Current and are affected by changing ocean conditions at both seasonal and interannual periodicities.

AB  - Marine ecological indicators can be used to assess the condition of the pelagic ecosystems. The bloom onset provides a warning bell for possible changes in trophic interactions and biogeochemical processes. However, depicting the phenology of phytoplankton blooms at high latitudes, where long-term observations are sparse or unavailable, is not a straightforward task. A data-interpolating empirical orthogonal function algorithm was applied to daily satellite-retrieved chlorophyll-a images to produce a long-term (1998-2014) and cloud-free data set over the North Water (NOW) polynya. The seasonal bloom was modeled using a multi-Gaussian approach from which a baseline of phenological characteristics was extracted. The correlation analysis highlights the influence of environmental factors, such as sea surface temperature, cloud fraction, wind stress, and sea-ice concentration, in modulating the bloom start date, its duration, and amplitude. The year-to-year variability in bloom onset appears to be controlled by a delicate balance between oceanographic and meteorological conditions. Blooms last longer during years characterized by a longer open-water period and are shorter during those characterized by greater sea-ice coverage. Noteworthy is the decrease in phytoplankton bloom amplitude over the 17 years examined. Collectively, these outcomes depict the NOW as a climate-sensitive region in which the pelagic marine ecosystem seems to be going toward a decline in chlorophyll-a concentrations. Satellite time series are still too short to differentiate between inter-annual variability, inter-decadal variability, and climate change signal. Should these changes persist; however, the NOW may no longer act as a productive regional oasis supporting thriving populations of zooplankton and top predators.

AB  - Hydroelectric dam operation can alter discharge and temperature patterns, impacting fish populations downstream. Previous investigations into the effects of river regulation on fish have focused on a single species within a river, yet different results among studies suggest the potential for species-specific impacts. Here, we compare the impacts of two different hydropeaking regimes relative to a naturally flowing river on three ecologically important members of the forage fish community: longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) and trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus). Annual growth, estimated from otolith back-calculations, was higher for each of the species in the regulated river relative to the naturally flowing river but did not differ between hydropeaking regimes. Condition was assessed using weight-length relationships and differed between rivers for each species, and between hydropeaking regimes for longnose dace and slimy sculpin. Survival of longnose dace and slimy sculpin was lower in the regulated river relative to the naturally flowing river, but comparable between rivers for trout-perch. Annual growth was significantly related to mean summer discharge in the regulated river and to mean summer water temperature in the naturally flowing river for each species, and significantly different slopes among species indicate species-specific responses to discharge and temperature alterations. This study demonstrates different biological responses among fish species within rivers to regulation in general, as well as to specific hydropeaking regimes. Future studies should focus on multiple species and multiple indicators of fish health to more fully characterize the impacts of river regulation on downstream fish communities.

AB  - Orchids are potentially useful as ecological indicators because of their sensitivity to habitat fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbance. While many studies explore the effect of single factors on orchid diversity, few investigate how the extent, configuration, and condition of surrounding habitat affect whole orchid communities. Here, we unravel the effect of biological invasions, anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., grazing pressure, ecological condition), and habitat fragmentation on an Australian orchid community. We sampled 39 plots across nine sites in the Mount Lofty Ranges, Australia. We recorded the number of orchid species and number of individuals per species in mid-winter, early-spring, and late-spring to account for the effect of season on species visibility, with 115 surveys in total. We ranked grazing intensity and ecological condition, and estimated cover of exotic species. We analyzed the response of richness and diversity through generalized linear mixed models, and differences in species composition through non-metric multidimensional scaling. Habitat configuration in the surrounding landscape had different effects at increasing radii, explaining 29%-87% of variance. Patch-level orchid diversity was positively correlated with habitat edges in the immediate area, and with habitat cohesion at medium scales, whereas diversity was negatively correlated with increasing mean patch habitat area across larger surrounding areas. Orchids co-existed with exotic species but were negatively affected once exotic cover exceeded 20%. Species composition was correlated with exotic cover. Our findings reveal a complex relationship between orchid communities and their surrounding environments suggesting orchids benefit from a somewhat disturbed environment at patch and landscape scales. These idiosyncratic responses suggest orchid diversity may be unreliable as early-warning indicators of habitat disturbance.

AB  - Although gammarid species are promising bioindicators of metal bioavailability in freshwaters, interspecies variability is still rarely assessed in situ. Besides, ambient environmental conditions inherent to the species' occurrence are likely to affect metal bioavailability, hence hampering the interpretation of field bioaccumulation data. The study aimed to assess the relevance of using common gammarid species for biomonitoring water quality at the scale of a river basin. Gammarids were collected at 20 sites of the Seine basin during three consecutive years to establish geographical distribution patterns of the species and their metallic contamination levels. The sites were characterised in terms of physiography, physicochemistry, hydrothermal regime and land use to identify ecological factors explaining the absence or presence of species. Bioaccumulation abilities of Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Pb and Zn were compared between species as a function of the exposure levels and environmental characteristics of their occurrence. Statistical analyses indicated that the occurrence of Gammarus fossarum and Gammarus pulex, as native species of the Seine basin, is governed by a combination of entangled environmental factors. By contrast, Echinogammarus berilloni as a naturalized species tolerated larger ranges of environmental conditions and related-land use pressures. At some sites, the absence of gammarid species was associated with unfavourable conditions, e.g. eutrophication, urbanisation. Unlike Pb, bioaccumulation abilities appeared to be comparable among species for Cd, Cu, Mn and Zn, and only between both native species for Co, when local physicochemical conditions were considered. For further, the generic responsiveness to exposure levels supported that metal contents in gammarids provide reliable information on metal bioavailability whatever physicochemistry of freshwaters and ecological zonation of these common species of the Seine basin.

AB  - Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) activity in Southern Africa tends to occur during periods of sustained elevated rainfall, cooler than normal conditions, and abundant vegetation cover creating ideal conditions for the increase and propagation of populations of RVFV mosquito vectors. These climatic and ecological conditions are modulated by large-scale tropical-wide El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena. The aim of this 5-year study was to investigate climatic conditions during Rift Valley fever "post-epizootic" period in Free State province of the Republic of South Africa, which historically experienced the largest RVF outbreaks in this country. We collected satellite-derived rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data since 2014 to understand broad environmental conditions in the years following a period of sustained and widespread large RVF outbreaks (2008-2011) in the region. We found this post-epizootic/interepizootic period to be characterized by below-normal rainfall (~-500 mm), above LSTs (~+12 degrees C), depressed NDVI (60% below normal), and severe drought as manifested particularly during the 2015-2016 growing season. Such conditions reduce the patchwork of appropriate habitats available for emergence of RVFV vectors and diminish chances of RVFV activity. However, the 2016-2017 growing season saw a marked return to somewhat wetter conditions without any reported RVFV transmission. In general, the aggregate vector collections during this 5-year period follow patterns observed in climate measurements. During the 2017-2018 growing season, late and seasonally above average rainfall resulted in a focal RVF outbreak in one location in the study region. This unanticipated event is an indicator of cryptic RVF activity during post-epizootic period and may be a harbinger of RVFV activity in the coming years.

AB  - UNESCO World Heritage List encompasses over 1000 cultural, natural and mixed World Heritage Sites (WHS) with outstanding universal value. Many of these sites are faced with geological threats which could have negative effects on the value, integrity and accessibility of their heritage assets. Assessments of geological hazards susceptibility are still limited in the literature and mostly undertaken at global to continental levels. The paucity of nationwide exercises that could be carried out based on the wealth of established datasets and models available at the geological surveys proves that there is not yet a systematic Earth-science approach applied to heritage conservation. Focusing on the WHS of the UK, this paper aims to: (i) appraise the suitability of existing geohazard mapping approaches at global to continental scale, and whether an assessment at finer scale is instead required; (ii) review nationwide geological datasets available, developed and maintained at the British Geological Survey (BGS), and provide the first quantitative assessment of the full spectrum of geological and mining-related hazards affecting WHS across the country; and finally (iii) explore how such a review can fill knowledge gaps and increase awareness of geohazards in the national WHS management sector. An assessment of hazard information from published global and European scale studies using low to medium spatial resolution hazard datasets is first provided. The review then moves to the national level and reaches the scale of the individual WHS, accounting for the extent of their Core Area, Buffer Zone and Sensitive Area as designated by UNESCO, and their geological and geohazard peculiarity. We analyse the whole spectrum of BGS datasets, including: six GeoSure ground stability products, aggressive ground conditions from BGS civils, the National Landslide Database, mass movement deposits from the Digital Geological Map of Great Britain (DiGMapGB), fluvial and coastal Geological Indicators of Flooding (GIP), and susceptibility to Groundwater Flooding (GWF). Mining data from BGS Mining hazard (not including coal), British Pits (BritPits), as well as ARUP's review of mining instability and opencast coal data from the Coal Authority are also analysed. The review reveals that ground compressibility and uneven settlement (subsidence) and landslides are the geohazards that, with higher likelihood, may affect the integrity of the UK WHS. These geohazards show the highest percentages of total susceptible land (18.6% and 11.5%, respectively), followed by corrosive (ferrous) ground conditions (11.3%), groundwater flooding at surface (14.3%) and below ground (9.7%), liquefaction of sand deposits (10.9%) and mining hazard (8.0%). These figures highlight the granularity and diversity of the geology and hazards found across the country, as well as the improvements compared to global and continental approaches. The priorities for further studies and heritage management are therefore identified. The provision of baseline geological and hazard data contributes to raise the level of preparedness of UNESCO WHS managers and the World Heritage Committee to deal with natural hazards. Review of the WHS periodic reports - cycle II (2008-2015) reveals the current level of geological hazard awareness at the UNESCO properties and identifies where activities of knowledge transfer to site managers could help to improve the understanding of geological threats.

AB  - We evaluated the effects of ecosystem composition and structure ( species richness and diversity, cover and spatial attributes of vegetation), abiotic factors ( climate and topographical features) and the condition of the bare-ground areas ( evaluated using soil-surface indicators) on the performance of Stipa tenacissima [evaluated using foliar delta(13)C, delta(15)N, nitrogen concentration and the carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio] in 15 steppes of SE Spain. Foliar delta(13)C values of S. tenacissima showed a low degree of variation in the studied steppes, with average values ranging from -24.1 to -22.9 parts per thousand. Higher variation was found in the delta(15)N values, which ranged from -5.5 to -2.4 parts per thousand. The nitrogen concentration and the C: N ratio varied between 5.0 and 8.0 mg g(-1), and between 55.4 and 85.3, respectively. The delta(13)C values became less negative with increasing spatial aggregation of perennial vegetation, while the C:N values increased with increasing perennial vegetation cover. The delta(15)N values became more negative with increasing infiltration in the bare-ground areas, but the nitrogen concentration was not related to any of the environmental variables measured. Our results suggest that the relative importance of ecosystem structure and soil-surface conditions in the bare ground areas was higher than that of abiotic factors as determinants of the performance of S. tenacissima. The results also show that even subtle changes in these ecosystem features may lead to modi. cations in plant performance in semiarid S. tenacissima steppes, and thus to modi. cations in the associated ecosystem functions in the mid- to long-term.

AB  - Ecosystem functions can be understood as the quantified amount of an ecosystem's role in a natural process, while ecosystem services are the requantification of the ecosystem functions by factoring in environmental conditions and human needs based on social perspectives. In this study, differences between ecosystem functions and services were presented in terms of air purification of a forest ecosystem. Forest volume growth was employed to quantify the pollutant absorption capacity of a forest and was indicated by the natural functions (NF) for air purification by a forest ecosystem. Forest ecosystem services can be requantified from the forest functions by adding the air pollutant and population densities. Air pollutant density was applied to the assessment of the environmental services (ES) of forest ecosystems. Furthermore, the environmental social services (ESS) of forest ecosystems were assessed by including population density considerations. We simulated differences in NF, ES, and ESS in relation to pollutant and population density; while NF was spatially quantified without a close relationship to air pollutant and population density, ES and ESS reacted to environmental and social condition more sensitively. These results imply that the ecosystem services of forest resources for air purification are high where the pollutant and population densities are high, while the ecosystem functions of forest resources for air purification depend solely on forest conditions and not on the density changes of air pollutants and population. This study suggests that the differences in NF, ES, and ESS are important factors to be understood and considered in the decision-making process for ecosystem services. When considering human needs and surrounding environmental conditions, the results suggest that decision makers should utilize the ES and ESS concepts, which reflect both population and pollutant density along with additional human-related factors.

AB  - Anthropization of insular ecosystems may have negative impacts on native populations of lizards, which provide core ecosystem services on islands. We aimed to identify environmental factors to explain the interlocal variation in faecal glucocorticoids, parasite intensity, and body condition in populations of insular lizards. A cross-sectional design during the summer of 2017 and 2018 was used to sample 611 adult lizards, Gallotia galloti. Interlocal variation of three stress indicators was analysed in response to environmental variables across a wide environmental gradient in Tenerife (Canary Islands): (i) concentration of faecal glucocorticoids, (ii) intensities of infection by hematic parasites, and (iii) body condition. The data, with low spatial autocorrelation, were analysed using multimodel inference and model cross-validation. Bioclimatic variables associated with the extreme hot and dry climate of summer were the most informative predictors. Interlocal variation in faecal corticosterone in males was best fitted to a model that included the maximum temperature of the warmest month, although the best predictor was habitat anthropization. The thermal annual range, associated with extreme thermal events, was positively related to faecal corticosterone in females. Extreme hot temperatures were positively related to the median parasite intensities in both sexes, while the highest mean intensities of infection were found in females from the most xeric coastal localities. None of the predictors tested, including faecal glucocorticoids, explained individual or interlocal variation in body condition. Effects of human pressure and climate change on insular populations of lizards can be additive. However, the uncoupled relationship found between body condition and the faecal glucocorticoid content suggests that current negative effects may be aggravated during drought periods in summer. Given the impact of climate change on islands, our results may be of application to other archipelagos, where lizards also play key ecological roles. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main objective of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to achieve good ecological status for surface waters in Europe by 2015. The ecological status has to be defined based on near-natural reference conditions. Benthic invertebrates and diatoms arc among the key biological elements recommended by the Directive to assess ecological quality of water bodies. The purpose Of this Study is to identify species associations of these biological elements that are characteristic of the different stream types occurring in Luxembourg and that distinguish degraded from reference conditions. In general, the results reveal that diatoms and invertebrates can be considered as complementary indicators with more diatom species being characteristic of small size stream types and more benthic invertebrate species being associated with larger stream types. Among invertebrates, Trichoptera, Hydrachnidia, Ephemeroptera and Diptera show high affinities for most stream types. Plecoptera, Oligochaeta appear as useful indicators for some particular types. If only reference sites are selected (all river types considered), the number of indicator species drops from 55 to 24 for diatoms and front 81 to 48 for benthic invertebrates. Moreover, for the larger stream type, no reference site was found at all. This trend is likely to be a consequence of the Multiple anthropogenic pressures that have affected large parts of European lowland rivers for decades. Our results Suggest that Trichoptera, Hydrachnidia, Diptera, Ephemeroptera and Oligochaeta could be considered as best candidate groups for a tiered-taxonomic resolution approach where only taxa which have narrow and specific ecological requirements would be identified to finer levels. In Central Europe, however, since taxonomic Soundness and easy recognition arc required, only Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera are the groups to be recommended at the present time.

AB  - We analyzed data from 967 randomly selected wetland sites across the conterminous United States (US) as part of the 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA) to investigate the relative and attributable risk of various stressors on wetland vegetation condition. Indicators of stress included six physical stressors (damming, ditching, filling/erosion, hardening, vegetation removal, and vegetation replacement) and two chemical stressors (soil phosphorus and heavy metals) that represent a wide range of human activities. Risk was evaluated nationally and within four aggregate ecoregions and four aggregate wetland types. Nationally, all of the stressors except soil heavy metals and phosphorus had a significant relative risk but values were always <2 (a relative risk of two indicates that it's twice as likely to have poor vegetation condition when the stressor is present relative to when it is absent). Among the different ecoregions or wetland types, no one stressor was consistently riskier; all of the stressors were associated with poor vegetation condition in one or another of the subpopulations. Overall, hardening had the highest attributable and relative risks in the most different subpopulations. Attributable risks above 25% were observed for vegetation removal in the Coastal Plain, hardening and ditching in the West, and hardening in Estuarine Woody wetlands. Relative risks above 3 were noted for heavy metals and soil phosphorus in the Interior Plains, and vegetation removal, vegetation replacement, and damming in Estuarine Woody wetlands. Relative and attributable risk were added to the data analyses tools used in the NWCA to improve the ability of survey results to assist managers and policy makers in setting priorities based on conditions observed on the ground. These analyses provide useful information to both individual site managers and regional-national policy makers.

AB  - Eutrophication is the most pressing threat to highly calcareous (marl) lakes in Europe. Despite their unique chemistry and biology, comprehensive studies into their unimpacted conditions and eutrophication responses are underrepresented in conservation literature. A multi-indicator palaeolimnological study spanning ca. 1260-2009 was undertaken at Cunswick Tarn (UK), a small, presently eutrophic marl lake, in order to capture centennial timescales of impact. Specific aims were to (1) establish temporal patterns of change (gradual/abrupt) across biological groups, thereby testing theories of resistance of marl lake benthic communities to enrichment, and (2) compare the core record of reference condition with prevailing descriptions of high ecological status. Analyses of sediment calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), pigments, diatoms, testate amoebae, cladocerans, and macrofossils, revealed three abrupt changes in ecosystem structure. The first (1900s), with biomass increases in charophytes and other benthic nutrient-poor indicators, supported ideas of resistance to eutrophication in Chara lakes. The second transition (1930s), from charophyte to angiosperm dominance, occurred alongside reductions in macrophyte cover, increases in eutrophic indicators, and a breakdown in marling, in support of ideas of threshold responses to enrichment. Core P increased consistently into the 1990s when rapid transitions into pelagic shallow lake ecology occurred and Cunswick Tarn became biologically unidentifiable as a marl lake. The moderate total P at which these changes occurred suggests high sensitivity of marl lakes to eutrophication. Further, the early record challenges ideas of correlation between ecological condition, charophyte biomass and sediment Ca. Instead, low benthic production, macrophyte cover, and Ca sedimentation, was inferred. Management measures must focus on reducing external nutrient and sediment loads at early stages of impact in order to preserve marl lakes.

AB  - Suitable methods for measuring and monitoring the condition of riparian environments are being investigated by government agencies responsible for maintaining these environments in Australia. The objective of this work was to compare two riparian condition assessment approaches, the Tropical Rapid Appraisal of Riparian Condition (TRARC) method developed for rapid on-ground assessment of the environmental condition of savanna riparian zones and an image based riparian condition monitoring scheme. Measurements derived from these two approaches were compared and correlated. The sample representativeness of the TRARC method was evaluated and the cost-effectiveness and suitability for multi-temporal analysis of the two approaches were assessed. Two high spatial resolution multi-spectral QuickBird satellite images captured in 2004 and 2005 and coincident field data covering sections of the Daly River in the Northern Territory, Australia were used in this work. Both field and image data were processed to map indicators of riparian zone condition including percentage canopy cover, organic litter on the ground, canopy continuity, tree clearing, bank stability, and flood damage. Spectral vegetation indices, image segmentation, and supervised classification were used to produce riparian health indicator maps. QuickBird image data were used to examine if the spatial distribution of TRARC transects provided a representative sample of ground based estimates of riparian health indicators. Covering approximately 3% of the study area, the sample mean of the TRARC estimates of individual indicators of riparian zone condition were in most cases within 20% of the global mean derived from the whole imaged riparian area. The cost-effectiveness of the image based approach was compared to that of the ground based TRARC method. Results showed that the TRARC method was more cost-effective at spatial scales from 1 km to 200 km of river in relatively homogeneous riparian zones along rivers with only one channel, while image based assessment becomes more feasible at regional scales (200-2000 km of river). A change detection analysis demonstrated that image data can provide detailed information on gradual change, while the TRARC method is less suited for multi-temporal analysis due to the ranked data format, which inhibits precise detection of change. However, results from both methods were considered to complement each other for single date assessment of riparian zones if used at appropriate spatial scales. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic activities do collectively lead to an alteration of the flow regime, posing a great influence upon the structure and persistence of native biotic communities within river ecosystems. The range of variability approach (RVA) method is commonly used to evaluate the flow regime alteration. However, it was reported to underestimate the degree of flow regime potentially. In this study, two new assessment methods/metrics for evaluating the process behaviors of the flow regime are developed based on Euclidean distance and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. They are then integrated with the metric of RVA, generating two composite metrics that represent both frequency and process changes of the flow regime. The new methods/metrics were applied to identify the flow regime alteration in a typical basin in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, China. The results show that the composite metrics consistently reveal a high alteration degree of flow regime in the basin. The decreased biological integrity of fish demonstrates the reasonability of the high-level overall alteration to some degree. The updated methods enable more scientific evaluation for the complex hydrologic alteration under a changing environment.

AB  - Bryophytes have been proposed as ideal indicators of ecosystem change, because they are important components of forest integrity, and considerable research indicates that some groups are sensitive to the changes associated with specific human disturbances. Bryophyte richness and abundance have been found to vary predictably along elevational gradients, but the role of human impacts on these distribution patterns remains unclear. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of human disturbance on the elevational patterns of bryophyte diversity, along an elevational gradient. Along the gradient we collected three datasets in the following sites: preserved (P), forest track roadsides (R) and disturbed by agriculture/silviculture practices (D). Two survey plots of 100 m(2) were established at every 200 m elevational step for each sites P, R, D, and in each plot bryophytes were sampled in a stratified manner. At each plot we recorded all species on available substrates and estimated their percentage cover. Our results showed that species number did not differ among studied sites, but that species diversity pattern differs among the three gradient types and species life strategy composition along the elevational gradient showed a clear response to the disturbance of mature communities. We conclude that human impact has strongly changed the elevational pattern of diversity, and that these changes vary depending on the ecological and taxonomical group considered.

AB  - The importance of restoring and maintaining environmental flows for sustaining the ecosystem integrity of rivers has been recognized in policies and legal frameworks in many countries. However this is routinely not implemented in Tanzania as exemplified by the case of the Wami River estuary, which plays a vital role in processing riverine nutrients, trapping sediment, recycling nutrients in the mangroves, and supporting the ecology of the Saadani National Park and the livelihood of the local communities. Our study reveals that currently the estuary is ecologically healthy but it is threatened by both increasing sedimentation and declining freshwater flow caused by decreasing rainfall - possibly linked with climate change - and by increasing water demand in the watershed for artisanal and large scale agriculture and irrigation schemes. Environmental flow assessment for the Wami River ( with exclusion of estuary) has been done and the minimum flows were recommended but they are not enforced. We recommend that the responsible authority (Wami-Ruvu Basin Water Office) enforce its own environmental flow recommendations in order to maintain a healthy estuarine ecosystem and regulate water usage in the watershed. A similar recommendation also holds for all other rivers and estuaries in Tanzania. (C) 2015 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Quantifying the impact of land use on water supply and quality is a primary focus of environmental management. In this work we apply a semidistributed hydrological model (SWAT) to predict the impact of different land management practices on water and agricultural chemical yield over a long period of time for a study site situated in the Arborea region of central Sardinia, Italy. The physical processes associated with water movement, crop growth, and nutrient cycling are directly modeled by SWAT. The model simulations are used to identify indicators that reflect critical processes related to the integrity and sustainability of the ecosystem. Specifically we focus on stream quality and quantity indicators associated with anthropogenic and natural sources of pollution. A multicriteria decision support system is then used to develop the analysis matrix where water quality and quantity indicators for the rivers, lagoons, and soil are combined with socio-economic variables. The DSS is used to assess four options involving alternative watersheds designated for intensive agriculture and dairy farming and the use or not of treated wastewater for irrigation. Our analysis suggests that of the four options, the most widely acceptable consists in the transfer of intensive agricultural practices to the larger watershed, which is less vulnerable, in tandem with wastewater reuse, which rates highly due to water scarcity in this region of the Mediterranean. More generally, the work demonstrates how both qualitative and quantitative methods and information can assist decision making in complex settings.

AB  - The paper considers methodological approaches to assessment of biological and environmental potential of landscape systems in the southern Kazakhstan soil-climatic conditions to the most complete and efficient use of natural resources in the design and construction of high-performance agrolandscape systems. Based on qualitative and quantitative indicators heat, light and moisture availability a mathematical model has been developed to assess biological and environmental productivity of landscape systems including soil productivity and vegetation cover.
   It should be noted that the developed model of landscapes biological productivity assessment (C-bp) takes into account the heat availability of the landscape systems soil cover (C-tb), natural moisturization coefficient of the vegetation cover (C-m), and ecological productivity of landscapes (C-bp). This model is based on the potentially available energy expended in soil-forming process (Q(n)) and natural moisturization coefficient of the vegetation cover (C-m) is one of the modifications of the qualitative and quantitative models of natural system climatic productivity, widely used in the field of geography and ecology assessment of natural system resources potential.
   Based on the developed models of landscape systems biological and environmental productivity a comprehensive assessment of South Kazakhstan region natural resource potential was performed, including Almaty, Zhambyl, Kyzylorda and Turkestan region using long-term data of 32 meteorological stations located on the territory of the region.
   Use of improved methodologies for assessment of landscape systems biological and ecological productivity can more accurately determine the biological resources of the landscape systems according to agro-ecological areas and to assess the efficiency of natural system natural resources potential.

AB  - Through the mechanisms of particle immobilization and subsequent depletion of particles, mussel cultivation has a direct effect on chlorophyll-a concentrations and Secchi depth; both of which are primary indicators of marine ecological status and metrics for water quality management. As such, mussel cultivation has been proposed as a measure to mitigate the effects of coastal eutrophication. However, the extent to which this ecosystem service, and relatedly, biomass accumulation, are affected by ambient environmental conditions involves complex interactions. To explore the interacting mechanisms underpinning depletion dynamics under various biophysical conditions along the salinity gradient in the Baltic Sea, we used an updated Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model with field data from the western Baltic Sea, accommodating osmotic stress. We use the DEB model to drive a 3D farm-scale model within a novel precompiled hydrodynamic framework (FlexSem) to evaluate the effects of different environmental conditions and farm configuration on the intensity and extent of the chlorophyll-a depletion signal. We also report on extensive in situ monitoring of chlorophyll-a and Secchi depth within and around mussel farms, from several cultivation areas from around the western Baltic Sea to evaluate site-specific characteristics of depletion. Monitoring reflected the high degree of spatio-temporal variability in the quantification of this ecosystem service; with relative differences in chlorophyll-a from-14 to 69% and Secchi depth from 0 to 75%. We find that the extensive in situ measurements in different environmental conditions can be represented by the integrated farm model in terms of mussel biomass accumulation and depletion, providing insight on the interactions of current velocity, farm orientation to predominant current direction, ambient chlorophyll-a concentrations, and total biomass loads on the intensity and spatial extent of the depletion signal. Furthermore, the model has been calibrated to cover a variety of environmental contexts and permits fine resolution simulation of multiple environmental interactions on mussel energetics, which can be used to evaluate potentials for optimizing mussel mitigation culture and the associated ecosystem services of phytoplankton depletion under local conditions without extensive recalibration from field growth data. The general interactions exhibited here and model will be useful for evaluating depletion and planning the establishment of mitigation farms in regions where national environmental monitoring programs can provide basic data. This can also reduce the need for extensive and costly in situ monitoring programs.

AB  - Biological attributes of ecosystems often change nonlinearly as a function of anthropogenic and natural stress. Plant and animal communities may exhibit zones of change along a stressor gradient that are disproportionate relative to the incremental change in the stressor. The ability to predict such transitions is essential for effective management intervention because they may indicate irreversible changes in ecological processes. Despite the importance of recognizing transition zones along a stressor gradient, few, if any, investigators have examined these responses across multiple taxa, and no community threshold studies have been reported at large geographic scales. We surveyed benthic macroinvertebrate, fish, bird, diatom, and plant communities in coastal wetlands across a geospatially referenced gradient of anthropogenic stress in the Laurentian Great Lakes. We used Threshold Indicator Taxon Analysis (Baker and King 2010) to analyze each community's response to identify potential zones of disproportionate change in community structure along gradients of major watershed-scale stress: agriculture and urban/suburban development. Our results show surprising congruence in community thresholds among different taxonomic groups, particularly with respect to % developed land in the watershed. We also analyzed uncertainty associated with the community-specific thresholds to understand the ability of different assemblages to predict stress. The high and congruent sensitivity of assemblages to development demonstrates that watershed-scale stress has discernible effects on all biological communities, with increasing potential for ecosystem-scale functional changes. These findings have important implications for identifying reference-condition boundaries and for informing management and policy decisions, in particular, for selecting freshwater protected areas.

AB  - The Permian-Triassic Boundary event at 252.2 Ma marks the largest extinction of marine fauna in the Phanerozoic and there is a wide consensus that the extinction coincided with an intense oceanic anoxic event. The stratotype of the Changhsingian Stage, precisely constrained by the PTB Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) and the GSSP for the Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian Boundary, both at Meishan in southern China, is well-documented in respect to geochronology and the pattern of extinction. Here we report secular trends in bulk isotopic parameters and lipid biomarkers in a core spanning 214 m of stratigraphic section across the PTB; and through the entire Changhsingian interval. Our analysis of these data, viewed in the context of relative sea level change and strontium isotopes, reveals distinct shifts in paleoenvironmental conditions and profound changes in plankton ecology well before and following the biological extinction event. Specifically, patterns of steroids and triterpenoids indicate a marine plankton community that was heavily dominated by bacteria during the late Wuchiapingian, middle Changhsingian and early Griesbachian stages. Secular trends in aromatic hydrocarbons diagnostic for anoxygenic green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) identify periods when euxinic conditions extended into the photic zone during the entire Changhsingian stage. Here also, the delta N-15 of organic nitrogen progressively shifted from positive values around +2 or + 3%. to -1 parts per thousand coincident with a sharp negative excursion in delta C-13(org) and slightly postdating the sharp minimum in delta C-13 values of inorganic carbon that occurs at the top of Bed 24. These results, together the published chronology indicate that conditions unfavourable for aerobiosis existed in the marine photic zone at Meishan for 1.5 million years prior to the main phase of the biological extinction. The induction of marine euxinic conditions, worldwide, at the end of the Permian was likely a consequence of the aggregation of Pangea and the uplift, weathering and transport of nutrients to the ocean well in advance of the PTB. The protracted and widespread nature of the ensuing oceanic anoxic event suggests a causal association with the mass extinction. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydrological regimes, being strongly impacted by climate change, play a vital role in maintaining the integrity of aquatic river habitats. We investigated lag in hydrologic recovery following extreme meteorological drought events, and we also discussed its implications in the assessment of ecological environment flow. We used monthly anomalies of three specific hydrometeorological variables (precipitation, streamflow, and baseflow) to identify drought, while we used the Chapman-Maxwell method (the CM filter) with recession constant calculated from Automatic Baseflow Identification Technique (ABIT) to separate baseflow. Results showed that: (i) Compared to the default recession parameter (alpha = 0.925), the CM filter with the ABIT estimate (alpha = 0.984) separated baseflow more accurately. (ii) Hydrological drought, resulting from meteorological drought, reflected the duration and intensity of meteorological drought; namely, longer meteorological drought periods resulted in longer hydrological drought periods. Interestingly, the time lag in streamflow and baseflow indicated that aquatic ecosystem habitat recovery also lagged behind meteorological drought. (iii) Assessing environmental flow by quantifying drought provided greater detail on hydrological regimes compared to abrupt changes, such as the increased hydrological periods and the different environment flows obtained. Taken together, our results indicated that the hydrological response in streamflow and baseflow (e.g., the time lag and the precipitation recovery rate (P-r)) played a vital role in the assessment of environmental flow.

AB  - This study explores ecological vulnerability to land-use change in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic Region by spatially extrapolating land and economic development, and overlaying these projections with maps of sensitive ecological resources. As individual extrapolations have a high degree of uncertainty, five methods with different theoretical bases are employed. Confidence in projections is increased for counties targeted by two or more projection methods. A county is considered at risk if it currently supports three or more sensitive resources, and is projected to experience significant growth by the year 2010 by two or more methods. Analysis designated 19 counties and two cities as at risk, highlighting within a large region the priority areas where state and regional efforts would contribute the most to integrating environmental considerations into the process of land development. The study also found that potentially severe ecological effects of future land-use change are not limited to the outskirts of major urban areas. Recreational demands on smaller communities with mountain and coastal resources are also significant, as are initiatives to promote economic development in rural areas of high ecological quality. This approach provides a comprehensive overview of potential regional development, leading to an objective prioritization of high-risk areas. The intent is to inform local planning and decision-making so that regional and cumulative ecological degradation are minimized.

AB  - The understanding of the differences between living (L) and dead (D) benthic foraminiferal assemblages and all the factors that might lead their distribution should be a key to characterize the environmental and paleoenvironmental changes accurately. Population dynamics and dissimilarities of biological nature (the differences in turnover rate and seasonal alterations in standing stock) can cause significant divergences between the L and D foraminiferal assemblages. This study compares L and D foraminifera to evaluate the sediment quality of the Brazilian Saquarema Lagoon System (SLS) using biogeochemical proxies and predict how coastal ecosystems are responding to the combined effects of eutrophication and pollution pressure and areas where the paleoenvironmental studies can be performed. The SLS is a transitional environment where total organic carbon, proteins, and dissolved oxygen are the main factors controlling the distribution of foraminiferal assemblage. The high values of biopolymers (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins) in SLS indicate a very impacted environment with long water residence time. The low values of species richness, Shannon-Weaver diversity, and evenness for both L and D foraminiferal assemblages are a consequence of fluctuating conditions in the SLS. Due to low salinities, agglutinated species and Quinqueloculina seminula can occur in the most confined areas, and Ammonia parkinsoniana, Cribroelphidium excavatum, Cribroelphidium poeyanum, and Elphidium gunteri characterized the area with the highest marine influence. Although in most of the SLS the taphonomic processes modified the original assemblage, in some regions the thanatocoenosis corresponds to the biocenosis. These areas can be considered the most suitable for future paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic studies.

AB  - The extensive use of modeling and technologies such as a geographic information system (GIS) in ecological vulnerability assessment and the recognition of eco-environmentally vulnerable areas from the perspective of spatial positioning provide important complements to urban ecological space management research. This study establishes an ecological vulnerability assessment indicator system containing nine elements and twelve indicators with respect to ecological sensitivity, ecological pressure, and self resilience. The range of ecologically vulnerable areas in a highly urbanized region is spatially recognized. Management strategies are proposed with regard to institutionalization and marketization. The results show that the ecological vulnerability in Shenzhen is good overall and that most areas are moderately vulnerable; the goal of space management is to enhance ecological function and prevent further expansion of the city as a threat to ecological security. Highly vulnerable areas are mainly distributed in the west and agglomerate with urban functional areas; it is suggested to delimit an ecological red line in this region and implement the most stringent "steel wire" control following the existing ecological protection law in China. Furthermore, this study proposes an ecological preparedness system suited for the particularity of the highly urbanized region in Shenzhen and attempts to introduce marketization into ecological restoration to solve the economic and social plight of ecological reconstruction in highly urbanized regions. The vulnerability assessment results objectively reflect the condition of the regional ecological environment, and the space management policy has implications for ecological protection, resource utilization, and sustainable development in similar cities.

AB  - Since the massive population decline of the long-spined sea urchin, Diadema antillarum. in the early 1980s, (he dynamics of coral reef ecosystems in the Caribbean have changed tremendously. The absence of D. antillarum. once a keystone herbivore, has led to macroalgal dominance in many of these reef communities. D. antillarum is not only important ecologically. but may also be a sensitive bioindicator species for toxicant exposure. Echinoderm larval development tests were conducted with 1). antillarum exposed to elevated levels of aqueous copper (Cu), silver (Ag), nickel (Ni). or selenium (Se), All metals significantly affected larval development, based on normal development to the pluteus stage. The EC50s based on dissolved metal concentrations were 11 mu g/L Cu. 6 mu g/L Ag, 15 mu g/L Ni. and 26 mu g/L Se. Adult sea urchins were exposed to aqueous copper under flow through conditions for 96h. The 96-h LC50 for this exposure was 25 mu g/L dissolved Cu, Additionally. behavioral and physiological disturbance was observed. The physiological responses included both acid-base balance disturbance, as evidenced by reduced coelomic fluid pH and apparent ionoregulatory effects. In addition. behavioral effects included spatial orientation within the exposure tank, spine closure, and loss of spines, The high sensitivity of both adult and larval D antillarum to these metals supports the use of this organism as an important biological indicator for metal exposure in marine environments.

AB  - Combining natural capital accounting tools and ecosystem restoration approaches builds on existing frameworks to track changes in ecosystem stocks and flows of services and benefits as a result of restoration. This approach highlights policy-relevant benefits that arise due to restoration efforts and helps to maximize opportunities for return on investment. Aligning the System of Environmental Economic Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) framework with risk assessment tools, we developed a risk register for peatlands in two contrasting catchments in Ireland, based on available information relating to peatland stocks (extent and condition) and flows (services and benefits), as well as knowledge of pressures. This approach allowed for identification of areas to target peatland restoration, by highlighting the potential to reduce and reverse negative trends in relation to provisioning, regulating, and cultural services, flows relating to non-use values, as well as abiotic flows. We also highlighted ways to reduce and reverse the effects of historical and ongoing pressures through restoration measures, aligning our approach with that outlined in the SER International Principles and Standards for the Practice of Ecological Restoration. Building on the synergies between the SEEA EA and the SER Standards is highlighted as a means to develop transdisciplinary collaboration, to assist in setting and achieving targets set out under the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration as well as integrating regional policy targets set under the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, and the related EU Habitats and EU Water Framework Directives.

AB  - The development of easily observable measures of restoration success is essential for monitoring of the ambitious proposed global restoration targets (e.g. The Bonn Challenge; New York Declaration on Forests). Systematic reviews with meta-analyses are a good way to evaluate the performance of different organisms in the monitoring of ecological restoration. Among the arthropods, ants have a long history in environmental monitoring. We compiled a data set and performed a global meta-analysis encompassing studies conducted in different ecosystems around the world to investigate whether richness and composition of species or functional groups (FG) of ant communities can be predicted during the restoration process. Moreover, we aimed to understand the influence of restoration technique (natural regeneration or active restoration), ecosystem type (temperate or tropical), and past land use (mining or pasture) on ant communities in areas undergoing restoration processes. Notwithstanding the varied conditions in which the studies were carried out, our meta-analysis showed that reestablishment of ant FG takes place more quickly than species richness. The recovery of ant diversity is faster in tropical ecosystems and areas under natural regeneration can have higher ant diversity than the reference areas. In temperate ecosystems, mined areas under restoration are less likely to recover the number of species than FG richness. Both species and FG composition were less predictable in our meta-analysis. As the publication of new datasets is increasing, we hope that future meta-analyses can build on the present study to further describe and understand the patterns in ant communities to be used as indicators of ecosystem restoration.

AB  - The need to monitor the environmental condition of ecosystems worldwide has resulted in a large number of potential bioindicators being proposed in the scientific literature. However, only a few have been validated at an adequate scale to monitor environmental problems and to solve management questions. Here we compiled a list of candidate seagrass indicators (n = 59) obtained from the literature. We empirically validated them on a temperate seagrass ecosystem (Posidonia oceanica) across a wide anthropogenic gradient ranging from undisturbed to severely disturbed sites. We discarded about 75 % of the candidate indicators because of their lack of sensitivity at the relevant spatial scale for biomonitoring (i.e. 10s of km against 10s of m) or across the environmental quality gradient. This illustrates the need for a careful validation of indicators prior to their use in monitoring programmes. Bathymetric variability strongly influenced indicator responses to the quality gradient. Deep meadows responded more clearly to differences in environmental quality, whereas shallow meadows were more influenced by natural sources of variability such as herbivory and physical disturbances. The 16 indicators unequivocally related to the environmental status gradient were representative of physiological, biochemical, individual, and population levels of biotic organisation. Their combination was necessary to cover the entire environmental gradient and to reflect the multiple anthropogenic disturbances causing the gradient. The selection process of indicators described here is an important step that needs to take place before the integration of these indicators to extract ecologically relevant information useful for policy and management goals.

AB  - Stressor-response models offer guidance for concentration-based nutrient criteria in lakes under human intervention. Diatom-based statistics from biological responses were incorporated to derive taxon-specific and community-level change points (thresholds) of phosphorous and nitrogen in 77 Yangtze floodplain lakes. Diatom metrics relating with conductivity were adopted as response variables, since conductivity explained the maximum variation (38.1%) in diatom assemblages via Bootstrapped regression trees. Nonparametric change-point analysis and Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis showed threshold responses of diatom community structure at 0.05-0.08 mg TP/L in connected lakes and 0.02-0.04 mgTP/L in isolated lakes. Distinct community change points of sensitive diatoms occurred at 0.96-1.63 mgTN/L in connected lakes and 0.52-0.63 mgTN/L in isolated lakes. Diatom community structures of tolerant taxa were substantially altered beyond 0.22-0.23 mg/L in connected lakes and 0.52-0.69 mg NOx/L in isolated lakes. Hydrological river-lake connectivity differed significantly in ecological nutrient criteria with more TN/TP criteria and less NOx criteria in connected lakes. Given the ecological significance and biological integrity, diatom-based statistics can provide more reliable change points (thresholds) for nutrient criteria than Chl alpha-nutrient relationships.

AB  - This study aims to assess the potential supply of the ecosystem service (ES) nutrient regulation on two spatial scales, the federal German state of Schleswig-Holstein (regional) and the Bornhoved Lakes District (local), exemplarily for the nutrient nitrogen. The methodology was developed using the ES matrix approach, which can be applied to evaluate and map ES at different geospatial units such as land use/land cover classes. A Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) was constructed in order to include additional spatial information on environmental characteristics in the assessment. The integration of additional data, which describes site-specific characteristics such as soil type and slope, resulted in shifted probability distributions for the nutrient regulation ES potential. The focal objective of the study was of methodological nature: to test the application of a BBN as an integrative modelling approach combining the information from the ES matrix with additional data sets. In the process, both study areas were assessed with a regional differentiation with regard to the predominant landscape types. For both study areas, regional differences could be detected. Furthermore, the results indicate a spatial mismatch between ES demand and supply of the nutrient regulation potential. Land management and agricultural practices seem not to be in harmony with the spatial patterns of the environmental characteristics in the study areas. The assessment on the local scale, which comprised higher resolution input data, emphasized these circumstances even more clearly.

AB  - Odonata are valuable biological indicators of freshwater ecosystem integrity and climate change, and the northeastern USA (Virginia to Maine) is a hotspot of odonate diversity and a region of historical and growing threats to freshwater ecosystems. This duality highlights the urgency of developing a comprehensive conservation assessment of the region's 228 resident odonate species. We offer a prioritization framework modified from NatureServe's method for assessing conservation status ranks by assigning a single regional vulnerability metric (R-rank) reflecting each species' degree of relative extinction risk in the northeastern USA. We calculated the R-rank based on 3 rarity factors (range extent, area of occupancy, and habitat specificity), 1 threat factor (vulnerability of occupied habitats), and 1 trend factor (relative change in range size). We combine this R-rank with the degree of endemicity (% of the species' USA and Canadian range that falls within the region) as a proxy for regional responsibility, thereby deriving a list of species of combined vulnerability and regional management responsibility. Overall, 18% of the region's odonate fauna is imperiled (R1 and R2), and peatlands, low-gradient streams and seeps, high-gradient headwaters, and larger rivers that harbor a disproportionate number of these species should be considered as priority habitat types for conservation. We anticipate that our analysis might serve as a model for guiding and standardizing conservation assessments at multiple scales for Odonata and other diverse taxa that have not yet received attention to prioritization.

AB  - Biodiversity in developing countries is inextricably linked with development. Consequently, policies to conserve biodiversity must take into account national development objectives and vice versa. Policy makers in developing countries are forced to identify creative ways of conserving biodiversity while supporting development and eradicating poverty. Even more than elsewhere, and countries must focus on biodiversity valuation for both direct (e.g. biotrade, biotechnology and tourism) and indirect (e.g. ecosystem function, aesthetics and cultural values) uses. While inappropriate policies can undermine the conservation of biodiversity, good policies do not ensure that it takes place. Particularly in and regions, policy markers and managers must have diverse skills to address a wide variety of challenges. Adaptive management is essential for biodiversity conservation in and environments. It requires regular, informed problem-solving over a wide range of issues, and this, in turn, requires adequate and accessible databases concerning appropriate indicators of eilvironmental change.
   Major headaches for planners are the intrinsic variability of and environments, the long-term, changes that occur, and the often uncharismatic biota involved. Managers must be able to handle rapid and adaptive program planning and implementation, monitoring and evaluation, dissemination of information to authorities and the general public, and, often, training of junior and volunteer staff. Management education in support of the conservation of biodiversity in and environments must focus on problem-solving skills and information management to ensure the depth and breadth of the training.

AB  - Lichens and bryophytes have commonly been used as bioindicators of environmental conditions, especially in relation to air quality. However, their diagnostic role in the assessment of soil pollution is relatively poorly recognised. The aim of this study was to find a pattern of cryptogamic biota structure associated with zinc and lead soil pollution and to thereby identify common signal species useful for bioindication purposes. The study area encompassed various types of anthropogenic and semi-natural habitats directly associated with the processing of Zn-Pb ores in southem Poland. Detailed analysis of cryptogamic biota with respect to the chemical parameters of the corresgonding soil enabled us to identify three different pollution classes related to the concentration of heavy metals and four distinct groups of ecologically close species with similar responses to the prevailing level of pollution. The significant relationship between soil chemical parameters and cryptogamic biota structure implies the high bioindicative value of the defined lichen and bryophyte assemblages. Consequently, specific sets of distinct species reflecting levels of pollution were instrumental in the development of a practical tool. This approach may constitute a first step in soil quality assessment in a broad landscape scale. It provides an opportunity for preliminary verification of the sites that are potentially the most contaminated and which require further attention, for example, within the framework of restoration projects, reclamation interventions, or conservation strategies. The proposed bioindication approach involves common, widespread lichens and bryophytes, thus increasing the potential for its wide application in post-industrial areas associated with the mining and processing of Zn-Pb ores.

PWS is highly productive and diverse, with primary productivity strongly coupled to nutrient dynamics driven by variability in the climate and oceanography of the GOA and North Pacific Ocean. The pelagic and nearshore primary productivity supports a complex and diverse trophic structure, including large populations of forage and large fish that support many species of marine birds and mammals. High intra-annual, inter-annual, and interdecadal variability in climatic and oceanographic processes as drives high variability in the biological populations. A risk-based conceptual ecosystem model (CEM) is presented describing the natural processes, anthropogenic drivers, and resultant stressors that affect PWS, including stressors caused by the Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964 and the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989. A trophodynamic model incorporating PWS valued ecosystem components is integrated into the CEM. By representing therelative strengths of driver/stressors/effects, the CEM graphically demonstrates the fundamental dynamics of the PWS ecosystem, the natural forces that controlthe ecological condition of the Sound, and the relative contribution of natural processes and human activities to the health of the ecosystem. The CEM illustrates the dominance of natural processes in shaping the structure and functioning of the GOA and PWS ecosystems.

AB  - Nematodes represent a very abundant group of soil organisms and non-parasitic species are important for soil quality and in the soil food web. In recent years, it has been shown that nematodes are appropriate bioindicators of soil condition and they are also suitable organisms for laboratory toxicity testing. The aims of this paper are to overview and critically assess methods and approaches for researching soil nematode ecotoxicology. In natural ecosystems, nematode abundance and community structure analyses were proved to be sensitive indicators of stress caused by soil pollutants and ecological disturbance. Community structure analyses may be approached from a functional or ecological point of view; species are divided into groups according to their feeding habits or alternatively the maturity index is calculated according to their ecological strategy. Many environmental factors have the potential to affect nematode community, which consequently results in high space and time variability. This variance is major handicap in field ecotoxicological studies because pollutant-nematode relationships are obscured. For prospective risk assessment of chemicals, several toxicity tests with nematodes were developed and are increasingly used. Sensitivity of these tests is comparable to tests with other soil species (e.g. enchytraeids, earthworms and springtails) while tests are less demanding to space and time. Most studies have focused on metal toxicity but organic compounds are almost overlooked. Endpoints used in tests were often mortality, reproduction or movement, but more sublethal endpoints such as feeding or biomarkers have been used recently too. Although there is an increasing amount of knowledge in soil nematode ecotoxicology, there is still a lot of various issues in this topic to research. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human visitations to Antarctica have increased in recent decades, raising concerns about preserving the continent's environmental quality. To understand the spatial and temporal patterns of anthropogenic disturbances at the largest scientific station in Antarctica, McMurdo Station, a long-term monitoring program has been implemented. Results from the first nine years (1999-2007) of monitoring are reported. Most physical disturbance of land surfaces occurred prior to 1970 during initial establishment of the station. Hydrocarbons from fuel and anthropogenic metals occur in patches of tens to hundreds of square meters in areas of fuel usage and storage. Most soil contaminant concentrations are not expected to elicit biological responses. Past disposal practices have contaminated marine sediments with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), petroleum hydrocarbons, and metals in close proximity to the station that often exceed concentrations expected to elicit biological responses. Chemical contamination and organic enrichment reduced marine benthic ecological integrity within a few hundred meters offshore of the station. Contaminants were detected in marine benthic organisms confirming bioavailability and uptake. PCBs in sediments are similar to suspected source materials, indicating minimal microbial degradation decades after release. Anthropogenic disturbance of the marine environment is likely to persist for decades. A number of monitoring design elements, indicators and methodologies used in temperate climates were effective and provide guidance for monitoring programs elsewhere in Antarctica.

AB  - Growing levels of uncertainty and vulnerability generated by land use conversion and climate change set demands on local communities and national institutions to build synergies between the diverse array of knowledge systems in order to provide policy makers and practitioners with the best available information to decide what urgent actions must be taken. Science policy arenas and agreements such as the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) recognize the importance of different types of knowledge and the need for broad stakeholder involvement, yet the use of indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) in environmental decision-making processes is still underdeveloped. This study involved working with local stakeholders, using the MARISCO method (adaptive MAnagement of vulnerability and RISks at COnservation sites) to carry out a systematic situation analysis of the existing socioenvironmental conditions. The assessments were conducted in the Kavango East Region in northern Namibia with the participation of inhabitants of the Khaudum North Complex, a protected area network covering wooded savannahs belonging to the Northern Kalahari sandveld. General outcomes of the assessments and evaluations made by the local stakeholders concerning the most critical drivers of degradation of the ecosystems appeared to support existing scientific knowledge of the study area, demonstrating that community-based assessments can provide valuable information about socioecological systems where scientific data are scarce. The findings of this study also highlight the importance of power dynamics for the implementation of participatory processes and the interpretation of their outcomes.

AB  - Diatoms are used as indicators of freshwater ecosystems integrity. Developing diatom-based tools to assess impact of herbicide pollution is expected by water managers. But, defining sensitivities of all species to multiple herbicides would be unattainable. The existence of a phylogenetic signal of herbicide sensitivity was shown among diatoms and should enable prediction of new species sensitivity. However, diatoms present a cryptic diversity that may lead to variation in their sensitivity to herbicides that would need to be taken into account. Using bioassays, the sensitivity to four herbicides (Atrazine, Terbutryn, Diuron, Isoproturon) was evaluated for 11 freshwater diatom taxa and intraspecific variability was assessed for two of them (Nitzschia palea and Achnanthidium spp.). Intraspecific variability of herbicide sensitivity was always smaller than interspecific variability, but intraspecific variability was more important in N. palea than in Achnanthidium spp. Indeed, one species showed no intraspecific phylogenetic signal (N. palea) whereas the other did (Achnanthidium spp.). On one hand, species boundaries are not set properly for Achnanthidium spp. which encompass several taxa. On the other hand, there is a higher phenotypic plasticity for N. palea. Finally, a phylogenetic signal of herbicide sensitivity was measured at the interspecific level, opening up prospects for setting up reliable biomonitoring tools based on sensitivity prediction, insofar as species boundaries are correctly defined.

AB  - In this study, an interval-fuzzy regional ecosystem management (IF-REM) model is developed based on an interval fuzzy linear programming (IFLP) technique. The IF-REM model can handle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets and discrete intervals; it also incorporates ecosystem service valuation directly into the optimization process, such that an effective linkage between economic values and ecosystem services can be provided. The IF-REM model is applied to a real case of planning regional ecosystem development in New Binhai District of Tianjin, where the natural ecosystem has suffered the severe degradation induced by large-scale land reclamation projects along the coastal line. Results of land use patterns, industrial pollution-mitigation schemes, and cost-benefit analysis can be obtained. The results suggest that large scale reclamation projects can bring a series of negative effects to the coastal ecosystem, such as endangering animals and plants, changing intrinsic gas regulation, as well as altering natural nutrient cycling; moreover, the current cost for land reclamation is too low to reflect the ecosystem losses and unable to curb excessive reclamation projects, which implies that ecosystem service valuation is of great significance. These findings can facilitate the local decision makers in not only considering regional ecosystem integrity but also gaining insights into the tradeoff between socio-economic development and eco-environmental sustainability.

AB  - Ecological restoration centers on the reestablishment of ecological processes and the integrity of degraded ecosystems, but its success also depends on public acceptance and support. In this study, we evaluated the short-term ecological effects of different restoration treatments in Iceland. Furthermore, we tested the public perception of aesthetic and recreational values of these revegetated areas. Predefined soil and vegetation indicators were measured, and a survey, based on a questionnaire and photographs of the different areas, was used for gauging public perception. Our results indicate that different restoration treatments triggered different succession trajectories. The vegetation composition of areas seeded with grasses seemed to be on a trajectory toward relatively undisturbed reference ecosystems, whereas areas seeded with nonnative lupine seemed to be developing a novel ecosystem. Results of the survey demonstrated that people valued the appearance of revegetated areas higher than that of the eroded control areas, with the exception of areas seeded with lupine. The visual perception of each restoration treatment corresponded well with the ecological factors and revealed both a social and an ecological rationale against the use of lupine in land restoration. The results indicate that the design of restoration projects should be based on both an analysis of sociocultural priorities and an understanding of possible trajectories of ecosystem development associated with the available restoration methods to avoid results that are neither socially acceptable nor ecologically feasible.

AB  - Wetlands are fascinating and dynamic ecosystems that provide indispensable ecosystem services. They have changed dramatically over the past few centuries, largely through human settlement and associated activities. Fortunately, recent years have seen increasing acknowledgement of the range of benefits that wetlands have the potential to provide. With this recognition has come an acceptance of the role of healthy wetlands in underpinning human well-being.
   Usually, a wetlands rehabilitation program is structured around the principal directions based on monitoring the following specific indicators: water quality, waste management and waste water, pollution sources, habitat and biological communities. All rehabilitation interventions are undertaken within the context of improving the integrity and functioning of the ecosystem, and include measures that address both causes and effects of degradation.
   Rehabilitation can be sustainable if people understand and take ownership of completed rehabilitation work. The creation and arrangement of wetland space to offer new possibilities for leisure and even for conduct of educational activities will determine a clear challenge with respect to the link between sustainable development and wetland conservation.
   The paper presents a vision for sustainable wetland development to enhance the role of education in wetland protection, with the aim of improving the community service functions while conserving good ecological status. A proposed complex of eco-buildings is presented as an integrated solution for future development of a wetland area. The study site is Ciobarciu wetland area in Prut river catchment.

AB  - Economic development has increased pressures on natural resources during the last decades. The concept of planetary boundaries has been developed to propose limits on human activities based on earth processes and ecological thresholds. However, this concept was not developed to downscale planetary boundaries to sub-global level. The absence of boundaries at sub-global levels constrains the use of the concept in environmental governance and natural resource management, because decisions are typically taken at these levels. Decisions at the national level are currently supported, among others, by statistical frameworks in particular the System of National Accounts. However, statistical frameworks were not developed to compile environmental information, hindering environmental decision making. Our study examines if and how ecosystem accounting can be used in combination with the concept of planetary boundaries in guiding human activities at the level of a river basin. We assess the applicability of both frameworks for natural resource management in the Orinoco river basin, based on adaptive management components. Our analysis indicates that differences in the purpose of analysis, information provided, and methods constrain the potential integration of both frameworks. Nevertheless, the way both frameworks conceptualize the social system and the interactions between social and ecological systems can facilitate translating planetary boundaries into indicators considered in ecosystem accounting. The information recorded in national ecosystem accounts can support establishing ecological thresholds and, more fundamentally, to relate ecological thresholds to human impacts on ecosystem condition. Capitalizing on these synergies requires further exchange of experiences between the communities working on ecosystem accounting and planetary boundaries.

AB  - Many factors influence metal speciation in freshwaters. Metal species that are more soluble are considered more bioavailable and toxic. However, evaluation of metal speciation in waters is a complex task. Moreover, the quantification of total and dissolved metals is not sufficient to determine toxic effects on the biota. Here, we review environmental parameters that influence metal bioavailability: mathematical models to predict toxicity, and the biological tools used to evaluate contamination in freshwaters ecosystems. The major points are the following: (1) we discuss many "exceptions" of chemical parameters that are deemed to increase metal bioavailability or to protect against metal uptake, such as pH and water hardness. We provide evidence of organisms and environmental conditions that break these rules and therefore should be considered when predicting impairment by metals. (2) We discuss the advances in mathematical modelling as a proxy to metal toxicity. (3) We discuss advantages and limitations of using multiple biological tools to assess toxicity, such as the use of biomarkers and microorganisms, zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish communities. Biomarkers are efficient in detecting low concentrations of metals in a short-term exposition. Changes on biological community structure and composition are good tools to detect high metal concentration or chronic concentration in a long-term exposition. The use of multiple tools including chemical analyses and a set of biological indicators is recommended for a more accurate evaluation of metal impacts on freshwater systems.

AB  - Ciliated protozoa play important roles in micro-ecosystems, especially in marine biotopes. However, few studies have been carried out on the periphytic, or aufwuch, forms in mariculture waters so far. In this study, we sampled periphytic ciliate communities in two closed mariculture ponds (ponds CP1 and CP2) and a natural seawater reservoir (pond RP) using a glass slide method to evaluate their colonizing processes and general ecological features, as well as their application as water quality indicators. We analyzed species compositions, structural parameters (species number, richness, diversity, evenness, abundance and d (BP)) and functional parameters (G, S (eq) and T (90%)). Pond RP was characterized by higher levels of structural parameters (except for abundance and d (BP)) and more equal proportion of the major taxonomic groups. The values of S (eq) were significantly higher in pond RP and similar in both pond CP1 and CP2. It was also demonstrated that environmental factors, including NO2-H, NO3-H, NH3-H, soluble reactive phosphate, temperature and pH, were the first principal factors affecting the communities. Among them, temperature and chemical factors were all significantly and negatively correlated with species number (P < 0.01), richness (P < 0.01), diversity (P < 0.01), and positive correlated with abundance (P < 0.01). Opposite correlations between pH and structural parameters were observed. This study showed that there were significant differences in species composition, structural parameters and functional parameters of the periphytic ciliate communities among the ponds, which were in agreement with the water quality. Results of this study confirmed the periphytic ciliate communities to be useful bioindicators of water quality in intensive mariculture waters.

AB  - We examined the radiocarbon age, taphonomic condition and stratigraphic position of shells of the venerid bivalve Chione spp. from the tidal flats of Bahia la Choya, Sonora, Mexico. Shells in Bahia la Choya are time-averaged. Thirty shells yielded radiocarbon dates from modern (A.D. 1950 or younger) to 3569 years before present. The median calendar age of inner flat shells is 483 years; the median age of tidal channel shells is 427 years. We interpret such long shell survival to be the result of frequent shallow burial. Such burial retards bioerosion of shells.
   The taphonomic condition of shells varied with environment. Shells from the surface of the inner flats were better preserved than shells from the tidal channel. Shells are more likely to be physically worn and biologically degraded in the waters of the channel than on the quieter and more frequently exposed inner tidal flat. Taphonomic condition is an unreliable indicator of a shell's time-since-death. Poorly-preserved shells on the inner flats tended to be old, but in general shell condition was much more variable than shell age. A shell's condition is more likely the result of its total residence time on the surface than its time-since-death (surface time plus burial time).
   Two composite short (44 cm and 50 cm) cores revealed varying degrees of stratigraphic disorder (the departure from perfect correlation between relative stratigraphic position and relative age). One of eight shells in the inner flats core was disordered; four of nine shells in the tidal channel were disordered. The actual age range of surface shells approximates the age range of shells in cores. Stratigraphic disorder is a consequence of both time-averaging and physical and biogenic mixing.
   Time-averaging controls the degree of precision possible in paleoecological studies. Environmental changes and ecological phenomena occurring within a span of 3500 years would not be recognized in deposits like those of Bahia la Choya. Time-averaging and stratigraphic disorder also constrain the temporal resolution possible in microstratigraphic studies of evolution. The extent of time-averaging and stratigraphic disorder will dictate an appropriate sample interval. In order to prevent temporal overlap between successive samples in deposits like Bahia la Choya, sample spacing should not be less than approximately 0.5 m.

AB  - Because oxygen deficient conditions enhance the preservation of depositional organic matter, analysis on paleooxygenation conditions of depositional environments becomes a routine work in evaluations of potential hydrocarbon source rocks. The article focuses on depositional and ecological features relating to oxygen deficient shelfal environments at the Shangsi Section, as a part of multidiscipline collaboration to reevaluate the hydrocarbon potential of the Middle and Upper Permian, Guangyuan Northeast Sichuan Province. Ichnofabric Zoophycos, sepiolite-bearing limestones (SBL) were interpreted as indicators of dysaerobic environments. Laminated calcareous and/or siliceous mudstones with pelagic ammonites and radiolarians were believed to be the deposits of anaerobic environments. When rhythmic succession was considered, average strategy was adopted for the oxygenation explanation of a given interval. The anaerobic condition in this Permian section was observed in the upper part of the latest Permian Dalong Formation, in which siliceous mudstones with ammonite, radiolarians develop in association with lower U/Mo ratio, lower biomarker ratio of Pr/Ph, and the highest TOC content. The topmost Maokou Formation, featured by thin-bedded calcareous and siliceous mudstones with ammonite, thin-shelled bivalves, and laminations would be deposits of the quasianaerobic condition. The middle part of the Members I and III of the Chihsia Formation is proposed to be dysaerobic condition as indicated by occurrences of SBL and ichnofabric features, with the Member III being the severe dysaerobic condition.

AB  - Complex chemical cycling of mercury in aquatic ecosystems means that tracing the linkage between anthropogenic and natural loadings of mercury to watersheds and water bodies and associated concentrations in the environment are difficult to establish without the assistance of numerical models that describe biogeochemical controls on mercury distribution and availability to organisms. This paper presents an overview of a process-based, steady-state model developed for state and water quality managers and scientists to assist in ecological risk assessments for mercury in aquatic environments. SERAFM (Spreadsheet-based Ecological Risk Assessment for the Fate of Mercury) incorporates the chemical, physical, and biological processes governing mercury transport and fate in a surface water including atmospheric deposition, watershed transport and transformation, solid transport and cycling within the water body, and water body mercury processes. This modelling framework was designed to assist risk assessors in evaluating wildlife risk at the screening-level for an aquatic ecosystem with mercury-contaminated sediments. An example application of the model that is used to inform a regional risk assessment is presented in this manuscript. In the example provided, hazard quotients for exposed wildlife and humans are calculated by the model for three scenarios: historical case of mercury-contaminated sediments, required clean-up levels to protect the most sensitive species, and background conditions. The spreadsheet structure of SERAFM permits dismantling and reassembling of specific sub-modules, while maintaining transparency to permit flexibility in use and application.

AB  - The complexity of ecosystem-based management (EBM) of natural resources has given rise to research frameworks such as integrated ecosystem assessments (IEA) that pull together large amounts of diverse information from physical, ecological, and social domains. Conceptual models are valuable tools for assimilating and simplifying this information to convey our understanding of ecosystem structure and functioning. Qualitative network models (QNMs) may allow us to conduct dynamic simulations of conceptual models to explore natural-social relationships, compare management strategies, and identify tradeoffs. We used previously developed QNM methods to perform simulations based on conceptual models of the California Current ecosystem's pelagic communities and related human activities and values. Assumptions about community structure and trophic interactions influenced the outcomes of the QNMs. In simulations where we applied unfavorable environmental conditions for production of salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), intensive management actions only modestly mitigated declines experienced by salmon, but strongly constrained human activities. Moreover, the management actions had little effect on a human wellbeing attribute, sense of place. Sense of place was most strongly affected by a relatively small subset of all possible pair-wise interactions, although the relative influence of individual pair-wise interactions on sense of place grew more uniform as management actions were added, making it more difficult to trace effective management actions via specific mechanistic pathways. Future work will explore the importance of changing conceptual models and QNMs to represent management questions at finer spatial and temporal scales, and also examine finer representation of key ecological and social components.

AB  - Biological quality in a bay affected by man's activities was evaluated by means of the composition of assemblages of sponges and ascidians. Our results showed that the structure of these two groups of filter-feeders aided in discriminating between undisturbed and disturbed areas, establishing different "environmental health categories" from moderately to strongly disturbed areas, and in ascertaining the extension of the area of each "health category". We were able to divide the bay into four zones based on type of disturbance or anthropogenic source: (1) stations free of any source of disturbance, (2) stations under moderate disturbance, located close to industrial ports, millworks, etc., (3) stations that are under the direct influence of industrial wastes such as a power station and oil refinery, and (4) stations near strongly disturbed areas, influenced directly by harmful steelworks activities. We differentiated clearly between four large species assemblages. and related the composition of these assemblages to different kinds of disturbances, Thus, these species could be used to manage the marine environment in this bay by comparing the observed fauna, with expected fauna in an unstressed site. Moreover, the joint presence of the sponge Cliona vastifica and tunicate Policitor adriaticum seems always to indicate a more or less pristine environmental situation, functioning as bioindicators of normal conditions. We think that the use of specific bioindicators for monitoring disturbance is a valid tool to establish baselines to predict impacts associated with industrial development in many marine ecosystems. The advantages to monitoring communities on hard rocks versus sandy or muddy bottoms are also commented upon. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A survey of 60 high mountain lakes of Colombia's Eastern Range was performed to evaluate the response of surface-sediment diatoms to environmental variables. In each one of these lakes, water samples were taken for physical and chemical characterization, and diatoms were collected from the superficial bottom sediment at the deepest part. Multivariate statistical analyses were made to determine the relationships between environmental and biological data, specifically which environmental variables explain the diatom distribution. For each of these significant environmental variables, optima and ecological tolerances were calculated using the weighted-average method, which allowed for the classification of the species according to their environmental preferences. The lakes showed a wide range of environmental gradients in variables such as pH, alkalinity, and nutrients. In addition, the depth of the lakes was a direct determinant of the light environment of the water column. A total of 339 diatom taxa were identified belonging mainly to the genera Eunotia and Pinnularia. Variables related to pH-alkalinity gradient, trophic condition (nitrates and phosphorus), and physical factors (radiation at the bottom) had a significant effect on diatom composition. Despite the fact that the total organic carbon environmental range was high, the effect of this variable on diatom species composition was not significant. In conclusion, the diatoms of the studied lakes showed a significant ecological relationship with environmental variables which are potentially important in environmental reconstruction. Diatoms in the study sites can provide useful and independent quantitative information to investigate the recent impacts of global change on tropical high mountain ecosystems.

AB  - Freshwater inflow management (quality and quantity) is critical for both environmental and human demands. Inflows needed to maintain ecosystem functionality can be assessed by observing how organisms sensitive to environmental change (bioindicators) respond to varying flow conditions. In Galveston Bay (Texas, U.S.A.), Rangia cuneata clams were proposed as bioindicators of ecological response to freshwater inflows. Rangia cuneata abundance has decreased and their distribution has retracted proximal to freshwater sources from 1983 to 2010. From 2010 to 2014, the highest mean shell lengths (Trinity River delta, 48.0 +/- 0.4 mm) and meat indexes (Clear Lake, 13.3% +/- 0.3%) of R. cuneata were observed in areas most influenced by freshwater inputs. In the Trinity River delta, clam biomass and density averaged 3.4 (+/- 0.3) kg m (3) and 25.6 (+/- 3.5) clams m (2), respectively. A general decreasing trend was observed in biomass and density between like seasons after the drought of 2011, which persisted throughout most of 2014. Sex ratios (62.8% +/- 2.4% male) and juvenile abundance (highest in winters and summers after spawning) were consistent with life-history observations. Life-cycle observations were not available before 2010 and are important to consider in future studies. Without them, long-term decadal declines in R. cuneata clams are difficult to explain when limited to terms of natural and anthropogenic stressors. Rangia cuneata's utility as bioindicators of the ecological functionality of an estuary affected by changing freshwater inflows requires further investigation for resource management.

AB  - The valuation of nature is an inbuilt component of validating environmental management decisions and an important research field for different disciplines related to conservation, economy and ethics. Here, biodiversity was valued using an ecological approach based on the intrinsic value incorporated in biodiversity per se, regardless of any human association. The Marine Biological Valuation protocol was drawn upon the methodology of terrestrial valuation maps, to support the European MSFD environmental status assessment (descriptor 1 - biodiversity) and national marine spatial planning approaches. To apply the protocol on the Portuguese continental shelf we compiled and analyzed national biological databases for a wide taxonomic range of ecosystem components (seabirds, demersal fish, macrobenthos, marine mammals and sea turtles) and assessed the spatial overlap with existing and proposed conservation areas (Natura 2000 network). The resultant maps described patterns of biological value consistent with the physical and biological oceanographic conditions as well as local hydrodynamics of the Portuguese continental shelf. The results of our approach confirm previously identified valuable areas for protection (particularly in the northern and central regions), but also highlights the value of currently unprotected sites, mainly in the southern region. Biological valuation maps showed to be comprehensive tool to compile and spatially analyze biological datasets. By drawing attention to subzones of biological importance, it constitutes a valuable instrument in making appropriate-scale decisions on the spatial allocation of human activities in the context of the Portuguese marine spatial planning, currently facing the pressure and impacts of increased maritime exploitation.

AB  - Earthworms are important soil metabionts indicative of N enrichment in pastures. A rotational pasture in central Nova Scotia was tested for earthworms using chemical extraction followed by excavation and hand sorting in 28 paired micro plots placed in areas with low versus high proportion of the N indicator plant species dandelion (Taraxacum officinale). Species richness was low with five earthworm species of the Lumbricidae recovered in the following order of abundance: Lumbricus rubellus, Lumbricus terrestris, Aporrectodea turgida. Aporrectodea tuberculata, and Aporrectodea trapezoides. All species occurred at high constancy except the rare A. trapezoides. The inventory revealed spatial differentiation of earthworm abundance and community structure at the field level. High proportion of dandelion reduced pasture sward biomass while abundance of L. rubellus and A. tuberculata significantly (p < 0.05) increased with a concomitant increase in epigeic earthworm dominance at the expense of the anecic L terrestris. Thus, low cost and non-destructive floristic surveys of N indicators, such as dandelion, allow for concordant inferences about the environmental impact of intensive cow pasture on earthworms and ecosystem function. High earthworm counts may run contrary to the notion of ecological integrity depending on specific earthworm abundances. Reduced earthworm benefits due to any de-intensification of rotational pasture must be assessed against increased risks of N-leaching in intensive pastures with high proportion of dandelion.

AB  - Environmental flows are used to support the structure and function of floodplain, wetland and riverine ecosystems that are subject to stress from drought, climate change or water resource development. The financial costs of environmental flows are considerable and it is therefore highly desirable that the ecological benefits are monitored. Productivity of floodplain vegetation is a critical ecological response to flooding, and represents an indicator of ecosystem 'health'. being linked to structural integrity, habitat provision, nutrient cycling and numerous other ecosystem functions. Productivity of floodplain plant communities is hard to measure, being highly variable over time depending on seasonal and climatic factors and the frequency, magnitude and duration of flood events. We compared an index of plant growth - the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from MODIS satellite imagery - in the Paroo River Wetlands ecosystem, Australia, to NDVI in a nearby terrestrial area to quantify the magnitude and duration of floodplain vegetation responses to flooding alone. This analysis shows that a flood which inundated more than 50% of the Paroo River Wetlands in 2008 increased NDVI by up to 19% above non-flood levels and for a period of 13 months following flood recession. This approach has applications in planning environmental flows and in monitoring the ecological responses. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - System thinking and integrated research are widely applied approaches in environmental management, often facilitating the organization of information from different levels and sources. They are here applied to support the review of (1) political and management instruments and (2) elements that characterize the Bahia de Cadiz Nature Park (Spain). The latter objective is sustained by the DPSIR (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) framework. A first DPSI conceptual map offers a broader view of the park capturing a range of elements that act at global, national and regional levels. Next, through expert consultation, prioritized DPSI issues describing the current situation of Bahia de Cadiz Nature Park are highlighted. A second DPSI map is designed to explore specific land-use and land-cover changes and their effects on the park's ecological integrity, offering a greater level of detail. 'Responses' are discussed separately, through a review of most recent response actions that have originated at various levels, and future ones proposed by the park's management. The framework proves to be appropriate to identify elements from both social and environmental dimensions, but excludes global-scale elements that do not fit the scope of this analysis. The review hopes to support future integrated research initiatives, involving in-depth analysis though the use of tools as are indicators or models.

AB  - Understanding the causes and consequences of dispersal is a prerequisite for the effective management of natural populations. Rather than treating dispersal as a fixed trait, it should be considered a plastic process that responds to both genetic and environmental conditions. Here, we consider how the ambient temperature experienced by juvenile Erigone atra, a spider inhabiting crop habitat, influences adult dispersal. This species exhibits 2 distinct forms of dispersal, ballooning (long distance) and rappelling (short distance). Using a half-sib design we raised individuals under 4 different temperature regimes and quantified the spiders' propensity to balloon and to rappel. Additionally, as an indicator of investment in settlement, we determined the size of the webs build by the spiders following dispersal. The optimal temperature regimes for reproduction and overall dispersal investment were 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Propensity to perform short-distance movements was lowest at 15 degrees C, whereas for long-distance dispersal it was lowest at 30 degrees C. Plasticity in dispersal was in the direction predicted on the basis of the risks associated with seasonal changes in habitat availability; long-distance ballooning occurred more frequently under cooler, spring-like conditions and short-distance rappelling under warmer, summer-like conditions. Based on these findings, we conclude that thermal conditions during development provide juvenile spiders with information about the environmental conditions they are likely to encounter as adults and that this information influences the spider's dispersal strategy. Climate change may result in suboptimal adult dispersal behavior, with potentially deleterious population level consequences.

AB  - Land is a physical system formed by the interaction of near-surface climate, geomorphology, surface geology, hydrology, soil, flora and fauna, and the results of past and present human activities. Land resource is the land which can be used for human beings in a certain technical condition and a certain period of time. In the past, the recognition of land resources put too much emphasis on the direct use of land by human, which can easily lead to the neglect of the ecological connotation of land resources. Although the systematic characteristic of land has been widely accepted, a systematic view in the practice of land planning and management is often lacked, and results in unsustainable land resource utilization. Therefore, it is necessary to deepen the systematic theories and methodologies for further understanding land resources.
   Coupling pattern and process is the basic point of understanding land resource. Pattern refers to the size, shape, quantity, type and spatial composition of land; and the process includes the natural and social processes occurring in the land system. The land pattern affects the ecological and anthropogenic processes, and these processes also influence the land pattern, thus producing various spatiotemporal effects in the land system. The change of land pattern and process is the leading factor that affects ecosystem services. A clear understanding on the cascade of "pattern-process-service" would help to deeply understand the systematic relationship between the natural conditions and human needs in the spatiotemporal evolution of land resources. It will provide new important theoretical guidance for the systematic study of land resource.
   The methods of natural capital assessment and space planning are the new embodiment of the systematic land resource management. Deconstructing the natural capital stock and ecosystem service flow in the land system, as well as transforming the physical quantity of ecosystem service to ecosystem service value, can provide key methodological support for managing the land resource assets. Based on quantifying the size, pattern and quality of the production, living and ecological spaces, as well as identifying the interactions relationships and overlapping areas, the multifunctional landscape could be located and the ecological security pattern could be constructed, which can provide new methodological support for spatial planning. It has become an important requirement to seek an analytical approach for the relationship between supply and demand of ecosystem services, and reduce the uncertainty of the valuation on ecosystem services. Moreover, it has been a methodological difficulty to spatially trade-off and optimize the coordination of the land use purposes among production, living and ecological space.
   In conclusion, systematically understanding land resource is not only a theoretical need for comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the complex human-land system knowledge, but also a practical demand for China's ecological civilization strategy. Starting from the coupling of pattern and process, strengthening multi-scale space observation and model simulation, and effectively identifying the "pattern-process-service" cascade relationship, can provide more comprehensive theoretical knowledge for systematically understanding land resource. Relying on the concepts of ecosystem service supply and demand, ecological assets, multifunctional landscape, and ecological security pattern, etc., to improve the "resource-capital-asset" knowledge of land system, and effectively identify "production-living-ecological space", can provide more powerful methods for systematically understanding land resource. Facing the great strategic demand of China's ecological civilization construction, by tackling the theoretical and methodological key problems of land resources research, the scientific results can be more effectively serve the governmental decision-making, and support the sustainable development of national society, economy, resources and environment.

AB  - A multimetric index was developed using benthic macroinvertebrates to assess the ecological health of selected rivers and streams in the north-eastern part of Lake Tana subbasin, Ethiopia. One-time extensive sampling was carried out during the post-rainy season (November-December) of 2016. Macroinvertebrates were collected using a Surber sampler and a D-frame net at twenty sites. Based on the measured physico-chemical variables, sampling sites were clustered into references (n = 8) and test sites (n = 4). Approximately thirty potential candidate metrics were tested, and five metrics were selected as core metrics: number of Ephemeroptera Plecoptera Trichoptera taxa, percentage of Ephemeroptera individuals, percentage of EPT individuals, percentage that were shredders, and the percentage that were filter-feeders. These metrics were scored on a continuous scale from 0 to 10. To develop Lake Tana subbasin multimetric index (LTSBMI), scores were added and scaled to produce a score from 0 to 100. The final index was divided into five water quality classes: 'very good', 'good', 'fair', 'poor' and 'very poor'. The LTSBMI was effective in discriminating sites with different levels of impacts, but should be checked to other localities. The current LTSBMI could be used for ecosystem health assessment and monitoring in different Aftropical river systems with similar agroecology.

Accurately assessing the effects of multiple human-caused stressors on freshwater (and other) ecosystems is an essential step in the development of efficient decision support tools for environmental managers. Our objective is to review potentials and limitations of the use of biological traits as indicators (BTIs) of multiple stressor effects on running water (i.e. lotic) ecosystems.
   2. Pioneers in ecology provided mechanistic explanations for responses of alternative biological traits to a given stressor and for the action of habitat harshness as a trait filter. These ideas were subsequently integrated in theoretical ecological constructs (e.g. Habitat Templet Concept) that form the basis of the BTI approach.
   3. To resolve the effects of multiple stressors on running waters requires multiple traits of a biologically diverse group of organisms such as lotic invertebrates. To meet this goal, however, recently created databases on the biological traits of lotic invertebrates must be expanded and unified.
   4. Addressing the technical implementation of the BTI approach, we illustrate that anticipated problems with phylogenetic trait syndromes are seemingly less serious in reality and that presence-absence data of genera and few sample replicates are sufficient for accurate trait descriptions of invertebrate communities.
   5. Current trends in politics demand that biomonitoring tools be effective at large scales, i.e. large-scale trait patterns of natural communities (i.e. at reference conditions) should be relatively stable. The trait composition of natural invertebrate communities is relatively stable at the scale of Europe and North America because trait filters of natural lotic habitats act similarly across large biogeographical units.
   6. The mechanistic actions of stressors on the biological traits of invertebrates should facilitate a priori predictions, but the complexity of potential trait responses makes such predictions sometimes difficult.
   7. To illustrate potentials and limitations of BTIs to identify a given stressor acting exclusively (or primarily), we examine the (i) use of functional feeding groups to indicate the action of various stressors and (ii) trait responses to an indirectly acting stressor (discharge variation) and to a more directly acting stressor (near-bottom flow). If the excessive use of specific traits for the indication of too many different stressors is avoided and a given stressor acts directly on traits as a priori predicted, reliable interpretations of trait responses can be achieved.
   8. To illustrate how BTIs can identify individual stressors acting in combination, we examine three cases of multiple stressors: (i) heavy metal pollution in combination with cargo-ship traffic; (ii) eutrophication and fine sediment deposits associated with land use; and (iii) various stressors associated with climate change in combination with salinity. If the number of the assessed traits is sufficiently great and the action of each individual among the multiple stressors is not too weak, multiple traits can potentially resolve the effects of multiple stressors.
   9. Thematic implications: if the expansion and unification of existing trait databases can be achieved, the rapidly growing knowledge about biological trait responses of lotic invertebrates to individual and multiple stressors should enable the identification of management priorities focused on: (i) individually acting stressors (manage stressor A at site X prior to stressor B at site Y); (ii) multiple stressors acting in different combinations at different sites (manage stressors A & B at site X prior to stressors C & D at site Y); and (iii) individual stressors acting in combination (manage stressor A prior to stressor B at site X). Thus, the BTI approach has the potential to inaugurate a new era in the biomonitoring of lotic (and other) ecosystems.

AB  - Cephalopods are sensitive to environmental conditions due to their fast growth rates and short life cycles, being thus considered good ecological indicators. Here, we analyzed western Mediterranean cephalopod paralarvae communities during two consecutive summers (2004 and 2005) characterized by contrasting oceanographic conditions. Our main aim was to determine to what extent such contrasting scenarios affected the spatial distribution of the cephalopod early life stages and decipher the main environmental factors affecting each particular taxon. The contrasting oceanographic conditions during 2004 and 2005 included differences in the shape and location of a regional frontal system, which brought about differences in the sea circulation and the temperature regime. Such contrasting scenarios were reflected in the spatial distribution and the frequencies of appearance of both the whole community and the individual taxa. There was not any major factor affecting most taxa equally, which points to differences in species sensitivity to external conditions. Moreover, our results evidenced that paralarvae populations were more influenced by regional sea salinity and temperature than by mesoscale hydrographic features. Our study reveals that moderate changes in sea temperature have a major effect on the presence of paralarvae populations, which has profound implications in the context of the current global warming.

AB  - The present paper provides practical advice on high elevation afforestation of Scots pine under the adverse environmental conditions of the low-subalpine elevational zone in the mountains of northern Anatolia. Research was focused in particular on the effects of microsite conditions on the growth of seedlings and on appropriate planting techniques for use in mountainous regions.
   The effects of microsite conditions on the growth, percentage of survival and vitality of ten-year old seedlings were studied. The duration of the snow cover, particularly in the spring, has important effects on seedling growth on northeastern slopes in low subalpine elevational zones.
   Favorable microsite conditions for seedling growth are: 1. areas where snow melts early/warm sites; 2. areas of low snow pressure and movement; 3. areas with little weed cover; 4. ridges and upper sections of slopes at slightly elevated sites and 5. smooth slopes, i.e. those devoid of microtopographical variations. Unfavorable microsites are as follows. 1. Areas where snow persists for long periods/cold sites; 2. areas subject to snow pressure and snow movement; 3. areas with dense weed cover; 4. flat sites/permanently wet, poorly aerated, cold and compact soils; 5. hollows and 6. secondary stream beds.
   Microsite conditions were found to be much more effective on northeastern than on southeastern slopes. Because of this, microsites can be identified, in part at least, from maps showing the length of snow cover. Significant benefits also result from the use of indicator plants and from long-term observations of the environmental conditions of the terrain.

AB  - The goal of structural health monitoring is to infer structural health status using available measurement. It is well accepted that structural modal frequency can be utilized as an indicator revealing health status of a monitored structure, but this indicator exhibits substantial seasonal variation due to changing environmental conditions (such as temperature and humidity). There are three critical issues in modal frequency-environmental condition relation development: 1) a significant level of uncertainty in both structural dynamical responses and environmental factors; 2) huge number of possible components of input features of environmental factors; 3) capability of multivariate prediction on modal frequencies of several modes. This paper develops an updated version of the Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL), enhancing the efficiency in the hyperparameter optimization process, with capabilities in uncertainty quantification, sparse feature selection and multivariate prediction. The approach is utilized for modal frequency-environmental condition relation development of a reinforced concrete building based on one-year measurement. It turns out that the optimal multivariate sparse model can depict the pattern between the modal frequencies of the first three modes and the environmental conditions with high fitting capacity and low error sensitivity.

AB  - We surveyed 15 bodies of water among remnants of the Atlantic Forest biome in southern Brazil for adult dragonflies and damselflies to test whether an empirical selection method for diversity indicators could be applied in a subtropical ecosystem, where limited ecological knowledge on species level is available. We found a regional species pool of 34 species distributed in a nested subset pattern with a mean of 11.2 species per locality. There was a pronounced difference in species composition between spring, summer, and autumn, but no differences in species numbers between seasons. Two species, Homeoura chelifera (Selys) and Ischnura capreolus (Hagen), were the strongest candidates for regional diversity indicators, being found only at species-rich localities in our surveyed area and likewise in an undisturbed national forest reserve, serving as a reference site for the Atlantic Forest. Using our selection method, we found it possible to obtain a tentative list of diversity indicators without having detailed ecological information of each species, providing a reference site is available for comparison. The method thus allows for indicator species to be selected in blanco from taxonomic groups that are little known. We hence argue that Odonata can already be incorporated in ongoing assessment programs in the Neotropics, which would also increase the ecological knowledge of the group and allow extrapolation to other taxa.

AB  - The loss of a landscape nature has been contributing to change limnological variables values of inland water bodies as well as the integrity of ecosystems in watersheds. The conduct of limnological analyzes allied to land use and coverage provide useful information for environmental planning and decision-making on watershed management. In light of the above, the study aimed to conduct a limnological survey, check the main land uses and the degree of hemerobics on the Santa Maria do Leme watershed, in the State of Sao Paulo. To this end, we conducted six sample campaigns for measuring limnological variables in 2020 and it has identified the main land uses and land cover with the framing of classes found in different degrees of hemerobia, reflecting thus the naturalness of the landscape. Seasonality and runoff influence on the limnological variables was verified due to the formation of different groups in the Principal Component Analysis scatterplot. Urbanized areas (30.47%) and temporary farming (25.16%) predominate in the micro-basin, areas with native vegetation correspond to 15.41% of the territory and concentrate on areas of permanent preservation. The landscape is marked by a high degree of artificiality (84,34%) and anthropogenic interference, a situation noted by the degrees of hemerobia (mesohemerobiotic, eumerobiotic, polyhemerobiotic and metahemerobiotic areas). Despite having high anthropogenic dependence, the existing natural elements are of great importance for maintaining water bodies and environmental features.

AB  - Biological elements, such as benthic macroinvertebrates and fish, have been used in assessing the ecological quality of rivers according to the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. However, the concurrent use of multiple organism groups provides a broader perspective for such evaluations, since each biological element may respond differently to certain environmental variables. In the present study, we assessed the ecological quality of a Greek river (RM4 type), during autumn 2003 and spring 2004 at 10 sites, with benthic macroinvertebrates and fish. Hydromorphological and physicochemical parameters, habitat structure, and riparian vegetation were also considered. Pollution sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa were more abundant at headwaters, which had good/excellent water quality according to the Hellenic Evaluation System (HES). The main river reaches possessed moderate water quality, while downstream sites were mainly characterised as having bad or poor water quality, dominated by pollution-tolerant macroinvertebrate taxa. Macroinvertebrates related strongly to local stressors as chemical degradation (ordination analysis CCA) and riparian quality impairment (bivariate analysis) while fish did not. Fish were absent from the severely impacted lower river reaches. Furthermore, external pathological signs were observed in fish caught at certain sites. A combined use of both macroinvertebrates and fish in biomonitoring programs is proposed for providing a safer assessment of local and regional habitat impairment.

AB  - The lysosomal-autophagic system appears to be a common target for many environmental pollutants as lysosomes accumulate many toxic metals and organic xenobiotics, which perturb normal function and damage the lysosomal membrane. In fact, lysosomal membrane integrity or stability appears to be an effective generic indicator of cellular well-being in eukaryotes: in bivalve molluscs and fish, stability is correlated with many toxicological responses and pathological reactions. Prognostic use of adverse lysosomal and autophagic reactions to environmental pollutants has been explored in relation to predicting cellular dysfunction and health in marine mussels, which are extensively used as sensitive bioindicators in monitoring ecosystem health. Derivation of explanatory frameworks for prediction of pollutant impact on health is a major goal; and we have developed a conceptual mechanistic model linking lysosomal damage and autophagic dysfunction with injury to cells and tissues. This model has also complemented the creation of a cell-based computational model for molluscan hepatopancreatic cells that simulates lysosomal, autophagic and other cellular reactions to pollutants. Experimental and simulated results have also indicated that nutritional deprivation-induced autophagy has a protective function against toxic effects mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, coupled measurement of lysosomal-autophagic reactions and modelling is proposed as a practical toolbox for predicting toxic environmental risk.

AB  - Hydrological connectivity is known to determine biodiversity patterns across large river floodplains, but it is often greatly altered by human activities. indicators and predictors of the response of river alteration or restoration are therefore needed. Recent papers suggested that fish environmental guilds - based on species flow preferences - could be used as a tool to assess ecological status of rivers. In the Loire floodplain, we described fish assemblages across the floodplain at the onset of the dry season and we determined whether observed spatial patterns could be related to environmental variables, especially connectivity. Based on specific composition of 46 electrofished waterbodies, a hierarchical typology of the Loire floodplain assemblages was built using self-organizing maps. Each assemblage of the typology was characterized by a set of species using the indicator value method. These species sets and the composition of the assemblages revealed a gradient of flow preferences in the different assemblages identified. A stepwise discriminant analysis showed that the most important variable determining assemblage composition was the hydrological connectivity. Finally, the conclusion was made that a high connectivity level is needed to conserve native fish diversity in the Loire floodplain, notably because the number of protected and native species increased with connectivity, and because the number of exotic species increased with isolation.

AB  - As a wind vane of climate change, lakes have a series of problems, such as functional degradation, reduction of ecological diversity, and weakening of self-purification capacity. The integrity of the water environment ecosystem has been destroyed. In this paper, Qinghai Lake is selected as the research object, taking temperature and precipitation as the starting point, and the impact of water vertical temperature, concent of dissolved oxygen, precipitation on water environment is analyzed emphatically. The increase of temperature increases the vertical temperature difference of Qinghai Lake, about 1.2 degrees C/m, which decreases the content of dissolved oxygen and the depth of oxygen layer. Due to precipitation, surface runoff and sink flow processes are strengthened. As a result, the indicator concentrations of TP, TN and PPCPs in Qinghai Lake increased. On the basis of clarifying the main factors that destroy the self-purification capacity of lakes, strictly following the ecological principles, the comprehensive ecological restoration countermeasures of water environment are proposed according to the results of biochemical simulation experiments, which are mainly bioremediation and phytoremediation, supplemented by physical and chemical restoration methods, The SWAT model is used to simulate and predict the future water environment parameters. The results show that the ecosystem of Qinghai Lake has been improved well, and at the same time, it also provides a scientific guidance for the feasibility of lake restoration work in China.

AB  - We report the development of a methodology for assessing confidence in ecological status classifications. The method presented here can be considered as a secondary assessment, supporting the primary assessment of eutrophication or ecological status. The confidence assessment is based on scoring the quality of the indicators on which the primary assessment is made. This represents a first step towards linking status classification with information regarding their accuracy and precision. Applied to an existing data set used for assessment of eutrophication status of the Baltic Sea (including the Kattegat and Danish Straits) we demonstrate that confidence in the assessment is Good or High in 149 out of 189 areas assessed (79%). Contrary to our expectations, assessments of the open parts of the Baltic Sea have a higher confidence than assessments of coastal waters. We also find that in open waters of the Baltic Sea, some biological indicators have a higher confidence than indicators representing physical-chemical conditions. In coastal waters, phytoplankton, submerged aquatic vegetation and indicators of physical-chemical conditions have a higher confidence than indicators of the quality of benthic invertebrate communities. Our analyses also show that the perceived weaknesses of eutrophication assessments are due more to Low confidence in reference conditions and acceptable deviations, rather than in the monitoring data.

AB  - The common bean is an important food in the human diet. Certain storage conditions, high temperatures and high humidity, cause a texture defect that reduces the acceptability of common beans. The present study aimed at evaluating the effect of storage on the physico-chemical properties of common bean grains and the relationship between accelerated aging at 40 C and 76% RH and storage under natural conditions. Two varieties of common beans (Iapar 81 - carioca variety and Iapar 44 - black variety) were stored at 40 degrees C and 76% RH for 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 days to accelerate aging. The same varieties were stored under environmental conditions (natural aging) for 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. For both storage conditions of each variety, fresh beans stored at 5 degrees C were used as a control group. In all of the samples, hardness, pH, acidity and the soluble protein percentage were analyzed. Both storage processes, in the natural and accelerated conditions, caused an increase in acidity (4.0 to 5.9 and 3.2 to 6.4 g acetic acid kg(-1)) and a decrease in cellular pH (6.65 to 6.45 and 6.65 to 6.45) and protein solubility (77 to 54 and 76 to 38%). The greatest percentage changes in the parameters of acidity, pH and soluble proteins were observed in the beans in the accelerated aging condition. Beans' hardness during storage has a negative correlation with pH, which shows that it is a good indicator of grain quality. Natural storage for one year is equivalent to accelerated aging for 45 days at 40 degrees C and 76% RH.

AB  - In order to determine the independent and joint effects of: (1) crop management; (2) soil condition; and (3) site location on soil biota assemblage, we examined the effects of several crop management and soil condition descriptors on the abundance and diversity of soil microarthropods in crop fields. Data were analyzed using linear regression, canonical correspondence analysis and variance partitioning. Our results indicated that: (1) soil mites was the most affected group by crop management; (2) most of the variance on microarthropod abundance remained unexplained as none of the descriptors were able to explain more than 10% of total species matrix variance; (3) tillage intensity resulted in higher variance explained of the species matrix than pesticide use or crop rotation; (4) soil carbon was the most influential factor among soil condition descriptors; and (5) a significant component of species variation was accounted for by the spatially structured fraction of the explanatory descriptors and other underlying spatial processes. Following the methods proposed in this work, further studies based on the obtained results may increase their power to detect agriculturally induced effects on soil biota by including more soil fauna groups and more controlled environmental factors or by improving the description of the local scale spatial heterogeneity.

AB  - Individuals from the same population typically show consistent differences in behavioural traits that are frequently associated with differences in contextual plasticity. Yet such a correlation might arise either because some individuals are better able than others to detect environmental changes or because the benefits of being plastic are condition-dependent. To discriminate between these two competing hypotheses, I developed an individual-based model that simulates a population in which individuals of varying fighting ability compete by pairwise interactions using either the fixed hawk (aggressive) or dove (peaceful) strategies or a conditional assessment strategy. As anticipated, the model predicts that only individuals with low (and/or intermediate) fighting ability should use the assessment strategy, giving rise to a negative (or dome-shaped) relationship between aggressiveness and plasticity. The proportion of plastic individuals, however, should be affected not only by the environmental conditions in which individuals live but also by the mechanism that would maintain variation in the traits that determine the benefits of plasticity. In particular, if individual differences in fighting ability may be eroded by natural selection, it predicts that ecological conditions that cause assortative interactions (e.g. high predation risks) would contribute in maintaining variation among individuals in their fighting ability, thereby favouring greater plasticity.

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental changes in Kazakhstan lead to changes in the formation of groundwater. The anthropogenic impact on the environment is expressed in the change of the relief and hydrographic network, the redistribution of water resources and the change in their qualitative and quantitative characteristics. An important consequence of anthropogenic influence is a change in the temperature regime of the territory and the nature of precipitation. The results of the analysis of the nature of changes in the formation of groundwater are given. The areas with the most strongly changed formation conditions, which include zones of ecological disaster in the Aral Sea region and the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, as well as built-up areas of large industrial centers and urban agglomerations of cities, are identified. A comprehensive analysis of climatic, glaciological and hydrogeological materials on the territory of Kazakhstan was used as a research methodology to determine the influence of climatic and anthropogenic environmental changes on the formation conditions of groundwater. Comparison of the research results from different years with the materials of recent years identified that fundamental changes in the quantitative indicators of groundwater supply should not be expected and groundwater resources, unlike surface water resources, will not significantly decrease. The use of research results will allow justifying the expansion of water supply for the population at the expense of groundwater.

AB  - Intertidal foraminifera from surface sediments are commonly used as a high-resolution indicator of sea-level change. The integrity of this approach is based upon the assumption that surface assemblages are similar in composition to their buried, fossil counterparts. This assumption may, in some cases, be inappropriate due to subsurface (or infaunal) production and taphonomic alteration. Here, we review the current understanding of foraminiferal production and taphonomic loss in intertidal environments, and examine the extent to which these processes can affect the development of foraminiferal assemblages in intertidal environments.
   As a sediment layer undergoes burial, dead tests are added at a rate proportionate to the standing crop at that depth. As a consequence, test accumulation within the layer is proportionate to the depth-integrated standing crop. Depending on the nature of its vertical living distribution, the upper 1 cm of sediment may therefore not adequately characterise a given species total input. Instead, a comparison of each species contribution to the entire, depth-integrated living community may offer a better a priori estimate of relative input to the sediment column. This provides an improved base-line for identifying 'true' taphonomic trends downcore.
   The potential for infauna to create discrepancies between surface and subsurface assemblages may be minimised however, where: (1) reproduction is concentrated near to the sediment surface, transforming an apparent infaunal standing crop into an effective epifaunal production; (2) the living fauna is composed similarly at all depths of production; and/or (3) intense bioturbation homogenises the upper sediment layers. The likely decline in the intensity of taphonomic processes with depth may mean that the foraminiferal production from different depths may not experience taphonomic processes uniformly. Consequently, in addition to their possible gradual enrichment due to subsurface production, infaunal species may be preferentially preserved by virtue of their production closer to the base of the taphonomically active zone. Additionally, homogenisation of the sediment column by reworking may mix temporally and perhaps environmentally distinct faunas, affecting the stratigraphic integrity of the sediment deposit.
   The most important taphonomic processes in intertidal environments are those associated with early diagenesis. While the organic cements of agglutinated taxa may be directly oxidised, the associated changes in the saturation state of porewaters with respect to calcium carbonate may affect calcareous species. The type of diagenetic reaction operating within the sediment provides a quantitative control on agglutinated test degradation but a largely qualitative control on calcareous preservation. In addition, calcareous test preservation is dependent upon the rate with which organic matter is supplied, while agglutinated test preservation is independent of organic matter concentrations. Although the specific morphological pathways of test degradation for calcareous species are well understood, the stages under which agglutinated tests are lost are less clear.
   The combined but varying influences of production (infaunal and species composition), taphonomic processes and bioturbation may create complex pathways in the transition from live to dead to fossil assemblages. Understanding the extent to which infauna, taphonomic loss, and sediment reworking affect assemblage development in different intertidal environments is essential in order to interpret the fossil record.

AB  - Genetic and ecological factors may interact in their effects on fitness. Such interactions are thus to be expected between inbreeding and exposure of a population to a toxicant. The magnitude of inbreeding depression is thought to increase in stressful environments. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the combined effects of environmental conditions and inbreeding on fitness in the self-fertile snail Lymnaea stagnalis, using a stress gradient (0-2) applied to a 100 isolated and paired lineages: laboratory control (0), outdoor microcosm control (1) and pesticide exposure under outdoor microcosm conditions (2). Outdoor stress conditions were maintained for 28 days prior to measurements of fitness traits (fecundity, hatching success, and size at hatching) under laboratory conditions, so that delayed environmental effects could be estimated. Under laboratory control conditions, we found significant initial family level heterogeneity for most measured traits, including physiological performances as assessed through energetic biomarkers. Whatever the environmental conditions, inbreeding depression was very low for progeny performances. Negative values of self-fertilization depression (SFD) were obtained. Unexpectedly, SFD showed a negative relationship with the assumed stress intensity, reflecting a higher sensitivity under pairing than under selfing, mostly due to parental fecundity. This suggests that stressful conditions may favour selfing. Stress intensity increased the distribution limits of both depression indices, suggesting that changes in fitness are less predictable in a population under stress. Implications of such findings for environmental risk assessment of pesticides are discussed.

AB  - Evaluation of the ecological status of river sites in Canada is supported by building models using the reference condition approach. However, geography, data scarcity and inter-operability constraints have frustrated attempts to monitor national-scale status and trends. This issue is particularly true in Atlantic Canada, where no ecological assessment system is currently available. Here, we present a reference condition model based on the River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System approach with regional-scale applicability. To achieve this, we used biological monitoring data collected from wadeable streams across Atlantic Canada together with freely available, nationally consistent geographic information system (GIS) environmental data layers. For the first time, we demonstrated that it is possible to use data generated from different studies, even when collected using different sampling methods, to generate a robust predictive model. This model was successfully generated and tested using GIS-based rather than local habitat variables and showed improved performance when compared to a null model. In addition, ecological quality ratio data derived from the model responded to observed stressors in a test dataset. Implications for future large-scale implementation of river biomonitoring using a standardised approach with global application are presented.

AB  - The invasive alien species Robinia pseudoacacia may lead to species homogenization in high invaded forest ecosystems. Its invasive behaviour is poorly known in dry forest habitats and low cover-abundance conditions. We have investigated central-northern Italian Quercus pubescens forest habitats (code 91AA* - EU Habitat Directive) without and with the presence of R. pseudoacacia and in respect of R. pseudoacacia dominant communities that are present in the same forest potential areas. Using levels of R. pseudoacacia cover-abundance values (Braun-Blanquet scale) we classified the vegetation releves in five groups: from 0 (total absence) to 4 (dominant conditions). Through the calculation of some indices, we highlighted the relations between groups of releves and the variation in term of ecological features. A threshold has been identified at low coverage values of R. pseudoacacia. We detected a significant difference in the lower invaded sites in term of presence of nitrophilous and alien species, Shannon diversity index and changes in nutrient, moisture, light and reaction Ellenberg indicator values. These results inform about the early alarm level to set in monitoring Q. pubescens forest habitats in sub-Mediterranean areas.

AB  - The main objective of this article is to analyse the relationship between human well-being (HWB) and ecosystem services (ES). We studied the Rio Cruces watershed (Chile) as a social-ecological system by means of a social survey and compared the results with those previously obtained at the Aysen watershed. We surveyed six localities characterized by different types of habitat. HWB was assessed by means of two indicators (material conditions and quality of life) and ES through the analysis of provisioning and regulating services. Results for Rio Cruces show no significant HWB differences between localities, with the exception of life satisfaction (lower on isolated localities). The use of provisioning and regulating services did not differ between localities, with the exception of two components (wood and soil fertility), and we only found a significant positive correlation between regulating services and HWB material conditions. The comparison between watersheds show that changes in HWB material conditions and both types of ES are positively correlated. We conclude that the relationship between human well-being and ecosystem services seems to be contextual to the analysed social-ecological system and that generalizations across systems may not be possible.

AB  - The environmental specimen banking program (ESB) of the Federal Republic of Germany implies a collection of specimens from repre sentative areas of Germany, stored under stable conditions for deferred analysis. It is an important part of the ecological assessment program. The ecological concept is presented as the frame of the entire ESB program. It is based on the selection of representative sampling areas and specimens. Standard operating procedures (SOP's) for sampling and characterization of specimens, as well as sampling designs specific to the areas, are presented as further important parts of the quality assurance system in relation to the correct sampling of specimens.

AB  - Because of the inaccuracies and biases of population estimates for large herbivores, 'indicators of ecological change' (IEC), which allow changes in the animals' abundance and body condition to be monitored together with ecosystem features, represent an interesting alternative. We used a set of indicators to monitor the relationship between a roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) population and its habitat during a significant increase of hunting pressure in an over-browsed forest of 12.1 km(2): the kilometric index, the ovulation rate of adult does, the body mass and jaw length of young and the browsing index. Subsequent to the monitoring results, roe deer density was reduced to a level improving forest regeneration, the animals' body condition and sustainable game use. Drawing from this successful experience, we caution against a misuse of IEC that could lead to erroneous interpretations. First, the indicators concerning abundance, body condition and impact on the habitat are complementary and necessary to obtain the information needed to efficiently manage populations. Second, managers must consider the values obtained over at least three consecutive years to correctly interpret IEC variations because of their non-linearity and sensitivity to environmental fluctuations.

AB  - We developed a Molecular Biomarker System (MBS) to assess the physiological status of mud snails (Ilyanassa obsoleta) challenged by exposure to high temperature, cadmium, atrazine, endosulfan and the water-accommodating fraction of bunker fuel #2. The MBS is used to assay specific cellular parameters of the gastropod cell that are indicative of a non-stressed or stressed condition. The MBS distinguished among responses to each stressor and to non-stressed control conditions. For example, the biomarkers metallothionein and cytochrome P450 2E1 homologue distinguished between metal and non-metal stresses. MBS data from this study corroborate toxicological studies of organismal responses to endosulfan, atrazine, fuel and cadmium stresses. The MBS technology aids in the accurate diagnosis of the snail's health condition because the physiological significance of the changes of each biomarker is well known. This technology is particularly relevant for environmental monitoring because gastropods are used as key indicator species in many estuarine, marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. Finally, the Molecular Biomarker System technology is relatively inexpensive, easy to implement, precise and can be quickly adapted to an automated, high-throughput system for large sample analysis.

AB  - An optical plankton counter (OPC) potentially provides an assessment tool for zooplankton condition in ecosystems that is rapid, economical, and spatially extensive. We collected zooplankton data with an OPC in 20 nearshore regions of 4 of the Laurentian Great Lakes. The zooplankton size information was used to compute mean size, biomass density, and size-spectra parameters for each location. The resulting metrics were analyzed for their ability to discriminate among the Great Lakes. Biomass density provided discrimination among lakes, as did several parameters describing spectra shape and distribution. A proposed zooplankton indicator, mean size (determined with OPC measurements in this study), was found to provide discrimination among lakes. Size-spectra-related parameters added increased ability to discriminate in conjunction with the biomass density (or mean size) metric. A discriminant function analysis of the multiple metrics (mean size, biomass density, and distribution parameters) suggests that a multi metric size-based approach might be used to classify communities among lakes improving a mean-size metric. The feasibility OPCs and size-based metrics for zooplankton assessment was found to have potential for further development as assessment tools for the biological condition of zooplankton communities in the Great Lakes.

AB  - The natural N-15/N-14 isotope composition (delta N-15) of a tissue is a consequence of its N source and N physiological mechanisms in response to the environment. It could potentially be used as a tracer of N metabolism in plants under changing environmental conditions, where primary N metabolism may be complex, and losses and gains of N fluctuate over time. In order to test the utility of delta N-15 as an indicator of plant N status in N-2-fixing plants grown under various environmental conditions, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) plants were subjected to distinct conditions of [CO2] (400 vs. 700 mu mol mol(-1)), temperature (ambient vs. ambient +4 degrees C) and water availability (fully watered vs. water deficiency-WD). As expected, increased [CO2] and temperature stimulated photosynthetic rates and plant growth, whereas these parameters were negatively affected by WD. The determination of delta N-15 in leaves, stems, roots, and nodules showed that leaves were the most representative organs of the plant response to increased [CO2] and WD. Depletion of heavier N isotopes in plants grown under higher [CO2] and WD conditions reflected decreased transpiration rates, but could also be related to a higher N demand in leaves, as suggested by the decreased leaf N and total soluble protein (TSP) contents detected at 700 mu mol mol(-1) [CO2] and WD conditions. In summary, leaf delta N-15 provides relevant information integrating parameters which condition plant responsiveness (e.g., photosynthesis, TSP, N demand, and water transpiration) to environmental conditions.

AB  - We analyzed the effects of regional and local natural conditions on the process of construction and functioning of road landscape-engineering systems (RLES) - modem actively developing operating roads with the required infrastructure. It has been reported that compared with other anthropogenic landscapes, those of roads do not receive sufficient attention from environmental geographers and landscape scientists, especially regarding the impact of regional and local nature conditions on their functioning. On the example of a region, which is specific according to natural conditions and landscape structure - Podillia, we analyzed three natural factors that significantly affect the functioning of RLES in the region, particularly the manifestation of unfavourable processes in them. These factors include broad distribution (72% of the territory of Podillia) and thick layers of loess rocks (up to 5-7 metres), high differentiation of the surface and cloudburst pattern of atmospheric precipitations. Those factors create preconditions for the development of unfavourable processes in the RLES, especially if this is aggravated by poor planning of their construction and irrational exploitation of RLES of Podillia. In more details, it was analyzed in two natural areas of actively functioning road landscape-engineer systems: Khmelnytsky-Virmytsia (outskirts of Yakyshyntsi village) and Vinnytsia-Uman (outskirts of Voronovytsia town). We should note that the impact of local peculiarities of the natural conditions and unfavourable processes they had caused often depend on confinement of the RLES to two of the most dynamic types of landscape in Podillia - slopes and floodplains. Manifestation of local peculiarities of natural conditions and landscape complexes was analyzed on the example of Podillia' s commonest slope-type habitats - ravine tracts that intersect the road landscape-engineer systems. The paper demonstrates that regional and local peculiarities of natural conditions of Podillia and their impact on the functioning of road landscape-engineering systems should be considered against the background of expression of zonal natural factors and current conditions of the development of society. Taking into account regional and local natural peculiarities in the process of construction and functioning of RLES is one of the realistic ways to ensure long and safe rational exploitation.

AB  - In the present study, a new wetland health assessment approach based on the fuzzy inference system (FIS) was developed and proposed for the first time to improve a traditional wetland classification and assessment index. One primary purpose of the study is to modify the indicators of the traditional assessment approach to suit the regional environmental conditions of the selected areas. As two of the twenty-five Iranian wetlands with international importance, Kanibarazan and Choghakhor wetlands were selected as the study areas due to their significant roles in protecting the biodiversity of their regions. The wetlands are supported by the international Ramsar Convention on Wetlands to mandate and encourage the local authorities towards their conservation and sustainable exploitation. In this regard, the Iranian Department of Environment, in cooperation with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), selected these wetlands to demonstrate new approaches of managing the wetland areas protected by the Conservation of Iranian Wetlands Project (CIWP). A real-time wetland monitoring station with hydrological instruments, including water level, air temperature, air humidity, and water quality multi-parameter sensors recording water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, and dissolved oxygen (DO), was implanted at the deepest part of both wetlands. The manual sampling of water quality parameters was also carried out periodically during specific intervals. The relative importance of the wetland health indicators involved in the FIS was determined via the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), utilizing the knowledge of local experts, including academic staff, environmental specialists, and natives, to localize the traditional assessment approach. In turn, the health level categories of both wetlands were assessed using the traditional and proposed wetland health assessment approaches. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the selected case studies, and it proved to be a more flexible and appropriate approach for wetland health assessment. Furthermore, the observed differences between the health level of the first case study pointed to the efficiency of the AHP-FIS method in improving the traditional index. Besides, feedforward neural network (FFNN) and support vector regression (SVR) artificial intelligence (AI) methods were used to model DO as one of the most critical water quality parameters in maintaining the biological integrity of wetland ecosystems. The obtained results indicated that FFNN performed slightly better than SVR in predicting DO of both wetlands. Consequently, the results of DO modeling were used to investigate the possibility of employing AI models in wetland health assessment in case of unavailability or failures of DO sensors, which was considered practical considering the suitable performance of AI models and the obtained wetland health level results based on the predicted DO.

AB  - Frame Lake, located within the city of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, has been identified as requiring significant remediation due to its steadily declining water quality and inability to support fish by the 1970s. Former gold mining operations and urbanization around the lake have been suspected as probable causes for the decline in water quality. While these land-use activities are well documented, little information is available regarding their impact on the lake itself. For this reason, Arcellinida, a group of shelled protozoans known to be reliable bioindicators of land-use change, were used to develop a hydroecological history of the lake. The purpose of this study was to use Arcellinida to: (1) document the contamination history of the lake, particularly related to arsenic (As) associated with aerial deposition from mine roaster stacks; (2) track the progress of water quality deterioration in Frame Lake related to mining, urbanization and other activities; and (3) identify any evidence of natural remediation within the lake. Arcellinida assemblages were assessed at 1-cm intervals through the upper 30 cm of a freeze core obtained from Frame Lake. The assemblages were statistically compared to geochemical and loss-on-ignition results from the core to document the contamination and degradation of conditions in the lake. The chronology of limnological changes recorded in the lake sediments were derived from Pb-210, C-14 dating and known stratigraphic events. The progress of urbanization near the lake was tracked using aerial photography. Using Spearman correlations, the five most significant environmental variables impacting Arcellinida distribution were identified as minerogenics, organics, As, iron and mercury (p < 0.05; n = 30). Based on CONISS and ANOSIM analysis, three Arcellinida assemblages are identified. These include the Baseline Limnological Conditions Assemblage (BLCA), ranging from 17-30 cm and deposited in the early Holocene >7,000 years before present; the As Contamination Assemblage (ACA), ranging from 7-16 cm, deposited after similar to 1962 when sedimentation began in the lake again following a long hiatus that spanned to the early Holocene; and the Eutrophication Assemblage (EA), ranging from 1-6 cm, comprised of sediments deposited after 1990 following the cessation of As and other metal contaminations. The EA developed in response to nutrient-rich waters entering the lake derived from the urbanization of the lake catchment and a reduction in lake circulation associated with the development at the lake outlet of a major road, later replaced by a causeway with rarely open sluiceways. The eutrophic condition currently charactering the lake-as evidenced by a population explosion of eutrophication indicator taxa Cucurbitella tricuspis-likely led to a massive increase in macrophyte growth and winter fish-kills. This ecological shift ultimately led to a system dominated by Hirudinea (leeches) and cessation of the lake as a recreational area.

AB  - Many biotic integrity indices are not able to isolate community effects due to pesticide exposure as the communities also respond to other anthropogenic and natural stressors. A macroinvertebrate trait bioindicator system that is pesticide specific was therefore developed to overcome these challenges. This system, called SPEAR (SPEcies At Risk), was applied in South Africa as an indicator to link known pesticide catchment usage to changes in the macroinvertebrate community, especially when analytical methods are inconclusive. In addition, the SPEAR(salinity) index within the SPEAR suite of tools was also evaluated for its effectiveness in South Africa. The results indicated that all of the sites have either been exposed to the same pesticide pressure or not been exposed to pesticides as the SPEAR results were similar when compared to the pesticide intensity. The interaction with other factors like nutrients or salinity was likely a factor that confounded the SPEAR(pesticides) indicator.

AB  - Riparian buffers are of major concern for land and water resource managers despite their relatively low spatial coverage. In Europe, this concern has been acknowledged by different environmental directives which recommend multi-scale monitoring (from local to regional scales). Remote sensing methods could be a cost-effective alternative to field-based monitoring, to build replicable "wall-to-wall" monitoring strategies of large river networks and associated "riparian buffers. The main goal of our, study is to extract and analyze various parameters of the riparian buffers of up to 12,000 km of river in southern Belgium (Wallonia) from three-dimensional (3D) point clouds based on LiDAR and photogrammetric surveys to i) map riparian buffers parameters on different scales, ii) interpret the regional patterns of the riparian buffers and iii) propose new riparian buffer management indicators. We propose different strategies to synthesize and visualize relevant information at different spatial scales ranging from local (<10 km) to regional scale (>12,000 km). Our results showed that the selected parameters had a clear regional pattern. The reaches of Ardenne ecoregion have channels with the highest flow widths and shallowest depths. In contrast, the reaches of the Loam ecoregion have the narrowest and deepest flow channels. Regional variability in channel width and depth is used to locate management units potentially affected by human impact. Riparian forest of the Loam ecoregion is characterized by the lowest longitudinal continuity and mean tree height, underlining significant human disturbance. As the availability of 3D point clouds at the regional scale is constantly growing, our study proposes reproducible methods which can be integrated into regional monitoring by land managers. With LiDAR still being relatively expensive to acquire, the use of photogrammetric point clouds combined with LiDAR data is a cost-effective means to update the characterization of the riparian forest conditions.

AB  - The interaction of background disease processes with environmental induced diseases has long been an issue of considerable interest and debate with respect to its impact on risk assessment. Whether and to what extent these processes should be considered independent or additive to background has been the principal focus of debate. The concept of hormesis, a biphasic dose response characterized by a low dose stimulation and a high dose inhibition, as framed within the context of post-conditioning, reveal the occurrence of a third type of "background" possibility, that of "subtraction to background". This novel application of the hormesis concept, which is framed within the biological context of post-conditioning adaptive processes, offers considerable implications for the assessment of aging and environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Floristic Quality Assessments (FQAs) are measurements of a natural area's ecological integrity based on their plant species composition. Widely used by government agencies and conservation organizations to monitor and assess natural areas, FQA data bases have been developed for much of the United States and beyond. Here, we present the Universal FQA Calculator (), a free, open-source web-based FQA Calculator. The calculator offers 30 FQA data bases (with more being added regularly) from across the United States and Canada and has been used to calculate thousands of assessments. The Universal FQA Calculator's growing repository for site inventory and transect data is accessible via a REST API and represents a valuable resource for data on the occurrence and abundance of plant species. We describe the features and implementation of the Universal FQA Calculator, provide a summary of its increasing usage and discuss the benefits of cloud-based storage of ecological assessment data.

AB  - Bioindicator organisms, such as edaphic invertebrates, are constantly used to assess disturbance, as they exhibit responses such as reduced community and changes in diversity, affecting the local ecosystem. The aim of this study was to compare the impacts of disturbance on the edaphic invertebrate community in both a pasture area and a native forest area, during summer and winter. Samplings were conducted for nine days using pitfalls. Bray-Curtis analyses, NMDS, ANOSIM, and SIMPER were applied. There was difference in richness and diversity between areas and seasons. Native forest pitfalls had higher similarity in abundance and diversity in both seasons than pasture pitfalls. Specimens belonging to 20 orders were collected; of those, Collembola, Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera had the highest number of individuals. Seasonal influence on the organisms was evident. The impact on edaphic invertebrate community located in the pasture area showed that native forest has higher complexity and structural stability.

KW  - PATTERNS
AB  - The forest products industry is a significant earner of foreign currency for South Africa. It is, therefore, important that tools are developed to monitor the health of plantation ecosystems and determine the impact of biotic and abiotic influences. Fungi can be useful indicators of the health of the ecosystem, because they represent an important link in the flow of energy through it and are also involved in most ecosystem processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate two different methods assessing the diversity of fungal communities. The first method was based on the structural diversity of the macrocarpic fungal community, and the second on the functional diversity of fungal populations in the organic horizon of plantation soils. Both techniques showed that diverse fungal communities were supported in pine plantations, but that the structural diversity of macrocarpic fungi was more sensitive in detecting differences between the compartments. This approach could be improved by using specific organisms such as mycorrhizal fungi as indicator species of ecological integrity in plantation ecosystems.

AB  - We studied the effect of three major forest management types (unmanaged beech, selection beech, and age class forests) and stand variables (SMId, soil pH, proportion of conifers, litter cover, deadwood cover, rock cover and cumulative cover of woody trees and shrubs) on bryophyte species richness in 1050 forest plots in three regions in Germany. In addition, we analysed the species richness of four ecological guilds of bryophytes according to their colonized substrates (deadwood, rock, soil, bark) and the number of woodland indicator bryophyte species. Beech selection forests turned out to be the most species rich management type, whereas unmanaged beech forests revealed even lower species numbers than age-class forests. Increasing conifer proportion increased bryophyte species richness but not the number of woodland indicator bryophyte species. The richness of the four ecological guilds mainly responded to the abundance of their respective substrate. We conclude that the permanent availability of suitable substrates is most important for bryophyte species richness in forests, which is not stringently linked to management type. Therefore, managed age-class forests and selection forests may even exceed unmanaged forests in bryophyte species richness due to higher substrate supply and therefore represent important habitats for bryophytes. Typical woodland indicator bryophytes and their species richness were negatively affected by SMId (management intensity) and therefore better indicate forest integrity than the species richness of all bryophytes. Nature conservation efforts should focus on the reduction of management intensity. Moreover, maintaining and increasing a variability of substrates and habitats, such as coarse woody debris, increasing structural heterogeneity by retaining patches with groups of old, mature to over-mature trees in managed forests, maintaining forest climate conditions by silvicultural methods that assure stand continuity, e.g. by selection cutting rather than clear cutting and shelterwood logging might promote bryophyte diversity and in particular the one of woodland indicator bryophytes.

AB  - Environmental stress can increase phenotypic variation in populations by affecting developmental stability of individuals. While such increase in variation results from individual differences in ability to buffer stress, groups of individuals and different traits may have different sensitivity to stressful conditions. For example, the sex that is under stronger directional selection for faster growth may be more sensitive to stressful conditions during development. On an individual level, stress-induced variation in a trait may be related to the strength of stabilizing selection that acts on the trait. We experimentally examined sensitivity of mandibular development to stress in a free-living population of common shrews (Sorex cinereus), a short-lived insectivore mammal with very limited dispersal and nearly continuous foraging activity. We found a strong increase in asymmetry in shrews born under stressful conditions. Increased asymmetry was associated with lower physiological condition in both control and stressed populations, although the effect of asymmetry on fitness was more pronounced under stressful conditions. Males' developmental stability was more sensitive to stressful conditions than developmental stability of females, suggesting that their apparently faster and more variable growth is more sensitive to stress than is growth of females. Mandible traits differed in their sensitivity to environmental changes. Preliminary results suggest that this differential sensitivity is proportional to the degree of developmental and functional morphological integration among mandibular traits.

AB  - The present study relates to the preparation of mixed calcium oxide alumina compositions as candidate materials for a cyclic thermochemical hydration dehydration scheme at moderate to high temperatures (e.g. 400-600 degrees C) that can offer the possibility of short and long term energy storage, particularly suitable for concentrated solar power installations. The synthesized materials were assessed in terms of their cyclic hydration dehydration performance in the temperature range of 200-550 degrees C. Acknowledging the fact that the particular thermochemical scheme has been identified to result in substantial cycle-to-cycle fragmentation of pure CaO particles which is detrimental to particle reactor bed concepts, one of the main purposes of using Al as additive is related to materials structural enhancement. To this respect, preliminary studies related to macro-structural integrity assessment were also conducted. In addition, the performance of synthesized material is compared to the one of natural lime (benchmark material). The additive content spanned over a wide range of Ca/Al molar ratios, namely from 95/5 to 52/48, while two different calcium oxide precursors, i.e. calcium nitrate and calcium acetate, were employed. Fresh and hydrated compositions were characterized in-detail with respect to their physicochemical properties in order to correlate different behaviors with certain attributes of the materials. Synthetic materials, both calcium nitrate and calcium acetate derived, favored the formation of Ca/Al mixed phases. The latter led to materials with higher surface areas and, for a given Ca/Al ratio, resulted to higher hydration/dehydration performance. Mixed oxides, although capable of being hydrated at ambient temperature, did not participate in the reaction scheme at temperatures >= 200 degrees C and thus presence of such phases resulted in considerable decrease of hydration/dehydration capacity versus the one of natural lime. On the other hand, the presence of such mixed compositions improved, albeit not dramatically, macro-structural integrity. A relatively good combination of hydration dehydration performance with better-than-natural lime structural integrity was achieved for the mixed materials with a Ca/Al molar ratio equal to 89/11 and 81/19 molar ratio. The Ca-precursor used in these materials slightly affected their cyclic performance with the ex-CaN ones presenting better behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Restoration status of forest rehabilitation areas can be assessed by comparing their ecosystem characteristics with those of a reference system, most often what is considered the natural climax vegetation. However, comprehensive measurements needed for a traditional vegetation description are often hard or impractical in complex (sub)tropical ecosystems. Therefore, an alternative approach is the identification of simple indicators of ecosystem integrity. The use of such indicators can speed up the availability of resource inventories and thus contribute to the accelerated implementation of successful rehabilitation practices. Thermal buffer capacity (TBC) of ecosystems has been previously proposed as an overall indicator of ecosystem integrity. In this article, sequential surface-temperature measurements are proposed as a method for TBC assessment of different land-use types. Surface temperatures of seven land units in central Tigray (northern Ethiopia), each with a uniform land-use type (degraded and bushy grazing land, enriched and non-enriched rehabilitation area, and forest), were measured with a hand-held infrared thermometer in the rainy and the dry season. Surface-temperature models were derived by means of quadratic regression. Cross-correlation functions were calculated for all possible pairs of land-unit time-series data. Instantaneous heat-up rates, average TBC, and accumulated heat load were calculated. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test the effect of aspect and protection status on TBC. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks for small samples was used to test the significance of differences in heat-up rates and heat load among land-use groups. Time lags between land-unit surface temperatures are caused by differences in aspect rather than land-use type. Protection status and aspect have a significant effect on the average TBC. Results clearly demonstrate a differentiation between protected (low heat-up rate) and non-protected areas (high heat-up rate). Overall ranking suggests that the remnant forest has the highest TBC of all surveyed land-use types, followed by the enriched protected area. Results of this study show that TBC quickly responds to area closure and can therefore be used to monitor the development of protected areas. It is strongly recommended that a detailed monitoring strategy for protected areas on the basis of this technology be devised, validated, and finally transferred to the local communities.

AB  - The assemblage of benthic macroinvertebrates in relation to some selected environmental variables of the two headwater streams of Aiba Reservoir was studied from May 2013 to March 2014. This was with a view to assessing the health status and water quality of the streams, and comparing their taxa richness with similar studies on the reservoir and its out-flowing stream. A total of 23 taxa were recorded in the study. NO2- and PO43- showed indirect relationships (P < 0.05) with bioindicators of good water quality, while dissolved oxygen (DO) showed indirect relationship (P < 0.05) with bioindicators of poor water quality. The streams were of poor biological water quality, and diversity indices revealed that they were polluted and unstable in habitat structure. Anthropogenic impacts at the upper reaches need to be mitigated and regular biomonitoring of the streams is of the essence, in order to conserve the integrity of the downstream reservoir.

AB  - Diatoms are widely used in the biological monitoring of streams because they are strong responders to environmental change, but dispersal and spatial factors can play important and potentially confounding roles in the presence, absence, and abundance of species along with characterizing species environment relationships. To examine how spatial factors affect diatom community structure and biomonitoring, multiple scales were sampled including the Western Allegheny Plateau (n = 58), Leading Creek watershed (n = 18), and the adjacent Shade River watershed (n = 21) in southeast Ohio. Partitioning of spatial, environmental, and spatially-structured environmental variation was conducted on diatom assemblages and on diatom metrics used in biomonitoring. At the regional scale, diatom assemblages and metrics had strong relationships with agricultural (e.g., significant correlations with nutrients, conductivity, and pasture/row crops in the watershed) and alkalinity gradients. Diatom assemblages and metrics in both watersheds were strongly associated with acid mine drainage (AMD) impacts, and when spatial factors were set as covariables in CCAs, relationships with AMD gradients became even stronger, indicating the need to consider how spatial factors could reduce the strength of diatom-environment relationships. Metrics calculated at all scales had very little variation explained exclusively by spatial factors, likely because multiple species are combined into a simplified metric that reduces the effects of species dispersal. Local environmental variables accounted for 57, 42, and 42% of the total variation explained (WE), and spatial variables accounted for 28, 31, and 37% of the WE in the regional, Leading Creek, and Shade River datasets, respectively. The amounts of variation in diatom assemblages explained solely by spatial factors at these scales were substantial and similar to what has been reported at continental, national, and large regional (Level I Omernik ecoregions) scales (approximately 1/3 of TVE). Although amounts of variation explained are similar across scales, processes underlying the spatial structure likely differ. In addition to describing ecological patterns, recognizing the potential influence of spatial factors could improve the identification and management of environmental problems at a range of scales, as well as aid in the development of new research questions and hypotheses aimed at exploring factors that could explain portions of the spatially explicit variation.

AB  - In order to clarify the restoration status of natural habitat in riparian zone of Liao River Conservation Area, promote the healthy management of riparian zone ecosystem of Liao River Conservation area, and realize the sustainable development of river and regional ecosystem, this paper build a practical and feasible evaluation index system and formulate appropriate evaluation criteria by combining geographical features with its natural and artificial factors. The comprehensive index method was used to evaluate the restoration status of natural habitats in the riparian zone of Liao River reserve. The results show that, 21.74% of the sampling sites were in excellent condition, 17.39% in good condition, 26.09% in general condition, 17.39% in worse condition, and 17.39% in very bad condition. Compared with historical data, 82.61% of riparian natural habitats were improved, while only 17.39% of riparian natural habitats remained unchanged. There was no degradation of natural habitats in riparian zones, and natural habitats in riparian zones in the Liao River reserve were in a state of recovery.

AB  - Simple Summary Understanding the natural behaviour of pigs in free-range conditions facilitates the interpretation of their behaviour in intensive conditions. The present study aims to study behavioural indicators of activity in the domestic pig, reared free-range and under two feeding regimes, with some help from humans with concentrates and without help, just eating natural resources. Results confirmed that exploratory behaviour was an important behaviour for pigs, but the same animals that dedicated 50% of their time to this activity when they were not fed by humans reduced this activity to 17.8% when they were fed with concentrates. In addition, few social contacts between animals were seen in extensive conditions, with a higher incidence of negative rather than positive social behaviour. It was concluded that: (1) the need for exploring the surroundings in natural environments is of less importance for pigs when they are fed by humans, and (2) bathing areas in outdoor conditions are important for pigs in the event of warm conditions. Overall, it is concluded that natural behaviour of pigs in free-range conditions, such as a reduced foraging behaviour when pigs are fed with concentrates, should be considered when interpreting behavioural needs in intensive conditions.
   Abstract Understanding the natural behaviour of pigs in free-range conditions facilitates interpretation of their behaviour in intensive conditions. Studying six different farms over two years at different seasons, with climatic and management variations, allowed for a general description of Iberian pig behaviour and which factors have an influence on it. The main activity found was resting (56.5% of the time observed), followed by exploratory behaviour. However, this exploratory behaviour was higher when animals were fed only with natural resources than when fed with concentrates (50% versus 17.8%, respectively). In addition, pigs used bathing areas in summer that were not visited in winter. Negative social behaviour was seen more frequently than positive social behaviour, accounting, in total, for 1% of the total activity of animals. Pigs situated at the centre of the groups tended to remain more relaxed, while the peripheral animals remained more alert and vigilant. Our results indicate that foraging behaviour accounts for a significant proportion of pigs' active time, but this proportion is much more reduced when pigs are fed concentrates. Therefore, behavioural needs in pigs reared in intensive conditions should consider that exploratory behaviour is reduced when pigs are fed with concentrates.

AB  - Do adversarial environmental conditions create social cohesion? We provide new answers to this question by exploiting spatial and temporal variation in exposure to earthquakes across Chile. Using a variety of methods and controlling for a number of socio-economic variables, we find that exposure to earthquakes has a positive effect on several indicators of social cohesion. Social cohesion increases after a big earthquake and slowly erodes in periods where environmental conditions are less adverse. Our results contribute to the current debate on whether and how environmental conditions shape formal and informal institutions.

AB  - Extreme temperature events have increased in intensity, duration and frequency in the last century, with potential consequences on organisms and ecosystems. In many streams, leaf litter of terrestrial origin is a key resource for microorganisms and some detritivores, and its decomposition has a main role on ecosystem functioning and is often used as an indicator of ecological integrity. As litter is often exposed to atmospheric conditions before entering the stream, extreme warming and freezing events may alter its physicochemical structure and affect decomposition and associated detritivores. We tested this prediction in a microcosm experiment by exposing litter of three tree species (in single-species treatments and the 3-species mixture) to different temperature pre-treatments: heating (40 degrees C), freezing ( - 20 degrees C) and both (heating followed by freezing). We then examined changes in litter traits due to leaching (72 h), litter decomposition in the absence and presence of detritivores, and detritivore growth (28 d), with focus on mass and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) changes. Nutrient leaching was promoted mostly by the heating pre-treatment, which apparently produced lower-quality litter. However, microbial activity mostly resulted in litter mass and nutrient gain, which were reinforced by the heating pre-treatment, while freezing had the opposite effect. When detritivores were present, decomposition showed high variation among litter types but, again, the heating and freezing pre-treatments tended to reduce and enhance nutrient loss, respectively. The greatest and more consistent effects occurred for detritivore growth, which was reduced by temperature pre-treatments, particularly in the highest-quality litter type. In general, the sequential application of heating and freezing pre-treatments showed no synergistic effect, and the litter mixture showed similar responses to single-species treatments. Our results demonstrate that short-term extreme temperatures can modify litter quality in riparian soils and have subsequent effects on its decomposition within the stream and associated fauna, potentially altering stream food webs, ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - Indicators to assess sustainable land development often focus on either economic or ecologic aspects of landscape use. The concept of multifunctional land use helps merging those two focuses by emphasising on the rule that economic action is per se accompanied by ecological utility: commodity outputs (CO, e.g., yields) are paid for on the market, but non-commodity outputs (NCO, e.g., landscape aesthetics) so far are public goods with no markets.
   Agricultural production schemes often provided both outputs by joint production, but with technical progress under prevailing economic pressure, joint production increasingly vanishes by decoupling of commodity from non-commodity production.
   Simultaneously, by public and political awareness of these shortcomings, there appears a societal need or even demand for some non-commodity outputs of land use, which induces a market potential, and thus, shift towards the status of a commodity outputs.
   An approach is presented to merge both types of output by defining an indicator of social utility (SUMLU): production schemes are considered with respect to social utility of both commodity and non-commodity outputs. Social utility in this sense includes environmental and economic services as long as society expresses a demand for them. For each combination of parameters at specific frame conditions (e.g., soil and climate properties of a landscape) a production possibility curve can reflect trade-offs between commodity and non-commodity outputs. On each production possibility curve a welfare optimum can be identified expressing the highest achievable value of social utility as a trade-off between CO and NCO production.
   When applying more parameters, a cluster of welfare optimums is generated. Those clusters can be used for assessing production schemes with respect to sustainable land development.
   Examples of production possibility functions are given on easy applicable parameters (nitrogen leaching versus gross margin) and on more complex ones (biotic integrity).
   Social utility, thus allows to evaluate sustainability of land development in a cross-sectoral approach with respect to multifunctionality. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dynamic canopy temperature and transpiration rates of tall fescue (festuca arundinacea) were studied under well-watered and moisture stress conditions, using step increase and decrease levels of irradiance. These studies were preformed in a high irradiance plant growth chamber under controlled conditions. The fescue canopy was modeled using Laplace transfer functions, with plant temperature, irradiance, and vapor pressure deficit as input variables. Well-watered plants tended to respond as a second-order model, with a critically damped response for most levels of step irradiance inputs. Moderately stressed plants approached critical and under-damped response conditions. Severely stressed plants tended to respond closely to a first model. The results illustrate the complex nature of plant feedback mechanisms as the plant anticipates moisture stress conditions.

AB  - Most species interactions probably involve parasites. This review considers the extent to which marine ecologists should consider parasites to fully understand marine communities. Parasites are influential parts of food webs in estuaries, temperate reefs, and coral reefs, but their ecological importance is seldom recognized. Though difficult to observe, parasites can have substantial biomass, and they can be just as common as free-living consumers after controlling for body mass and trophic level. Parasites have direct impacts on the energetics of their hosts and some affect host behaviors, with ecosystem-level consequences. Although they cause disease, parasites are sensitive components of ecosystems. In particular, they suffer secondary extinctions due to biodiversity loss. Some parasites can also return to a system after habitat restoration. For these reasons, parasites can make good indicators of ecosystem integrity. Fishing can indirectly increase or decrease parasite populations and the effects of climate change on parasites are likely to be equally as complex.

AB  - Connectivity metrics for surface water are important for predicting floods and droughts, and improving water management for human use and ecological integrity at the landscape scale. The integrated use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations and geostatistics approach can be useful for developing and quantifying these metrics and their changes, including geostatistical connectivity function (GCF), maximum distance of connection (MDC), surface water extent (SWE), and connection frequency. In this study, we conducted a geostatistical analysis based on 52 wet and dry binary state (i.e., water and non-water) rasters derived from Sentinel-1 A/B GRD products acquired from 2015 to 2019 for China's Momoge National Nature Reserve to investigate applicability and dynamics of the hydrologic connectivity metrics in an ungauged (i.e., data such as flow and water level are scarce) multi-lake system. We found: (1) generally, the change of GCF in North-South and Northeast-Southwest directions was greater than that in the West-East and Northwest-Southeast directions; (2) MDC had a threshold effect, generally at most 25 km along the W-E, NW-SE and NE-SW directions, and at most 45 km along the N-S direction; (3) the flow paths between lakes are diverse, including channelized flow, diffusive overbank flow, over-road flow and "fill-and-merge"; (4) generally, the values of the three surface hydrological connectivity indicators (i.e., the MDC, the SWE, and the conneciton frequency) all increased from May to August, and decreased from August to October; (5) generally, the closer the distance between the lakes, the greater the connection frequency, but it is also affected by the dam and road barrier. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the geostatistical method combining Sentinel-1 SAR image analysis in quantifying surface hydrological connectivity in an ungagged area. This approach should be applicable for other geographical regions, in order help resource managers and policymakers identify changes in surface hydrological connectivity, as well as address potential impacts of these changes on water resources for human use and/or ecological integrity at the landscape level.

AB  - Changes in plateau body lake water are an important indicator of global ecosystem changes, and a timely and accurate grasp of this change information can provide a scientific reference for the formulation of relevant policies. The traditional fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) algorithm takes into account the ambiguity of the classification of the ground object pixels but does not consider the rich spectral information of the neighboring pixels and is very sensitive to the background noise" of the remote sensing image, resulting in low water extraction accuracy. Aiming to compensate for the shortcomings of the traditional FCM algorithm, this paper proposes an improved FCM algorithm. This algorithm replaces the Euclidean distance of the traditional FCM algorithm with a combination of the Mahalanobis distance and spectral angle matching (SAM) to fully take into account the spectral information of neighboring pixels and improve the clustering accuracy. The study selected Sentinel-2 images of the Fuxian Lake and Xingyun Lake basins during normal, wet, and dry periods as the data source. Under the same conditions, the clustering accuracy was compared with the traditional FCM algorithm, improved FCM algorithm, K-means clustering method and iterative self-organizing data analysis (ISODATA) clustering method. The experimental results show that the improved FCM algorithm has a higher water extraction accuracy than the traditional FCM algorithm, K-means clustering method and ISODATA clustering method. The kappa coefficient and overall accuracy (OA) of the improved FCM algorithm can be increased by 5.56%-9.45% and 2.66%-5.32%, respectively, and the omission error and commission error can be reduced by 1.72%-4.55% and 12.14%-22.10%, respectively. When the improved FCM algorithm is used, the extraction accuracy is higher for plateau deep lakes than for plateau shallow lakes, and the extraction effect for lakes with poor water environments is more significant than that of other methods. The improved FCM algorithm better maintains the integrity of the water boundary and overcomes the influence of a certain number of mountain shadows and urban building pixels on the clustering results.

AB  - Since 1977 the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) has maintained a specimen bank for retrospective chemical analyses. The Great Lakes Fisheries Specimen Bank (GLFSB) is a complementary activity to the department's ongoing Great Lakes Contaminants Surveillance Program that has annually, since 1977, monitored levels of metals and organochlorines in aquatic biota throughout the Canadian Great Lakes. Past activities have focused on defining the effects of long-term frozen storage on the integrity of organochlorine residues in archived biological tissues. Archived samples have been reanalyzed for total PCBs, PCB congeners including co-planar PCBs, dioxin and furan isomers, and 22 toxaphene congeners. More recently, archived samples of predatory fish have been analyzed for stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta(15)N) and carbon (delta(13)C), as indicators of historical changes in food web dynamics. A catalogue or user-guide has recently been completed describing all information associated with samples stored in the GLFSB. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The use of soil fauna as soil quality indicator has been of great importance to understand the biological, chemical and physical variations of ecosystems. The collembola takes part in a group of organisms that has an active participation in organic material transformations of soil. The aim of this work was to evaluate the collembola reproduction in laboratory condition. The used substrate was sample of soil collected from citrus and pinus area with the following treatments: a) citrus soil with: common vetch ground straw, corn ground straw, turnip ground straw, broiller litter and in soil and, b) pinus soil with: common vetch ground straw, corn ground straw, turnip ground straw, broiller litter and in soil. The treatments were maintained in plastic pots at 26 C in the darkness, during 180 days, with five repetitions. The soil material from citrus area with turnip ground straw favored the collembola reproduction in laboratory conditions.

AB  - Land degradation in drylands is the process in which undesirable conditions emerge due to human and natural causes. Despite the particularly deleterious effects of degradation, and it's potentially irreversible nature, regional assessments have provided conflicting extents, rates, and severities of degradation, both globally and regionally. Current monitoring of degradation relies upon the detection of green, photosynthetically active parts of vegetation (e.g., leaves). Less is known, however, about the effect of degradation on the non-photosynthetic components of vegetation (e.g., wood, stems, leaf litter) and the relationship between photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and bare soil under degraded conditions (BS). The major objective of the study was to evaluate regional patterns of fractional cover (i.e., PV, NPV, BS) under degraded and non-degraded NPP conditions in a managed rangeland in north Queensland, Australia. Homogenous environmental conditions were identified and each of NPP, PV, NPV, and BS were scaled according to their potential, reference values. We found a strong spatial and temporal correlation between scaled NPP with both scaled PV and scaled BS. Drastic differences were also found for PV and BS between degraded and non-degraded conditions. NPV displayed similarity to both PV and BS, however no clear relationship was found for NPV in all areas, irrespective of degradation conditions.

AB  - The relative importance of pollution from non-point sources, such as vehicular emissions, is not well understood in sensitive semi-arid protected areas, such as Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP). Roadside N deposition could be substantial in areas with high visitation and traffic volume such as GCNP, although inputs of roadside pollution have not been quantified in GCNP. We used three potential indicators of N enrichment to evaluate impacts of vehicle emissions on roadside ecosystems in GCNP: 1) concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) captured by passive air samplers, 2) natural delta N-15 abundance in the foliage of mature Pinon pine trees and soil N, and 3) concentrations of available inorganic N (NOT and NHS') in soil. Over an eight-month period, N enrichment was assessed at ten sites located across hypothesized gradients of vehicular N deposition based on distance from primary roadways and traffic levels in GCNP. Ogawa passive air samplers indicated that NOx levels were on average 52% higher at roadside locations compared to 30 m away, and were highest at the most heavily trafficked sites in the park. Natural abundance delta N-15 of foliage was significantly higher (F = 16.04, p = 0.007, n = 237) at roadside locations than at 15, and 30 m distances: a pattern that is consistent with local N inputs from vehicle emissions. Available inorganic soil N was significantly higher (F = 3.46, p = 0.013, n = 8) at the South Entrance roadside compared to areas with lower traffic densities. The direct measurement of atmospheric NOx using Ogawa samplers and delta N-15 of Pinon pine needle tissues were the best indicators of roadside N deposition. Our results also suggest that vehicular emissions on the South Rim of GCNP were incorporated in the plant nutrient pools near roadside environments. Although N emissions in GCNP comply with current annual air quality standards as specified by the Clean Air Act, it remains unclear whether the standards are low enough to sustain ecological integrity of native ecological communities along roadsides. Coupled with information on N-pollution tipping points and other ecological indicators, the metrics used here may prove to be a cost effective approach for monitoring roadside N-deposition and informing management decisions.

AB  - Background Previous studies have characterized alopecia in captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) by a mixed partial to complete alopecia in a bilateral symmetric pattern.
   Methods In this study, coat condition assessments were related to exogenous and endogenous factors in captive rhesus macaques under different housing conditions in order to identify disturbances in environmental factors controlling or influencing hair growth. Additionally, the degree of alopecia was investigated in relation to adrenal endocrine function as an indicator of social stress using faecal glucocorticoid measurements.
   Results Hair loss was found to vary with season and sex, was most pronounced in adult females during the winter and spring months. Generally, infants were not affected, but alopecia developed during adolescence. However, the housing system, available enclosure space and variations in group size and composition also appeared to influence coat condition. Levels of immunoreactive cortisol metabolites (11-oxoetiocholanolone) in faeces were significantly negatively correlated with alopecia, suggesting a relationship between hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and hair loss in captive rhesus macaques.
   Conclusions Although the present study demonstrates the influence of the HPA axis on coat condition, it is not known if hair loss is caused by abnormal behaviour or hormonal imbalances of the HPA axis itself. Our data suggest that alopecia in rhesus macaques is a highly complex multicausal disorder.

AB  - The ultimate purpose of this study was to identify broad relationships that may have relevance for the risk assessment of chemicals and materials that are discharged to receiving streams via municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents (e.g., consumer product ingredients). The effects of municipal wastewaters occurring in high population density (>500 persons per square mile, urban) and low population density (<500 persons per square mile, rural) environments were determined via analysis of biological, habitat, and water chemistry data collected both immediately upstream and downstream of 221 WWTPs in Ohio, USA. Several biological and chemistry indicators demonstrated poorer water quality in urban areas compared to rural areas. After considering the effect of river size, adverse effects downstream of WWTPs for both fish and macroinvertebrate communities were clearly identified for only urban areas. These data indicate that WWTP potency may be greater in urban areas compared to rural areas.

AB  - The results are presented for a study of the biotechnological properties of the introduced Moldova variety, which grows in different soil and climatic conditions of the arid territories of Dagestan. Features of the synthesis of the components of carbohydrate, acid, nitrogen, phenolic, amino acid and vitamin complexes have been determined with respect to the cultivation location. It is noted that the Moldova variety can synthesize a large amount of valuable nutrients at a low moisture supply and high indicators of the sum of active temperatures. This variety has demonstrated ecological plasticity and technological versatility, and it has been experimentally proven that high-quality wine materials can be obtained from it for the production of sparkling and original special wines. Thus, the expansion of areas of grape planting in arid conditions is expedient.

AB  - The East River (Dong Jiang), a major tributary of the Pearl River (Zhu Jiang, the second largest river in China by discharge), is situated in southern China, which has the highest rates of urbanization and development on Earth. The East River also provides 80% of Hong Kong's water supply. However, there have been no ecological studies to examine the combined impacts of changes in land use and water quality degradation on this river ecosystem. We tested the hypothesis that land-use disturbance and water quality degradation would significantly reduce benthic biodiversity in the East River by investigating macroinvertebrate community composition and relating it to data on water quality and catchment condition. The percentage of total impervious area within each catchment (%TIA-an indicator of land-use disturbance) was negatively related to a composite water quality index-the ERWQI-we developed for the East River. Modeling by partial least squares projection to latent structures (PLS) showed that family richness and relative abundance index (RAI) of macroinvertebrates were strongly influenced by both %TIA and ERWQI. Multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) tests showed highly significant differences in family richness composition and RAI of macroinvertebrates among sites in the upper, middle, and lower course of the East River. MRPP also revealed differences in the family richness composition of nighttime drift samples between upper and middle site groups. Abundance (individuals m(-3)) and total family richness of drifting macroinvertebrates at each site were positively related to %TIA (range: 1.0-8.5%), while drift biomass was negatively related to dissolved oxygen and positively related to total suspended solids. Thus, human disturbances associated with land-use changes (increasing %TIA) and nutrient inputs severely degraded ecosystem integrity and the water quality of the East River and thereby reduced aquatic biodiversity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the impact of environmental conditions on the antimicrobial properties of 21 lactic acid bacteria strains in the selected indicator bacteria. To assess the antimicrobial activity of the whole bacteria culture (WBC), the agar well diffusion method was used. The interference of LAB strains with the growth of the selected indicator bacteria was evaluated by incubating co-cultures in the food matrix. Based on the conducted research, it was found that environmental conditions have a significant impact on the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria strains. The highest antimicrobial activity was recorded under optimal conditions for the development of LAB, the incubation time being different depending on the indicator strain used. The tested LAB strains were characterized by a high ability to inhibit indicator strains, especially in the food matrix. These results led us to further characterize and purify the antimicrobial compound produced by lactic acid bacteria taking into account changing environmental conditions.</p>

AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the use of continuous stage data to describe the relation between urban development and three aspects of hydrologic condition that are thought to influence stream ecosystems - overall stage variability, stream flashiness, and the duration of extreme-stage conditions. This relation is examined using data from more than 70 watersheds in three contrasting environmental settings - the humid Northeast (the metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts, area); the very humid Southeast (the metropolitan Birmingham, Alabama, area); and the semiarid West (the metropolitan Salt Lake City, Utah, area). Results from the Birmingham and Boston studies provide evidence linking increased urbanization with stream flashiness. Fragmentation of developed land cover patches appears to ameliorate the effects of urbanization on overall variability and flashiness. There was less success in relating urbanization and streamflow conditions in the Salt Lake City study. A related investigation of six North Carolina sites with long term discharge and stage data indicated that hydrologic condition metrics developed using continuous stage data are comparable to flow based metrics, particularly for stream flashiness measures.

AB  - Nutrient pollution and associated eutrophication of freshwaters threaten the ecological integrity and the services provided to humans by lakes. We examined how human residential development influenced the level of lake eutrophication in the Seattle, WA, USA, region. We surveyed 30 lakes and measured 3 indicators of eutrophication: concentrations of chlorophyll-a and phosphorus, and the proportion of algae that are inedible to zooplankton. We classified lakes based on the waste-treatment method for shoreline home: septic, sewer, and undeveloped lakes. Septic lakes occurred along the urban-rural fringe while sewer lakes occurred near urban centers. Septic lakes were more eutrophic than sewer lakes and undeveloped lakes, as indicated by higher levels of phosphorus and chlorophyll-a. These results suggest that septic systems contribute to the high levels of eutrophication in lakes at the urban-rural fringe. Lakes at the urban-rural fringe represent an opportunity for proactive management of urban expansion to minimize lake eutrophication .

AB  - A trail study was conducted in the Sagamatha (Mt. Everest) National Park, Nepal, during 1997-1998. Based on that study, this paper examines the spatial variability of trail conditions and analyzes factors that influence trail conditions. Logistic regression (multinomial logit model) is applied to examine the influence of use and environmental factors on trail conditions. The assessment of trail conditions is based on a four-class rating system: (class I, very little damaged; class II, moderately damaged, class III, heavily damaged; and class IV, severely damaged). Wald statistics and a model classification table have been used for data interpretation. Results indicate that altitude, trail gradient, hazard potential, and vegetation type are positively associated with trail condition. Trails are more degraded at higher altitude, on steep gradients, in areas with natural hazard potential, and within shrub/grassland zones. Strong correlations between high levels of trail degradation and higher frequencies of visitors and lodges were found. A detailed analysis of environmental and use factors could provide valuable information to park managers in their decisions about trail design, layout and maintenance, and efficient and effective visitor management strategies. Comparable studies on high alpine environments are needed to predict precisely the effects of topographic and climatic extremes. More refined approaches and experimental methods are necessary to control the effects of environmental factors.

AB  - We used Translational Asymmetry (TA) of the annual stem, branch growth pattern and fractal dimension to quantify stress during development of argan (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels) throughout its range in Morocco. Under communal grazing conditions known as "mouchaa" (Grazing Management), the branch fractal dimension was reduced and the TA of plants increased, reflecting the stressful conditions in which the argan trees were growing. Under Wild growing conditions, developmental instability increased as moisture decreased across a gradient of aridity. Under Barley Management conditions (barley crops are cultivated underneath of argan), argan increased branch complexity (branch fractal dimension) in the mildest area (Essaouira), which imposed an additional cost that results in increased TA. The results of the study best fit the predictions that the level of asymmetry and fractal dimension reflects stressful conditions, which can be used to monitor the effect of environmental stress in the conservation of argan ecosystem.

AB  - Because deficient dissolved oxygen (DO) levels may have severe detrimental effects on estuarine and marine life, DO has been widely used as an indicator of ecological conditions by environmental monitoring programs. The U.S. EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program for Estuaries (EMAP-E) monitored DO conditions in the estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico from 1991 to 1994. DO was measured in two ways: 1) instantaneous profiles from the surface to the bottom were taken during the day, and 2) continuous measurements were taken near the bottom at 15 min intervals for at least 12 h. This information was summarized to assess the spatial distribution and severity of DO conditions in these estuaries. Depending on the criteria used to define hypoxia (DO concentrations usually < 2 mg L-1 or < 5 mg L-1) and the method by which DO is measured, we estimate that between 5.2 and 29.3% of the total estuarine area in the Louisianian Province was affected by low DO conditions.

AB  - Many older Midwestern cities of the United States are challenged by costly aging water infrastructure while working to revitalize urban areas. These cities developed much of their water infrastructure before the Clean Water Act became law and have struggled to mitigate contaminant loading to surface waters. An increasingly common approach to resolving these challenges is the integration of green infrastructure with gray infrastructure improvements to manage point and non-point source pollution. Stakeholder engagement and collaboration during green infrastructure planning can help address impairments and promote community involvement through the revitalization process. Mill Creek watershed in Cincinnati, OH, USA has seen improvement in watershed integrity indicators after being impaired for many decades by flashy hydrology, combined sewer overflows, and water quality degradation. A workshop was conducted to examine how integrated green and gray infrastructure has contributed to improvements in Mill Creek over the past several decades. This effort sought to examine internal and external factors that influence a multi-stakeholder watershed approach to planning, implementing, and evaluating green infrastructure techniques. Community investment and physical infrastructure, access to datasets, and skills and knowledge exchange were essential in improving use attainment in the Mill Creek. Strategic placement of green infrastructure has the potential to maximize water quality benefits and ecosystem services. However, green infrastructure deployment has been more opportunistic due to the diversity of stakeholder and decision maker interests. Future work should consider collaborative approaches to address scaling challenges and workforce development to maximize green infrastructure benefits.

AB  - 1. Biological traits of organisms are expected to provide increased mechanistic understanding of species-environment relationships. Linking traits to environmental conditions is, however, not straightforward, as traits are interconnected within species and can affect the adaptive value of each other. The aim of our study was to evaluate the importance of these trait interrelationships for understanding environmental responses of freshwater macroinvertebrates.
   2. To this end, we investigated whether environmental responses of macroinvertebrates sharing a given trait were consistent or differed according to their taxonomy or to their other traits. We divided the macroinvertebrates into groups based on single traits (49 single-trait modalities), on taxonomy (10 orders) and on their overall trait profile (10 trait profile groups [TPGs], defined usingself-organising maps clustering). Abundances of each of these 69 groups were related to 24 environmental variables using boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling, to assess the environmental responses of single traits, orders and TPGs.
   3. Cross-validated predictive power (R-2) of the BRT models ranged from < 1% to 38%. Environmental responses of macroinvertebrates sharing a given trait were inconsistent and varied according to order and/or TPG. Single-trait responses often reflected the responses of the most abundant taxonomic group expressing the trait, suggesting that analysis of trait responses simply revealed patterns in habitat use by the most abundant species and not necessarily mechanistic relationships.
   4. Further, taxa from the same TPG (hence showing large overlap in their traits) but belonging to different orders showed different environmental responses. This indicates that the order a taxon belongs to confers unique information related to its evolutionary history that was not captured by our 49 trait modalities. However, groupings by orders cannot replace trait-based approaches, since TPGs also revealed differences in trait profiles within some orders, which were associated with different environmental responses.
   5. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple rather than single traits when linking macroinvertebrates to environmental variables, including the potential information conveyed by evolutionary history.

AB  - The toxic effects associated to pesticides have been for long a concern in terms of environmental and human safety. The recognition of the limitations of numerous, if not all, pesticides in terms of species-specificity, toxicity level, persistency in the environment, influencing its runoff and transport ability, among other characteristics, have been the subject of numerous studies over the years. These have especially focused on the deleterious impacts of such substances in non-target organisms, including potential effects in humans, considering pesticide uptake through the ingestion of contaminated foodstuff. Aquatic ecosystems may be considered the most vulnerable to pesticide contamination, has most toxicants may eventually end up in these systems, if not directly, via indirect inputs. Aquatic communities are, thus, susceptible both to on-point acute contaminations and to exposure to mixtures of different contaminants for longer periods. Impacts of numerous pesticides in non-target aquatic species have been reported and investigated, contributing to the definition of regulations and legislation to prevent harmful effects to the communities. However, in order to assess effectively the effect of different pesticides in organisms, the definition of suitable biomarkers is crucial. As one of the most identifiable effect of pesticides is cell damage induced by oxidative stress, most studies have resorted to the analysis of antioxidant enzymes to assess the impacts of contamination in the organism. Nonetheless, with methodological advances, other molecules have been identified as potentially useful to be used as biomarkers, as fatty acids. These ubiquitous macromolecules in living organisms are major constituents of biological membranes and tissues. Evidence of the impact of xenobiotics on lipid metabolism and composition, as well as the sensitivity of fatty acids profiles to alterations in the homeostasis of organisms, have been arising, supporting the suitability of these macromolecules as biomarkers of toxicants exposure. However, most studies using fatty acids as biomarkers have dwelled mostly on marine ecosystems, disregarding other aquatic systems, as freshwater systems. Given the importance of these systems as providers of numerous services and goods and their role in ecological integrity and support, the present literature review aims to compile and critically review the studies conducted until the present time regarding the use of fatty acids as biomarkers of pesticide exposure assessment in freshwater communities, as well as highlight limitations identified and propose future research.

AB  - This study investigated the response patterns of aboveground macrofungal communities to different management stages representing a forest conversion from Norway spruce (Picea aisles) to European beech (Fagus sylvatica) in the Eifel National Park, Germany. We used a space-for-time substitution approach with three replicate study sites for each forest conversion stage: (I) even-aged single species Norway spruce, (II) unmanaged Norway spruce windthrow, (III) salvage-logged Norway spruce windthrow, (IV) single Norway spruce tree selection cutting (close-to-nature managed) with European beech underplanting and (V) old-growth, uneven-aged European beech (as reference). We assessed environmental variables and macrofungal sporocarps, while the latter were categorized into functional groups to link taxonomic information to potential ecosystem functions.
   Overall, we observed 235 macrofungal species. The highest species richness was found in the European beech reference stage, followed by the close-to-nature managed spruce/beech stage, while the Norway spruce stage showed approximately half the species richness, similar to the species level of both windthrow stages. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination separated each forest conversion stage into distinct fungal communities, while both windthrow stages could not be distinguished from each other. Beside tree species composition change and forest management, nutrient availability and microclimate were the main drivers of fungal community changes among the five differently-managed stages. Further, different functional groups responded in different patterns to forest management and to explanatory environmental variables.
   We reinforced the assumption, that old-growth, uneven-aged European beech forests ( > 120 years) can act as a refugium for unique forest type specific fungal communities with a higher functional structure, especially contrary to non-native, even-aged Norway spruce forests (similar to 70 years). Single Norway spruce tree selection cutting with further introduction of European beech trees can be an adequate strategy to allow a spruce forest conversion without necessarily reducing the macrofungal species richness and its functional structure. We displayed that ecological consequences of windthrow events can be a depression of fungal species richness and a collapse for the functional structure of fungi, especially after salvage logging. Our study underlines the need of including fungal conservation in forest conversion plans to optimize forest ecosystem integrity and resilience against biotic and abiotic agents, such as windstorm events.

This study proposed a sustainability performance indicator model (SPIM) to implement the sustainable performance control of projects, and the results are examined through the case study of a constructed wetland. The results indicated that projects using the SPIM have higher integrity and implementation effectiveness, verifying that the SPIM is capable of facilitating the sustainable performance of constructed wetland projects.

AB  - This study is the result of many years of research on the ecology of the marine benthos of Russian Arctic seas. We used samples collected at various locations from the Russian continental shelf during 1993-2009 as the basis of our study. Our main aim was to analyze the spatial distribution of taxonomic and quantitative characteristics of the meiobenthos (small bottom-dwelling animals, mm in size). Statistical analysis of the data revealed that the factors determining the spatial distribution of meiobenthic organisms under natural conditions, and conditions impacted upon by human activity, were salinity, water depth, hydrocarbons, heavy metals and radiocaesium volumetric activity. The possible use of the meiobenthos as a tool for environmental impact assessment is proposed and discussed on the level of higher taxa. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

AB  - Modern artifact replicas represent a definite challenge to the integrity of archaeological collections and their value to scientific study. Effective authentication analysis is necessary to preclude these artifacts. Natural artifact post-depositional surface modification is an indicator of antiquity and of vital importance to such analyses. Surface modification of major value is the authigenic precipitation/deposition of pedogenic minerals. Because of their ubiquitous presence in soils, and their stability when oxidized, the iron oxides/hydroxides are of special value with other minerals playing a supportive role. Features of the minerals and deposits most frequently encountered on artifact surfaces are addressed.

T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH

AB  - The pressure-state-response framework is a powerful approach to environmental assessment. In many of its current expressions, however, it ignores the background natural processes that play a major role in determining environmental and ecosystem health. Clearly, policies must be focused on human actions that scar the landscape and harm the environment, but coping with environmental change also requires an assessment of the natural processes that take place whether or not human influences are at work. A newly-developed class of environmental indicators (geoindicators), presented here in brief, may be helpful in understanding the interaction of human and natural processes and impacts. Explicit recognition of the need to include natural conditions in the indicator system is essential in the transition from environmental reporting to sustainability reporting.

AB  - Biological monitoring refers to the use of living organisms to evaluate environmental conditions. Of particular relevance to the health of marine ecosystems is the improvement of methodologies of biological monitoring to provide highly ecologically sensitive indices of exposure. We have shown that anisakid nematodes, a parasite group widely distributed in oceans that infects a wide range of host species, can accumulate essential and non-essential metals to levels far in excess of their host tissues. The fact that they could be used as biomarkers of trace-metal contamination in studies of environmental impact suggests a potential use as a monitor species in a marine ecosystem under anthropogenic stress because they might produce a warning or alert signal of high ecological relevance.

AB  - Land management, the organisation of the use and development of land, is an important instrument for addressing problems of rising greenhouse gas emissions and loss of natural resources. Yet, natural-social systems in which land management policies are implemented are poorly understood, thus decreasing the effectiveness of these policies. Local studies provide valuable insights, though only for the local conditions prevalent during the investigated period. Synthesising local studies in order to generalise results is impaired by the variety of local conditions. Collaborative research programmes may prevent some of these problems. They support the share of insights across temporal, ecological and spatial-economic contexts. On the basis of existing literature, we identify the challenges which face synthesis and demonstrate how a German research programme attempts to address some of them.

AB  - Reduced impact logging (RIL) systems are currently being promoted in Brazil and other tropical countries in response to domestic and international concern over the ecological and economic sustainability of harvesting natural tropical forests. RIL systems are necessary, but not sufficient, for sustainable forest management because they reduce damage to the forest ecosystem during the initial forest entry. If conditions were identified where RIL costs were clearly less than conventional logging (CL) costs, then a strong incentive for RIL adoption would exist.
   In this paper, a comparison of costs and revenues was made for typical RIL and CL operations in the eastern Amazon. An economic engineering approach was used to estimate standardized productivity and cost parameters. Detailed data on productivity, harvest volume, wasted wood and damage to the residual stand were collected from operational scale harvest blocks. Productivity and cost data were also collected using surveys of forest products firms.
   The major conclusion of the study was that RIL was less costly, and more profitable, than CL under the conditions observed at the eastern Amazon study site. Full cost accounting methods were introduced to capture the direct and indirect costs associated with wasted wood. The impact of wasted wood on effective stumpage price provided the largest gain to RIL. Large gains attributable to RIL technology were also observed in skidding and log deck productivity. In addition, investment in RIL yielded an "environmental dividend" in terms of reduced damage to trees in the residual stand and reduction of the amount of ground area disturbed by heavy machinery. Developing institutions that can monetize the value of the environmental dividend remains a major challenge in the promotion of sustainable forest management in the tropics.

We focus first on the degradation of this assimilative capacity triggered by pollution excesses and determine the intertemporal efficient pollution path, taking into account this ecological feedback. our analysis shows that a minimum level of initial assimilative capacity is necessary to prevent its optimal extinction. We then allow for the restoration of assimilative capacity and characterize the conditions under which this option frees the optimal policy from the dependency on the initial conditions. In both cases our results call for environmental standards based on the shadow price of assimilative capacity that are stricter than the static optimum commonly used in flow pollution control.

TI  - THE ROLE OF BIOINDICATORS IN ESTUARINE MANAGEMENT
T2  - ESTUARIES
LA  - English
AB  - Estuarine organisms can be considered three ways as bioindicators-first, as indicators of a defined set of environmental conditions, second, as indicators of contaminant loads on the system, and third, as indicators of the overall health of the system. By their very nature, estuarine organisms are eurytolerant and this, along with the various stratagems that have evolved to cope with the problems of life in estuaries results in a confusing picture for the estuarine manager. The recommended bioindicators for estuarine conditions are plankton; for contaminant loads, a range of species with different feeding types; and for system status, a eurytolerant species, such as the mussel Mytilus edulis for laboratory monitoring or a ''target'' species such as the clam Macoma balthica for field monitoring. However, it would be unwise to rely on a single indicator, and the recommendation is that the final choice, and preferably choices, be tailored to the desired goal.

AB  - Recently, many studies focus on the ingestion of microplastics by marine biota. Fish exploit almost every kind of marine environment, occupy many ecological niches and are an important food source for human populations worldwide. For these reasons, they seem to represent very appropriate biological indicators of microplastic ingestion. UNEP/MAP SPA/RAC (2018) identified the bogue, Boops boops (Linnaeus, 1758), as a possible target species for monitoring microplastic ingestion in fish populations. This study provides the first report of microplastic ingestion by B. boops from the Tyrrhenian and the Ligurian Seas (Western Mediterranean Sea). Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to analyse the relationship among biological parameters and environmental factors. A total of 379 bogues were collected in three Italian regions, subject to different anthropogenic pressures (river input, human population, shipping lanes and distance from the coast). Microplastics were detected in the gastrointestinal tract of most individuals (56%) with a mean of 1.8 (+/- 0.2) microplastics per individual. Our study further confirms that this species is able to highlight differences in the ingestion of microplastics according to local anthropization, resulting Latium region to be the most polluted. Fish with lower physical condition are more likely to ingest microplastics, suggesting a relationship with the level of local environmental contamination. Finally, the ingestion of microplastics might be influenced by behavioural differences between sexes. According to our results, males ingest significantly more microplastics than females (p < 0.05). Our research confirms that an extensive knowledge on the biology of a bioindicator species is a priority for developing a valid monitoring strategy, such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive for European waters.

AB  - Environmental indicators have been developed widely to promote biodiversity conservation, ecological restoration, and nature resource management from local to global scales. Ecoregions are effective tools for global conservation of plant diversity, and soil conditions can affect the plant diversity within ecoregions. Hence, soil indicators of plant diversity have substantial potential as tools for effectively understanding global ecoregions. Here, we used plant diversity data from 361 ecoregions and seven soil variables in a regression analysis to explore the relationships between soil and ecoregional plant diversity (EPD). We found that soil means and heterogeneity were significantly related to EPD. EPD decreased curvilinearly as both mean cation exchange capacity and mean soil pH increased, while mean soil organic carbon stock was negatively related to EPD (P < 0.05). EPD increased curvilinearly with mean soil texture clay fraction and mean soil texture silt fraction (P < 0.05). Heterogeneity of bulk density, cation exchange capacity, and soil pH had positive relationships with EPD (P<0.05). EPD had a negative, unimodal response to soil organic carbon stock heterogeneity, with an opposite trend in heterogeneity of soil texture clay fraction (P< 0.05). Furthermore, such relationships may depend on the vulnerability of ecoregions of interest. Specially, means of soil texture clay fraction and heterogeneity of bulk density were useful indicators of EPD for relatively stable or intact and vulnerable ecoregions (P <0.05), and mean cation exchange capacity and heterogeneity of soil organic carbon stock were useful indicators of EPD in critical or endangered ecoregions (P < 0.05). Hence, monitoring soil conditions should be conducted for plant diversity at broad scales, and conservation efforts should focus on soil diversity, with a particular emphasis on relatively stable or intact ecoregions worldwide.

AB  - The Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) has been intensely developed for industrial bitumen extraction and upgrading since the 1980s. A paucity of environmental monitoring prior to development raises questions about baseline conditions in freshwater systems in the region and ecological responses to industrial activities. Further, climatic changes prompt questions about the relative roles of climate and industry in shaping aquatic ecosystemsthrough time. We use aquatic bioindicators frommultiple trophic levels, concentrations of petrogenic contaminants (dibenzothiophenes), and spectrally-inferred chlorophyll-a preserved in well-dated sediments of a closed-basin, shallow lake similar to 50 km away from the main area of industry, in conjunction with climate observations, to assess how the biotic assemblages of a typical AOSR lake have changed during the past similar to 75 years. We examine the contributions of the area's stressors in structuring aquatic communities. Increases in sedimentary measures of petrogenic contaminants provide clear evidence of aerial contaminant deposition fromlocal industry since its establishment, while climate records demonstrate consistent warming and a recent period of reduced precipitation. Quantitative comparisons of biological assemblages from before and after the establishment of regional industry find significant ( p < 0.05) differences; however, the magnitude and overall timing of the changes are not consistent with a threshold-type shift in response to the onset of regional industry. Rather, biotic assemblages from multiple trophic levels suggest transitions to an increasingly complex benthic environment and relatively warmer waters, which, like the increasing trends in inferred primary production, are consistent with a changing climate. These findings highlight the important role of climate conditions in regulating primary production and structuring aquatic communities in these shallow systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The investigation of submerged aquatic macrophytes in their natural habitat using metabolic fingerprinting may represent a comprehensive and sensitive approach in environmental sciences. The potential of metabolic fingerprinting for discriminating Myriophyllum spicatum individuals growing in different lakes under varying environmental conditions was explored to determine its applicability in an ecological context. Low molecular weight compounds from hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts of leaves from individual plants were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with subsequent data preprocessing of the mass-to-charge fragments of metabolites using XCMS. Multivariate analysis was used to compare the metabolite composition of the plants in space and time at a fingerprint level. The technical variation in the signals was low compared with the biological variation between individuals. Variation of the metabolite composition of aquatic macrophytes retrieved at one site at a particular time was within the same range as described for algae and plants grown under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Thus, metabolic fingerprinting of M. spicatum growing in the field is reproducible and biological responses can be detected. As a "proof-of-principle", the approach was applied to study individuals from two lake populations, as well as one population over a three week flowering period. Distinct metabolic fingerprints were found for the individuals from two lakes and were shown to be associated with the nutrient status of these lakes. For the population characterized overtime, metabolic fingerprints of individuals seem to be related to their state of ontogenetic development. These results suggest that the lake water chemistry is reflected in the metabolite composition of the submerged macrophytes and that developmental changes may lead to metabolic alterations. We consider metabolic fingerprinting to be suitable for studying physiological processes of aquatic macrophytes in their habitat and potentially applicable for environmental monitoring.

AB  - A 72-lake diatom training set was developed for the Irish Ecoregion to examine the response of surface sediment diatom assemblages to measured environmental variables. A variety of multivariate data analyses was used to investigate environmental and biological data structure and their inter-relationships. Of the variables used in determining a typology for lakes in the Irish Ecoregion, alkalinity was the only one found to have a significant effect on diatom assemblages. A total of 602 diatom taxa were identified, with 233 recorded at three or more sites with abundances >= 1%. Generally diatom data displayed a high degree of heterogeneity at the species level and non-linear ecological responses. Both pH and total phosphorus (TP) (in the ranges of 5.1-8.5 and 4.0-142.3 mu g l(-1) respectively) were shown to be the most significant variables in determining the surface sediment diatom assemblages. The calibration models for pH and TP were developed using the weighted averaging (WA) method; data manipulation showed strong influences on model performances. The optima WA models based on 70 lakes produced a jack-knifed coefficient of determination (r(jack)(2)) of 0.89 with a root mean squared error (RMSEP) of 0.32 for pH and r(jack)(2) of 0.74 and RMSEP of 0.21 (log(10) mu g l(-1)) for TP. Both models showed strong performances in comparison with existing models for Ireland and elsewhere. Application of the pH and TP transfer functions developed here will enable the generation of quantitative water quality data from the expanding number of palaeolimnological records available for the Irish Ecoregion, and thus facilitate the use of palaeolimnological approaches in the reconstruction of past lake water quality, ecological assessment and restoration.

AB  - In The Netherlands several models have been constructed over the last decade facilitating prediction of the occurrence of plant species or vegetation types in relation to hydrological or hydrogeochemical habitat conditions. This paper compares six correlative ecohydrological models: NTM, DEMNAT, MOVE, HYVEG, ICHORS, and ITORS on the basis of the properties, possibilities and constraints of different model concepts. The models were developed for different purposes so that the suitability of the model concepts depends on the areas for which they were constructed and the aim of the user. Major differences between the models are: the expert knowledge and field measurements required, the scale level, ecosystem and habitat conditions for which prediction is made, and the number of input variables. The latter also causes different opportunities of connection with input models. Without comparable validations it was impossible to mark the most appropriate predicting model. The suitability of the model concepts in other areas is illustrated by means of a selection of the most suitable model for the Prairie Pothole area (North America) and for the catchment area of the river Dommel (Belgium/The Netherlands). The development of a set of ecohydrological modules, containing causal relationships combined with expert knowledge and empirical-statistical based black box relationships, between plant species and habitat conditions, is considered a major need in future ecohydrological modelling.

AB  - Extensive agricultural and urban development has contributed to the decline of riparian forests across North America. An urban-rural gradient was used to identify species- and guild-level indicators of riparian forest degradation in southern Manitoba. Twenty-five sites were categorized according to urban, suburban, high-intensity rural, low-intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference land use. Generalists, which frequented all land use types, dominated (69%) the understorey community, whereas opportunistic (15%) and vulnerable (16%) species were relatively less common. Opportunistic species, which characterized city sites, tended to be exotic, woody and annual, and effective dispersers (i.e., endozoochores). In contrast, vulnerable species, which characterized non-city sites, tended to be native, perennial, and ineffective dispersers (i.e., barochores or anemochores). Indicators of disturbed forests were opportunistic and positively associated with disturbance measures including connectivity and cover of garbage, and negatively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included exotics Solanum dulcamara, Rhamnus cathartica, and Lonicera tartarica. In contrast, indicators of high-integrity forest were vulnerable, often excluded from urban sites and were negatively associated with disturbance measures and positively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included natives Rubus idaeus, Carex spp., and Galium triflorum. Our results suggest that opportunistic and vulnerable species, and their associated guilds, can be used as effective indicators of disturbance and forest integrity and to identify forest patches that warrant further protection or restoration.

AB  - Because of the continued development and production of a variety of nanomaterials and nanoparticles, their uptake and effects on the biota of marine ecosystems must be investigated. Filter feeding bivalve molluscs are highly adapted for capturing particles from the external environment and readily internalize nano- and micro-sized particles through endocytosis, so they are commonly used as valuable indicator species for nanoparticle studies. In these studies, adult eastetn oysters, Crassostrea virginica, were exposed to a range of titanium dioxide nanoparticle (TiO2-NP) concentrations (5, 50, 500, and 5000 mu g/L) in conjunction with natural sunlight. Isolated hepatopancreas tissues were also exposed to the same TiO2-NP concentrations using particles exposed to similar light and dark conditions. Dose-dependent decreases in lysosomal stability were observed in the adult oyster studies as well as in the isolated tissues, at exposures as low as 50 mu g/L. Titanium accumulation in isolated hepatopancreas tissue studies was directly correlated to lysosomal destabilization. Based on measurements of lipid peroxidation as an indicator of oxidative stress, TiO2-NPs toxicity was not related to increased ROS production over the short-term course of these exposures. Analysis of particle size using dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that concentration had a significant impact on agglomeration rates, and the small agglomerates as well as individual particles are readily processed by oysters. Overall, this study illustrates that low concentrations of TiO2-NPs may cause sublethal toxicity on oysters, which might be enhanced under natural sunlight conditions. In estuarine environments, where these nanomaterials are likely to accumulate, agglomeration rates, interaction with organics, and responses to sunlight are critical in determining the extent of their bioreactivity and biological impacts.

AB  - 1. Reservoir creation and management can enhance many ecological services provided by freshwater ecosystems, but may alter the natural conditions to which aquatic biota have adapted. Benthic macroinvertebrates often reflect environmental conditions, and this community may be particularly susceptible to water-level changes that alter sediment exposure, temperature regime, wave-induced sediment redistribution and basal productivity.
   2. Using a before-after control-impact experimental design, we assessed changes in macroinvertebrate community structure corresponding with changes in water-level management in two lentic systems in the Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, U. S. A. Littoral zone (depths 1-5 m) benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were sampled in Rainy Lake (control system) and Namakan Reservoir (impact system) in 1984-85, and again in 2004-05 following a change in water-level management that began in January 2000. The new regime reduced the magnitude of winter drawdown in Namakan Reservoir from 2.5 to 1.5 m, and allowed the reservoir to fill to capacity in late May, a month earlier than under the prior regime. Rainy Lake water levels were not altered substantially.
   3. We found changes in macroinvertebrate community structure in Namakan Reservoir relative to Rainy Lake at 1-2 m depths but not at 3-5 m depths. These shallower depths would have been most directly affected by changes in sediment exposure and ice formation.
   4. In 2004-05, Namakan Reservoir benthos showed lower overall abundance, more large-bodied taxa and an increase in non-insect invertebrates relative to 1984-85, without corresponding changes in Rainy Lake.
   5. Changes in the benthic community in Namakan may reflect cooler water in spring and early summer as well as lower resource availability (both autochthonous production and allochthonous inputs) under the new regime.

AB  - We sampled soils at three sites, located in the Pavia Province (northern Italy), under different agricultural practices, named "biological", "sewage" and "manure". The aim of this study was to evaluate the soil health using nematode communities as bioindicators. The community of the biological-managed site community had the highest taxonomic and trophic diversity and maturity. The food web was fairly good structured and this site was in better conditions in comparison with the others. The sewage-managed site had the highest enrichment condition, but the lowest nematode density. Finally, the community of the manure-managed site was the worst and the least diversified and structured, being dominated by plant feeders, especially by the genus Para-tylenchus, whose high density can be related to ecological degradation.

AB  - Watershed health, including the natural environment, hydrology, water quality, and aquatic ecology, is assessed for the Han River basin (34 148 km(2)) in South Korea by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The evaluation procedures follow those of the Healthy Watersheds Assessment by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Six components of the watershed landscape are examined to evaluate the watershed health (basin natural capacity): stream geomorphology, hydrology, water quality, aquatic habitat condition, and biological condition. In particular, the SWAT is applied to the study basin for the hydrology and water-quality components, including 237 sub-watersheds (within a standard watershed on the Korea Hydrologic Unit Map) along with three multipurpose dams, one hydroelectric dam, and three multifunction weirs. The SWAT is calibrated (2005-2009) and validated (2010-2014) by using each dam and weir operation, the flux-tower evapotranspiration, the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture, and groundwater-level data for the hydrology assessment, and by using sediment, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen data for the water-quality assessment. The water balance, which considers the surface-groundwater interactions and variations in the stream-water quality, is quantified according to the sub-watershed-scale relationship between the watershed hydrologic cycle and stream-water quality. We assess the integrated watershed health according to the U.S. EPA evaluation process based on the vulnerability levels of the natural environment, water resources, water quality, and ecosystem components. The results indicate that the watershed's health declined during the most recent 10-year period of 2005-2014, as indicated by the worse results for the surface process metric and soil water dynamics compared to those of the 1995-2004 period. The integrated watershed health tended to decrease farther downstream within the watershed.

AB  - Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) are the primary elements involved in the growth and development of plants. The C:N ratio is an indicator of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and an input parameter for some ecological and ecosystem models. However, knowledge remains limited about the convergent or divergent variation in the C:N ratios among different plant organs (e.g., leaf, branch, trunk, and root) and how evolution and environment affect the coefficient shifts. Using systematic measurements of the leaf-branch-trunk-root of 2,139 species from tropical to cold-temperate forests, we comprehensively evaluated variation in C:N ratio in different organs in different taxa and forest types. The ratios showed convergence in the direction of change but divergence in the rate of change. Plants evolved toward lower C:N ratios in the leaf and branch, with N playing a more important role than C. The C:N ratio of plant organs (except for the leaf) was constrained by phylogeny, but not strongly. Both the change of C:N during evolution and its spatial variation (lower C:N ratio at midlatitudes) help develop the adaptive growth hypothesis. That is, plants with a higher C:N ratio promote NUE under strong N-limited conditions to ensure survival priority, whereas plants with a lower C:N ratio under less N-limited environments benefit growth priority. In nature, larger proportion of species with a high C:N ratio enabled communities to inhabit more N-limited conditions. Our results provide new insights on the evolution and drivers of C:N ratio among different plant organs, as well as provide a quantitative basis to optimize land surface process models.

AB  - It is necessary to minimize the environmental impact and utilize natural resources in a sustainable and efficient manner in the early design stage of developing an environmentally-conscious design for a heating, ventilating and air-conditioning system. Energy supply options play a significant role in the total environmental load of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems. To assess the environmental impact of different energy options, a new method based on Emergy Analysis is proposed. Emergy Accounting, was first developed and widely used in the area of ecological engineering, but this is the first time it has been used in building service engineering. The environmental impacts due to the energy options are divided into four categories under the Emergy Framework: the depletion of natural resources, the greenhouse effect (carbon dioxide equivalents), the chemical rain effect (sulfur dioxide equivalents), and anthropogenic heat release. The depletion of non-renewable natural resources is indicated by the Environmental Load Ratio, and the environmental carrying capacity is developed to represent the environmental service to dilute the pollutants and anthropogenic heat released. This Emergy evaluation method provides a new way to integrate different environmental impacts under the same framework and thus facilitates better system choices. A case study of six different kinds of energy options consisting of renewable and non-renewable energy was performed by using Emergy Theory, and thus their relative environmental impacts were compared. The results show that the method of electricity generation in energy sources, especially for electricity-powered systems, is the most important factor to determine their overall environmental performance. The direct-fired lithium-bromide absorption type consumes more non-renewable energy, and contributes more to the urban heat island effect compared with other options having the same electricity supply. Using Emergy Analysis, designers and clients can make better-informed, environmentally-conscious selections of heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban river valleys are exposed to strong anthropogenic pressure, but despite these distortions they provide important habitats in urban areas. Not embanked forests are particularly valuable in urban river valleys as they represent fragments of natural vegetation in a highly changed environment. The study assesses the flora and structure of forest communities in a riparian urban forest complex that is under the direct influence of river water. Las Pilczycki Forest in Wroclaw (SW Poland) is such a riparian forest island. We analysed the species richness and composition in terms of the phytocoenoses variability and their syntaxonomic classification. We also investigated if the vegetation can indicate a spatial differentiation in habitat conditions. Floristic and phyto-sociological data were collected from 70 circular plots (100 m(2) each) located in a grid. A total of 81 species were recorded, with a mean of 21 species per plot. Most frequent were: Acer campestre, Acer platanoides, Anemone nemorosa, Ficaria verna, Fraxinus excelsior, Galium aparine, Geum urbanum, Impatiens parviflora and Sambucus nigra. In biological spectrum the most numerous were hemi-cryptophytes, megaphanerophytes and geophytes. The number of alien species was minor (9% of the flora). The most frequent anthropophyte was Impatiens parviflora. Soil moisture, acidity and fertility indices exhibited spatial correlations and they were higher in the western part of the forest. The moisture index was also higher in the northern part. Species richness ranged from 13 to 32 (with a mean of 21 species). Two forms of Ficario-Ulmetum minoris were identified: with Galanthus nivalis and with Tilia cordata. The first was a well-structured riparian community, while the latter one represented the drained floodplain forest. Vegetation units are spatially separated, in the western part of the forest prevails form with Galanthus nivalis, while in the east with Tilia cordata. In isolated alluvial forests of urban area local site conditions are crucial for the vegetation patches, because of the distortion of river valleys. The absence of flood embankments is not a sufficient condition for maintaining proper structure of riparian forests.

AB  - Research on chydorid (Crustacea: Cladocera: Chydoridae) reproduction is scarce and very little is known about the dynamics of parthenogenetic (asexual) and gamogenetic (sexual) reproduction modes in these cyclical parthenogens. The paleolimnological approach has a lot to offer to this research since chydorid carapaces (indicative of asexual reproduction) and ephippia (indicative of sexual reproduction) are identifiable in lake sediments. In the current study, we examined historical changes in chydorid reproduction patterns in an Austrian Alpine lake with the objective to explore reproductive shifts under limnological variability and with the hypothesis that sexual reproduction intensifies under unfavourable environmental conditions. For this, we utilised subfossil remains from a sediment sequence covering the past similar to 300 years in a high Alpine lake, lake Oberer Landschitzsee. The results suggested that in-lake processes likely changed as a response to post-Little Ice Age (LIA) climate warming. Indeed, the benthic quality - indicated by the chironomid-based benthic quality index (BQI) - deteriorated, and the productivity - indicated by organic matter in the sediment - increased. The chydorid community exhibited dramatic shifts in the post-LIA section of the core, around 1850-1950 AD, when the two dominant species Alona (A.) affinis and A. quadrangularis were outcompeted by Acroperus harpae, Alonella excisa, and Chydorus (C.) sphaericus-type and their reproduction gradually shifted towards the dominance of sexual reproduction. The community shift and prevalence of sexual reproduction coincided with the period of unfavourable limnological conditions, evidenced by low BQI values and higher organic content. Therefore, we suggest that the intensified sexual reproduction was a local response to deteriorated benthic conditions and a vigorous adaptive mechanism to ensure successful diapause and genetic variability under environmental change. The results give reason to suggest that fossil chydorid assemblages and ephippia indicate the ecological quality of lake ecosystems and, thus, they can be used as additional proxies in future assessments of the lake ecological status.

It happens due to many indicators, including the assessment of specially protected natural territories. The author's opinion is associated with the assessment of tourism activities at these sites and consideration of the value of regulating ecosystem territories' services. The objectives of the study are the identification of approaches and assessment of protected areas; selection of "profitable" ecosystem services in regional protected areas; and submission of proposals for the effective usage of these territories. The calculation involves a combination of two methods: assessment of the gross value added of tourist destinations in protected areas and the value of regulatory ecosystem services. Tourism efficiency from the position of creating value chains destinations reflects the rate of gross value added, which is calculated as the difference between the proceeds from sales of tourist services entities and their material costs. To determine the economic value of regulatory services, the methods of market indirect assessment and compensation costs were used. During the calculation of ecosystem services, we selected those with beneficiaries located in the region. Increasing efficiency of facilities requires conditions for the development of recreation and new activities. These conditions are shown in the strengthening of interaction between administrations of protected areas with service companies that provide a quality factor of infrastructure, availability of facilities and food services. The economic contribution of specially protected natural areas from the usage of regulating ecosystem services and tourist and recreational activities amounted to 20.4 billion rubles, or 3.2% of gross regional product, in 2018. The proposed approach allows us to show the socio-economic and environmental contribution of specially protected natural areas to the economy of the Komi Republic.

AB  - Duckweeds, as a group, are important early warning indicators for the assessment of contaminated ecosystems due to their propensity to accumulate pollutants. In the present study, we investigated the potential use of Lemna gibba L (Lemnaceae) as an ecological indicator for boron (B) mine effluent containing B concentration above 10 mg l(-1). For this purpose, L gibba fronds were grown for 7 days in simulated water contaminated with B mine effluent. The important note is that this study was carried out in Kirka (Eskisehir, Turkey) B reserve area, which is the largest borax reserve in all over the world, under natural climatic conditions in the field. The results demonstrated that accumulations of B by L. gibba gradually increased based on the initial B concentrations (10, 25, 50,100, and 150 mg l(-1)) of the mine effluent. B concentration in the dry weight of the plant reached 639 mg kg(-1) when the minimum initial dosage (10 mg l(-1)) was applied and 2711 mg kg(-1) when the maximum initial dosage (150 mg l(-1)) was applied during the study. However, significant reductions in their relative growth rates occurred in 50, 100 and 150 mg l(-1) initial B concentrations. Results suggest that 25 mg l(-1) B concentration in water seemed to be a sensitive endpoint for L. gibba that could be used as a critical bioindicator level of B contaminated water. Following our data, we also constructed a simple growth model under the climatic conditions in this region of Turkey, but in instructive as a worldwide model. L gibba is, therefore, suggested to be able to use as both an indicator and a phytoremediation tool because of its high accumulation capacity for B contaminated water. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mixed cropping might be seen as an alternative to monocultures by better protecting biodiversity and improving ecosystem services and resources. In the presented study, we tested the genetic and ecological effects of pure and mixed propagation of different poplar hybrids planted together with black locust trees. Poplar (Populus) hybrids are widely used for bioenergy in monoculture systems due to their rapid and high biomass production. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) is a species with the ability to fix nitrogen and seen as a promising candidate for mixed cultivation. Eight different poplar hybrids and black locust trees from three provenances planted in two study sites with different environmental conditions were tested in varying combinations in pure and mixed stands to observe effects of the different hybrids and genotypes, site conditions and the mixed growing on the performance of poplar and its gene expression. Transcriptome analyses of leaves from four poplar clones selected according to their divergent growth performance were conducted to study differential gene expression that can be an important indicator of differences in growing conditions and success. Differences in gene expression were most pronounced among hybrids and different genotypes of the same hybrid, followed by the study site influence, and were least pronounced between mixed and pure stands. The genotypes of the same hybrid were clearly separated from each other. Clear separation between the study sites for all clones was also observed. Only a few genes were differently expressed in pure vs. mixed stand comparisons for each clone, but there were no common genes that were differently expressed in pure vs. mixed stands in all clones. In total, 199 genes showed differential expression between the study sites regardless of poplar clone or type of stands. The analysis suggested that plant genotypes and environmental conditions were more important at the early stage of stand development than pure or mixed cultivation.

AB  - Aim Biogeographers have long known that plant species do not fully encompass their fundamental niche. Nonetheless, in practice, species distribution modelling assumes that plant distributions represent a reasonable approximation of their environmental tolerance. For ecological forecasting, projections of habitat loss due to climate change assume that many species will be unable to tolerate climate conditions outside of those found within their current distributional ranges. We aim to test how well occurrences in the native range approximate the climatic conditions in which plant species can survive.
   Location Continental USA.
   Methods We compared the climatic conditions between occurrences in the US native versus US non-native ranges using 144 non-invasive plant species. We quantified differences in January minimum temperature, July maximum temperature and annual precipitation as indicators of climatic tolerance. We also compared modelled potential distributions throughout the US based on native and total ranges to test how expanded climatic tolerance translates into predicted geographical range.
   Results Most species (86%) had non-native occurrences in climates outside those described by their native distributions. For the 80 species with lower minimum temperatures at non-native occurrences, the median expansion of minimum temperature tolerance was -2.9 degrees C. Similarly, for the 90 species with lower precipitation at non-native occurrences, the median expansion of minimum annual precipitation was -23 cm. Broader climatic conditions at non-native occurrences expanded the modelled potential geographical range by a median of 35%, with smaller range species showing larger expansions of potential geographical range.
   Main conclusions Our results show that plants' native ranges strongly underestimate climatic tolerance, leading species distribution models to underpredict potential range. The climatic tolerance of species with narrow native ranges appears most prone to underestimation. These findings suggest that many plants will be able to persist in situ with climate change for far longer than projected by species distribution models.

AB  - Dryland rivers in arid and semi-arid regions drain approximately one-third of the Earth's land area, yet basic aspects of their ecology are poorly documented and many are threatened by excessive water use leading to alterations of the flow regime. Management of dryland rivers imperilled by changes to the flow regime requires quantitative hydro-ecological relationships and models to support environmental flow restoration strategies and to define ecological response indicators for assessment of trends in ecological health. Fish living in dryland rivers experience highly variable levels of food resources associated with boom and bust' productivity patterns driven by highly irregular episodes of rainfall, runoff and floodplain inundation followed by busts associated with drying of remnant aquatic habitats. To cope with variable food resource levels, fish store energy as fat during productivity booms, enabling them to breed later or to survive through extended periods of limited food resources. This study tracked temporal patterns of body condition and recruitment success of the four most abundant fish species in two Australian dryland river systems with contrasting patterns of flow variability, Cooper Creek and the Moonie River. We found consistent responses to flow magnitude and timing for body condition and/or recruitment success in Cooper Creek but fewer responses in the Moonie River. Results suggest that the fish metrics and relationships to flow established for Cooper Creek may apply in similar dryland rivers exhibiting clear boom and bust patterns, whereas the Moonie River results could be applicable to rivers with less variable flow patterns and fewer spells of zero flows. Our study demonstrates that simple, non-destructive methods based on fish length and weight provide useful biological indicators of response to flow variability provided that care is taken with species selection and that hydro-ecological relationships are calibrated for each contrasting type of hydrologic regime.

AB  - The MesoHABSIM simulation model was developed in 2000 as an enhancement of the habitat descriptions used in the physical habitat simulation model (PHABSIM). MesoHABSIM integrates system-scale assessment of ecological integrity in flowing waters with quantitative information on physical habitat distribution to simulate habitat changes at the watershed scale. The goal was better integration of physical habitat models into river management by 'upscaling' to address issues relevant at management levels. This paper describes the most updated version of the MesoHABSIM approach resulting from the experience gained during the application of the model in projects since 2000.

AB  - Questions: Which are the main sub-alpine and alpine grassland communities in the northeastern Greater Caucasus of Azerbaijan and what are their environmental and anthropogenic drivers?
   Location: Grasslands at 1800 and 3500 m a.s.l. on northern macroslope of the Greater Caucasus in Azerbaijan near Shahdag Mt.
   Methods: We established a randomized sampling design with stratification by geomorphology and altitude and validation using remote sensing data. The vegetation survey on 194 releves in a nested plot design of up to 100 m(2) encompassed examiniation of various site conditions. We applied cluster and indicator species analysis for vegetation classification, and indirect multivariate ordination to assess vegetation-environment relationships.
   Results: We classified 13 unranked communities in two sub-alpine groups and one alpine group, plus the very distinct vegetation around camp sites of semi-nomadic herders. Important drivers for vegetation differentiation are altitude as proxy for temperature, latitude as proxy for orographically founded differences in bedrock and precipitation, aspect, soil factors, such as content of organic matter and variables connected to land-use types and intensity (e.g. pasturing vs hay meadows, browsing tracks). In consequence, also effects on species richness are detectable. Furthermore, we found only partial concordance of our communities with existing vegetation classifications in the Greater Caucasus.
   Conclusions: A state-of-the-art classification and ordination of regional high-mountain grassland communities and their environmental drivers fills a gap in knowledge about this vegetation. It is widely unknown to international audience and remained almost unstudied during the last 25 yr, when severe shifts in land use remarkably changed the natural conditions. The study can help to identify problems in current grassland management and their consequences for biodiversity conservation. Desirable changes towards sustainable grassland utilization require combined socio-ecological assessments beforehand.

AB  - Communicating change in environmental condition is a critical component of non-market valuation studies. However, the underlying assumptions and implications associated with alternative ways of expressing change in environmental condition for surveys are rarely discussed in the literature. Our review found no cases where alternative formulations were both discussed and tested. In this note we report on our multi-disciplinary analysis of how best to express such change. We interrogate the meaning of, and inferences from, four formulations for quantitative expressions, or metrics, of environmental indicators that are used in the field of ecology and we then evaluate their usefulness in non-market valuation. The assumptions and limitations of each formulation are discussed using seven hypothetical cases of change in environmental condition. We show that formulations for expressing change can be grouped based on two inherent philosophies potentially held by people when they consider their preferences for environmental changes: 'more is better philosophy' and 'restoration philosophy'. We contend that, without careful consideration of which philosophy people may apply, it is possible to inadvertently bias respondent choices when a particular formulation is used in a valuation study. If this happens, resulting value estimates will be a poor reflection of what researchers seek. An alternative approach that does not presuppose a philosophy but instead helps reveal a respondent's philosophy, is proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Various indices of soil microbial community and physiochemical properties at an iron deposit tailing area were investigated to evaluate the use of microbial community behavior as a complemental indicator of soil condition to traditional quality indices. Besides basal respiration rate and microbial carbon, the BIOLOG (R) method was applied to estimate the microbial ability in utilizing different carbon sources. Ordination methods to obtain a biological characterization of sampling sites, and principal response curve methods to reveal the carbon utilizing ability during the whole cultivating process were utilized in this study. The Nemerow composite index, which was used to assess the heavy metal contamination based on six total metal contents, hardly detected the overall discrepancy. However, there were significant differences in microbial functioning parameters at the five sampling plots, which provided more information about the environmental condition. The increases of certain metal contents and pH were accompanied by higher basal respirations (BAS). The increase of BAS did not correspond with the increase of carbon utilization and the higher level of microbial carbon contents. On the whole, these findings indicated that microbes can provide complementary information about different degrees of contamination and can be regarded as a usefully environmental indicator.

AB  - Selected comparisons of water quality and biological properties in lakewide samplings of the early 1970s and 2005-2006 illustrate a range of ecological changes within Lake Superior over the last three decades. Comparisons depict warmed surface layers, and increased chloride and nitrate concentrations-confirming trends described in recent literature. Our comparisons also depict some spatial dimensions of change, showing vertical and horizontal patterns throughout the lake as a function of depth and from shallow to deepest waters. The selected physico-chemical examples speak to different scales of source drivers for change (from local, to basinwide, and even global) and highlight a lake in which some fundamental properties have been influenced in a short period relative to its long flushing time (similar to 170 years). One legacy of the past 30 years of study seems clear: the notion that Lake Superior, due to its vastness, is resistant to environmental forcing and very slow to change, has been modified. We use two important biological components to evaluate change and also to contrast biological distributions, highlighting that some fundamental aspects of food webs vary with depth. Reflecting on these observations, we offer a perspective on how well we keep track of the condition and functioning of the lake, and how we might improve assessments to more actively inform management. Without more frequent biological sampling across all depth zones of the lake, there will continue to be limited ability to assess the nature and causes of ecological change, even when some changes are detected. Knowing that physico-chemical changes can occur relatively quickly (within decades), that the mechanisms for change can be expressed over different spatial dimensions of the lake, and that biology is distributed heterogeneously over these spatial dimensions, we argue the need to increase the degree (the spatial comprehensiveness, frequency, and integration of components) to which the lake is assessed.

AB  - The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive requires the EU Member States to estimate the level of anthropogenic impacts on their marine systems using 11 Descriptors. Assessing food web response to altered habitats is addressed by Descriptor 4 and its indicators, which are being developed for regional seas. However, the development of simple foodweb indicators able to assess the health of ecologically diverse, spatially variable and complex interactions is challenging. Zooplankton is a key element in marine foodwebs and thus comprise an important part of overall ecosystem health. Here, we review work on zooplankton indicator development using long-term data sets across the Baltic Sea and report the main findings. A suite of zooplankton community metrics were evaluated as putative ecological indicators that track community state in relation to Good Environmental Status (GES) criteria with regard to eutrophication and fish feeding conditions in the Baltic Sea. On the basis of an operational definition of GES, we propose mean body mass of zooplankton in the community in combination with zooplankton stock measured as either abundance or biomass to be applicable as an integrated indicator that could be used within the Descriptor 4 in the Baltic Sea. These metrics performed best in predicting zooplankton being in-GES when considering all datasets evaluated. However, some other metrics, such as copepod biomass, the contribution of copepods to the total zooplankton biomass or biomass-based Cladocera: Copepoda ratio, were equally reliable or even superior in certain basin-specific assessments. Our evaluation suggests that in several basins of the Baltic Sea, zooplankton communities currently appear to be out-of-GES, being comprised by smaller zooplankters and having lower total abundance or biomass compared to the communities during the reference conditions; however, the changes in the taxonomic structure underlying these trends vary widely across the sea basins due to the estuarine character of the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Foraminifera are protozoans with biomineralized tests that can be successfully used as a low cost monitoring tool to assess the health status of marine environments. Living benthic foraminiferal assemblages can provide essential information on natural and/or anthropogenic stresses and provide baseline conditions for studies on fossil material. Several studies have highlighted the negative impact of phosphate treatment industries along the Gulf of Gabes (Lesser Syrtis, Tunisia) on the marine environment. However, only a few studies, based on living (stained) benthic foraminifera, are presently available to assess environmental and/or ecological conditions in this Gulf. Thirty-eight surface sediment samples were quantitatively investigated to identify the dominant living benthic foraminiferal species and potential pollution-sensitive and stress-tolerant species. One-hundred and sixty-one species were identified, and grouped into seven dusters representing different environments within the Gulf. These groups represent polluted settings (Cluster A and B), polluted environments characterized by physicochemical variability (Cluster C), seagrass meadows and "pristine" sites (Cluster D and E) and the region subjected to major industrial impact (Cluster F). The final outlier Cluster, identified the foraminifera barren and all shallow coastal stations. A SIMPER analysis helped identify species with clear and fast responses to environmental perturbations (Ammonia tepida, Amphistegina lessonii, Brizalina striatula, Bulimina marginata, Buliminella elegantissima, Eggereloides scaber, Peneroplis perutusus, Rosalina macropora, Rosalina villardeboana, Trochammina inflata). A comparison with the measured geochemical parameters (TOC, phosphorus in the sediments and heavy metal concentrations in the seawater) has shown that the benthic foraminiferal assemblages are mainly linked to phosphorus, TOC, As and Cd pollution. We also provide here the first compilation of the identified living species in the Lesser Syrtis, their synonyms and digital images of important species.

AB  - In response to the current needs of humanity with regard to food production, environmental disasters and climate change, it is important to define (livestock) production systems and management practices that are both productive and ecologically sustainable. We qualitatively assessed advanced silvopastoral experiences in five ecologically and culturally distinct regions in Chiapas, Mexico, given their ability to provide key services: internal (productivity and productive resiliency) and external (climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation). We propose 20 indicators that reflect management, resources, use of external inputs, availability of food, commercial products and animal feed and trees in grazing and forest areas. Sets of some indicators form criteria for dependence on external inputs, productive diversification with emphasis on food security, soil conservation, tree cover and landscape connectivity, among others. Indicators and thresholds were adjusted to critical (traffic light) levels, based on field data. Comparing the levels reached by the studied experiences, we found that most of the resulting services go hand in hand; so 'win-win' situations are passible to be achieved. The elements and practices that affect both internal and external services were explored. The red light critical points in each production unit were identified so that they could be attended. Experiences that presented higher levels in assessment criteria could serve as examples to enable the improvement of livestock systems under similar conditions. We propose this assessment as a tool for rapid intervention that can be widely applied to livestock systems, from conventional to organic or diversified, because of the criteria used. However, it can be more flexible, as new criteria can be added and thresholds can be adjusted for other types of production systems, always reflecting local and desired conditions. The proposed indicators can be also used as a basis for a quantitative agroecosystem assessment.

AB  - Ecotoxicology is concerned with describing and predicting the behaviour of substances in the environment and the response of biological systems, and ultimately with assessing the risks associated with emissions. These assessments are complicated from a basic-science point of view and they should be carried out by using integrative assessments. Contaminated sediments are a significant regulatory issue with important science implications. Determining the impact of contaminated sediments is a key element in environmental risk assessment and management of water resources. Tests for ecotoxicology assessment in sediments may be conducted either in the laboratory or field. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Data from different studies performed in laboratory conditions and in field assessments are compared here. The principal advantages of sediment toxicity tests in the laboratory are the possibility to standardize methodologies and to provide direct evidence of sediments as causative agents of toxicity; however, the results are difficult to extrapolate to the field. The results obtained here show the importance of the end point selected in each test and the variability of the responses. Therefore, the results highlight the necessity and importance of the battery-of-tests approach for toxicity assessment. On the other hand, field sediment toxicity has the advantage of empirical evidence and strong correlative indication of the contaminants responsible for toxicity; however, the results obtained from these tests are highly affected by casualty, so it is not possible to isolate a single causative factor. When structural macrofaunal parameters are incorporated into field tests, the results are even more difficult to interpret, because their parameters can be mainly related to organic enrichment or another kind of natural stress, such as salinity gradient, tidal stress conditions, etc.

AB  - The fluctuating asymmetry (FA) inBetula pendulaRoth was estimated as an integrated measure of five morphometric characteristics of a lamina. Samples were collected in seven cities that differ both in climatic conditions, moderately to sharply continental. In total, 33 ecotopes were distinguished with various level of anthropogenic load. The statistical data processing involved correlation, one-way and factorial ANOVA, regression analyses, and principal component analysis (PCA). The impact of 25 climatic and anthropogenic factors on the FA value was considered. In most urban ecotopes, the integrated fluctuating asymmetry (IFA) value was higher than in natural biotopes of the same region. No significant inter-annual differences in IFA values were found. FA dependence on traffic load is noted to be statistically significant. The covariation analysis of IFA, climatic, and anthropogenic variables in various urban ecotopes revealed the impact of three groups of factors that together explain 93% of the variance in environmental parameters. The complex analysis clearly arranged the studied ecotopes by pollution gradient and climatic patterns. The primary effect of the total anthropogenic load on the developmental stability ofB. pendularesults in an IFA increase. IFA can play a key role in bioindication assessment of environmental quality. The climatic factors have no significant effect on the developmental stability ofB. pendulain urban conditions.

AB  - This study focused on site-specific preferences of potentially harmful cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata to occur in lakes with different ecological and trophic conditions. Its pelagic growth was studied in six lakes from June to September in 1986-1988, 2000-2001 and 2009. In total, 78 samples were taken from the epilimnion (stratified lakes) or the whole water column (non-stratified lakes). Analyses of phytoplankton and environmental variables were performed according to standard methods.
   During summer, a distinct maximum of the Gloeotrichia growth was observed in July or August (the warmest period). Bloom events of G. echinulata occurred in lakes where the light and oxygen conditions were significantly inferior while the phosphorus content remained on a slightly elevated level. The distinct domination of this cyanobacterium (above 40% of the total phytoplankton biomass) was limited to lakes with a high, moderate or even poor ecological status, and to the mesa-eutrophic or eutrophic state of lakes. However, G. echinulata occurred in a broader range of ecological and trophic conditions of lakes. The historical approach to mass occurrence of G. echinulata, with its possible contribution to phosphorus translocation from sediment to the pelagic zone, suggested its importance as an indicator of progressive ecological and trophic deterioration of lakes. This indication should be very useful for establishment of main targets in water management.

AB  - Emergent plants can be suitable indicators of anthropogenic stress in coastal wetlands if their responses to natural environmental variation can be parsed from their responses to human activities in and around wetlands. We used hierarchical partitioning to evaluate the independent influence of geomorphology, geography, and anthropogenic stress on common wetland plants of the U. S. Great Lakes coast and developed multi-taxa models indicating wetland condition. A seven-taxon model predicted condition relative to watershed-derived anthropogenic stress, and a four-taxon model predicted condition relative to within-wetland anthropogenic stressors that modified hydrology. The Great Lake on which the wetlands occurred explained an average of about half the variation in species cover, and subdividing the data by lake allowed us to remove that source of variation. We developed lake-specific multi-taxa models for all of the Great Lakes except Lake Ontario, which had no plant species with significant independent effects of anthropogenic stress. Plant responses were both positive ( increasing cover with stress) and negative ( decreasing cover with stress), and plant taxa incorporated into the lake-specific models differed by Great Lake. The resulting models require information on only a few taxa, rather than all plant species within a wetland, making them easier to implement than existing indicators.

AB  - A decision analysis method for integrating environmental indicators was developed. This was a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP). Being able to take into account the interdependency among variables, the method was capable of ranking ecosystems in terms of environmental conditions and suggesting cumulative impacts across a large region. Using data on land cover, population, roads, streams, air pollution, and topography of the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States, we were able to point out areas which were in relatively poor condition and/or vulnerable to future deterioration regarding various environmental aspects. The method offered an easy and comprehensive way to combine the strengths of conventional multivariate statistics (PCA) and decision-making science tool (ANP) for integrated environmental assessment.

AB  - Sanjiangyuan, called the "Water tower of Asia", is critically important in the ecological services of water pro- vision and regulation and in biodiversity conservation. To strengthen protection in this eco-region, The Chinese government established the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve (SNNR) in 2001 and Sanjiangyuan National Park (SNP) in 2014. To assess the effectiveness of these two conservation practices, on the endangered plant species, we used an integrated method to identify the priority areas of the endangered plant species in the Sanjiangyuan Area which showed if some areas need more conservation efforts. After identifying the potential habitats of high-valued species in Sanjiangyuan with MaxENT, a model that combined the hotspots of en- dangered plant species richness (H), vegetation condition (V), soil condition (S), human disturbance (D) and climate change impact (C) was used to calculate ecosystem risk (ER) associated with each habitat. Projections of climate modeling show that the distribution of endangered plants in Sangjiangyuan will expand to the west and north with the warmer and wetter climate in the future. In both current and future scenarios, the habitats in the northeast of the SNNR are at the highest ecosystem risk and need to be protected strictly. However, most of the high ecosystem risk/conservation priority regions we identified - either current or predicted future status (in 2070 under RCP 2.6) were not protected by SNNR or SNP. Identified conservation gaps call for the well-targeted planning and delineated scientific interventions for protecting the key habitats of these endangered plant species. Conservation priority should be given to eastern Xinghai County and northeastern Tongde County in the east of SNNR, where the habitats are at high ecosystem risk and have high conservation priority.

AB  - Major problems involved in using bio-indicators to monitor heavy metals in the marine environment include standardizing a great variety of physical and biological factors which have a significant effect on metal accumulation. The fact that different species may have different accumulation strategies for different metals, and also that the natural distribution of indicator species is limited, often prevents comparison between monitoring results in different geographic areas and hydrographic conditions. Furthermore, environmental effects on the uptake and depuration of the metals in the biological indicators are not well understood.
   In the present study, uptake of Cd, Pb and Zn by four polymer-ligands (i.e. Chelex(R) 100, Poly(4-vinylpyridine), Sephadex Sp C-25 and Amberlite IR-122) were studied. Laboratory results showed that Chelex(R) 100 was most effective in taking up the soluble fractions of these three metals at low ambient concentrations (0.1-10 mg l(-1)). Equilibrium at low concentrations was reached in about 21 days. Concentration factors after 21 days exposure ranged from 2500 to 5500, depending upon the metal species and ambient concentration. Both uptake and release of metals by Chelex are directly responsive to ambient concentrations and exposure time. Results of field transplantation of Chelex and mussels (Perna virvidis) also showed that Chelex accumulated significantly higher levels of Cd, Cr and Pb, similar levels of Cu, and a lower level of Zn than those of mussels under natural field conditions. Coefficients of variations of metal uptake were also much smaller with Chelex.
   The suitability of using Chelex(R) 100 as a novel chemical device for monitoring metal pollution in the aquatic environment is evaluated against selection criteria established for metal bioindicators. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - The distribution and growing conditions of Cupressus chengiana forests along with the physical and chemical properties of soils in Northwest Sichuan were studied in 2002 to investigate the conditions and characteristics of soil fertility of C. chengiana and to compare and investigate differences of soil fertility for six C. chengiana populations and their relationships with vegetation, climate and disturbance. The results of the study at 0-20 cm soil depth showed that 1) significant differences (P < 0.05) existed among populations for soil bulk density, soil total porosity, capillary porosity, maximum water-holding capacity, capillary water-holding capacity and topsoil natural water content; 2) chemical characteristics of soil organic matter, total N, total P, alkali-hydrolyzable N, available P, available K and cation exchange capacity were significantly different among the populations; and 3) based on the significant effect of soil fertility factors on forest growth, soil physical and chemical characteristics could be selected as an integrated fertility index (IFI) for evaluation of different C. chengiana populations. Principal component and cluster analyses showed significant differences probably due to the difference of vegetation conditions, management measurements, human-induced disturbances and environmental factors. In order to protect the soil ecological functions in fragile ecological regions, C. chengiana could be used in programs enclosing the hill for natural afforestation, natural forest protection programs, and programs replacing agriculture with afforestation measures.

AB  - Groups of eels (Anguilla anguilla) were exposed to Po river water under control conditions at "la Casella" Fluvial Hydrobiology Station for 30-day periods between November and May. At the end of the exposure period, fish were sacrificed and cytochrome P4501A was evaluated in liver microsomes using both catalytic (EROD) and semiquantitative immunodetection (ELISA) assays. At the same time, water samples were taken for chemical analyses of PCBs, PAHs and pesticides. Eel was chosen as bio-indicator on the bases of experiments on cytochrome P450 expression and activity under basal or induced conditions and in consideration of the ecological and economic relevance and ease of handling, Low levels of cytochrome P450 during Winter were followed by a step increase during Spring, associated with a substantial concentration increase of agrochemicals. A good correlation was found between measurements of cytochrome P4501A by EROD and ELISA in dose-effect experiments, however, ELISA showed a higher sensitivity. Immunochemical techniques may be used in addition to enzyme activity measurements both to detect lower levels of cytochrome P450 induction (where they proved more sensitive) and as quality control. These results suggest that measurement of cytochrome P4501A under controlled conditions, using eel as bio-indicator, can be a useful tool in monitoring Po river ecosystems.

AB  - Current food production and consumption trends are inconsistent with the Convention on Biological Diversity's 2050 vision of living in harmony with nature. Here, we examine how, and under what conditions, the post-2020 biodiversity framework can support transformative change in food systems. Our analysis of actions proposed in four science-policy fora reveals that subsidy reform, valuation, food waste reduction, sustainability standards, life cycle assessments, sustainable diets, mainstreaming biodiversity, and strengthening governance can support more sustainable food production and consumption. By considering barriers and opportunities of implementing these actions in Peru and the United Kingdom, we derive potential targets and indicators for the post-2020 biodiversity framework. For targets to support transformation, genuine political commitment, accountability and compliance, and wider enabling conditions and actions by diverse agents are needed to shift food systems onto a sustainable path.

AB  - Constructed wetlands (CWs) have proved to be a highly effective measure to reduce the ecological impact of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) on receiving waters. Due to the stochastic nature of the loading regime and the multitude of environmental influences, assessment of the performance of such plants requires detailed mathematical modelling. A multi-component reactive transport module (CW2D) was applied to simulate the flow, transport and degradation processes occurring in a CW for CSO treatment. CW2D was originally developed to simulate the treatment of municipal wastewater in subsurface flow CWs. Loading and operational conditions in CSO treatment differ fundamentally from the conditions occurring for wastewater treatment. Despite these differences, first results from the simulation of lab-scale experiments show, that the model is generally applicable to this type of plant. Modelling of adsorption, degradation processes, and influent fractionation, however, require further research.

AB  - Livestock grazing in riparian areas has significant impacts on waterway ecosystems. In Australia, livestock grazing is allowed on many public waterway frontages under long-term licences. Many barriers to removing or restricting grazing on riparian areas exist, including concerns that removing grazing from historically grazed sites may favour invasive plant species. We compared vegetation changes at 180 sites along three connected waterways in northern Victoria, Australia that had been extensively grazed by livestock under grazing licences. Some of these sites were permanently protected from grazing by the creation of a new public park and reserve system in 2002. We compared vegetation attributes between sites in the ungrazed reserves, to sites outside reserves that were either recently grazed or ungrazed in 2009. Importantly, we used a sampling design and statistical models that explicitly incorporated the proximity to the waterway to account for known resource and disturbance gradients. Broad site condition assessments that were conducted on the exact same sites prior to reservation provided an indication of pre-treatment condition attributes. Despite no clear evidence of having more or less native vegetation prior to reservation, reserved sites had more native vegetation cover across a range of different lifeform types than unreserved sites. Reserved sites also had much less bare ground, and this effect was far greater closer to the waterway margin. Livestock grazing within reserves reduced these perceived benefits for native vegetation and bare ground. However, reserved sites also had a higher cover of exotic graminoids, but not herbs. This study suggests that reservation of stream frontages was beneficial to native vegetation condition within the study systems even if grazing persisted. Livestock grazing was effective at reducing exotic vegetation cover but at the cost of native vegetation and ground condition. Many factors may influence outcomes and we expect these responses to differ in more productive landscapes or in periods with greater rainfall, so quantitative monitoring is advisable. Evaluation of cost-benefit trade-offs for the environment, graziers, and social and cultural objectives will be important to guide reservation decisions.

AB  - Ecologists and oceanographers inform population and ecosystem management by identifying the physical drivers of ecological dynamics. However, different research communities use different analytical tools where, for example, physical oceanographers often apply rank-reduction techniques (a.k.a. empirical orthogonal functions [EOF]) to identify indicators that represent dominant modes of physical variability, whereas population ecologists use dynamical models that incorporate physical indicators as covariates. Simultaneously modeling physical and biological processes would have several benefits, including improved communication across sub-fields; more efficient use of limited data; and the ability to compare importance of physical and biological drivers for population dynamics. Here, we develop a new statistical technique, EOF regression, which jointly models population-scale dynamics and spatially distributed physical dynamics. EOF regression is fitted using maximum-likelihood techniques and applies a generalized EOF analysis to environmental measurements, estimates one or more time series representing modes of environmental variability, and simultaneously estimates the association of this time series with biological measurements. By doing so, it identifies a spatial map of environmental conditions that are best correlated with annual variability in the biological process. We demonstrate this method using a linear (Ricker) model for early-life survival ("recruitment") of three groundfish species in the eastern Bering Sea from 1982 to 2016, combined with measurements and end-of-century projections for bottom and sea surface temperature. Results suggest that (a) we can forecast biological dynamics while applying delta-correction and statistical downscaling to calibrate measurements and projected physical variables, (b) physical drivers are statistically significant for Pacific cod and walleye pollock recruitment, (c) separately analyzing physical and biological variables fails to identify the significant association for walleye pollock, and (d) cod and pollock will likely have reduced recruitment given forecasted temperatures over future decades.

AB  - Previous geochemical studies carried out in the Parnaiba Basin (Brazil) show that natural gas deposits, whose source rock is formed by the shales of the Pimenteiras Formation (PF; Devonian), stimulated new research to understand the petroleum system. Despite previous studies of PF, ifs characterization with emphasis on the biomarker content is still incipient. In this work, the organic matter (OM) of outcrop samples of the Pimenteiras Formation outcrop samples was investigated through diagnostic biomarkers, to evaluate paleoenvironmental conditions of deposition, the thermal evolution, and the organic matter type. The general distribution of hydrocarbons suggested that the samples present low thermal evolution, marine depositional paleoenvironment, and dysoxic conditions. The molecular parameters based on steranes, hopanes, Pr/C-17 and Ph/C-18, presence of nC(25), n-C-27 and n-C-29 n-alkanes showed strong evidence of marine origin OM with higher plant input. The data also suggested that OM was not affected by igneous intrusions, being below the oil window. Also, the isomers 4 alpha(methyl)- and 4 beta(methyl)-24-ethylcholestane and 24-n-propylcholestane have been detected, which are indicative of a marine depositional system. Aromatic carotenoids and derivatives suggest that euxinic conditions have reached the photic zone, an environment conducive to the preservation of organic matter.

AB  - The two non-native grasses that have established long-term populations in Antarctica (Poa pratensis and Poa annua) were studied from a global multidimensional thermal niche perspective to address the biological invasion risk to Antarctica. These two species exhibit contrasting introduction histories and reproductive strategies and represent two referential case studies of biological invasion processes. We used a multistep process with a range of species distribution modelling techniques (ecological niche factor analysis, multidimensional envelopes, distance/entropy algorithms) together with a suite of thermoclimatic variables, to characterize the potential ranges of these species. Their native bioclimatic thermal envelopes in Eurasia, together with the different naturalized populations across continents, were compared next. The potential niche of P. pratensis was wider at the cold extremes; however, P. annua life history attributes enable it to be a more successful colonizer. We observe that particularly cold summers are a key aspect of the unique Antarctic environment. In consequence, ruderals such as P. annua can quickly expand under such harsh conditions, whereas the more stress-tolerant P. pratensis endures and persist through steady growth. Compiled data on human pressure at the Antarctic Peninsula allowed us to provide site-specific biosecurity risk indicators. We conclude that several areas across the region are vulnerable to invasions from these and other similar species. This can only be visualized in species distribution models (SDMs) when accounting for founder populations that reveal nonanalogous conditions. Results reinforce the need for strict management practices to minimize introductions. Furthermore, our novel set of temperature-based bioclimatic GIS layers for ice-free terrestrial Antarctica provide a mechanism for regional and global species distribution models to be built for other potentially invasive species.

AB  - There are several community-based bioindicator systems that use species presence or abundance data as proxies for environmental variables. One example is the Ellenberg system, whereby vegetation data are used to estimate environmental soil conditions. Despite widespread use of Ellenberg values in ecological research, the correlation between bioindicated values and actual values is often an implicit assumption rather than based on empirical evidence. Here, we correlate unadjusted and UK-adjusted Ellenberg values for soil moisture, pH, and nitrate in relation to direct environmental measures for 50 woodland sites in the UK, which were subject to repeat sampling. Our results show the accuracy of Ellenberg values is parameter specific; pH values were a good proxy for direct environmental measures but this was not true for soil moisture, when relationships were weak and non-significant. For nitrates, there were important seasonal differences, with a strong positive logarithmic relationship in the spring but a non-significant (and negative) correlation in summer. The UK-adjusted values were better than, or equivalent to, Ellenberg's original ones, which had been quantified originally for Central Europe, in all cases. Somewhat surprisingly, unweighted values correlated with direct environmental measures better than did abundance-weighted ones. This suggests that the presence of rare plants can be highly important in accurate quantification of soil parameters and we recommend using an unweighted approach. However, site profiles created only using rare plants were inferior to profiles based on the whole plant community and thus cannot be used in isolation. We conclude that, for pH and nitrates, the Ellenberg system provides a useful estimate of actual conditions, but recalibration of moisture values should be considered along with the effect of seasonality on the efficacy of the system.

AB  - Recovery indicators play a crucial role in the evaluation of river rehabilitation projects. Various types of biological indicators are used to address different ecosystem attributes (structure, composition, and function) at different levels of the biological hierarchy (population, guild, and community). Indicator values are evaluated against reference information from various sources, representing the conditions to be achieved (near-natural references) or to avoid (degraded references). We studied the extent to which investigators' conclusions on project outcome were influenced by the indicator and reference types used. We analyzed 40 selected studies dealing with the recovery of riverine fish assemblages after active rehabilitation of physical habitat and lateral connectivity. In 32 (80%) of the 40 studies, fish response was measured at the population level. Structural and compositional indicators dominated (31 and 24 studies, respectively), while functional indicators were underrepresented (5 studies). Eighteen studies used multiple indicator types for a given ecosystem attribute, a given hierarchical level, or both. Among these studies, we found only very limited evidence that project outcome differed among different indicator types (1 study). In contrast, highly heterogeneous results were found within the different indicator types at the level of the individual study (i.e., indicators addressing the same hierarchical level and ecosystem attribute resulted in different evaluations of project outcome). Such heterogeneity was related to the spatiotemporal variability of the results and species-specific responses to physical habitat rehabilitation. Most studies (73%; 29 studies) used a single type of reference, and the majority focused on degraded conditions. Among the 10 studies that applied multiple reference types, one-third (3 studies) showed inconsistent results (i.e., one reference comparison produced a positive assessment for a given indicator, whereas the second comparison indicated that the endpoint was not achieved). We discuss the implications of inconsistent project outcomes for future monitoring activities.

AB  - Aim. To demonstrate the high adaptive abilities of dairy cattle to various ecosystems and natural zones of the Lower Volga at different times of the year. For the study we selected farms located in the steppe and semi-desert natural zones of the Volgograd region where animals of different breeds are reared.
   Material and Methods. Analysis was undertaken of the main indicators of raw milk quality, amino acid composition and environmental safety. Animals of all farms studied showed fairly high indicators of milk productivity in the climatic conditions of the Volgograd region, according to the standards of the breeds investigated.
   Results. The content of essential amino acids in cow milk for all groups varied depending on the breed and period of the year, generally reaching maximum values in winter. The calculation of amino acid scores showed that lysine is a limiting amino acid in animals of the Holstein-Friesian breed in the summer and autumn periods of lactation. The determination of chemical elements in milk during the summer period of lactation showed that all indicators are within acceptable concentrations, including heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury).
   Conclusion. The research conducted confirms compliance of raw milk with standards in all farms studied for the main controlled indicators of quality and amino acid composition, content of chemical elements and allows recommendation of the milk produced for the production of all types of dairy and fermented milk products.

AB  - Common approaches tomapping green infrastructure in urbanised landscapes invariably focus on measures of land use or land cover and associated functional or physical traits. However, such onedimensional perspectives do not accurately capture the character and complexity of the landscapes in which urban inhabitants live. The new approach presented in this paper demonstrates how open-source, high spatial and temporal resolution data with global coverage can be used tomeasure and represent the landscape qualities of urban environments. Through going beyond simple metrics of quantity, such as percentage green and blue cover, it is now possible to explore the extent to which landscape quality helps to unpick the mixed evidence presented in the literature on the benefits of urban nature to human well-being. Here we present a landscape approach, employing remote sensing, GIS and data reduction techniques to map urban green infrastructure elements in a large U.K. city region. Comparison with existing urban datasets demonstrates considerable improvement in terms of coverage and thematic detail. The characterisation of landscapes, using census tracts as spatial units, and subsequent exploration of associations with social-ecological attributes highlights the further detail that can be uncovered by the approach. For example, eight urban landscape types identified for the case study city exhibited associations with distinct socioeconomic conditions accountable not only to quantities but also qualities of green and blue space. The identification of individual landscape features through simultaneous measures of land use and land cover demonstrated unique and significant associations between the former and indicators of human health and ecological condition. The approach may therefore provide a promising basis for developing further insight into processes and characteristics that affect human health and well-being in urban areas, both in the United Kingdom and beyond.

AB  - There is growing interest in assessing the effects of changing environmental conditions and management actions on human wellbeing. A challenge is to translate social science expertise regarding these relationships into terms usable by environmental scientists, policymakers, and managers. Here, we present a comprehensive, structured, and transparent conceptual framework of human wellbeing designed to guide the development of indicators and a complementary social science research agenda for ecosystem-based management. Our framework grew out of an effort to develop social indicators for an integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA) of the California Current large marine ecosystem. Drawing from scholarship in international development, anthropology, geography, and political science, we define human wellbeing as a state of being with others and the environment, which arises when human needs are met, when individuals and communities can at meaningfully to pursue their goals, and when individuals and communities enjoy a satisfactory quality of life. We propose four major social science-based constituents of wellbeing: connections, capabilities, conditions, and cross-cutting domains. The latter includes the domains of equity and. justice, security, resilience, and sustainability, which may be assessed through cross-cutting analyses of other constituents. We outline a process for identifying policy-relevant attributes of wellbeing that can guide ecosystem assessments. To operationalize the framework, we provide a detailed table of attributes and a large database of available indicators, which may be used to develop measures suited to a variety of management needs and social goals. Finally, we discuss four guidelines for operationalizing human wellbeing measures in ecosystem assessments, including considerations for context, feasibility, indicators and research, and social difference. Developed for the U.S. west coast, the framework may be adapted for other regions, management needs, and scales with appropriate modifications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conservation of seagrasses meadows is important, because these habitats are ecologically important and under threat. Monitoring and modelling are essential tools for assessing seagrass condition and potential threats, however there are many seagrass indicators to choose from, and differentiating between natural variability and declining conditions poses a serious challenge. Tropical seagrass meadows in the Indo-Pacific, in contrast to most temperate meadows, are characterized by a multi-species composition and a year-round growth. Differences in characteristics between species growing within one meadow could induce uncertainty in the assessment of the dynamics of these meadows if variation in productivity and related biomass turnover timescales are not taken into consideration. We present data on biomass distribution, production and turnover timescales of above- and belowground tissues for three key tropical seagrass species (Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea rotundata and Halodule uninervis) in two mixed-species meadows in the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia. Seagrass leaf turnover time scales were comparable for the three studied seagrass species and varied between 25 and 30 days. Variation in leaf and rhizome turnover timescales were small (or insignificant) between the two meadows. In contrast, rhizome turnover time scales were around ten times longer than leaf turnover timescales, and large differences in rhizome turnover time scales (200-500 days) were observed between the species. The late-successional species T. hemprichii had much slower rhizome turnover compared to the two early successional species. Furthermore, since rhizome biomass has a much longer turnover time compared to leaf biomass, changes in rhizome biomass reflect effects on seagrass meadows on a much longer timescale compared to changes in leaf biomass for these tropical meadows. We conclude that belowground biomass dynamics are an important proxy to assess long-term effects of environmental stressors on seagrass ecosystems and should be included in tropical seagrass management programmes.

AB  - Taking into account the characteristics of the crop reflectance spectrum and the variations caused by different climates, remote sensing imaging technology and its counter-technical indicators can track the growth rate and aspects of crops and collect personalized information on the land where crops can be planted and how they can be grown and distributed. According to the collected data, the main crops in the investigated area are corn, wheat, and sorghum, etc., and most of the crops in the central area are very neat and have an excellent growing climate so that they grow taller and fuller, in the south of the area and the surrounding area. In regions, the crop is different in height and not very neat, the fruit is relatively dry, and there are many areas where agricultural land is deserted; a specific area meets the conditions of sunlight and temperature for multiple crops of wheat and vegetables, and a study is carried out under these conditions. Favorable factors influencing agriculture and climate change will increase. In remote sensing research, this technology has a positive impact on agricultural planting and distribution. It also helps to consider the various conditions of crops in different regions and to make different decisions. Deep understanding and use of big data on land resources and temperature changes are of great importance for mastering agricultural conditions, directing agricultural planting methods, and adjusting crops' structure. Active and healthy agricultural growth will make it possible for people to live a better life and have a healthy and robust body. At the same time, it will increase the life cycle of agricultural land and ensure sustainable growth. The most important thing is to concentrate on environmental problems and solve the problem. This plays a vital role in social progress and ecological and agricultural development. However, the current development of healthy agriculture in land A has encountered major challenges, and its small-scale and under-funded nature restricts its progress.

AB  - The diet of red-footed boobies (Sula sula) provisioning chicks was quantified using 106 regurgitations collected from 81 adults over two study years with contrasting oceanographic conditions: 2014 and 2015. A total of 1,049 prey items were sorted into three broad categories (fish, squid, and other, consisting of highly-digested 'mush' and parasitic isopods) and assigned a categorical freshness value of 1 (perfect condition), 2 (superficial digestion), or 3 (highly digested and incomplete). A total of 492 undigested prey items (freshness 1 and 2) were measured and sampled for genetic identification with 401 (82%) successfully identified. Rarefaction analyses suggested robust diet sampling, with 32 documented species: 29 fishes and three squids. While the prey-specific index of relative importance highlighted that fish dominated the diet in 2014 (32.3% fish, 15.1% squid) and in 2015 (29.9% fish, 22.3% squid), diet composition varied significantly between the two study years. The purpleback flying squid (Stenoteuthis oulaniensis) accounted for 98.7% (232 of 236) of the identified squid specimens. Mantle lengths were significantly longer in 2015 (7.2 +/- 1.1 SD cm) than in 2014 (6.3 +/- 1.7 SD cm). These results indicate a higher relative abundance and size of the epipelagic squids available to foraging red-footed boobies in 2015, during warm-water conditions associated with the positive phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Due to their diverse diet, red-footed boobies are useful bioindicators of epipelagic nekton assemblages during changing oceanographic conditions. Moreover, their reliance on the purpleback flying squid makes these seabirds ideal samplers of the juveniles of this poorly studied species. Understanding how interannual and longer-term oceanographic variability affects central-place foraging seabirds and the recruitment and abundance of their squid prey is critical for precautionary ecosystem-based fisheries management of oceanic islands and the surrounding marine environment.

AB  - The present article portrays root growth and root system development with special reference to Picea abies. Root phenology and ontogeny are depicted, and the biological responses of the roots to adverse growing conditions appraised. Norway spruce is regarded as a species which is able to grow under a wide range of soil physical and chemical conditions, provided sufficient soil aeration is guaranteed. The root system of spruce is however sensitive to any dislocation of its primary taproot. Nursery handling and planting damage often affect the root system development of the young tree. Soil acidity and Al-toxicity represent other significant restraints to root growth of spruce. Rooting patterns and mycorrhizal communities are influenced by atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and acidity. Root system spread is closely related to the tree's competitive status in the forest stand and responds to forest management practices. The preference of Norway spruce roots for humus-rich soil horizons and patches is repeatedly reported. Though, a general characterisation of P abies as a primary 'surface-rooter' has been disproved. Different structures and functions of long and short roots can be identified. Periodic shedding of small and fibrous root structures is a natural phenomenon and is influenced by ambient (i.e. climatic) conditions. Nonetheless, adverse growing conditions result in an increased frequency of adventitious root formation. Permanent root system damage will occur when such root replacement strategies fail. The resulting occurrence of root derangement points and the loss of ramification orders, advances from the fine- to the coarse-root structures. The result is an irregular arrangement of the structural root system, with increasing frequency of damaged roots and disturbance of the root system symmetry. Damaged coarse roots are characterised by discolouration following decay. A damage class scheme for Norway, spruce that depicts general stages of root system vitality and decay is provided. The work illustrates that root parameters are good indicators of the sustainability of forest sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A rapid increase in population causes quantitative municipal solid wastes (MSW) in Pakistan, leading to serious public health and environmental impacts. Pakistan has social and environmental issues due to poor and inadequate waste management. Moreover, solid waste in Pakistan is 2.4% per year and 0.283 to 0.612 kg/capita/day. While the new scheme focuses primarily on waste collection and transportation, but the recovery rate is 68%. Insufficient waste collection and disposal would pollute the air, water, and soil that may cause a public health risk. The main techniques for waste disposal used in Pakistan include composting, landfilling, open dumping, incineration, anaerobic digestion, etc. However, these approaches are not ecological and cost-effective. The black soldier's fly technology (BSF) effectively and biologically breaks down diverse biodegradable wastes under sub-tropical conditions. Most people worldwide use BSF larvae to degrade biodegradable matter, especially in tropical and developing countries. BSF innovation has a high potential to cope with the current challenges related to inadequate reliable waste management infrastructure as Pakistan has favorable environmental and climate conditions. It is also capable of fostering regional growth, creating jobs, and local recycling of degradable waste. Black soldier fly larvae technology is an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method because of its quick transition rate, good sustainability, and low cost-effectiveness compared to existing and other operating technologies in Pakistan. Organic waste becomes not only useful after being processed by BSFL but also produces high-value eco-friendly goods. This review highlights the role of BSFL for waste management, its benefits in Pakistan under the current environmental condition, and the biodegradation of various organic wastes under subtropical conditions. In this study, different kinds of practices used in Pakistan for waste management, including open dumping, landfilling, incineration, and anaerobic digestion, were compared. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Zooplankton is an important bioindicator of ecosystem functioning. Knowledge of the seasonal fluctuation in the zooplankton population in estuarine waters of the Indian Sundarbans is rather limited. In the present study, we analysed the community structure of zooplankton assemblages and their spatio-temporal variations based on different multivariate statistics and indicator value analysis. A total of 56 taxa were identified and the density was primarily dominated by planktonic copepods and few meroplankton communities during four sampling seasons. The most abundant species were: Acartia spinicauda, Acartia sp., Bestiolina similis, Euterpina acutifrons, Labidocera acuta, Paracalanus aculeatus, Paracalanus parvus and Paracalanus indicus. Canonical Correspondence Analysis highlighted that temperature, pH, DO, salinity and nutrients were the prevailing environmental parameters associated with significant spatio-temporal changes of zooplankton distribution in this area. The highest abundance of zooplankton was recorded in winter, followed by monsoon, summer and spring. Throughout the study period, different zooplankton indices were observed in good condition. Seasonal occurrence of dominant zooplankton with high IndVal index was markedly observed and it might be used as a potential bioindicator for a particular season and environmental condition in this estuarine complex. The results of this study provide evidence for the presence of warm water species in the estuarine waters of the Indian Sundarbans and can be a clear indication of climate change-mediated elevated temperature in the estuarine system. Our results underscore the high diversity of zooplankton from mangrove dominated estuarine complex and emphasize the need for long-term monitoring in ecologically fragile ecosystems like the Sundarbans Estuarine System.

AB  - In human-modified tropical landscapes (HMLs) the conservation of biodiversity, functions and services of forest ecosystems depends on persistence of old growth forest remnants, forest regeneration in abandoned agricultural fields, and restoration of degraded lands. Understanding the impacts of agricultural land uses (ALUs) on forest regeneration is critical for biodiversity conservation in HMLs. Here, we develop a conceptual framework that considers the availability of propagules and the environment prevailing after field abandonment as two major determinants of forest regeneration in HMLs. The framework proposes that regeneration potential decreases with size, duration and severity of agricultural disturbance, reducing propagule availability and creating ill-suited environmental conditions for regeneration. We used studies from Southern Mexico to assess this framework. First, we identify regeneration bottlenecks that trees face during transit from seed to follow-up life stages, using demographic analysis of dominant pioneer species in recently abandoned fields. Then, we explore effects of ALUs on forest regeneration at the field and landscape scales, addressing major legacies. Finally, we integrate agricultural disturbance with landscape composition to predict attributes of successful second growth forests in HMLs, and provide indicators useful to select tree native species for active restoration. An indicator of disturbance inflicted by ALUs, based on farmers' information, predicted better regeneration potential than measurements of soil and microclimate conditions at time of abandonment. Cover of cattle pastures in the landscape was a stronger indicator of forest regenerating attributes than cover of old growth forest remnants. To conclude, we offer recommendations to promote forest regeneration and biodiversity conservation in HMLs.

AB  - The paper concerns forest populations of lady's slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus L.). The study sites were located in localities with the most numerous populations of Cypripedium calceolus L. in managed forests in Poland. The field studies were conducted in 2012 according to Natura 2000 sites protocols. The aim of studies was the determination of population structure of lady's slipper orchid, especially in indexes reflected number of flowering and fruit plants. The relations between above factors and environmental conditions expressed by ecological indicator values, cover of vegetation layers, species richness, stand age, and intensity of thinning were studies. The obtained results confirmed negative influence of understorey layer and positive influence of density of tree layer on the development of studied orchid populations. The increase in thinning intensity has not significant influence on protection status of Cypripedium calceolus.

AB  - For a large part of earth's history, cyanobacterial mats thrived in low-oxygen conditions, yet our understanding of their ecological functioning is limited. Extant cyanobacterial mats provide windows into the putative functioning of ancient ecosystems, and they continue to mediate biogeochemical transformations and nutrient transport across the sediment-water interface in modern ecosystems. The structure and function of benthic mats are shaped by biogeochemical processes in underlying sediments. A modern cyanobacterial mat system in a submerged sinkhole of Lake Huron (LH) provides a unique opportunity to explore such sediment-mat interactions. In the Middle Island Sinkhole (MIS), seeping groundwater establishes a low-oxygen, sulfidic environment in which a microbial mat dominated by Phormidium and Planktothrix that is capable of both anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis, as well as chemosynthesis, thrives. We explored the coupled microbial community composition and biogeochemical functioning of organic-rich, sulfidic sediments underlying the surface mat. Microbial communities were diverse and vertically stratified to 12cm sediment depth. In contrast to previous studies, which used low-throughput or shotgun metagenomic approaches, our high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach revealed extensive diversity. This diversity was present within microbial groups, including putative sulfate-reducing taxa of Deltaproteobacteria, some of which exhibited differential abundance patterns in the mats and with depth in the underlying sediments. The biological and geochemical conditions in the MIS were distinctly different from those in typical LH sediments of comparable depth. We found evidence for active cycling of sulfur, methane, and nutrients leading to high concentrations of sulfide, ammonium, and phosphorus in sediments underlying cyanobacterial mats. Indicators of nutrient availability were significantly related to MIS microbial community composition, while LH communities were also shaped by indicators of subsurface groundwater influence. These results show that interactions between the mats and sediments are crucial for sustaining this hot spot of biological diversity and biogeochemical cycling.

AB  - Background and aims - Phenotypic plasticity is the morphological response of a single genotype to produce several different physiological and/or morphological types under changing environmental conditions. Desmodesmus, a green alga, has been well documented for its phenotypic responses (e.g. colony transformation to unicells, and spiny transformation to spineless). Two oxbow lakes (R1 and R2) and one artificial dam reservoir (R3) were used to evaluate the quantity and diversity range of Desmodesmus species occurring during four seasons of one-year.
   Methods - Water samples were quantified for Desmodesmus species and identified using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). To better understand the morphological responses of Desmodesmus, an axenic culture of Desmodesmus abundans, CCAP 258/299, was cultured in sterile-filtered water from each water body collected from each season.
   Key results - Not surprisingly, different Desmodesmus species inhabited each Water body and exhibited different densities of growth, contributing 77% of the total density in R1, 22% in R2 and only 1% in R3. Summer and autumn were the seasons when Desmodesmus showed the highest density in the shallow and polymictic oxbow lakes (R1 and R2). In the deep and dimictic reservoir (R3), the highest density of Desmodesmus was during autumn. Phenotypic plasticity was observed in the experiments, with unicells being formed from colonies, some with shorter spines. Desmodesmus grown in a high concentration of nitrogen (SE, Medium 7 +3N and BBM) had a higher percentage of unicells compared to the other culture conditions.
   Conclusions - Our studies are important from both taxonomical and ecological points of view, since our results showed that there may be new possibilities for using the phenotypic plasticity of Desmodesmus to assess water quality and as a potential bioindicator of nutrient availability in natural ecosystems.

AB  - Recently, molecular environmental surveys of the eukaryotic microbial community in lakes have revealed a high diversity of sequences belonging to uncultured zoosporic fungi commonly known as chytrids. These microorganisms have two different stages in their life cycle and are known as algal parasites (i.e. host-attached infective sporangia) and as food sources for zooplankton (i.e. free-living zooflagellate propagules) in aquatic systems. However, because of their small size and their lack of distinctive morphological features, traditional microscopy does not allow the detection of chytrids, particularly of zoospores which have probably been misidentified as phagotrophic flagellates in previous studies. Hence, quantitative data on chytrids in natural environments is missing. We have adapted a clone-FISH approach known from prokaryotes to optimize the hybridization conditions of a designed oligonucleotidic probe specific to Chytridiales (i.e. the largest group of the true-fungal division of Chytridiomycota), before application to natural samples using the CARD-FISH approach. When these conditions were applied, the CARD-FISH assay demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity, and offers a promising tool for quantitative assessment of natural zoosporic fungi, primarily of zoospores which contributed up to 60% of the total abundance of heterotrophic flagellates. Although the field results from the CARD-FISH approach were considered preliminary and mainly as 'proof of concept', findings were consistent with ecological considerations known from pelagic habitats and host versus parasite populations, with recurrent ecological patterns in two contrasting lake ecosystems. We conclude that this approach will contribute to a better understanding of the ecological significance of zoosporic organisms in microbial food webs of pelagic ecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Flow cessation affects river ecosystems submitted to low precipitation and increased water demand, and creates unfavourable conditions to aquatic biological communities. Diatoms are amongst the most sensitive biological groups to hydric stress, making them good indicators of preceding hydrological conditions. We here analyse the response of diatom assemblages to the duration and frequency of non-flow periods in 23 Mediterranean temporary streams. All of them experienced a strong decrease in water flow during summer, leading to a period of flow cessation. In addition, other ten permanent streams (zero dry days during the study period) were included in the study for comparative purposes. Temporary and permanent streams showed similar diatom species richness, evenness, and alpha diversity. However, beta diversity was higher in temporary than permanent streams, regardless rare taxa (<1% occurrence) had similar numbers in the two types of streams. Alpha diversity, richness, and evenness of diatom assemblages in the temporary streams changed with the duration of the non-flow period. Durations of 50-100 days were associated to higher alpha diversity, richness, and evenness, but longer non-flow periods caused their decrease. Diatoms thriving under the most extreme conditions were mostly aerophilic, pioneer, and motile taxa. The proportion of aerophilic diatom taxa increased beyond 100 dry days, particularly in those sites receiving more intense solar radiation. Overall, the taxonomical and functional composition of diatom assemblages mostly responded to the duration of the non-flow period, irrespectively of these being consecutive or not. This study shows that diatom assemblages from temporary streams contain taxa adapted to non-flow conditions, but remain vulnerable to further reductions of water flow associated to climate or global change. 'Unimpacted' watercourses in the Mediterranean region, independently of their flow regime, should be urgently protected and used as taxonomical and functional early indicators of climate change.

AB  - Size appears to be an important parameter in ecological processes. All physiological processes vary with body size ranging from small microorganisms to higher mammals. In this model, five state variables - phosphorus, detritus, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish are considered. We study the implications of body sizes of phytoplankton and zooplankton for total system dynamics by optimizing exergy as a goal function for system performance indicator. The rates of different sub-processes of phytoplankton and zooplankton are calculated, by means of allometric relationships of their body sizes. We run the model with different combinations of body sizes of phytoplankton and zooplankton and observe the overall biomass of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish. The highest exergy values in different combinations of phytoplankton acid zooplankton size indicate the maximum biomass of fish with relative proportions of phytoplankton and zooplankton. We also test the effect of phosphorus input conditions corresponding to oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic system on its dynamics. The average exergy to be maximized over phytoplankton and zooplankton size was computed when the system reached a steady state. Since this state is often a limit cycle, and the exergy copies this behaviour, we averaged the exergy computed for 365 days (duration of 1 year) in the stable period of the run. In mesotrophic condition, maximum fish biomass with relative proportional ratio of phytoplankton, zooplankton is recorded for phytoplankton size class 3.12 (log V mum(3) volume) and zooplankton size 4 (log V mum(3) volume). In oligotrophic condition the highest average exergy is obtained in between phytoplankton size 1.48 (log V mum(3) volume) and zooplankton size 4 (log V mum(3) volume), whereas in eutrophic condition the result shows the highest exergy in the combination of phytoplankton size 5.25 (log V mum(3) volume) and zooplankton size 4 (log V mum(3) volume).

AB  - In current risk assessment ecotoxicological biotests (e. g. Daphnia reproduction test) are used to assess the potential impact of xenobiotics on ecosystems. The effects of chemicals and pesticides on populations of non-target organisms in the field depend not only on the exposure and the toxicity, but also on other factors such as life history characteristics. The effects of 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) measured with standardized test procedures, namely the Daphnia immobilisation test (OECD 202) and Daphnia reproduction test (OECD 211), were extrapolated to the population level using an individual-based Daphnia magna population model (IDamP) integrating only the effects on mortality and reproduction. The application of IDamP to extrapolate the effects on population levels was tested on two different population datasets, differing in the start population as well as in the feeding regime. The simulation results were compared to data derived from population experiments under semi-static and flow-through conditions. The IDamP model with an integrated toxicity module was able to predict the effects of 3,4-DCA on the population level under constant laboratory conditions for both datasets. This modelling approach was used to establish concentration-response relationships for 3,4-DCA on the population level. For this purpose two endpoints, the population capacity and the extinction probability, were calculated for different food levels. It turned out that the concentration-response relationship of the population capacity was less influenced by food supply, whereas for daphnid populations exposed to 3,4-DCA the extinction risk was twice as high with lower (environmental relevant) food supply. For both endpoints the lowest EC(50) was calculated to be 25 and 35 mu g l(-1). The calculation of concentration-effect relationships on the population level by using a modelling approach provides a tool to extrapolate from effects derived from lab experiments to effects on the population level and can improve the ecological risk assessment of chemicals and pesticides.

AB  - Wildlife tourism alters the environmental conditions in which the focal animal lives, and it is therefore necessary to assess the ability of the animal to adjust to and persist in these novel conditions if the industry is to be sustainable. Here, we report on the physiological responses of southern stingrays (Dasyatis americana) which are the focus of intense marine provisioning-tourism in the Cayman Islands. Using stingrays from non-tourist sites about Grand Cayman as a basis for comparison, we show in this natural experiment that tourist-exposed stingrays exhibit hematological changes indicative of physiological costs of wildlife tourism. The novel conditions with which the stingrays must interact include non-natural food, higher injury rates (from boats, conspecifics and predators), and higher parasite loads (from crowding conditions). As a result of this year-round environment, stingrays display sub-optimal health: lower hematocrit, total serum protein concentrations, and oxidative stress (i.e., lower total antioxidant capacity combined with higher total oxidative status). Moreover, they show evidence of attenuation of the defense system: for tourist stingrays only, animals possessing both injuries and high parasite loads also exhibit lowest leukocrit, serum proteins and antioxidant potential, as well as differing proportions of differential leukocytes indicative of suppression (lymphocytes and heterophils) and down-regulation (eosinophils), thus suggesting that the physiological changes of tourist stingrays are in partial response to these stressors. While survival- and reproduction- quantification was not possible in this long-lived marine species, the physiological measures -situated within ecological context, indicate that the long-term health and survival of tourist stingrays have a significant probability of being affected. Consequently, management of the tourism attraction is essential. The indicators chosen in this study reflect general health indices and defense capabilities used across taxa, and represent a tradeoff between ease of collection/analysis and interpretation so that managers can continue the research for monitoring purposes.

AB  - 1. There is growing consensus that integrated marine management is needed. However, implementation of ecosystem-based management (EBM) faces major operational challenges, including accurately delineating the links between ecosystem components and benefits to humans, and quantifying trade-offs associated with different management decisions.
   2. It is suggested using human activity level as an indicator of the benefit provided by marine ecosystems at a certain location in comparison with other locations and establishing links between human activity levels and ecological conditions.
   3. This approach allows for the determination of what ecological conditions may provide the greatest human benefits and thus may be targets for management action.
   4. This approach is used to investigate the link between scuba diving in the Monterey Bay area, California, USA, and different ecological characteristics of kelp forests. Diving intensity levels correlate with kelp persistence, suggesting that kelp persistence may be used as an indicator of benefits from diving and for evaluating the impact of potentially competing activities through their effects on kelp.
   5. Overall, an operational definition of marine ecosystem services is provided and it is suggested that this method could be extended to a suite of different activities and systems and thus may become useful in considering trade-offs among different activities that depend upon the same ecosystem.

AB  - The highly populated coasts of the Bay of Bengal are particularly vulnerable to water-borne diseases, pollution and climatic extremes. The environmental factors behind bacterial community composition and Vibrio distribution were investigated in an estuarine system of a cholera-endemic region in the coastline of Bangladesh. Higher temperatures and sewage pollution were important drivers of the abundance of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae. A closer relation between non-culturable Vibrio and particulate organic matter (POM) was inferred during the post-monsoon. The distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Vibrio genus was likely driven by salinity and temperature. The resuspension of sediments increased Vibrio abundance and organic nutrient concentrations. The delta C-13 dynamic in POM followed an increasing gradient from freshwater to marine stations; nevertheless, it was not a marker of sewage pollution. Bacteroidales and culturable coliforms were reliable indicators of untreated wastewater during pre and post-monsoon seasons. The presumptive incorporation of depleted-ammonium derived from ammonification processes under the hypoxic conditions, by some microorganisms such as Cloacibacterium and particularly by Arcobacter nearby the sewage discharge, contributed to the drastic N-15 depletion in the POM. The likely capacity of extracellular polymeric substances production of these taxa may facilitate the colonization of POM from anthropogenic origin and may signify important properties for wastewater bioremediation. Genera of potential pathogens other than Vibrio associated with sewage pollution were Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Arcobacter, and Bergeyella. The changing environmental conditions of the estuary favored the abundance of early colonizers and the island biogeography theory explained the distribution of some bacterial groups. This multidisciplinary study evidenced clearly the eutrophic conditions of the Karnaphuli estuary and assessed comprehensively its current bacterial baseline and potential risks. The prevailing conditions together with human overpopulation and frequent natural disasters, transform the region in one of the most vulnerable to climate change. Adaptive management strategies are urgently needed to enhance ecosystem health.

AB  - BackgroundEcological sciences have, in recent decades, benefited from the ability of proximity loggers (PLs)-i.e. devices that transmit and receive radio signals (UHF)-to quantify intra- and inter-specific interactions. These are used to estimate the frequency of contacts according to a predefined distance between individuals or between individuals and environmental features. The performance of these devices may, however, be potentially affected by several factors, signifying that they require accurate calibration under field conditions in order to correctly interpret the information obtained. We assessed the effect of four relevant factors in ecological and epidemiological studies over the attenuation of radio waves in terms of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and contact success rate at a short (3 m) and medium distance (up to 20 m). The factors considered were: height above the ground (0-1 m), the presence/absence of vegetation, the presence/absence of live body mass around the devices, the distance between devices and the overlaid effects of all of them.ResultsThe RSSI was found to be an accurate measure of distance, although its precision decreased over greater distances (up to 100 m), with the loss being sharper with vegetation, with body mass and when the devices were located on the ground. The success rate at up to 20 m decreased with distance and was also affected by body mass and vegetation. A probability of contact success of 81% was obtained in the best conditions (without vegetation and body mass) at a distance of 3 m, whereas it was of 56% in the worst conditions.ConclusionsOur study shows the potential synergistic effects of external factors on the performance of PLs, even when they are used to infer near-contacts. We, therefore, highlight the importance of assessing, for each particular study, the combined effect of non-controllable external factors on the performance of PLs in order to estimate the minimum (best scenario) and maximum (worst scenario) level of underestimation in the field data. The sampling design described here is a cost-effective protocol suitable for this purpose.

AB  - The HSP70 proteins are used as exposure biomarkers, and the oyster Crassostrea virginica is considered as a bioindicator organism in environmental assessment. According to the season, the level of expression of the HSP70 family in wild oysters has not been characterized before. The aim of this work was to analyze the expression of the HSP70 family as an exposure biomarker using C. virginica gills from individuals and groups of oysters from the Tampamachoco Lagoon under natural conditions. Ninety oyster samples were collected at locations from the Tampamachoco Lagoon during the dry and "north winds" seasons. One group of oysters was maintained under laboratory conditions and exposed to thermal stress. The pH, temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen (DO2) were measured inside the brackish Tuxpam-Tampamachoco system. Salinity and DO2 were outside the limits recommended for brackish systems in both seasons. The electrophoresis and immuno-detection assay of HSP70 were performed using proteins from oyster gills. The HSP73, HSP72 and HSP69 isoforms were expressed in dry season tissue samples, while only the HSP73 and HSP72 isoforms were detected in north winds season tissue samples and positive control tissue samples. The HSP73 isoform has not been previously reported in C. virginica. To evaluate the expression of HSP70 protein family at individual and group levels from wild animals, it is also important to determine a seasonal baseline expression.

AB  - Enzymes are known to be sensitive indicators of soil quality. Nevertheless, the natural variability of their activities needs to be considered for a relevant interpretation of activity levels, especially in contaminated soils. We first monitored the variability of enzymatic activities (acid and alkaline phosphatases. beta-glucosidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, urease and dehydrogenase) in two agricultural sites in northwestern France during a seasonal April-October cycle. For both sites, two types of long-term different agricultural managements, grassland and intensive cropping were considered. Our results revealed great variability of enzymatic activities in space and over time, yet more pronounced for grassland than for cropped soils. Then, we assessed the impact of copper on enzymes activity on Terrestrial Model Ecosystems (TMEs) filled with undisturbed soil, and incubated for 70 days in open-field conditions. Copper was added at two concentration levels corresponding to a regulated annual agronomic input (2 mg kg(-1)) or to a high soil contamination (200 mg kg(-1)). In comparison to effects of natural spatiotemporal variability of soil conditions, copper addition did not show significant impacts on enzymatic activities. Finally, our results confirmed that for assessing effective impacts of contaminants in soils under real field conditions, natural spatiotemporal soil variability must be considered.

AB  - Herbicidal activities of clove oil and its primary constituent eugenol on broccoli, common lambsquarters, and redroot pigweed and the role of crystalline leaf epicuticular wax (LEW) in susceptibility and retention of these essential oils were studied. Clove oil (2.5%) and eugenol (1.5%) were applied to leaves of greenhouse-grown broccoli, common lambsquarters, and redroot pigweed seedlings and effects on seedling growth and leaf cell membrane integrity were studied. Compared with eugenol clove oil caused greater inhibition of seedling growth in all species. Both eugenol and clove oil caused greater loss of membrane integrity and inhibition of seedling growth in redroot pigweed, which has no crystalline LEW, compared with common lambsquarters, which has a thick layer of crystalline LEW. In broccoli seedlings with clove oil caused greater inhibition of growth than eugenol. Both clove oil and eugenol caused greater electrolyte leakage from broccoli leaves without LEW than in the leaves with LEW. Removal of LEW increased electrolyte leakage, an indicator of cell membrane damage, by 97% in eugenol-treated and 26% in clove oil-treated broccoli leaves. Susceptibility of broccoli seedlings and possibly some weed species may, therefore, be affected by factors (e.g., genetic, environmental) that influence the amount of LEW. Although the presence of LEW greatly reduced the retention of the essential oil solutions, there was no significant difference between the retention of clove oil and eugenol solutions, indicating that differences in their phytotoxicity to broccoli leaves was not due to differential foliar retention.

AB  - Aquaculture continues to be the fastest-growing animal food sector and accounts for over 50% of the world's fish consumption. This trend is projected to continue, highlighting the role that the aquaculture industry will play in ensuring future global food security. Enhancement of growth rates of fish can optimize aquaculture production and has been achieved through selective breeding programs producing fast-growing domesticated strains, or the development of growth hormone (GH) transgenic strains. Although the ability of selectively-bred domesticated and GH transgenic salmon to outgrow wild-type salmon is well documented, very little research has been reported that directly compares the growth rates of domesticated and GH transgenic strains. The aim of the present study was to compare the growth and survival of selectively-bred domesticated and GH transgenic coho salmon across a range of experimental conditions. We performed four experiments investigating the growth rates of domesticated and GH transgenic salmon by comparing these strains at different developmental stages and under different experimental rearing conditions, as well as under conditions when strains were competing and when they were reared separately. Results from all experiments showed that GH transgenic coho salmon grew faster and to a larger size than the selectively-bred domesticated coho salmon. This was true whether fish groups were reared post-smolt in freshwater or seawater, whether reared together or separately, and whether manipulated to be size-matched at early stages. Thus, GH transgenesis could become a viable complement to selective breeding to produce fast-growing salmon for aquaculture systems. While further research can continue to optimize the development and use of transgenic strains, the data presented here also are important for environmental risk assessments by providing data on the relative fitness and ecological consequences of selectively-bred domesticated and GH transgenic fish should they enter nature.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) threatens the growth and function of coral reef ecosystems. A key component to coral health is the microbiome, but little is known about the impact of OA on coral microbiomes. A submarine CO2 vent at Maug Island in the Northern Mariana Islands provides a natural pH gradient to investigate coral responses to long-term OA conditions. Three coral species (Pocillopora eydouxi, Porites lobata, and Porites rus) were sampled from three sites where the mean seawater pH is 8.04, 7.98, and 7.94. We characterized coral bacterial communities (using 16S rRNA gene sequencing) and determined pH of the extracellular calcifying fluid (ECF) (using skeletal boron isotopes) across the seawater pH gradient. Bacterial communities of both Porites species stabilized (decreases in community dispersion) with decreased seawater pH, coupled with large increases in the abundance of Endozoicomonas, an endosymbiont. P. lobata experienced a significant decrease in ECF pH near the vent, whereas P. rus experienced a trending decrease in ECF pH near the vent. In contrast, Pociliopora exhibited bacterial community destabilization (increases in community dispersion), with significant decreases in Endozoicomonas abundance, while its ECF pH remained unchanged across the pH gradient. Our study shows that OA has multiple consequences on Endozoicomonas abundance and suggests that Endozoicomonas abundance may be an indicator of coral response to OA. We reveal an interesting dichotomy between two facets of coral physiology (regulation of bacterial communities and regulation of calcification), highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary approaches to understanding coral health and function in a changing ocean.
   IMPORTANCE Ocean acidification (OA) is a consequence of anthropogenic CO2 emissions that is negatively impacting marine ecosystems such as coral reefs. OA affects many aspects of coral physiology, including growth (i.e., calcification) and disrupting associated bacterial communities. Coral-associated bacteria are important for host health, but it remains unclear how coral-associated bacterial communities will respond to future OA conditions. We document changes in coral-associated bacterial communities and changes to calcification physiology with long-term exposure to decreases in seawater pH that are environmentally relevant under midrange IPCC emission scenarios (0.1 pH units). We also find species-specific responses that may reflect different responses to long-term OA. In Pocillopora, calcification physiology was highly regulated despite changing seawater conditions. In Porites spp., changes in bacterial communities do not reflect a breakdown of coral-bacterial symbiosis. Insights into calcification and host-microbe interactions are critical to predicting the health and function of different coral taxa to future OA conditions.

AB  - In order to access environmental conditions, the use of bioindicators that have a close relationship with environmental stressors is a largely common practice, but when evaluating environmental inferences, the individual dominant taxa need to be interpreted. Humid regions such as the marshlands are fragile ecosystems and sustain communities of microalgae, often used as bioindicators, of which diatoms are a good example. Although they provide an excellent response to chemical and physical changes in water, diatom studies in surface sediments in wetlands are scarce worldwide. To determine whether diatom species have the potential to provide unambiguous inferences in the influence of environmental factors, we have evaluated diatom abundance in surface sediment, from three Pantanal lakes, against a set of environmental gradients: pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, water temperature, index of trophic water status, total phosphorus and total nitrogen. The Ferradura lake presented an oligotrophic state and both Burro and Caracara lakes presented mesotrophic state. Diatoms were more abundant in the a mesotrophic conditions, but with higher species richness in the oligotrophic conditions. Depending on the N:P ratio, the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus can also play the role of pollutants and may have negative and unpredictable effects in the environment, such as biotic homogenization. Despite the spatial variation in species, there was a greater richness of Eunotia Ehrenberg species, with the highest relative density of Eunotia formica Ehrenberg and E. pantropica Glushchenko, Kulikovskiy & Kociolek, due to the environmental acidic conditions, a determining characteristic of this genus. It was also observed that a small increase in the level of phosphorus generated an increase in the abundance of Aulacoseira Thwaites with the highest relative density of A. pusilla (Meister) Tuji & Houki and A. veraluciae Tremarin, Torgan & T.Ludwig. However, A. italica dominated in the moderately acidic environment. The results can help with decisions in impacted areas to solve socioeconomic problems, environmental management and biodiversity.

AB  - Under natural conditions, organisms can experience a variety of abiotic (e.g., temperature, pH) and biotic (e.g., species interactions) factors, which can interact with toxicant effects. By ignoring species interactions conventional ecotoxicological studies (i.e., single-species tests) oversimplify the actual field situation. We investigated whether temperature and interspecific competition affected the effects of zinc (Zn) on a Daphnia longispina population. The D. longispina populations were exposed in a full factorial design to 3 different Zn treatments (background, 29, and 110g Zn/L), 2 different temperature regimes (cold, 17-18 degrees C; warm, 21-22 degrees C), and 2 interspecific competition levels (no interspecific Brachionus competition=no Brachionus calyciflorus added; interspecific Brachionus competition=B. calyciflorus added). Interspecific Brachionus competition and temperature by itself had a limited effect on the Daphnia abundance but significantly interacted with the highest Zn concentration. Without Brachionus competition the D. longispina juvenile and adult abundances under warm conditions were up to 5.5 and 21 times lower, respectively, in the high Zn treatment in comparison with the Zn control, whereas under cold conditions no significant Zn effect was observed. However, with Brachionus competition the highest Zn treatment was on average 2.2 times less toxic to the D. longispina juvenile abundance at higher temperatures. Under cold conditions the highest Zn treatment affected the juvenile abundance sooner and up to 9 times more negatively when simultaneously faced with Brachionus competition. It is possible that the competition for food reduced the amount of energy that could be used by D. longispina for reproduction, and the metabolic costs increased as a result of Zn stress. The present study clearly illustrated the influence of temperature and competition on the effects of a chemical stressor. Thus, not considering such factors in ecological risk assessment may underestimate or overestimate risks in aquatic ecosystems when extrapolating data from standard single-species tests to the field.

AB  - The river types in Wallonia (Belgium) were defined according to the system B of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) taking into account obligatory and optional factors synthesized in three criteria: 'size', 'slope' and 'natural region'. Under the hypothesis that benthic invertebrate assemblages would be specialized according to river type, a set of 627 faunal samples originating from an 11-year sampling period was tested to characterize river types with faunal assemblages. A multivariate approach led to gather 23 river types into seven groups exhibiting similar faunal assemblages. Using biocenotic metrics based on benthic invertebrate assemblages (e.g., the French standard IBGN), type-specific reference conditions and ecological status class limits were defined for each 'natural' river type group. Ecological potential was defined for heavily modified and for artificial (i.e., man-made canals) types. An,ecological status' evaluation strategy was therefore developed and applied in the southern - and more natural - part of Wallonia, where many reference sites were available. In the northern part of Wallonia (i.e., the 'Loess region') where no high quality site was available, the expert judgement took a larger part in the definition of the reference conditions and of the ecological status class limits, in addition to the calculations. Two independent distribution gradients of taxa assemblages resulted from multivariate ordination: a first 'saprobity axis', as the taxa-sensitivity to organic contamination was increasing from very resistant' taxa (mainly located in the 'Loess region') to 'sensitive' and 'very sensitive' taxa (from the river types belonging to the Condroz, the Famenne, the Arden and the Jurassic regions) and a second axis characterizing the Meuse-specific faunal assemblage, gathering exotic species and typical limnophilous taxa of large heavily modified rivers. The ecological status monitoring management system developed in this. study - i.e., the definition of faunal river type groups, related reference conditions and ecological status class limits - represents a proposal to be integrated in the ecological status assessment of biological elements for the implementation of the WFD and was tested in Wallonia. For the period 2000-2002 involving 349 different sites, the element 'benthic invertebrate fauna' was in that way classified 'high status' for 31.5% of sites, 'good status' for 31.5% and below 'good status' for 37% of sites. The best ecological status (i.e., 100% 'high' and 'good' status) was found in river type 'Arden's xenotrophic brooks with strong slope' and in river types 'large rivers with medium slope'. The worst status was found in river types 'Loess brooks and rivers with medium slope'.

AB  - The green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata has been widely used in ecological risk assessment, usually based on the impact of the toxicants in the alga growth. However, the physiological causes that lead algal growth inhibition are not completely understood. This work aimed to evaluate the biochemical and structural modifications in P. subcapitata after exposure, for 72 h, to three nominal concentrations of Cd(II), Cr(VI), Cu(II) and Zn(II), corresponding approximately to 72 h-EC10 and 72 h-EC50 values and a high concentration (above 72 h-EC90 values). The incubation of algal cells with the highest concentration of Cd(II), Cr(VI) or Cu(II) resulted in a loss of membrane integrity of 16,38 and 55%, respectively. For all metals tested, an inhibition of esterase activity, in a dose-dependent manner, was observed. Reduction of chlorophyll a content, decrease of maximum quantum yield of photosystem II and modification of mitochondrial membrane potential was also verified. In conclusion, the exposure of P. subcapitata to metals resulted in a perturbation of the cell physiological status. Principal component analysis revealed that the impairment of esterase activity combined with the reduction of chlorophyll a content were related with the inhibition of growth caused by a prolonged exposure to the heavy metals.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the integrity of two forest fragments in Rio Negro Pantanal sub-region, using coleopterans as environmental indicators. The study was carried out at Santa Emilia Farm in the Rio Negro sub-region, municipality of Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul (19 degrees 30' 18 '' S and 55 degrees 36' 45 '' W). Two sites were selected, locally denominated as "cordilheiras" (narrow and elongated strands of elevated soil), one with low degree of anthropic disturbance (CL) and the other, currently undergoing restoration process (TD). The sampling sites were determined using a GPS device. Ten pit-fall traps containing water and detergent were used for the specimens sampling, which were screened and identified. Abundance, richness, diversity and similarity were determined. Abundance was higher for CL (n=277) than for TD (n=251). The same was observed for the diversity indices, CL showed H'=2.83 bit. individual(-1) and TD=2.48 bit. individual(-1), confirming the interferences made for abundance. Specimens of ten families were captured in CL area and seven families in TD area, indicating higher richness in CL, when compared to TD. The linear correlation coefficient (p > 0.05) indicates that both areas are significantly different, showing similarity value of 66.7%. The data show that the structure and disturbance degree in the environment integrity influence the composition of beetles fauna, causing the increase of abundance, richness and diversity in anthropogenic environments undergoing the early stage of regeneration.

AB  - Numerous oil and gas (O&G) installations worldwide will need to be decommissioned in the near future. Complete removal of subsea structures is often the default approach although some regions retain structures under rigs-to-reefs programs. Here, we reviewed the published literature to understand the status of global research on decommissioning, and specifically identify gaps in ecological knowledge. We estimated the frequency of different research categories (i.e., themes, and spatial/temporal scales), and tested the assumption that the number of papers across the categories of each research aspect was even in distribution. However, the frequency of studies focusing on biodiversity at a local (<100 km2) scale (relative to regional and oceanic and pan-oceanic scales) were significantly higher; while other theme categories (e.g., ecotoxicology, connectivity, structural-integrity, restoration and other) were significantly lower than expected. Temporally, <1-year studies were more frequent than multiyear studies, but these frequencies did not significantly deviate from the assumed distribution of equal frequencies. We propose that further research be carried out to evaluate the benefits of both retention and removal of structures. Ecological research on decommissioning should extend its focus beyond biodiversity, to include eco-toxicology, structural-integrity, connectivity at larger spatial and temporal scales. This would provide a more holistic assessment of ecological impacts to inform sustainable and equitable development choices in multiple Blue Economy sectors, as we transition from offshore O&G to marine renewables.

AB  - Worldwide, many rivers cease flow and dry either naturally or owing to human activities such as water extraction. However, even when surface water is absent, diverse assemblages of aquatic invertebrates inhabit the saturated sediments below the river bed (hyporheic zone). In the absence of surface water or flow, biota of this zone may be sampled as an alternative to surface water-based ecological assessments. The potential of hyporheic invertebrates as ecological indicators of river health, however, is largely unexplored. We analysed hyporheic taxa lists from the international literature on temporary rivers to assess compositional similarity among broad-scale regions and sampling conditions, including the presence or absence of surface waters and flow, and the regional effect of hydrological phase (dry channel, non-flowing waters, surface flow) on richness. We hypothesised that if consistent patterns were found, then effects of human disturbances in temporary rivers may be assessable using hyporheic bioindicators. Assemblages differed geographically and by climate, but hydrological phase did not have a strong effect at the global scale. However, hyporheic assemblage composition within regions varied along a gradient of higher richness during wetter phases. This indicates that within geographic regions, hyporheic responses to surface drying are predictable and, by extension, hyporheic invertebrates are potentially useful ecological indicators of temporary river health. With many rivers now experiencing, or predicted to experience, lower flows and longer dry phases owing to climate change, the development of ecological assessment methods specific to flow intermittency is a priority. We advocate expanded monitoring of hyporheic zones in temporary rivers and recommend hyporheic invertebrates as potential bioindicators to complement surface water assessments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ecological risk assessors have a growing need for sensitive and rapid indicators of environmental exposures in aquatic ecosystems resulting from natural and synthetic estrogen-like compounds. Investigators developing subcellular exposure markers in traditional sentinel organisms must be vigilant about inherent variability of analyses, especially regarding regulatory and policy statements. Here, we report a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) assay for the detection of vitellogenin transcripts environmentally triggered in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). We demonstrate that our QPCR assay exhibits little inter- or intra-assay variability (21.7 and 11.9%, respectively). This method appears to be robust in terms of variability stemming from extrinsic sources, indicating that it may be readily transferable to laboratories having the requisite equipment. Our primary focus in development of this method derived from the observation that transcriptional responses of the vitellogenin gene (vtg) in fathead minnows demonstrated high biological variability between identically treated individuals, even under controlled laboratory conditions (coefficient of variation, > 100%). This variability was not seen in other genes from the same RNA preparations that we examined, suggesting that it is specific to the vitellogenin response. Our data and those of others suggest that variability in vtg expression is common to a number of aquatic vertebrates, which is indicative of genetic causation. Despite a relatively high degree of variability in vtg transcription, this method is sensitive enough to detect exposures of 5.0 ng 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)/L within 24 It of exposure, and it has the ability to discriminate 10.0 and 5.0 ng EE2/L within 48 h. The vitellogenin QPCR assay is a highly sensitive, comparatively rapid, and inexpensive method for the detection and characterization of exposure to environmental estrogens and estrogen mimics.

AB  - Pasture degradation in the Brazilian Cerrado, the second largest biome in South America, is a widespread problem that leads to serious environmental consequences. Thus pasture restoration is crucial, not only because of the economic importance of meat production in Brazil, but also for mitigation of soil erosion and the effects of climate change. Furthermore, ecosystem productivity depends on nutrient cycling and organic matter transformation in soils, highlighting the need to better understand the biological functioning of soil in natural and managed systems. Soil microbiota can be analyzed to monitor changes in soil functions, thereby serving as an indicator of ecological restoration. In the present study, we used a barcoded pyrosequencing approach to assess soil bacterial communities under three different conditions: a native cerrado area, an active pasture, and a degraded pasture that was planted with native tree species. In the three study areas, Acidobacteria was dominant phylum (20-38%), followed by Proteobacteria (8-13%), AD3 (4-12%), Verrucomicrobia (3-11%), and Firmicutes (3-8%). However, the results demonstrated a clear differentiation of soil microbial communities under native vegetation cover and pasture regardless of rainfall seasonality. The higher abundance of AD3 in the native cerrado area was an important variable differentiating natural and managed areas. Comparing the two pasture areas, the pasture under restoration treatment differed from the active pasture in terms of abundance of the most dominant phyla in the rainy period but not in the dry period. Proteobacteria was lower in the degraded pasture planted with native trees than in the active pasture, while the relative abundance of Acidobacteria showed the opposite trend. Changes in the abundance of main bacterial phyla even in the initial phases of the restoration process, point out for the relevance of microbiological parameters as additional indicators in the monitoring of degradation recovery.

AB  - Saline lakes are threatened all over the world and their conservation has been a key issue. Various diversity indices are available for ecological status assessments, however, with poorly explored relevance and applicability in saline, alkaline pans. Therefore, traditional diversity measures (species richness and Shannon diversity) and taxonomic distinctness indices (Average [AvTD] and Variance of Taxonomic Distinctness [VarTD]) were tested in more than 100 sampling sites of 39 soda pans in Central-Europe to find sufficient indicators of the ecological condition and simultaneously to facilitate their preservation according to the modern conservation practices. Results of the analyses showed that healthy soda pan ecosystems with high level of natural stress and reduced habitat heterogeneity are characterized by low diversity diatom assemblages. In soda pans where the stress can be extremely high from natural reasons, oligopoly of closely related species can develop: the average taxonomic distinctness appeared between genus and family level. The non-DNA-sequence based phylogenetic diversity measures (AvTD and VarTD), were generally sensitive to the trophic state of the lakes, in contrast to traditional diversity metrics, which were unequivocally indicative for the special physical and chemical parameters (e.g. conductivity, pH) of the soda pans. In some cases, when the response of the diversity measures for a given environmental variable (pH, temperature) overlapped, the AvTD was found to be a more precise indicator of the environmental changes (pH) than traditional ones. The decreasing tendency of the AvTD along the intensified natural impact may be explained by the long available time for the species to adapt to these special environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The ecosystem services approach is an established framework for the balanced evaluation of ecological, economic and social landscape resources. It promotes functional synergies (win-win situations) as well as trade-offs among various benefits resulting from ecosystem processes. Spatial aspects of heterogeneity and configuration play a major role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services and hence in human wellbeing. Cultural artifacts also contribute to landscape functionality. Because of the underlying areal aspects, an additional term, landscape service has been proposed and is increasingly used (Termorshuizen and Opdam. 2009). We take a particular interest in spatial aspects of this framework and the optimization of trade-offs between landscape services.
   Firstly, spatial heterogeneity is assessed by means of landscape metrics computed as indicators for landscape services. Landscape heterogeneity is a key measure of biodiversity and contributes to several valuable functions. Habitat connectivity and other measures of landscape structure are also essential criteria for the behavior of metapopulations and for recreational value.
   Secondly, service providing areas (SPAs) are discussed as the areal basis for service provision. Similarly, service benefiting areas (SBAs) and connecting areas (SCAs) for the transfer of matter, energy and organisms between them are investigated. Place-based assessment addresses such areas. We thus show possibilities for estimating and evaluating landscape units.
   Thirdly, the landscape consists of the natural environment, artifacts from past human use, current human activity and even social thinking. The landscape services approach in a wider sense allows us to take social/cultural services better into account because they depend strongly on heritage assets, structural characteristics, historical conditions end even cultural specifics; which can hardly be subsumed to ecosystems. Place-based assessment is an appropriate solution for combining several spatial categories. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - River scientists are increasingly asked to provide recommendations about the amount and timing of water flows needed to support ecosystem health. The need for scientifically credible environmental flow assessments and the limited availability of resources to conduct in-depth studies place a premium on methods that can be readily applied at low cost. The Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) software program was originally developed by The Nature Conservancy in the 1990s to quickly process daily hydrologic records to enable characterization of natural water conditions and facilitate evaluations of human-induced changes to flow regimes. The evolution of the IHA software is discussed, including recent revisions and additions to the IHA that have improved its utility in environmental flow-setting processes. Drawing from holistic methodologies developed around the world, the ability to calculate characteristics of five components of flow important to river ecosystem health - extreme low flows, low flows, high-flow pulses, small floods and large floods - has been added to the IHA. A practical advantage of these environmental flow components is that an environmental flow prescription based upon them can be readily implemented in most water management settings. Frequently used as a one-time generator of flow statistics, the value of the IHA increases when used interactively with ecological models. A process for linking IHA output to an ecological model to explore flow-ecology relationships within an adaptive management context is presented and demonstrated through its application on the Green River, Washington. The IHA used in conjunction with ecological models facilitates the creation and testing of flow-ecology hypotheses, formulation of water and land protection or restoration goals, and development of a focused research and monitoring program, all important components of environmental flow-setting processes.

AB  - A comprehensive database, containing biological and chemical information, collected in the frame work of the bilateral interdisciplinary MARS project ("biological indicators of natural and man-made changes in marine and coastal waters") during the years 1995-1997 in the coastal environment of the North Sea, was subjected to a multivariate statistical evaluation. The MARS project was designated to combine a variety of approaches and to develop a set of methods for the employment of biological indicators in pollution monitoring and environmental quality assessment. In total, nine ship cruises to four coastal sampling sites were conducted; 765 fish and 384 mussel samples were analysed for biological and chemical parameters. Additional information on the chemical background at the sampling sites was derived from sediment samples, collected at each of the four sampling sites. Based on the available chemical data in sediments and black mussel (Mytilus edulis) a pollution gradient between the selected sites, was established. The chemical body burden of flounder (Platichthys flesus) from these sites, though, did not reflect this gradient equally clear. In contrast, the biological information derived from measurements in fish samples displayed significant a regional as well as a temporal pattern. A multivariate bioindicator data matrix was evaluated employing a factor analysis model to identify relations between selected biological indicators, and to improve the understanding of a regional and temporal component in the parameter response. In a second approach, applying the k-means algorithm on the data matrix, two significantly different clusters of samples, characterised by the current health status of the fish, were extracted. Using this classification a temporal, and in the second order, a less pronounced spatial effect was evident. Tn particular, during July 1996, a clear sign of deteriorating environmental conditions was extracted from the biological data matrix.

AB  - Exploitation of freshwater resources is essential for sustenance of human existence and alteration of rivers, lakes and wetlands has facilitated economic development for centuries. Consequently, freshwater biodiversity is critically threatened, with stream ecosystems being the most heavily affected. To improve the status of freshwater habitats, e.g. in the context of the European Water Framework Directive and the US Clean Water Act, it is essential to implement the most effective restoration measures and identify the most suitable indicators for restoration success. Herein, several active and passive bioindication approaches are reviewed in light of existing legal frameworks, current targets and applicable implementation of river restoration. Such approaches should move from the use of single biological indicators to more holistic ecological indicators simultaneously addressing communities, multiple life stages and habitat properties such as water quality, substrate composition and stream channel morphology. The proposed Proceeding Chain of Restoration (PCoR) can enable the integration of natural scientific, political and socioeconomic dimensions for restoration of aquatic ecosystems and associated services. Generally, an analysis that combines target species-based active bioindication with community-based passive bioindication and multivariate statistics seems to be most suitable for a holistic evaluation of restoration success, as well as for the monitoring of stream ecosystem health. Since the response of biological communities to changing environmental conditions can differ between taxonomic groups and rivers, assessments at the ecosystem scale should include several levels of biological organisation. A stepwise evaluation of the primary factors inducing disturbance or degradation is needed to integrate increasing levels of complexity from water quality assessments to the evaluation of ecological function. The proposed PCoR can provide a step-by-step guide for restoration ecologists, comprising all planning steps from the determination of the conservation objectives to the use of ecological indicators in post-restoration monitoring.

AB  - Despite strong demand for information to support the sustainable use of Australia's natural resources and conserve environmental values and despite considerable effort and investment, nation-wide environmental data collection and analysis remains a substantially unmet challenge. We review progress in producing national environmental reports and accounts, identify challenges and opportunities, and analyse the potential role of research in addressing these. Australia's low and concentrated population density and the short history since European settlement contribute to the lack of environmental data. There are additional factors: highly diverse data requirements and standards, disagreement on information priorities, poorly measurable management objectives, lack of coordination, over-reliance on researchers and businesses for data collection, lack of business engagement, and short-term, project-based activities. New opportunities have arisen to overcome some of these challenges: enhanced monitoring networks, standardisation, data management and modelling, greater commitment to share and integrate data, community monitoring, increasing acceptance of environmental and sustainability indicators, and progress in environmental accounting practices. Successes in generating climate, water and greenhouse gas information appear to be attributable to an unambiguous data requirement, considerable investment, and legislative instruments that enhance data sharing and create a clearly defined role for operational agencies. Based on the analysis presented, we suggest six priorities for research: (1) common definitions and standards for information that address management objectives, (2) ecological measures that are scalable from local to national level, (3) promotion of long-term data collection and reporting by researchers, (4) efficient satellite and sensor network technologies and data analysis methods, (5) environmental modelling approaches that can reconcile multiple data sources, and (6) experimental accounting to pursue consistent, credible and relevant information structures and to identify new data requirements. Opportunities exist to make progress in each of these areas and help secure a more sustainable future. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the close linking between the biosphere and atmosphere, there are clear impacts of changes in climate, atmospheric deposition of nutrients/pollutants and land use (Global Changes) on the terrestrial biosphere. Lichens, with a direct dependence on atmospheric conditions, are much more affected by their immediate microclimate than by the ecosystem's prevailing macroclimate. In contrast to higher plants, poikilohydric organisms have different mechanisms of water and CO2 exchange. The application of stable isotopes to the understanding of the mechanisms that are fundamental to lichen gas exchange and water uptake is a promising tool for the evaluation of lichen response to environmental changes. Indeed, lichens have been shown to be influenced by a large number of natural and anthropogenic environmental factors, serving as ecological indicators. Thus, we may use these organisms to model the impact of key global change drivers, such as nitrogen deposition and biodiversity changes, at local scale. Particularly useful is the application of the Lichen Diversity Value (LDV) in order to evaluate the impact of global drivers. Moreover, it has been shown that these indices, associated with main photobiont types, green-algae (LDVch) or cyanobacteria (LDVcyh), and/or nitrophilous versus oligotrophic species, were good candidates as ecological indicators. Besides mapping with high spatial resolution the effects of climate alterations, lichen functional groups could also be used as an early-warning system in order to detect the first effects of climate change in ecosystems before sudden shifts occur on other components that may be less sensitive. Clearly, lichens possess the adequate traits to be used as powerful indicators of complex interactions between atmosphere and biosphere, and thus can generate potentially interesting models for global change drivers.

AB  - Safeguarding the environment is one of the most serious modern challenges, as increasing amounts of chemical compounds are produced and released into the environment, causing a serious threat to the future health of the Earth as well as organisms and humans on a global scale. Ecotoxicology is an integrative science involving different physical, chemical, biological, and social aspects concerned with the study of toxic effects caused by natural or synthetic pollutants on any constituents of ecosystems, including animals (including humans), plants, or microorganisms, in an integral context. In recent decades, this science has undergone considerable development by addressing environmental risk assessments through the biomonitoring of indicator species using biomarkers, model organisms, and nanocompounds in toxicological assays. Since a single taxon cannot be representative of complex ecotoxicological effects and mechanisms of action of a chemical, the use of test batteries is widely accepted in ecotoxicology. Test batteries include properly chosen organisms that are easy to breed, adapt easily to laboratory conditions, and are representative of the environmental compartment under consideration. One of the main issues of toxicological and ecotoxicological research is to gain a deeper understanding of how data should be obtained through laboratory and field approaches using experimental models and how they could be extrapolated to humans. There is a tendency to replace animal tests with in vitro systems and to perform them according to standardized analytical methods and the rules of the so-called good laboratory practice (GLP). This paper aims to review this topic to stimulate both efforts to understand the toxicological and ecotoxicological properties of natural and synthetic chemicals and the possible use of such data for application to humans.

AB  - In a cross-disciplinary project (LEGATO) combining inter- and transdisciplinary methods, we quantify the dependency of rice-dominated socio-ecological systems on ecosystem functions (ESF) and the ecosystem services (ESS) the integrated system provides. In the collaboration of a large team including geo- and bioscientists, economists, political and cultural scientists, the mutual influences of the biological, climate and soil conditions of the agricultural area and its surrounding natural landscape have been analysed. One focus was on sociocultural and economic backgrounds, another on local as well as regional land use intensity and biodiversity, and the potential impacts of future climate and land use change. LEGATO analysed characteristic elements of three service strands defined by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA): (a) provisioning services: nutrient cycling and crop production; (b) regulating services: biocontrol and pollination; and (c) cultural services: cultural identity and aesthetics. However, in line with much of the current ESS literature, what the MA called supporting services is treated as ESF within LEGATO. As a core output, LEGATO developed generally applicable principles of ecological engineering (EE), suitable for application in the context of future climate and land use change. EE is an emerging discipline, concerned with the design, monitoring and construction of ecosystems and aims at developing strategies to optimise ecosystem services through exploiting natural regulation mechanisms instead of suppressing them. Along these lines LEGATO also aims to create the knowledge base for decision-making for sustainable land management and livelihoods, including the provision of the corresponding governance and management strategies, technologies and system solutions.

AB  - Wetlands play an important role in sustaining ecosystems on the earth, which regulate water resources, adjust local climate and produce food for human beings, etc. However, wetlands are facing huge challenges due to human activities and other natural evolution, such as area shrinkage, function weakening and biodiversity decrease, and so on, therefore, some wetlands need to be urgently restored. In this study, the main technology components of close-to-natural restoration of wetlands were summarized. The ecological water requirement and water resource allocation can be optimized for the water balance between social, economy and ecology, which is a key prerequisite for maintaining wetland ecosystem. The pollution of wetland sediments and soils can be assessed by various indicators to provide the scientific basis for natural restoration of wetland base, and suitable strategies should be taken according to the actual conditions of wetland bases. The hydrological connectivity in wetlands and with related water system can be numerically simulated to make the optimal plan for improvement of hydrological connectivity. The ecological restoration of wetlands with the synergetic function of plants, animals and microorganisms was summarized, to improve the quality of wetland water environment and maintain the ecosystem stability. Based on the wetland close-to-natural restoration strategies, a brief ecological restoration plan for a typical wetland, Zaozhadian Wetland, near Xiong'an New Area in the north China was proposed from water resource guarantee, base pollution management, hydrological connectivity improvement and biological restoration. The close-to-natural restoration shows more effective, sustainable and long-lasting and thus a practical prospect.

AB  - This study reviews published information on Mugil cephalus from around the world, with recent genetic studies indicating that the flathead mullet may indeed be a species complex. Disciplines that are covered range from the taxonomy, genetics and systematics, through a variety of biological and ecological attributes, to biomarker and fisheries studies. The eurytopic nature of M. cephalus is emphasized, with the migratory life history covering a succession of very different aquatic environments (e.g. rivers, estuaries, coastal lakes/lagoons, marine littoral, open ocean), each of which is occupied for varying lengths of time, depending on the population characteristics within a region and the life-history stage of the species. Interpretation of these movements over time has been greatly enhanced by the use of otolith microchemistry which has enabled scientists to map out the different habitats occupied by individual fish at the different life stages. The range of physico-chemical attributes within these environments necessitates a wide tolerance to differing conditions, especially with regard to salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and temperature, all of which are discussed in this review. The importance of M. cephalus to the ecological functioning of coastal systems is emphasized, as well as the pivotal role that this species fulfills in fisheries in some parts of the world. The parasites range from internal trematode and cestode infestations, to external branchyuran and copepod parasites, which use M. cephalus as either an intermediate or final host. The value of the flathead mullet as a biomarker for the monitoring of the health of coastal habitats is discussed, as well as its potential as an indicator or sentinel species for certain ecosystems.

AB  - Altered rivers and managed flows are a hallmark of civilization and dams are a principal agent of alteration. Peak dam construction occurred at the turn of the last century in Western countries, and many of the largest dams are reaching the end of their service life. As a result, dam operators are increasingly facing a complex renewal/removal decision-making process in a large part because the economic and social values of dams have changed. The Mactaquac Hydroelectric Generating Station (New Brunswick, Canada), operated by NB Power Corporation (NB Power), is Canada's 25th largest dam and it is reaching the end of its service life. A decision is required for the dam's future state and three options were originally proposed: renew, rebuild, or remove. An overarching science framework was developed with NB Power to inform and support decision-making for the dam's decision process and an impending Environmental Impact Assessment. The framework guides research and monitoring for dam renewal/removal using science-based solutions that aim to minimize impacts on the aquatic environment while supporting an efficient and cost-effective decision-making process. The framework has five components: (a) establish long-term baselines of environmental conditions; (b) develop normal ranges describing the river's natural variability; (c) integrated physical and biological modelling; (d) assess the specific and cumulative state of fish passage; and (e) create and sustain a user-friendly geospatial data management system. In this paper we present a case study that implements the science framework (Part 1) through the Mactaquac Aquatic Ecosystem Study (MAES) with a view to revisit and assess its final impact post-project completion (Part 2).

AB  - Ecological risk assessment, aiming at evaluating a wide range of undesirable consequences initiated by a possible eco-environmental hazard, has been the center of concern for ecosystem management in recent years. However, when it comes to disturbed natural ecosystems, most models developed for ecological risk assessment are restricted to instant cause-effect computation of single factors and often ignore the indirect effects, therefore fail to implement a holistic assessment at an ecosystem scale when interactions of different risk receptors are obvious. In this study, we developed a risk-based network model based on a new control analysis termed control allocation and a conceptual conversion of flow currency in NEA. By taking a river ecosystem intercepted by dam construction as an example, risk propagation between all functional guilds of the ecosystem concerning both direct risk and integral risk dynamic were quantified and illustrated in the network model. The results of this new risk assessment showed that there were significant differences between network integral risk and input risk, and although the phytoplankton received the instantaneous impact of chromium pollution among all the functional guilds, it was the piscivorous fish which obtain the greatest overall risk threat. On the basis of the model results, we proposed the network-based indicators for assessing the system-wide risk condition and component-specific risk scenarios of disturbed ecosystems exposed to single or multiple stressors. This study could provide a novel perspective and methodology for assessing ecological risk at the system scale, and concurrently, serve as an elicitation of how we can effectively evaluate ecosystems on the same analytic basis of information-based networks.

AB  - Spatial processes are increasingly associated with species distributions in freshwaters. However, these processes are usually neglected in bioassessment techniques, which may introduce uncontrolled variation in ecological indicators used to express human disturbance. We used partial linear regression to quantify the relative importance of natural variables, human disturbance and spatial variables in structuring variation in boreal lake status indicators based on six biological indicator groups (phytoplankton, macrophytes, diatoms, littoral and profundal macroinvertebrates and fish). We found that, of the pure fractions, human disturbance explained most variation (7-32%) of the ecological quality ratios (EQRs) for all groups, with the exception of littoral macroinvertebrate metric, which was most controlled by natural and spatial variables (15% and 16%, respectively). In addition, pure fractions of natural and spatial variables and joint fractions of different explanatory variable groups structured all biological metrics to various degrees. Phytoplankton, diatom and profundal macroinvertebrate EQRs responded purest to human disturbance but only weakly to pure natural or spatial variation. Our work demonstrates that spatial processes and spatial structuring of the environment can bias bioassessment techniques and hinder the detection of human impact. Thus, it is important to acknowledge spatial autocorrelation, context of metacommunity dynamics, species dispersal traits and variable spatial extent when defining reference conditions and bioassessment techniques for different biological groups. More research is needed to better understand the relative role of spatial processes on ecological metrics originated from different freshwater ecosystems. To this end, our work provides an example of how sources of variation can be identified to increase accuracy in freshwater bioassessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tropical rivers and wetlands are recognized as one of the greatest and most abundant ecosystems in terms of ecological and social benefits. However, climate change, damming, overfishing, water pollution, and the introduction of exotic species threaten these ecosystems, which puts about 65% of river flow and aquatic ecosystems under a moderate to high level of threat. This paper aims to assess the environmental flow of the Selangor River based on the hydrological index method using the Global Environmental Flow Calculator (GEFC) and Indicators of Hydrological Alterations (IHA) software. The daily flow data collected by the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID), Malaysia, over a 60-year period (1960-2020) was used in this study to assess the Selangor River flow alterations. As per the results, the river flow has had two distinct periods over the last 60 years. In the first period, the river flows without any alteration and has a natural flow with high flood pulses and low flow pulses. While in the second, or post-impact, period, the flow of the river has a steady condition throughout the year with very little fluctuations between the dry and wet seasons of the year. From the overall comparison of the pre- and post-impact periods, it can be concluded that the minimum flow in the dry seasons of the year has increased, while the maximum flow has decreased in the monsoon seasons during the post-impact period. As a result, the Flow Duration Curve (FDC) and Environmental Management Class (EMC) analysis of the river flow recommends that the Selangor River be managed under EMC "C" to provide sufficient water for both human use and ecosystem conservation, which would also help to avoid a water level drop in the reservoirs. However, further holistic studies are suggested for a detailed analysis of the effects of the dams on aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem services in the Selangor River Basin.

AB  - Dung beetles are excellent indicators of ecosystem ecological integrity, accomplishing an essential role in nutrient cycling process that includes fertilization and soil aeration. Nevertheless, very little is known about the influence of season variation on the assemblage composition and ecological function of dung beetles from high Andean zones. We aimed to investigate the seasonal effect on the diversity and ecological function of dung beetles in terms of biomass. We sampled two pasture patches of the "Reserva Biologica Encenillo", located in Cundinamarca-Colombia, using ten pitfall traps baited with feces placed 50 m apart for 24 hours. This sample design was replicated during each season (dry, transition, and rain). A significant seasonal variation was documented, demonstrating an important association with the rainy season. Significant differences were found for the biomass between species and seasons. The species with the highest biomass was Homocopris achamas. It is evident that high Andean pastures assemblages have low diversity, due to the strong human disturbance, the pressures associated with the altitude, and the evolutionary dynamics of these regions. The marked seasonality of the registered species and the close association with the rainy season are consistent with the pattern established for the Neotropical region. Likewise, a strong seasonal variation of the biomass is evident, which could have a significant impact on the ecological functionality and the ecosystem services in this habitat. In future studies, it is necessary to quantify the functional contribution of the species and their seasonal variation to contribute to their conservation.

AB  - Biomonitoring of least disturbed areas is a crucial issue to accurately assess the ecological status of surface waters and ensure their sustainability. Diatom metrics are important tools for the assessment of environmental conditions of lotic ecosystems to achieve environmental sustainability. The present study was aimed to evaluate the ecological status of least disturbed areas in the Antalya River basin (Turkey) using diatom indices developed from different ecoregion. Diatom species such as Cymbella excisa, Achnanthidium minutissimum, Cocconeis euglypta, and Cocconeis placentula were the most contributing species to the dissimilarity of sampling stations between rainy and dry seasons. The first two axes of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) elucidated a strong (86%) correlation between diatom taxa and stressors. Results of the Monte Carlo permutation test indicated that total phosphorus (TP), water temperature, Tin (Sn), total organic carbon, zinc, and pH are significantly influential ecological factors on the distribution of diatom taxa among sampling stations. The Spearman correlation rank test indicated that diatom indices had significant positive and negative correlations with TP gradient. Results revealed that diatom indices developed from different ecoregions have different scores for the eco-assessment of similar sampling stations. European diatom indices mostly showed similar behavior in the bioassessment of the ecological status of rivers in the Antalya region compared to the different ecoregion. Among European diatom indices, TIT was more competitive and could give better results in the bio-evaluation of rivers in the Antalya River basin. Using diatom indices developed from different ecoregions may lead to an erroneous assessment of water quality. Accordingly, ecoregional specific diatom metrics are needed to accurately determine the surface water quality.

AB  - Offshore geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO2), known as offshore carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), has been under active investigation as a safe, effective mitigation option for reducing CO2 levels from anthropogenic fossil fuel burning and climate change. Along with increasing trends in implementation plans and related logistics on offshore CCS, thorough risk assessment (i.e. environmental impact monitoring) needs to be conducted to evaluate potential risks, such as CO2 gas leakage at injection sites. Gas leaks from offshore CCS may affect the physiology of marine organisms and disrupt certain ecosystem functions, thereby posing an environmental risk. Here, we synthesize current knowledge on environmental impact monitoring of offshore CCS with an emphasis on biological aspects and provide suggestions for better practice. Based on our critical review of preexisting literatures, this paper: 1) discusses key variables sensitive to or indicative of gas leakage by summarizing physico-chemical and ecological variables measured from previous monitoring cruises on offshore CCS; 2) lists ecosystem and organism responses to a similar environmental condition to CO2 leakage and associated impacts, such as ocean acidification and hypercapnia, to predict how they serve as responsive indicators of short- and long-term gas exposure, and 3) discusses the designs of the artificial gas release experiments in fields and the best model simulation to produce realistic leakage scenarios in marine ecosystems. Based on our analysis, we suggest that proper incorporation of biological aspects will provide successful and robust long-term monitoring strategies with earlier detection of gas leakage, thus reducing the risks associated with offshore CCS.

AB  - In freshwater ecosystems, Chironomidae are currently considered indicators of poor water quality because the family is often abundant in degraded sites. However, it incorporates taxa with a large ecological and physiological diversity and different sensitivity to impairment. Yet, the usual identification of Chironomidae at coarse taxonomic levels (family or subfamily) masks genus and species sensitivities. In this study, we investigate the potential of taxonomic and functional (traits) composition of Chironomidae to detect anthropogenic disturbance. In this context, we tested some a priori hypotheses regarding the ability of Chironomidae taxonomic and trait compositions to discriminate Mediterranean streams affected by multiple stressors from least-disturbed streams. Both taxonomic and Eltonian trait composition discriminated sites according to their disturbance level. Disturbance resulted in the predicted increase of Chironomidae with higher number of stages with hibernation/diapause and of taxa with resistance forms and unpredicted increase of the proportion of taxa with longer life cycles and few generations per year. Life history strategies (LHS), corresponding to multivoltine Chironomidae that do not invest in hemoglobin and lack strong spring synchronization, were well adapted to all our Mediterranean sites with highly changeable environmental conditions. Medium-size animals favored in disturbed sites where the Mediterranean hydrological regime is altered, but the reduced number of larger-size/carnivore Chironomids suggests a limitation to secondary production. Results indicate that Chironomidae genus and respective traits could be a useful tool in the structural and functional assessment of Mediterranean streams. The ubiquitous nature of Chironomidae should be also especially relevant in the assessment of water bodies naturally poor in other groups such as the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, such as the lowland rivers with sandy substrates, lakes, or reservoirs.

AB  - Leaf and crown damage and discoloration characteristics are important variables when defining the health of eucalypt tree species and have been used as key indicators of environmental quality. These indicators can vary significantly over a few hectares, especially in mixed-species forests, making field-based environmental surveillance of crown condition an extremely expensive and logistically impractical task. Reflectance in narrow spectral wavelengths obtained from a field-based spectroradiometer and a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager 2 (CASI-2) were collected over eucalypt vegetation of varying condition in southeastern Australia and compared with leaf- and crown-based attributes including percent red foliage discoloration, percent leaf damage, and crown density and crown foliage condition. Of the leaf attributes sampled, percent leaf damage was well correlated with a red-green spectral index (r = 0.68, p < 0.01), and percent red discoloration was well correlated with the slope of the red-edge for selected species (r = 0.89, p < 0.001). Within-tree crown density was well correlated with the slope of the red-edge (r = 0.77, p < 0.001) and a previously published index of plant stress with crown foliage condition (r = 0.88, p < 0.01) for selected species. Despite evidence of strong interspecific variability, a set of narrow spectral wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared regions of the spectrum have been identified that will be useful in the development of forest ecosystem environmental quality indicators.

AB  - Understanding the ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects is critical for maintaining ecosystem health while meeting human water needs. It is, however, currently hindered by a lack of direct evidence on ecological impacts associated with this type of project particularly on water quality and fish communities. Here, we characterized patterns and variations of fish communities and water quality in five impounded lakes of the Chinese South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), with the aim of better understanding potential ecological impacts of inter-basin water transfers. We found that 1) the impacts of water transfer on water quality in the impounded lakes was generally characterized by hydrological parameters (e.g. total suspended solids, turbidity, transparency, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total hardness) in an upstream-downstream direction; 2) increased hydrological connectivity may have favored biological invasion (e.g. Tridentiger bifasciatus) and promoted a potential biotic homogenization among the impounded lakes: and 3) there was a pattern of decreased fish abundance and biomass from the upstream to downstream lakes with fish communities strongly driven by changing water quality patterns across the impounded lakes. These findings improve our understanding of ecological impacts of large-scale hydraulic projects and provide a significant basis for water agencies with similar water transfer systems to optimize their water transfer management in order to minimize ecological impacts.

AB  - Using data from a 17-year study of individually marked Blue Petrels, we examined how survival and breeding probability varied with experience and breeding status, and looked for costs of first reproduction, taking into account environmental and individual variability. Using multistate capture-recapture models with four states (inexperienced nonbreeders, first-time breeders, experienced breeders, and experienced nonbreeders). we found that first-time breeders had a lower probability of surviving and breeding in the next year than experienced breeders. Survival of first-time breeders was lower than that of inexperienced nonbreeders, indicating a cost of first reproduction. Survival of inexperienced individuals (both breeders and nonbreeders), but not of experienced ones, was negatively affected by poor environmental oceanographic conditions. The costs of reproduction for first-time breeders were particularly marked during harsh weather conditions. Survival and the probability of breeding in the next year for experienced birds were higher for breeders than for nonbreeders. Similarly, the probability of breeding in the next year for first-time breeders was higher than for inexperienced nonbreeders. This suggests heterogeneity in quality among individuals. Experienced breeders had a higher body condition than first-time breeders and nonbreeders. Body condition did not affect the probability of surviving or breeding in the next year. These results can be interpreted in the light of a change in the proportion of individuals with different survival (selection hypothesis: low-quality individuals die sooner). The inferiority of first-time breeders may be linked to a higher proportion of lower-quality individuals in younger age classes. First reproduction may act as a filter, selecting individuals of higher quality. Sea surface height, reflecting food availability, is probably a key selective agent.

KW  - SEA
AB  - Low-temperature scanning electron microscopy is a specialized technique shown to be appropriate for the high-resolution examination of unconsolidated sea floor sediments. Newly developed cryogenic sediment sampling techniques combined with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) protocols developed for the analysis of biological materials now permits the sampling of fully hydrated bottom sediments while preserving the structural integrity of the sampled material. This enables the direct observation of the sediment fabric as it exists at the seabed and the examination of delicate biological structures that are normally obliterated or distorted by the removal of water required for standard SEM preparation. This paper demonstrates the value of LTSEM and shows variation in microfabric structure between a station located on a spoil heap below an oil rig and a more remote (400 m distant) station. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) was also conducted on the frozen samples and provided support for the qualitative differences found between the two sites. The results suggest that an organic film was more pervasive on the drill spoil heap and that biological activity in the form of foraminifera was much more extensive on the remote site. Insufficient data has yet been collected to allow statistical analysis of the results, but the paper provides the first microfabric analyses of submerged spoil sediments using LTSEM and confirms the potential of this technique in terms of environmental assessment and analysis of the nature of the sediment fabric of oily, drill spoil heaps from a location in the North Sea.

AB  - This paper proposes an innovative risk-assessment strategy based on condition and importance criteria for power transformer maintenance in a transmission network. The condition assessment is performed by the analysis of different diagnosis methods such as electrical test, insulating oil test, and visual inspection. The importance assessment is evaluated from various aspects such as load criticality, impact on system stability, possibility of failure, failure consequence, damage to property, as well as social impact and environmental concerns. Weighting and scoring techniques are applied to determine the actual condition and importance of the power transformer with regard to condition and importance aspects. By combining the condition and importance assessment, the overall risk to the power transformer is assessed and differentiated into nine categories in the risk matrix from the lowest to the highest risk. Additionally, by applying distance d' technique, the risk-based assessment matrix for the power transformer can be identified into five zones: healthy, good, moderate, bad, and risky. These five zones are also represented by color indicators as green, blue, yellow, orange, and red, which are further interpreted to five steps of maintenance tasks. The transformer with longer distance d' is subjected to higher risk and should be maintained first. By this method, a total of 19 power transformers were analyzed and are presented as examples for risk-based maintenance. Then, risks of a total 598 power transformers are shown in the risk matrix. A computerized web application program is developed for practical implementation in a utility in Thailand. Finally, the systematic risk assessment and maintenance task of the power transformer fleet in Thailand are effectively managed. Thereby, the total maintenance cost of power transformer can be reduced. (c) 2014 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - In the 1960s and 1970s, acidification was identified as a major environmental problem in Scandinavia, Great Britain and North America. In Sweden, a liming program was launched in order to counteract the effects of acidification on surface waters. More than 30 years after large-scale liming began, there is still debate about whether liming actually achieves its goals, i.e., to prevent acidification in acid-sensitive surface waters and to restore natural conditions in acidified waters. We used Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and analogue matching of diatom assemblages in surface sediment samples (recent conditions) from 31 limed lakes and pre-industrial samples from 291 reference lakes to help answer the question as to whether the Swedish liming program achieves its goals. Diatoms are important primary producers in lakes and established indicator organisms for lake-water quality. First we compared pre-industrial with post-limed diatom communities to address the question whether liming causes unnatural conditions, i.e., diatom communities that have not previously occurred in Swedish lakes. Second, we addressed the issue of what is a realistic condition to use as a reference (natural condition) or a target in management programs. We found that the diatom communities in limed lakes were not different from the communities in the reference lakes. Most of the limed lakes had one or more analogues within the reference data set and many of them had at least one within-lake analogue. Hence, liming does not create unique diatom communities in lakes. Based on this and previous paleolimnological studies in Swedish lakes we suggest a conceptual model integrating the natural lake condition, the historical human impact, and the recent and contemporary human impact, when defining realistic targets in management programs.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are at risk of being impaired by various organic chemicals, however comprehensive largescale evaluations of waterbodies? status and trends are rare. Here, surface water monitoring data, gathered as part of the EU Water Framework Directive and comprising the occurrence of 352 organic contaminants (>8.3 mil. measurements; 2001?2015; 8213 sites) in 31 European countries, was used to evaluate past and current environmental risks for three aquatic species groups: fish, invertebrates, plants. Monitoring quality indices were defined per country and found to improve over time. Relationships became apparent between countries? monitoring quality index and their success in detecting contaminants. Across the EU, contaminants were more frequently found in recent years. Overall, 35.7% (n = 17,484) of sites exceeded at least one acute regulatory threshold level (RTL) each year, and average risks significantly increased over time for fish (? = 0.498, p = 0.01) and aquatic invertebrates (? = 0.429, p = 0.03). This indicates an increased chemical pressure to Europe?s waterbodies and overall large-scale threshold exceedances. Pesticides were identified as the main risk drivers (>85% of RTL exceedances) with aquatic invertebrates being most acutely at risk in Europe. Agricultural landuse was clearly identified as the primary spatial driver of the observed aquatic risks throughout European surface waters. Issues in monitoring data heterogeneity were highlighted and also followed by subsequent improvement recommendations, strengthening future environmental quality assessments. Overall, aquatic ecosystem integrity remains acutely at risk across Europe, signaling the demand for continued improvements.

AB  - China's river basin ecosystems are facing serious environmental and structural fragmentation problems. However, there are no complete ecological redlines specifically for watershed ecological conservation. This study considers the Xiangjiang River Basin (XJRB) to propose a framework delineating the ecological redline area (ERA) on a watershed scale and highlights policy recommendations. It combines several evaluating indicators for coupling the response mechanism between human demand and ecological protection. Overall, the water supply in the XJRB meets the social demand. However, water supply in some places, such as the core area of Changsha Zhuzhou Xiangtan Urban Agglomeration and the Hengyang urban area, is still insufficient. This study considers ecosystem service functions, ecological sensitivities, and social needs and estimates the ERA of the XJRB to be 36,057 km(2), accounting for 38% of the total watershed. The key ecological functional areas account for 60% of the total redline area and are concentrated in the upper reaches. Compared with the current method conducted at the national and administrative level, the redline area defined in this study by the sub-basin scale exhibits better connectivity and integrity. Moreover, the study can help ensure an accurate placement of the ecological redline while also providing an important reference for redline delineation of other river basins.

AB  - Ammonia tepida is a dominant benthic foraminifer colonizing intertidal mudflat sediments. Horizontal locomotion speeds were monitored using time-lapse image analysis over 6 and 24 h. Experimental conditions were based on foraminifera exposed to dry sediment re-suspended in artificial sea water (ASW) without any nutrient addition (condition DS), to combusted sediment re-suspended in in ASW also without any nutrient addition (condition CS), or to combusted sediment re-suspended in ASW enriched with either: nitrate, urea, glucose, soil extract (SE), extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), benthic diatoms (Entomoneis paludosa) or natural microphytobenthic assemblages (MPB). Significant differences were already measured after 6 h between A. tepida mean locomotion speeds at the different experimental conditions. However, differences were clearer after 24 h where the slowest A. tepida mean locomotion speed was measured in specimens placed in CS (1.00 +/- 0.30 mm h(-1)) and the highest mean locomotion speed in DS (2.99 +/- 0.22 mm h(-1)). Three different groups were defined according to their locomotion speed, (1) foraminifera exposed to DS had a locomotion speed significantly higher than all other conditions, (2) foraminifera placed in conditions enriched in SE, Glucose, Urea and EPS had intermediary locomotion speeds (1.8-2.5 mm h(-1)), and (3) conditions with foraminifera showing the lowest locomotion speeds (1-1.6 mm h(-1)) were CS, nitrate, MPB and E. paludosa. Thus, foraminifera exposed to organic matter (DS, SE, Glucose and Urea) showed faster locomotion speeds than foraminifera exposed to inorganic matter (CS, nitrate) or live preys (E. paludosa, MPB).
   Dissolved organic matter enrichment enhanced foraminifera locomotion speed, which might be a behavioural response to satisfy their carbon and/or nitrogen requirements, and the lowest locomotion speed observed when feeding on live preys might be a consequence of longer time required for live prey phagocytosis.

AB  - Invasive nitrogen-fixing plants drive vegetation dynamics and may cause irreversible changes in nutrient-limited ecosystems through increased soil resources. We studied how soil conditioning by the invasive alien Lupinus nootkatensis affected the seedling growth of co-occurring native plant species in coastal dunes, and whether responses to lupin-conditioned soil could be explained by fertilisation effects interacting with specific ecological strategies of the native dune species. Seedling performance of dune species was compared in a greenhouse experiment using field-collected soil from within or outside coastal lupin stands. In associated experiments, we quantified the response to nutrient supply of each species and tested how addition of specific nutrients affected growth of the native grass Festuca arundinacea in control and lupin-conditioned soil. We found that lupin-conditioned soil increased seedling biomass in 30 out of 32 native species; the conditioned soil also had a positive effect on seedling biomass of the invasive lupin itself. Increased phosphorus mobilisation by lupins was the major factor driving these positive seedling responses, based both on growth responses to addition of specific elements and analyses of plant available soil nutrients. There were large differences in growth responses to lupin conditioned soil among species, but they were unrelated to selected autecological indicators or plant strategies. We conclude that Lupinus nootkatensis removes the phosphorus limitation for growth of native plants in coastal dunes, and that it increases cycling of other nutrients, promoting the growth of its own seedlings and a wide range of dune species. Finally, our study indicates that there are no negative soil legacies that prevent re-establishment of native plant species after removal of lupins. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. The nets used in bottom trawl fisheries cause mortality of benthic invertebrates and this can decrease the long-term availability of prey to exploited fish species by reducing the abundance of benthic invertebrates. This may have consequences for the sustainability of fisheries.
   2. We assessed the impact of bottom trawling on the food availability of fish by comparing the condition of fish (as weight-at-length) in an area that had a steep commercial bottom-trawling gradient in the Irish Sea but otherwise homogeneous environmental conditions.
   3. We found that the condition of the important commercial flatfish plaice Pleuronectes platessa was negatively related to trawling frequency, and this could be explained by a reduced production of the infaunal invertebrates they feed on. Density-dependent changes in competition over food could not explain this difference. No effect of trawling on the condition of the flatfish dab Limanda limanda was detected. Whiting Merlangius merlangus feeds primarily on fish, and therefore, no effect of bottom trawling on its condition was expected or detected.
   4. This study therefore indicates that bottom trawl fisheries may have a negative effect on the condition of some of their target species, but not others, by reducing the abundance of their benthic prey.
   5. Synthesis and application. Bottom trawls may indirectly affect the population size and growth rate of the target fish species and result in lower fishing yields. Such reductions in the yield and sustainability of fisheries are highly undesirable. The effects of bottom trawls may be mitigated by the modification of fishing gears or by minimizing the area of the seabed fished by bottom trawls.

AB  - Iron-coated indicatorof reduction in soils (IRIS) devices have been used for nearly two decades to help assess and document reducing conditions in soils, and official guidance has been approved for interpreting these data. Interest in manganese (Mn)-coated IRIS devices has increased because Mn oxides are reduced under more moderately reducing conditions than iron (Fe) oxides (which require strongly reducing conditions), such that they are expected to be better proxies for some important ecosystem services like denitrification. However, only recently has the necessary technology become available to produce Mn-coated IRIS, and the need is now emerging for guidance in interpreting data derived from Mn IRIS. Ninety-six data sets collected over a 2-yr period from 40 plots at 18 study sites among eight states were used to compare the performance of Mn-coated IRIS with Fe-coated IRIS and to assess the effect of duration of saturation and soil temperature as environmental drivers on the reduction and removal of the oxide coating. It appears that the current threshold prescribed by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils for Fe-coated IRIS is appropriate for periods when soil temperatures are warmer (>11 degrees C), but is unnecessarily conservative when soil temperatures are cooler (5-11 degrees C). In contrast, Mn-coated devices are particularly useful early in the growing season when soil temperatures are cool. Our data show that when using a threshold of 30% removal of Mn oxide coatings there is essentially 100% confidence of the presence of reducing soil conditions under cool (<11 degrees C) conditions.

To assess the current stony coral community condition under different degrees of wave exposure at a marine protected area of the Gulf of Cazones (SW Cuba), two expeditions were carried out in May 2010 and June 2012. Four sampling sites were sampled at reef crests (1.5 m deep), and twelve at fore-reefs, at 10, 15 and 20 m deep in four geographic locations. Live coral cover, species richness and composition, colony density, and maximum diameter were assessed using the AGRRA 2001 methodology. Multivariate and non-parametric statistics were applied to compare sites. The coral community structure within reef crests was not homogenous. The observed variability of indicators apparently was determined by great coral mortality events resulting from natural disturbances that occurred in the past (hurricanes, bleaching and diseases). Fore reef coral communities displayed better condition and lower coral mortality than reef crests. Species richness and coral composition varied, while multivariate and statistical methods did not reveal site grouping with regard to wave exposure. The remaining biological condition indicators were similar among sites, except in the most exposed one, where coral cover and coral size were slightly lower. Wave exposure in the gulf of Cazones seemed not to have a significant influence on differences in condition and structure of the assessed coral communities.

AB  - Despite the long-term research on the use of hydraulic-hydrodynamic habitat models (HHMs) for predicting the response of aquatic biota to habitat alteration, their practical application in model-based environmental flow assessments (EFAs) has been limited due to reasons mainly associated with cost-effectiveness, time-efficiency, required expertise, and availability of hydroecological information. In this study, we demonstrate a cost-effective and time-efficient application of a benthic-invertebrate, two-dimensional, fuzzy rule-based EFA in a 277-m long reach in the downstream route of a regulated river in western Greece. Apart from developing ecosystem-based environmental flow (eflow) scenarios, we highlight the valuable features of HHMs, comment on their disadvantages, and propose working solutions to overcome them. The results of the study show that the hydrology-based eflow of 0.2m(3)/s, initially proposed by the managing authorities, is not sufficient to ensure the long-term functionality of the downstream benthic communities, as the ecosystem-based eflow ranged between 0.6 and 2m(3)/s. As social resilience relies heavily on ecological resilience, ecosystem-based approaches can ensure the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems. This study demonstrates, inter alia, that HHMs-based EFAs can be implemented cost-effectively and time-efficiently to serve as an accurate scientific basis for water managers and stakeholders, in search of the fine balance between anthropogenic water demand and long-term ecosystem integrity and functionality.

AB  - A major objective of environmental impact assessment (EIA) is prediction. Two major goals in science are: (1) explanation of observed phenomena, and (2) prediction. The EIA process makes use of the methods of academic science to provide the explanatory framework for the required data gathering which is needed for the scientifically valid prediction of effects. Follow-up monitoring after a development proceeds is required to test the predictions for their accuracy, important in both scientific and decision-making aspects of EIA. This testing is needed not only for future EIAs in the area, but also for ongoing project management. In boreal forest management, where EIA prediction is ecosystem-oriented rather than site-specific only, the EIA process needs to be tied to long-term, ecosystem-based forest management plans. This must be done via ongoing tests of predictions, and then by feeding the test-derived information back into a dynamic decisionmaking process. in Saskatchewan this unique and holistic application of the EIA process to long-term forest ecosystem management has been initiated by applying EIA to the twenty-year management plan required by the holder of any forest management agreement (FMA). This is an example of harnessing scientific predictive and testing capacity of the EIA process to set the stage for ecologically sustainable, integrated forest resource management. This also is an example of local action to address a global problem by ensuring the continued integrity of ecological processes in a portion of Canada's boreal forest.

AB  - Watershed management using torrent-control structures is an activity having more than 100 years history in Romania, So far, researches regarding works behaviour in service focused mainly on defining and assessing each damage type, without studying the interaction between them. Thus, damage classification criteria were substantiated taking into account nature and strength of the damages. This paper presents a methodology for assessing the condition of hydrotechnical structures by quantifying the cumulative effects of damages which occur with a significant frequency during their service. The model was created using a database, nationwide representative, with 3845 torrent-control structures. The identified damage types identified were weighted using multi-criteria analysis. Depending on the weight and strength off all damages occurred was calculated an indicator named "condition rate" (Ys). This new parameter may be used to track the impact of different features (structure age, components sizes, the position in the system, the construction materials, riverbed slope, geology of the area, etc.) on the condition of structures. By establishing the condition rate for all the structures within a collectivity (an entire watershed or catchment area, a single watercourse, a battery of works etc.), there may be made an analysis and a grading both at individual level and population-wide level, which lead to order the repairs or additions of new structures to existing hydrotechnical systems. Also, the model designed can be a part of a monitoring system regarding torrent-control structures, answering, thus, the requirements on this issue of the "National Strategy for Flood Risk Management" approved by the Romanian Government in 2010.

AB  - Emerging adulthood is a unique developmental stage during which significant transitions in living environment, social networks, personal responsibilities, and identity development occur. Stress associated with these transitions relates to increases in health-risk behaviors, such as substance use and high-risk sexual behavior. This research examined health-risk behavior outcomes associated with the Young Adult Family Check-Up (YA-FCU). The YA-FCU comprises three sessions: an initial interview, an ecological assessment, and a feedback session that integrates motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. This study measured treatment fidelity of the YA-FCU and the extent to which therapists adhered to principles of MI during feedback sessions. Therapists included both licensed psychologists and trainees. The study also examined the relationship between therapists' MI fidelity and client change talk (CT), in order to determine if MI fidelity and client CT predicted postintervention health-risk behaviors among emerging adults who participated in the YA-FCU. Measures of health-risk behaviors were collected pre- and postintervention. Results indicated overall adequate treatment fidelity. MI fidelity was positively related to client CT. Several indicators of MI fidelity predicted decreases in emerging adults' health-risk behaviors. For example, therapist ratio of reflections to questions predicted a decline in emerging adults' alcohol use frequency and marijuana use quantity. These results have important implications for YA-FCU training and implementation and indicate that MI consistent skills might be a mechanism of change in the YA-FCU intervention.

AB  - Adaptive management can be a very useful tool for assessing and improving coastal ecological engineering restoration projects. A shoreline restoration project using ecological engineering approaches to mitigate coastal erosion was developed and implemented in 2003 at Loyola Beach, Baffin Bay, TX. The project incorporated riprap, fiber matting, geotextile, and vegetation as an alternative to conventional hard structures for erosion control. As part of the restoration expansion, a detailed evaluation of the previous project was completed at several levels, including the landscape, geotechnical design, environmental and ecological considerations, and social and economic factors. The findings indicated that the vegetation and its underlying geotechnical integrity have played an important role in erosion mitigation. Overall the project was successful in the protection of the shoreline and was shown to be more ecologically beneficial than other hard structures. Based on the preliminary success of the initial project, the restoration techniques were adapted for another beach extension to the west. The assessment did reveal some weaknesses in the original project design including the need for more substantial toe protection and periodic maintenance requirements. Based on these assessments, some additional new methods for the restoration extension were proposed and implemented. The broader applicability of this restoration approach outside the local region has been presented through several outreach activities and delivered to coastal planners and land owners throughout the Texas Coastal Bend and Northern Mexico.

AB  - AimsThis paper examined the relationships among hygiene indicators in take-away foodservice establishments and the impact of climatic conditions.
   Methods and ResultsA total of 7545 samples were collected encompassing 2050 from food handlers' (HF) hands, 3991 from stainless steel food contact surfaces (FCS) and 1504 samples from plastic FCS. The study covered a period of 43months. Hygiene-indicator bacteria (total plate count, Enterobacteriaceae Staphylococcus) were determined from the samples collected from 559 different take-away establishments. Climatic conditions were evaluated in respect to the outside temperature, pressure, humidity and precipitation. Logistic regression confirmed that the presence of precipitation was associated with an increased likelihood of exhibiting both Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus on HF' hands as well as exhibiting Enterobacteriaceae on both types of FCS. Numerable Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus levels on HF' hands were detected when higher outside temperatures and higher precipitations occurred. Higher outside temperatures were observed when Enterobacteriaceae were detected on both plastics (P<005) and stainless steel (P>005). Higher precipitation was observed when Enterobacteriaceae was detected on stainless steel while in contrast, this indicator was detected on plastics in periods with lower precipitation.
   ConclusionsThis research confirms relationships between hygiene indicators in take-aways and climatic conditions, mostly temperature and precipitation.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study provides another perspective into the possible nature of cross-contamination and foodborne outbreaks originating in foodservice establishments and brings to attention the necessity of analysing various climatic conditions.

AB  - Ecological security patterns are employed to characterize the health and integrity of an ecosystem. It is essential to achieve sustainable and high-quality development of cities and urban agglomerations and to enhance human well-being. Considering the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomerationd as an example, this paper proposes a technical framework for the delineation of ecological security patterns at the urban agglomeration scale with the objective of protecting and restoring mountains-rivers-forests-farmlands-lakes-grasslands. The ecological sources were indicated by the importance-sensitivity ecological assessment method. Ecological corridors were identified by a minimum resistance model, and the ecological security pattern was derived. Twenty-three important ecological source sites were identified within the urban agglomeration, mainly located in the southern part of the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration, with an area of 9122.36 km(2), accounting for 8.52% of the study area. The ecological sensitivity of the mountainous areas was relatively high, with ecological corridors showing a denser distribution in the south. The results of the study suggest that green infrastructure in the northern region should be strengthened, that the ecological functions of ecologically sensitive areas should be protected and enhanced, and that the connectivity of ecological corridors should be strengthened. The results provide guidance for the optimization of regional ecological security patterns for and the joint prevention and control of environmental pollution in the Guanzhong Plain.

AB  - Regional ecological assessments evaluate sustainability as an interaction among ecosystem services and stressors across changing landscapes. Using ecological assessments to inform ecosystem management activities relies on assessing functional linkages between ecosystem processes and ecosystem services, because ecosystem processes are the primary targets of ecosystem management. We undertook a review of regional ecological assessments in the Appalachian region of the United States to examine how forest-based ecosystem services, forest ecosystem processes, and their linkages are quantified. To provide context, we first give an overview of common ecological assessment frameworks, including risk, vulnerability, resilience, and indicator-based approaches. Assessments tended to target either ecosystem-level properties thought to be important for ecosystem service sustainability, or else to target specific ecosystem services or stressors. Forest ecosystem-level assessment most often relied on specific indicators for system properties such as integrity or health, but how those properties or their indicators were related to ecosystem services was typically not quantified. Individual ecosystem services were frequently assessed in terms of risk and vulnerability to specific external stressors, but linkages to ecosystem processes, and potential tradeoffs among ecosystem services, were infrequently quantified. Integrated system-level assessment and ecosystem service assessment can improve support for ecosystem management by advancing our understanding of dependencies on the ecosystem processes that are modified through management. Models that evaluate ecosystem services and underlying processes in a systems context offer one approach to do so.

AB  - Watershed ecological compensation, as an important means to protect the environment and promote the sustainable and coordinated development of upstream and downstream has wide concern in China. At present, the compensation accounting method only assesses water quality. When applied to some northern rivers represented by the Yongding River, which are facing water shortage, the assessment of water quality indicators alone cannot effectively compensate the ecosystem service providers for their expenditure on the environment. This paper proposes a transboundary water quality and quantity ecological compensation standard model, which couples the water quality ecological compensation standard of pollutant reduction and the water quantity ecological compensation standard based on the restoration cost method. We set up two scenarios using the model to calculate the amount of compensation payable under the actual scenario in 2018, which is USD 68.2 million. The amount of compensation under the local environmental policy target scenario is USD 10.6-82.668-529 million. It was concluded that the funds obtained from this model can cover the rehabilitation cost and meet the benefits of the upstream and downstream, making compensation funds more reasonable. However, based on the cross-sectional assessment, there is still a lack of integrity and comprehensiveness for the river basin. The development of watershed ecological compensation should move from the game of upstream and downstream interests to a win-win situation.

AB  - Three groups of cows representing three ranges of welfare in the production system were included in the study: two groups of Bruna dels Pirineus beef cattle maintained under different management systems (good and semiferal conditions) and a group of Alberes cows, a breed that lives in the mountains (hardest conditions).
   In order to identify new stress/welfare biomarkers, serum from Bruna cows living in both environments was subjected to DIGE labelling, two-dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-MS or ion trap MS. Identification was achieved for 15 proteins, which mainly belonged to three biological functions, the oxidative stress pathway (glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and paraoxonase (PON-1)), the acute phase protein family (Heremans Schmid glycoprotein alpha2 (alpha 2-HSG)) and the complement system.
   Biological validation included the Alberes breed. GPx and PON-1 were validated by an enzymatic assay and found to be higher and lower, respectively, in cows living in hard conditions. alpha 2-HSG was validated by ELISA and found to be reduced in hard conditions. Other biomarkers of the redox status were also altered by living conditions: protein carbonyl content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR).
   Our results show that changes in the redox system are the main adaptation of cows living in challenging environmental conditions.

AB  - A total of 14 surface (0-1cm) sediment grab samples and bottom water samples were collected at water depths varying from 0.8 to 2.5m in the Uppanar estuary. All the samples were analyzed to recognize the spatial distribution of benthic foraminifer assemblages and their relationship with environmental variables. The values of physicochemical parameters of bottom waters revealed that normal marine to hyposaline, low DO and high pH conditions were prevailing at the water-substrate interface at the time of sampling. The pH varies from 8.3 to 7.8, salinity from 32.46 PSU to 20.24 PSU, the DO from 5.4ml/L to 2ml/L from estuarine mouth to upstream direction. A total of 54 benthic foraminifer species belonging to 18 genera are identified and the faunal assemblages are dominated by Ammonia parkinsoniana, A. beccarii, A. tepida and Quinqueloculina spp. The dominance of Ammonia at all stations infer that it has a high tolerance to environmental variables and also reproduces more periodically than other taxa. The abundance and diversity (species richness) of living and total benthic foraminifera roughly corroborate the trends of salinity, pH and DO, indicating that these ecological variables largely affect the distribution of foraminiferal assemblages. The relative richness of species is high in lower estuary (stns.1-3), moderate in the middle estuary (stns. 4-7) and low in upper estuary (stns.8-14). The species richness in comparable samples is an indicator of environmental health, thus low values signifying deteriorated environmental conditions in the middle and upper estuarine zones. These estuarine zones are proximal to outfall of industrial effluents, resulting in low species richness and frequency. Four biotopes are recognized by cluster analysis of the total (live+dead) foraminiferal abundance data and their distribution are closely related to variations in salinity, DO and other parameters related to the hydrodynamics of the region. The unsystematic grouping of stations as disclosed by cluster analysis for total foraminifera suggests that the middle and upper estuarine zones are severely stressed due to industrial pollution. The FORAM index (FI) ranging from 1 to 1.45 indicates that estuary is environmentally stressed and inhospitable for symbiotic foraminifera. The Foram Stress Index (FSI) ranges from 0 to 4.23 and the decreasing trend of values indicate that severity of pollution increases in the upstream direction. Stations 1,2 and 4 are moderately polluted and the remaining are highly polluted. Ammonia-Elphidium index (AEI) with >90 at stns. 3-13 indicates increased hypoxic conditions, probably prevailed due to the mixing of industrial effluents. The species diversity indices (H', M, D and J) show a positive correlation with each other and low values of these indices clearly denote serious environmental degradation of the ecosystem. The foraminifer distribution data of this study will form the baseline against which future environmental monitoring of the Uppanar estuary will be compared.

AB  - We have developed an integrated modeling framework (IMF) to quantify indicators for ecosystem services (ES) and economic development (ED) in agricultural landscapes. Austria serves as a case study in which impacts, trade-offs, and synergies of ES and ED are assessed for different agricultural policy pathways and regional climate change scenarios. Agricultural intensification and incentivized use of provisioning ES (e.g. biomass production) lead to higher macro-economic output (e.g. GDP) but usually reduce ES related to regulation and maintenance (e.g. ecological integrity, climate regulation), as well as cultural services (landscape diversity). We revealed both synergies for certain ES (e.g. biomass production and soil organic carbon stocks) as well as large spatial deviations from the national mean across the heterogeneous agricultural landscapes in Austria. Climate change scenarios (i) lead to substantial variation in ES and ED indicators and (ii) usually amplify trade-offs by stimulating land use intensification. Our findings depict the complex relationship between different ES and ED indicators as well as the importance of considering spatial heterogeneity and regional climate change. This assessment can help to improve targeting of agri-environmental schemes in order to provide a more balanced and efficient supply of ES and to foster rural development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urbanization significantly increases the rates of environmental disturbance, being one of the main causes of habitat loss and biodiversity. The growing trend of converting the natural landscape into areas for real estate speculation in the coastal region of the southernmost part of Brazil is a current concern, as the region is home to unique ecosystems, such as dunes, wetlands and large brackish lagoons. As they are organisms sensitive to environmental changes, variations in the structure of Odonata communities are used as indicators of habitat quality reflecting the human impact on the environment. Here we assessed how the Odonata community is affected by the growing urbanization around natural ponds on the coast of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, testing the hypothesis that the increase in the percentage of urbanization negatively influences the Odonata community, following the same pattern found for other groups of invertebrates. The collections took place in 28 coastal ponds, which were classified as urbanized and non-urbanized based on the surrounding ground cover. Anisoptera's richness, abundance and composition were influenced by urbanization, but the same was not found for Zygoptera. The analysis of indicator species specifies three species associated with non-urbanized areas: Etythrodiplax sp.1, Erythemis credula and Telebasis corallina. Our study highlights the importance of Odonata as organisms that indicate environmental integrity and reinforces the need for urban planning strategies that favor the conservation and maintenance of the environments affected by urbanization.

AB  - Phytoplankton and macroinvertebrate assemblages were used to assess the impact of a kraft pulp and paper mill effluent in Kenya, on River Nzoia downstream of the discharge point in relation to changes in water quality during May to June and November 2008 (rainy and dry seasons, respectively). Total phosphorus concentration increased from 0.027 mg.L-1 upstream to 0.04 mg.L-1 downstream. Ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration was 0.51 mg.L-1 upstream and 0.86 mg.L-1 downstream. Nitrate concentration stood at 1.18 mg.L-1 upstream compared with the 2.23 mg.L-1 downstream. The pH changed from 4.5 to 5.0 upstream to 5.5 to 6.0 downstream, while DO increased from 6.57 to 7.03 mg.L-1 downstream. The BOD5 (biochemical oxygen demand after five days) values remained almost unchanged from 4.63 mg.L-1 upstream to 4.67 mg.L-1 downstream. Taxon composition of phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates correlated with adverse environmental gradients resulting from the mill's effluent discharge. Overall, there was a shift in composition and abundance of both phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates, with the downstream site recording high numbers of tolerant taxa (i.e., Microcystis sp. and Chironomus sp.). It was recommended that water quality monitoring with effluents of this nature be done using a combination of chemical analysis and biological indicators such as phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates.

AB  - Few ecotoxicity studies are available on thorium (Th) which hinders the ability to evaluate its ecotoxicological risk. Its release in the environment is often associated with the extraction of rare earth elements and uranium, as well as the field applications of phosphate fertilizers. This study investigates the effects of Th on microbial communities of periphytic biofilms. Ceramic plates were left to colonize for one month in the laboratory with a biofilm sampled from Cap Rouge river (QC, Canada). Plates were randomly placed in channels containing culture media representing three different conditions: a control condition (C0; background Th concentrations of 0.004 +/- 0.002 nM), a low Th concentration condition (C1; 0.18 +/- 0.09 nM Th) and a moderately high Th condition (C10; 8.7 +/- 3.4 nM) for up to 4 weeks. The presence of Th modified the diatom community by changing its taxonomic structure, reducing diversity and increasing cell density. The taxonomic structure of the bacterial community, followed by 16S metabarcoding analysis, was affected with a significant decrease in Pseudanabaena and Shingopyxis genera in the two Th exposed conditions. No direct toxic effect of Th was observed on counted micromeiofauna but the changes in diatom and bacterial communities could explain the higher number of individual diatoms and micromeiofauna observed in Th-exposed conditions. This work shows that low concentrations of Th can modify biofilm structure, which, in turn, could disturb its ecologically key functions.

AB  - Capelin Mallotus villosus is one of the most abundant fish species in the Barents Sea and is a critical link between zooplankton and commercial species such as Atlantic cod. Climatic conditions influence the population structure, feeding, and biological condition of capelin by affecting their distribution and that of their zooplankton prey. We sampled more than 1500 stomachs of capelin from 1978, 2002, 2003, 2006, and 2007 spanning years with cold, moderate, and warm climatic conditions, and examined the distribution of their major prey items: euphausiids and Calanus copepods. Capelin distribution is broader during warmer years, especially in the north and northeast. Copepods and euphausiids dominated the diets of capelin, but hyperiid amphipods and chaetognaths were also important. Diet and stomach fullness showed significant geographic variability within the Barents Sea, and varied among years depending on whether the climatic conditions were warmer or colder than the long-term average. Abundance of inter- and intraspecific competitors appears to affect diet, feeding intensity, and fat content. Fat content is an important indicator of capelin reproductive potential and their food value for predators, and was highest in northeastern regions and strongly influenced by capelin diet. Analyses of these 5 years of data plus 10 more years from previously published studies indicate the importance of climate drivers for determining fat content. Mechanisms are complex, however, and many factors directly and indirectly influence condition of this critical species in the Barents Sea ecosystem.

AB  - Behavioural disorders are considered as precise indicators of deranged emotions. Normal behaviour needs to be defined in order to study the >>internal mental images<< of animals, The differentiation of the diverse and multi-causal variation in canine behaviour is complex indicating the very different environmental demands of the various breeds, Problems also arise when attempting to establish a reference system to evaluate normal behavioural patterns of dogs, Some breeds develop abnornal behaviour when living in semi-natural conditions which are similar to those of the wolf. For a large number of breeds a partnership with man results in the attainment of social stability and flexibity. Social contact with humans is part of the environmental conditions for domestic dogs to develop a normal behaviour. Environmental conditions influence to a great extent the social behaviour and well being of dogs as indicated by the ontogeny of two litters reared under very different environmental conditions, One litter was kept under restricted conditions in a kennel receiving few social stimuli from humans and the other reared in a family. Behavioural indicators indicating suffering are classified accordingly to degrees of feelings. Ethological parameters such as expressive behaviour, inter-actions, their relationships and social structure provide objective indicators of the perception of dogs.

AB  - To assess the impact of arctic climate change on environmental condition and pelagic biodiversity, spatial variations in ciliated microzooplankton communities were studied at 32 stations (western Arctic Ocean) in summer sea-ice reduction period from August 1 to September 10, 2012. Multivariate and univariate analyses demonstrated that ciliated microzooplankton community structures showed significant differences between the western and eastern parts of the sampling region; consistent with east-west differences in environmental conditions; 16 dominant species (e.g., Leegaardiella ovalis, Strombidium acutum, and Mesodinium rubrum) showed the same spatial distribution pattern and were significantly correlated with physicochemical variables, especially with nitrates and phosphates; and both spatial patterns of community structure and species diversity indices were significantly associated with environmental condition. These results suggest that the summer sea-ice reduction has affected ciliate biodiversity seriously and the pelagic ciliate communities may be useful as robust bioindicators for studying climate change effects under increasing sea-ice melting in the Arctic Ocean.

T2  - CHEMOSPHERE

CP  - Western Pacific Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union
AB  - Opschoor and Reijnders (1991) propose a simple structure for the development of physical indicators of sustainable development. It begins with the development of two types of environmental indicators: one describing the pressure being placed on the environment, and one describing the effects of this pressure. The sustainability indicator then measures the distance between current or predicted conditions, as described in these simple 'state' indicators, and a reference condition.
   The reference condition is equated to sustainability. Specification of this reference requires the making of explicit choices as to the types of environmental change. It implies setting standards which make the criteria for sustainability explicit.
   The power of this simple construct is demonstrated using three examples. The first Sustainability indicator comprises a pressure indicator describing acid deposition in the Netherlands and a reference condition based on ecosystem sensitivity to this deposition. The second comprises an effect indicator describing species composition in the Dutch North Sea and a reference condition based on past species composition before this ecosystem was adversely affected by pollution, overfishing, etc. The third indicator deals with cadmium accumulation in Dutch soil. It identifies two criteria for sustainability, one constraining additions of cadmium to soil and one specifying soil quality. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - With an aim to minimize the difference of use reliability of air-conditioning systems in different regions, a clustering method for classifying regions based on factors of the reliability of air-conditioning systems is proposed. This study establishes a comprehensive evaluation model of regional clustering on the basis of analysis and investigation about the regional differences of natural environmental factors and user habit factors that influence the reliability of air-conditioning systems. A judging criterion of refrigeration and heating of air conditioners is set to accurately quantify seven clustering indicators. The Ward method is used to calculate weight coefficients of different distance. The weighted Ward clustering algorithm is used for clustering regions from the perspectives of natural environmental factors and user habit factors, respectively. Two kinds of clustering results are integrated together to obtain the final results by secondary clustering analysis. Finally, the regional clustering of 31 provincial administrative areas in mainland China is presented to verify the applicability and validity of the method proposed in this study. The results of this study might establish the foundation for accurately predicting the use reliability of air-conditioning systems in different regions. It also provides good reference value for the similar study of refrigerators, washing machines, water heaters, solar street lamps, etc.

AB  - The anthropogenic nature of Andean ecosystems is discussed in the framework of tree-line dynamics in selected sites in Ecuador. Indicators of human impact are evidence of the need for a scientific understanding of neotropical mountains that is better in tune with the special conditions of tropical Andean environments. Tropandean systems are neither tropical ecosystems nor midlatitude regions, and lessons from ecologically damaging activities in those ecosystems cannot be transferred readily to Tropandean systems. Better research from the ethnobiological and ecological fronts is needed if we are to comprehend the intricate functions of neotropical mountains, particularly the cloud-forest belt, which is regarded as the most threatened ecosystem when considering sustainability scenarios.

AB  - The phase field fracture method has emerged as a promising computational tool for modelling a variety of problems including, since recently, hydrogen embrittlement and stress corrosion cracking. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of phase field-based multi-physics models in transforming the engineering assessment and design of structural components in hydrogen-containing environments. First, we present a theoretical and numerical framework coupling deformation, diffusion and fracture, which accounts for inertia effects. Several constitutive choices are considered for the crack density function, including choices with and without an elastic phase in the damage response. The material toughness is defined as a function of the hydrogen content using an atomistically-informed hydrogen degradation law. The model is numerically implemented in 2D and 3D using the finite element method. The resulting computational framework is used to address a number of case studies of particular engineering interest. These are intended to showcase the model capabilities in: (i) capturing complex fracture phenomena, such as dynamic crack branching or void-crack interactions, (ii) simulating standardised tests for critical components, such as bolts, and (iii) enabling simulation-based paradigms such as Virtual Testing or Digital Twins by coupling model predictions with inspection data of large-scale engineering components. The evolution of defects under in-service conditions can be predicted, up to the ultimate failure. By reproducing the precise geometry of the defects, as opposed to re-characterising them as sharp cracks, phase field modelling enables more realistic and effective structural integrity assessments.

KW  - INTERNET
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging concept in the field of information technology. IoT can integrate any real-time entity with another, using sensing, computing and communication capabilities to offer enhanced services in everyday life. In this article, IoT-based patient health monitoring is considered for use in IoT sensors deployed in devices. These devices are attached to the body of the patient for timely tracking of his or her health condition. During data transfers from devices connected to the patient's body to the doctor, the data may be susceptible to security threats. IoT devices are subjected to many routing attacks, like blackhole, greyhole, Sybil, sinkhole and wormhole attacks. Sybil attacks are the most dangerous routing attacks. This type of attack involves stealing the identities of legitimate nodes; this, in turn, leads to information loss, misinterpretation in the network and an increase in routing disturbances. Hence, in this paper, we propose the use of the traditional Caesar Cipher Algorithm (CCA) along with the lightweight encryption algorithm (LEA) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to detect and prevent Sybil attacks in an IoT environment. The proposed algorithm detects the false node in a particular path by announcing the attack to another node. It also prevents the attack by choosing an alternative path by which to forward data packets to the desired users. To ensure authentication, privacy and data integrity, the lightweight encryption algorithm with a 64-bit key is used with AODV as the routing protocol.

AB  - Additive partitioning of species diversity is a valuable approach for quantifying the spatial patterns of biodiversity sampled in hierarchically scaled studies. This approach may provide key insights into vegetation community restoration following terrestrial ecosystems degradation in different climatic conditions. The scale-dependence of plant diversity in relation to different plant functional groups (e.g., herbaceous and woody) is still little understood. This research aims to investigate the influence of management options (protected vs. non-protected) and climatic conditions (semiarid vs. Mediterranean) on different components of diversity in both herbaceous and woody species derived from local and regional scales (i.e., plot and site, respectively). In the studied areas, a total of 64 plots (1000 m(2)) at local scale and 128 micro-plots (1 m(2)) among 16 sites at regional scale were selected for sampling the woody and herbaceous species data, respectively, by using a hierarchical sampling design. Diversity components of local (alpha 1, beta 1) and regional (alpha 2, beta 2) scales were extracted according to additive partitioning method. Differences in diversity component (alpha 1, alpha 21, beta 1 and beta 2) and floristic composition between management options and climatic conditions were evaluated using GLMM and DCA. The results indicate that all components of total species (both herbaceous and woody) diversity (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2) were significantly influenced by management options (p < 0.05) with greater values in the protected areas than the non-protected areas. However, the climatic conditions only had significant effects on beta 2, with greater values in the Mediterranean compared to semi-arid areas. Moreover, the separate analysis of herbaceous and woody species indicated that management options have a greater significant effect on different diversity components compared to the climatic condition. Detrended correspondence analysis showed that floristic variations along the axes are strongly affected by management in both climatic conditions. This indicates that protection measures mostly increased plant species diversity at the local and regional scales, which is independent of the climatic condition.

AB  - Despite the growing interest in social forestry (SF), how much do we understand the social, economic and environmental outcomes and the conditions that enable SF to perform? In this article, we use a content analysis of literature on existing traditional SF practiced throughout Indonesia. It examines the outcomes of these systems and the conditions that enabled or hindered these outcomes to understand possible causal relations and changing dynamics between these conditions and SF performance. We discuss the gaps in how SF is assessed and understood in the literature to understand the important aspects of traditional SF that are not captured or that are lost when the diverse traditional systems are converted into other land uses. It aims to understand the potential trade-offs in the State's push for formalizing SF if these aspects continue to be ignored.

AB  - Sewage sludge (mainly composed of excessive bio-sludge) is an inevitable by-product of biological wastewater treatment process and contains various toxic substances, such as pathogens, heavy metals, and organic contaminants. The production of sewage sludge may cause serious pollution risks without appropriate disposals. As the essential step of sludge treatment, dewatering plays significant roles in minimizing the sludge volume, facilitating the transportation, increasing the calorific value and even reducing the leachate production in landfill sites. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the issues related to dewatering of sewage sludge. Section 1 starts with the environmental implications of sludge dewatering. Section 2 deals with the concepts and challenges about differentiation of bound water fractions, and also reviews the recent progress of in-situ visualization of water occurrence states in bio-flocs. Section 3 discusses about how various physiochemical properties influence the sludge dewaterability, and the insufficiency in in-situ micro-characterization of sludge constituents is pointed out. Section 4 reviews the existing conditioning technologies for sludge dewaterability improvement, and the advantages/disadvantages of each technology in terms of applicable occasions, material consumption, energy consumption and environmental impacts are evaluated. The last section (section 5) specifically analyzes the feasibility of integrating sludge dewatering and re-utilization, and raises attention to the potential environmental risks of dewatering conditioning. Based on the above discussion, we propose that a unified theory for sludge dewaterability improvement remains to be established. Especially, how the molecular structures of sludge compositions affect the solid-water interface behavior requires to be deepened, which will further unravel the mechanism behind strong water-holding capacities of bio-flocs. Additionally, we believe that the key challenges for sludge dewatering is how to select the appropriate conditioning technique according to the physiochemical properties of target sludge. The reliable indicators for real-time control of conditioning operations are still deficient, e.g., dynamic dosage control of conditioning chemicals. Accordingly, the potential environmental risks of excessive conditioning chemicals should be taken into more consideration. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gluconacin, a bacteriocin produced by Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus PAL5, has previously shown a large spectrum of inhibitory activity against beneficial and phytopathogenic bacteria. The present study proposes a three-dimensional (3D) structure for Gluconacin based on modelling and describes some physicochemical characteristics and the effect of the peptide on cells of the phytopathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas albilineans ICMP196. The Gluconacin 3D structural model results demonstrated the 7 alpha-helices and 11 beta-sheets. Growth inhibition of the indicator microorganism, X. albilineans, occurred in the first moments of contact with Gluconacin (0.25 mu g mu l(-1)). Treatment of bacterial cells caused significant loss of inorganic phosphate and UV-absorbing materials. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that Gluconacin-treated X. albilineans cells were fully lysed. These results suggest that the mode of action of this peptide involves altered membrane integrity and increased permeability, resulting in complete cell lysis. Physicochemical characterisation demonstrated stability of biological activity under high temperatures, including autoclaving conditions and low pH. The activity was reduced after treatment with proteases and some surfactants and abolished with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The 3D conformation model indicates the possibility of a hydrophobic region, which could possibly interact directly with the cell membrane of target bacteria. In conclusion, the ability of Gluconacin to inhibit growth of phytopathogens of agricultural importance opens up new opportunities for biotechnological applications and, consequently, a reduction in the use of pesticides.

AB  - The methodology used to establish reference conditions and class boundary change of ecological status for the 32 Spanish river types is presented. The analysis was performed with data from monitoring programs of different Hydraulic Administrations: Water Boards, Water Agencies, etc., for the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. The data of 652 preliminary reference sites located in 410 natural water bodies in Spanish rivers were analyzed. After several exchanges of information with Hydraulic Administrations the existence of 388 reference stations was confirmed. For types with enough information, descriptive statistical analyses (median, percentiles, standard deviation, and confidence interval) were performed to propose the reference condition and the boundaries for two metrics: IBMWP and IPS. For types with no data or insufficient data, a proposal by interpolation and expert criteria was performed. Finally, the clusters obtained with the CLUSTER analyses of the communities of invertebrates and diatoms noted a similarity between certain types.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) bones from three Norwegian modern wild reindeer populations (Setesdal Ryfylke, Hardangervidda and Rondane) were used to investigate variations in delta C-13 and delta N-15 between, and within, populations. Each of these reindeer populations lives in different climatic and environmental conditions, thus vegetation and climatic conditions could be linked to their stable isotopic signature. Reindeer bones from several archaeological sites on Hardangervidda representing three chronological ranges (275-350 CE, 11th, and 13th century CE) were then analysed for their stable isotopic composition. No statistically significant differences were found within the populations, but the stable isotopic values differed between populations. Subsequently, these stable isotopic values were used to infer modern climatic conditions to sub-fossil palaeoenvironmental conditions on Hardangervidda.

AB  - Hoverflies are good indicators of ecosystem integrity, especially in drylands. However, the key factors explaining hoverfly diversity in North African forest ecosystems are still not addressed. The current study provides data on the diversity, structure and functional trophic groups (FTG) of the hoverfly community in Aleppo pine forests under a semi-arid climate in northeastern Algeria. Using an entomological net, hoverflies were sampled weekly during 2008-2009. Alpha and beta-diversity of hoverflies and functional trophic group (FTG) were analyzed using several parameters and indices (e.g. species composition, richness, occurrence, diversity, estimations, similarity, etc.). In total, 602 individuals of 21 species were collected with a constant species (Eupeodes corollae) and four common species (Episyrphus balteatus, Chrysotoxum intermedium, Eristalis arbustorum and Eristalis tenax). Most species (17) occurred accidentally or very accidentally in samples. The highest diversity was recorded during spring, corresponding to the flowering season of most understory plant species. Seasonal rarefaction and extrapolation curves indicated that the expected species richness would be higher in autumn and spring compared to summer and winter. The spectrum of FTG ranked predators first with 52.4% of species, followed by saprophagous (42.8%) and then phytophagous (4.8%) species. Hoverfly communities showed high taxonomic richness and alpha-diversity all over the year, with peaks during spring that coincides with flowering period of most plant species of the forest understorey and favourable climatic conditions.

AB  - Aim of study: to identify criteria and indicators (C&I) of sustainable forest management (SFM) under Mediterranean conditions. The indicators are meant to monitor changes in the provision of ecosystem services at a local scale (forest management unit, FMU). We support that if a forest provides a bundle of ecosystem services its management can be considered sustainable; thus, we adjust C&I to an ecosystem services classification.
   Area of study: La Hunde y La Palomera, a public FMU in the region of Valencia (east of Spain), 100km southwest of the city of Valencia.
   Material and methods: first, a literature review of the following themes took part: SFM, features of Mediterranean forests, ecosystem services and C&I. Some C&I were proposed and, later on, a participatory process in Ayora, the municipality where the mentioned FMU is located, was carried out with different stakeholders (forestry professionals, users for recreation, hunters, environmentalists and professionals of cultural and rural development activities) in order for them to value the C&I proposed according to their management preferences for La Hunde y La Palomera.
   Research highlights:
   - 15 criteria and 133 indicators were identified: a balance has been achieved among economic, social and ecological concerns.
   - People value the ecological issues associated to forestry on top and the economic ones at the bottom.
   - Results suggest that SFM under Mediterranean conditions is based on more than one product and on the provision of several ecosystem services.

AB  - The case for restoring water to the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, is based mainly on condition assessments, although time series provide valuable information on trends. We assessed trends of 301 ecological time series (mean 23 years, range 1905-2013) in two categories: (1) population' (abundance, biomass, extent) and (2) non-population' (condition, occurrence, composition). We analysed trends using log-linear regression, accounting for observation error only, and a state-space model that accounts for observation error and environmental noise'. Of the log-linear series (n=239), 50 (22%) showed statistically significant decline, but 180 (78%) showed no trend. For state-space series (n=197) one increased, but others were stable. Distribution of median exponential rates of increase (r) indicated a small but statistically significant declining trend, though 35-39% of the series were positive. Our analysis only partly supports, though does not refute, prevailing assumptions of recent ecological decline in the Murray-Darling Basin. The pattern is of fluctuating stability, with declines during droughts and recovery after flood. The overall trend from our meta-analysis is consistent with a pattern of historical decline to a hybrid ecosystem followed by slow, recent decline for some components and stability for others, with considerable variation in trends of specific ecological components: in short, there are ecological winners' and losers'.

AB  - How ecosystem functioning changes with microbial communities remains an open question in natural ecosystems. Both present-day environmental conditions and historical events, such as past differences in dispersal, can have a greater influence over ecosystem function than the diversity or abundance of both taxa and genes. Here, we estimated how individual and interactive effects of microbial community structure defined by diversity and abundance, present-day environmental conditions, and an indicator of historical legacies influenced ecosystem functioning in lake sediments. We studied sediments because they have strong gradients in all three of these ecosystem properties and deliver important functions worldwide. By characterizing bacterial community composition and functional traits at eight sites fed by discrete and contrasting catchments, we found that taxonomic diversity and the normalized abundance of oxidase-encoding genes explained as much variation in CO2 production as present-day gradients of pH and organic matter quantity and quality. Functional gene diversity was not linked to CO2 production rates. Surprisingly, the effects of taxonomic diversity and normalized oxidase abundance in the model predicting CO2 production were attributable to site-level differences in bacterial communities unrelated to the present-day environment, suggesting that colonization history rather than habitat-based filtering indirectly influenced ecosystem functioning. Our findings add to limited evidence that biodiversity and gene abundance explain patterns of microbiome functioning in nature. Yet we highlight among the first time how these relationships depend directly on present-day environmental conditions and indirectly on historical legacies, and so need to be contextualized with these other ecosystem properties.

AB  - In mangroves the habitat fragmentation has contributed to area reduction and increased edge extension, as well as other anthropogenic consequences that can change abiotic conditions, interfere with ecosystem functioning and lead to the loss of biodiversity. These impacts may affect terrestrial and marine invertebrates living in this coastal system. This study investigated the effects of fragment characteristics (size and matrix type) and distance to edge on ant richness, occurrence of functional groups and of the most frequent species in mangroves in North-Eastern Brazil. Our research covered ten mangrove fragments. We used sardine and honey baits in twelve randomly selected points per area. Twenty-five species of ants were recorded, with Camponotus arboreus, Crematogaster erecta, Azteca sp. and Neoponera villosa being the most frequent. Only four functional groups were found, the most representative of which were the Arboreal Omnivores with Massive Recruitment and the Generalist Predators. No relationship was found between the response variables and the environmental characteristics. Mangroves ants are mostly arboreal; thus, the pattern of competition between ant species or even tree architecture elements may have stronger effects than those related to anthropization, loss of area and fragmentation in this environment. Furthermore, the harsh physical conditions in the mangrove serve as barriers for most exotic species and to some functional groups of ants. This study highlights the natural restrictive nesting and foraging conditions in mangrove areas as the powerful forces in ant community structuring, possibly even more than anthropization itself.

AB  - A survey of distribution patterns of floodwater mosquito eggs related to environmental conditions such as moisture and plant associations was conducted by using soil samples from irrigated fields in Wroclaw, Poland. Mosquito egg distribution was determined by repeatedly flooding the soil samples with aerated water at a temperature of 25 degrees C. Under laboratory conditions, hatching in installments of Aedes caspius (Pallas) and Aedes vexans (Meigen) were commonly observed. The results show that similar to 75% of the larvae of Ae. caspius and Ae. vexans hatched after the first flooding under summer-like conditions, whereas, following the second and third flooding, the numbers of hatched larvae were significantly lower. In our study, within one intermediate flooded field, a total of 66 plant species was identified and classified into six communities. All vegetation types were associated by varied egg densities and showed differences both in richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index as well as in ecological indices for moisture, soil reaction, and nutrient level. Small changes in elevation along the slope within the study area showed a large difference in the distribution of mosquito eggs. The highest average egg density was observed in zones with high occurrence of Phalaris arundinacea, usually prevalent in intermediate flooded and fertile areas. Knowledge of the indicators for the distribution of floodwater mosquito eggs in temporary breeding sites may be essential for organizing a successful, integrated mosquito control program with special regard to microbial control agents.

AB  - Monitoring the ecological status of drinking water reservoirs is very important for assessing risks to the safety of drinking water supplies. Because of the huge number of potential organic and inorganic contaminants in water, we focused our study on common water quality variables and three ecological indices. In this study, we used the modified Carlson trophic status index, Shannon diversity index, and the phytoplankton functional group index to assess the changing ecological status of Zhushuqiao Reservoir, a drinking water source in central China. Stratified water sampling for abiotic and biotic variables was conducted bimonthly from April 2016 to February 2017. All three indices indicated that upper reservoir water quality and ecological condition were worse than those in the lower reservoir. Also, the dominant phytoplankton species in the upper reservoir differed significantly from those in the lower reservoir. The reservoir was eutrophic from June to October, especially in June. During the other months, it was mesotrophic, with the best water quality in winter. Water temperature was the main driver of seasonal changes in both biotic and abiotic indicators, although hydrological condition also affected water quality. Total phosphorus (TP) was the limiting factor for phytoplankton, but phytoplankton biomass increased greatly when both TP and total nitrogen increased. Each index had weaknesses; but applying all three together yielded a comprehensive ecological assessment of Zhushuqiao Reservoir and could do so for other similar reservoirs.

AB  - The current trends in rural development, sustainable use of nature, provision of comfortable ecological, economic and social conditions for the life of the population determine the solution to the problem of inequality within the respective state and between the countries as a whole. According to the results of the study of equality of supply with natural resources, in particular, forest land we have found that the greatest imbalance in the generation of gross income from the use of forest land is determined in the Steppe natural and climatic zone (GINI = 0,53) and the Kyiv and Sumy regions, the northern part of which is located in the Polissya zone, and the southern part of the administrative unit is located in the Forest-steppe zone (GINI = 0,92). It should be noted that on all other indicators the calculated Gini index indicates a low inequality in the provision of natural resources to the population, in particular, forestry lands in the context of all natural and climatic zones of Ukraine, which is a favorable factor for rural development, the formation of environmentally-safe conditions people living and decentralization. With the help of Gini index (inequality), it is possible to formulate a conceptual direction of transformation of ecological and economic mechanisms of forest land use, the mainstream of which should approach absolute equality in providing the population with natural resources, in particular, forestry, distribution of economic income from the implementation of forestry production. safe environment and social living conditions of people in newly created UTC.

AB  - Polyphasic analysis was carried out of natural samples and strains isolated from Phormidium mats, collected from different Spanish rivers with distinct water quality. 16S rRNA gene analysis separated five main clusters in a phylogenetic tree corresponding to five main, previously observed morphotypes. Two isolated strains and three natural samples had a relatively homogeneous morphology, which could correspond to Phormidium autumnale, and their sequences grouped in a well-supported cluster (morphotypegenotype I). However, ultrastructural differences were found among representatives from this cluster, and three clades could be separated in a further phylogenetic analysis. The samples belonging to the first clade were characteristic of hypertrophic waters, while representatives of the second grew in mesotrophic conditions, and those of the third in eutrophic waters. These results suggested that our representatives of morphotypegenotype I belong to three different species. According to our results and other published data, complementary information was obtained on the basis of morphological, phylogenetic and ecological criteria. Morphotypegenotype II, corresponding to Phormidium terebriforme, is a potential indicator of polluted waters. Oscillatoria tenuis, corresponding to morphotypegenotype III, is characteristic of eutrophic conditions. Phormidium mats identified as Phormidium corium (morphotypegenotype IV) were found to be characteristic of waters with low nutrient levels. Finally, morphotypegenotype V, identified as Phormidium aerugineo-caeruleum was dominant in oligo- to mesotrophic conditions.

AB  - Richards Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, is characterized by thermokarst lakes which record Holocene limnological change. This study is the first report of thecamoebian assemblages and continuous annual lake water temperatures from these Arctic lakes. Ecological environments on Richards Island are influenced by a climatic gradient resulting from the contrasting influences of the cold Beaufort Sea to the north and the warm waters of the Mackenzie Delta to the east and west. This climatic gradient in turn influences modern thecamoebian assemblages, and is an indication of the complexity involved in interpreting past conditions from core material in this area.
   Population abundance and species diversity of thecamoebian assemblages on Richards Island are not significantly different from those reported from temperate and semi-tropical latitudes. However, certain assemblage characteristics, such as large and coarse agglutinated tests, dominance of assemblages by one or two species and low morphological variation are interpreted to be diagnostic of Arctic conditions. Thecamoebian assemblages in core material from the area indicate that the local paleolimnological conditions may have changed within the last 3 ka, and this is unrecorded in previously reported pollen data.
   Paleoenvironmental interpretations in a permafrost landscape have to take into account morphological instability of thermokarst lakes, which can be the cause of paleolimnological and consequently faunal change. In this area ecosystem development is clearly related to geomorphology and local climatic effects and is not exclusively controlled by regional climate change.

AB  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates are frequently used to evaluate river system conditions and restoration project performance. A better understanding of macroinvertebrate community responses to multiple stressors is a primary challenge for river science. In this paper, macroinvertebrate responses to hydrological and water quality variability were studied in the regulated Oglio River (northern Italy). We hypothesized that in regulated rivers the hydrological, rather than the physico-chemical conditions, would affect macroinvertebrate communities and biomonitoring tools (taxonomic metrics and functional indices). Repeated sampling (six times a year) was performed at four sites downstream of four dams in a 30 km river stretch during 2014 and 2015. Data were analysed using a linear mixed effect framework, to take into account random variation due to site and sampling date, and with multivariate analysis to track changes in community structure. A total of 69 families and 134,693 organisms were identified. The investigated metrics were mainly affected by the coefficient of variation of discharge, minimum discharge, ammonium, and temperature. The short-term dynamics of hydrological and physico-chemical variables were generally less important than the overall random effects as drivers of macroinvertebrate-based metrics. However, the relevance of a random effect (site, time, their interaction) differed depending on the biological metrics analysed. Understanding potential differences in response to short term and short stretch conditions would benefit biomonitoring and restoration procedures in both regulated and natural rivers.

AB  - Mofettes are often investigated in ecology, either as extreme sites, natural analogues to future conditions under climate change, or model ecosystems for environmental impact assessments of carbon capture and storage systems. Much of this research, however, inadequately addresses the complexity of the gas environment at these sites, mainly focusing on aboveground CO2-enrichment. In the current research, the gaseous environment of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) trees growing at the Stavelinske slepice mofette (NE Slovenia) were studied by measuring both soil ([CO2](soil)) and atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ECO2](air)). Within the studied site (800 m(2)), soil CO2 enrichment was spatially heterogeneous; about 25% of the area was characterized by very high [CO2](soil) (> 40%) and hypoxic conditions. Aboveground gas measurements along vertical profiles not only revealed substantially elevated [CO2](air) close to the ground (height up to 1.5 m), but also in the upper heights (20-25 m; crown layer). On the basis delta C-13 of CO2, it was shown that elevated CO2 relates to a geogenic source. Trees grown in high [CO2](soil) were characterized by decreased radial growth; the delta C-13 of their wood was less negative than in trees growing in normal soil. Unfavorable gaseous soil conditions should generally be accepted as being by far the most important factor affecting (i.e. disturbing) the growth of mofette trees.

AB  - The origin and sedimentary environment of the Late Tertiary (Neogene) Red Clay Formation in northern China had long been controversial. A new mollusk record from the Xifeng red clay (red-earth) sequence in the central Loess Plateau provides the biological evidence for addressing questions of its origin and environmental implication. The study of composition and preservation condition of seventy mollusk fossil assemblages reveals the initial ecological condition of the red clay formation, avoiding the effect of post-deposited alteration. The result shows that all of identifiable mollusk species are composed of terrestrial taxa, most of them are the common species found in the overlying Quaternary loess-palleosol sequence. Most of fossil individuals preserved in the red clay strata are in living conditions based on the investigation of fieldwork, indicating the original population. Thus, the mollusk fossil assemblages can be used as an indicator of primary environment of the red clay formation. The mollusk record from the Xifeng red clay sequence supports the view that the red clay is an aeolian origin, similar to the overlying Quaternary loess deposits. Our data also reveal the history of environmental changes at Xifeng from 6.2-2.4 Ma, which is coupled in phase with the formation and development of the Arctic ice sheets and the process of the Tibetan Plateau uplift. Both may be the major cause and forcing mechanisms of the late Tertiary environmental changes in the Loess Plateau.

AB  - The historical range of variability (HRV) in landscape structure and composition created by natural disturbance can serve as a general guide for evaluating ecological conditions of managed landscapes. HRV approaches to evaluating landscapes have been based on age-classes or developmental stages, which may obscure variation in live and dead stand structure. Developing the HRV of stand structural characteristics would improve the ecological resolution of this coarse-filter approach to ecosystem assessment. We investigated HRV in live and dead wood biomass in the regional landscape of the Oregon Coast Range by integrating stand-level biomass models and a spatially explicit fire simulation model. We simulated historical landscapes of the region for 1000 years under pre-Euro-American settlement fire regimes and calculated biomass as a function of disturbance history. The simulation showed that live and dead wood biomass historically varied widely in time and space. The majority of the forests historically contained 500-700 Mg.ha(-1) (50-70 kg.m(-2)) of live wood and 50-200 Mg.ha(-1) (5-20 kg.m(-2)) of dead wood. The current distributions are more concentrated in much smaller amounts for both biomass types. Although restoring the HRV of forest structure is not necessarily a management goal for most landowners and managing agencies, departure from the reference condition can provide relative measure to evaluate habitat conditions for managers seeking to use forest structure as a means to maintain or restore ecosystem and species diversity.

AB  - The three contiguous National Estuary Programs of southwest Florida, along with partners from six coastal counties, have developed a tidal creek water quality assessment framework to help prioritize natural resource investigations across a large population of tidal creeks between Tampa Bay and Estero Bay, Florida. The assessment framework is based on outcomes of a multidisciplinary study and includes a nutrient based report card that characterizes nutrient conditions relative to regional numeric nutrient criteria developed for contributing freshwater streams, identification of site-specific water quality indicators of tidal creek condition, and an online open science dashboard to display the assessment framework and provide access to all information relevant to its implementation. Application of the assessment framework has provided an actionable list of southwest Florida tidal creeks prioritized for further research and potential management action along with a host of site-specific indicator results that provide insights into drivers of tidal creek condition. The open science dashboard provides a platform for dissemination of this information in a readily accessible and reproducible format and a means to incorporate new data and indicators as they become available. Local resource managers are in need of tools to help prioritize natural resource investigations and management actions that achieve the greatest resource benefit with limited available resources. This assessment framework informs these efforts and builds capacity for future research to identify and refine management tools for these creeks where management resources, data, and sentinel biological response endpoints are limited.

AB  - Prediction of the timing of spring phenological events such as bloom and leaf-out has important uses in agricultural and ecological management and modeling. However, after decades of model comparison there remains no consensus model to predict the date of spring phenological events in perennial temperate trees across species and locations. This lack of consensus may be due to over-fitting resulting from high model complexity, use of parameters that have not been adequately validated, or omission of parameters that are sound biological indicators of dormancy breaking. The aim of this study was to construct spring phenology candidate models with biologically-based parameters and starting values to test hypotheses regarding chill accumulation duration and the impact of pre-bloom conditions. Bloom data for three cultivars of Prunus dulcis (almond) from three decades in California were analyzed. Across all three cultivars, models which accumulated chill until approximately 75% of the heat requirement had been met, and did not integrate pre-bloom conditions, were substantially supported by the data. This suggests cold temperatures affect dormancy breaking well after the chilling requirement has been met and bud break timing is not substantially impacted by environmental conditions just prior to bud break. Fitting spring phenology using biologically based starting values estimated from bud break records may allow for the development of improved predictive models and improved approximations of critical phenological thresholds.

AB  - The Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Water Quality (ANZECC Guidelines) provide default national guideline values for a wide range of indicators of relevance to the protection of the ecological condition of natural waters. However, the ANZECC Guidelines also place a strong emphasis on the need to develop more locally relevant guidelines. Using a structured framework, this paper explores indicators and regional data sets that can be used to develop more locally relevant guidelines for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA). The paper focuses on the water quality impacts of adjacent catchments on the GBRWHA with the key stressors addressed being nutrients, sediments and agricultural chemicals. Indicators relevant to these stressors are discussed including both physico-chemical pressure indicators and biological condition indicators. Where adequate data sets are available, guideline values are proposed. Generally, data were much more readily available for physico-chemical pressure indicators than for biological condition indicators. Specifically, guideline values are proposed for the major nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and for chlorophyll-a. More limited guidelines are proposed for sediment related indicators. For most agricultural chemicals, the ANZECC Guidelines are likely to remain the default of choice for some time but it is noted that there is data in the literature that could be used to develop more locally relevant guidelines.

AB  - Wooded meadows are traditional semi-natural meadows in the region around the Baltic Sea. They are mowed regularly once per year, and some meadows are lightly grazed by sheep or cattle in late summer after mowing. Data on soil fauna in wooded meadows are still scarce in spite of their importance to ecosystem functioning. The aim of this study was to describe the taxonomic and ecological structure of earthworm communities in relation to the chemical and microbiological characteristics of the soil and meadow restoration conditions in Estonian wooded meadows. The chemical and microbiological parameters of the soil were studied so as to characterize the habitat of the earthworms. Earthworms were collected using a mustard solution as vermifuge. In total, the earthworm communities of wooded meadows consisted of eight species. The most abundant species were the endogeic Aporrectodea caliginosa and Aporrectodea rosea. The dominant epigeic species was Lumbricus rubellus in meadows with higher soil moisture and Dendrobaena octaedra in a dry meadow. In wooded meadows, richness of plant species and diversity in earthworm communities have developed in calcareous soil conditions. Different layers of plant cover create several different microhabitats for soil invertebrates including earthworms, thus promoting diversity. The taxonomic composition of communities depends on soil conditions; mostly on soil moisture. The restored wooded meadows differ significantly from the long-term managed meadows by the ecological structure of the earthworm communities: in mowed meadows the community consists of more endogeic and fewer epigeic species compared to the restored meadows.

AB  - Increases in medial prefrontal cortex ERK have been linked to learning and memory processes. In the present study separate groups of rats initially underwent testing in an open-field paired with either 2.0 mg/kg apomorphine or vehicle injections. Subsequently, in a brief conditioning 5 min. test the paired apomorphine group manifested a conditioned hyperactivity response. The vehicle/apomorphine groups were then subdivided into two vehicle and two apomorphine subgroups matched for their activity scores in this conditioning test. Following another apomorphine/vehicle pairing in the test environment the groups received 3 additional 5 min. non-drug conditioning tests in which the groups received post-trial vehicle/apomorphine treatments. The vehicle groups received vehicle either immediately or 15 min. after the first two of the three conditioning tests and the apomorphine groups received 2.0 mg/kg either immediately or 15 min. after the first two of the three conditioning tests. In the first conditioning test both of the apomorphine groups exhibited equivalent conditioned responses. By the third test, the conditioned response of the immediate post-trial apomorphine group remained robust whereas conditioned response of the 15 min. apomorphine post-trial group was extinguished. Immediately following the third conditioning test, the animals were euthanized and ERK was measured in the medial prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. ERK was enhanced in both brain areas, selectively in the immediate apomorphine post-trial group. Increased ERK activity linked to the presence of the apomorphine conditioned response coupled with the absence of increased ERK activity following extinction of the apomorphine conditioned response suggests that ERK activity immediately following a conditioning test is an indicator of activity in brain systems with substantial dopaminergic input that are important in learning and memory. The facilitative effects of the immediate post-trial apomorphine treatment on the conditioned response are also consistent with the proposition that immediate post-trial dopaminergic drug treatments can modify the reconsolidation of conditioned behavior.

AB  - Comprehensive assessments of contemporary diatom distributions across the Arctic remain scarce. Furthermore, studies tracking species compositional differences across space and time, as well as diatom responses to climate warming, are mainly limited to paleolimnological studies due to a lack of routine monitoring in lakes and streams across vast areas of the Arctic. The study aims to provide a spatial assessment of contemporary species distributions across the circum-Arctic, establish contemporary biodiversity patterns of diatom assemblages to use as reference conditions for future biomonitoring assessments, and determine pre-industrial baseline conditions to provide historical context for modern diatom distributions. Diatom assemblages were assessed using information from ongoing regulatory monitoring programmes, individual research projects, and from surface sediment layers obtained from lake cores. Pre-industrial baseline conditions as well as the nature, direction and magnitude of changes in diatom assemblages over the pastc.200 years were determined by comparing surface sediment samples (i.e. containing modern assemblages) with a sediment interval deposited prior to the onset of significant anthropogenic activities (i.e. containing pre-1850 assemblages), together with an examination of diatoms preserved in contiguous samples from dated sediment cores. We identified several biotypes with distinct diatom assemblages using contemporary diatom data from both lakes and streams, including a biotype typical for High Arctic regions. Differences in diatom assemblage composition across circum-Arctic regions were gradual rather than abrupt. Species richness was lowest in High Arctic regions compared to Low Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, and higher in lakes than in streams. Dominant diatom taxa were not endemic to the Arctic. Species richness in both lakes and streams reached maximum values between 60 degrees N and 75 degrees N but was highly variable, probably reflecting differences in local and regional environmental factors and possibly sampling effort. We found clear taxon-specific differences between contemporary and pre-industrial samples that were often specific to both ecozone and lake depth. Regional patterns of species turnover (beta-diversity) in the pastc.200 years revealed that regions of the Canadian High Arctic and the Hudson Bay Lowlands to the south showed most compositional change, whereas the easternmost regions of the Canadian Arctic changed least. As shown in previous Arctic diatom studies, global warming has already affected these remote high latitude ecosystems. Our results provide reference conditions for future environmental monitoring programmes in the Arctic. Furthermore, diatom taxa identification and harmonisation require improvement, starting with circum-Arctic intercalibrations. Despite the challenges posed by the remoteness of the Arctic, our study shows the need for routine monitoring programmes that have a wide geographical coverage for both streams and lakes.

AB  - This study selected and used indicator and surrogate microorganisms for Salmonella to validate the processes for physically heat-treated poultry litter compost in litter processing plants. Initially, laboratory validation studies indicated that reductions of 1.2 to 2.7 log or more of desiccation-adapted Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354 were equivalent to >5-log reductions of desiccation-adapted Salmonella enterica serovar Senftenberg 775/W in poultry litter compost, depending on treatment conditions and compost types. Plant validation studies were performed in one turkey litter compost processor and one laying hen litter compost processor. E. faecium was inoculated at ca. 7 log CFU g(-1) into the turkey litter compost and at ca. 5 log CFU g(-1) into laying hen litter compost with respectively targeted moisture contents. The thermal processes in the two plants yielded 2.8 to >6.4 log CFU g(-1) (>99.86%) reductions in E. faecium. Similarly, for the processing control samples, reductions of presumptive indigenous enterococci were on the order of 1.8 to 3.7 log CFU g(-1) (98.22% to 99.98%) of the total naturally present. In contrast, there were fewer reductions of indigenous mesophiles (1.7 to 2.9 log CFU) and thermophiles (0.4 to 3.2 log CFU g(-1)). More indigenous enterococci were inactivated in the presence of higher moisture in the poultry litter compost. Based on the data collected under the laboratory conditions, the processing conditions in both plants were adequate to reduce any potential Salmonella contamination of processed poultry litter compost by at least 5 logs, even though the processing conditions varied among trials and plants.
   IMPORTANCE Poultry litter compost, commonly used as a biological soil amendment, is subjected to a physical heat treatment in the industry setting to reduce pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and produce a dry product. According to the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) produce safety rule, the thermal process for poultry litter compost should be scientifically validated to satisfy the microbial standard requirement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first validation study in commercial poultry litter compost processing plants, and our results indicated that Salmonella levels, if present, could be reduced by at least 5 logs based on the reductions of surrogate and indicator microorganisms, even though the processing conditions in these commercial plants varied greatly. Furthermore, both indicator and surrogate microorganisms along with the custom-designed sampler can serve as practical tools for poultry litter compost processors to routinely monitor or validate their thermal processes without introducing pathogens into the industrial environments.

AB  - Organic carbon content of sediments, whether directly or indirectly assessed, has often been used as an indicator of marine benthic community condition both in site-specific and regional scale condition assessment studies. The conceptual framework underlying use of this indicator was developed based primarily on site-specific studies. A quantitative analysis of literature data on sediment organic matter impacts in marine systems was conducted to determine whether biotic metrics respond to abiotic indicators of sediment organic content, as predicted by conceptual models, at larger spatial scales. The ability to detect predicted decreases in community metrics (abundance, species richness, species diversity index H', biomass) varied among metrics, with best performance by species richness and H'. There was significant added variation both between and within analytical approaches (loss on ignition, total organic carbon methods), emphasizing the need for careful cross calibration and quality control in studies with multiple laboratory partners. High levels of variability for biotic metrics versus organic carbon metrics appear typical for large scale studies, and organic matter source, site depth, and individual estuarine system differences were important sources of variation. Covariation of organic matter content with percent fine sediments is another known source of variation, but various normalization methods may be inadequate due to inherent sources of variation at estuary level. While likely still useful for point-source studies, multiple major sources of variation appear to limit the usefulness of sediment organic content as a benthic condition indicator at larger spatial scales.

AB  - Multiproxy approach based on textural, mineralogical, geochemical, and microfaunal analyses on a 176-cm-long core (SP8) has been applied to reconstruct the Holocene paleoenvironmental changes and disentangling natural vs. anthropogenic variability in Marambaia Cove of the Sepetiba Bay (SE Brazil). Sepetiba Bay became a lagoonal system due to the evolution and development of the Marambaia barrier island during the Holocene and the presence of an extensive river basin. Elemental concentrations from pre-anthropogenic layers from the nearby SP7 core have been used to estimate the baseline elemental concentrations for this region and to determine metals enrichment factors (EF), pollution load index (PLI), and sediment pollution index (SPI). Record of the core SP8 provides compelling evidence of the lagoon evolution differentiating the effects of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) under natural vs. anthropic forcing in the last similar to 9.5 ka BP. The study area was probably part of coastal sand ridges between approximate to 9.5 and 7.8 ka BP (radiocarbon date). Events of wash over deposited allochthonous material and organic matter between approximate to 8.6 and 7.8 ka. Climatic event 8.2 ka BP, in which the South American Summer Monsoon was intensified in Brazil causing higher rainfall and moisture was scored by an anoxic event. Accumulation of organic matter resulted in oxygen depletion and even anoxia in the sediment activating biogeochemical processes that resulted in the retention of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). After approximate to 7.8 ka BP at the onset of the Holocene sea-level rise, a marine incursion flooded the Marambaia Cove area (previously exposed to subaerial conditions). Environmental conditions became favorable for the colonization of benthic foraminifera. The Foram Stress Index (FSI) and Exp(H'bc) indicate that the environmental conditions turned from bad to more favorable since approximate to 7.8 ka BP, with maximum health reached at approximate to 5 ka BP, during the mid-Holocene relative sea-level highstand. Since then, the sedimentological and ecological proxies suggest that the system evolved to an increasing degree of confinement. Since approximate to 1975 AD, a sharp increase of silting, Cd, Zn, and organic matter also induced by anthropic activities caused major changes in foraminiferal assemblages with a significant increase of Ammonia/Elphidium Index (AEI), EF, and SPI values and decreasing of FSI and Exp(H'bc) (ecological indicators) demonstrating an evolution from "moderately polluted" to "heavily polluted" environment (bad ecological conditions), under variable suboxic conditions. Thus, core SP8 illustrates the most remarkable event of anthropogenic forcing on the geochemistry of the sediments and associated pollution loads and its negative effect on benthic organisms.

AB  - Little is known about the suite of ecological conditions under which characteristic species may continue to develop under the pressure of recent habitat deterioration. We aimed to determine the niche of three indicator species of the priority habitat Pannonic salt steppes and to find out how their vegetation composition, land use, and soil chemistry mirror the current condition of their typical habitat. A plot-based vegetation survey was conducted in degraded and in pristine (reference) inland salt steppes in East-Central Europe. We confirmed decreased habitat quality at their northern geographical limit. Most of the sites there showed a strong prevalence of generalists (e.g., Elytrigia repens) and lack of specialists, both resulting from lowered habitat extremity and inappropriate land use (abandonment). A small proportion of plots (19%) were in the same good condition as the reference vegetation in the central area. Soil analyses revealed that the studied halophytes are able to persist on desalinized soils if the land use is suitable. The occurrence of the annual Camphorosma annua (Amaranthaceae) was driven largely by abiotic stress; grazing alone is insufficient for its long-term persistence, while the perennial Artemisia santonicum (Asteraceae) and Tripolium pannonicum (Asteraceae) have higher survival chances as they are able to coexist with generalists. Overall habitat quality can be reliably determined from the analyzed ecological conditions of indicator species. The outcomes of the presented work are relevant for conservation practice and can serve as a quick tool for assessing the current stage of other grassland habitats.

AB  - Coastal habitats are susceptible to changes in the environment associated with alterations in salinity. A field study was conducted on natural populations of the sailfin molly Poecilia latipinna, the western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis and the least killifish Heterandria formosa collected from coastal marsh sites along a salinity gradient, to investigate the influence of salinity on body condition and reproductive life history traits. In brackish marsh sites male P. latipinna had the best body conditions, while females had similar body conditions across all 3 marsh types. Female P. latipinna had greater reproductive allotment and fecundity in brackish marshes, where this fish was most abundant. Specimens of G. affinis collected from fresh marsh sites had less favorable body condition, and females had lower reproductive allotment and fecundity than those collected from higher salinities. While G. affinis was more abundant in freshwater marshes than in higher salinity marshes, this higher abundance did not correspond with a better body condition or higher reproductive effort, suggesting that G. affinis may be stressed in freshwater. There was no difference in the conditions between (both male and female) H. formosa from fresh and intermediate marshes. Female H. formosa from fresh marshes had a similar reproductive allotment and lower fecundity than those from intermediate marshes. The 3 species exhibited different life history patterns along the salinity gradient, and some of these patterns conflicted with expectations based on species abundances. When assessing habitat quality along an environmental gradient, measures of abundance should be accompanied by more sensitive indicators of environmental stress.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has received much recent attention in studies of the evolution of sexual signaling systems. Tests apparently showing that symmetry decreases as individual condition decreases have bolstered the view that FA plays a significant role in the evolution of sexual signals. However, a closer inspection of several examples of bilateral variation as a function of trait size (a correlate of condition) suggests a different pattern of variation. Rather than FA, these traits suggest a pattern of size-dependent antisymmetry (a bimodal frequency distribution of R - L). We introduce some quantitative methods to test for condition-or size-dependent FA. Our analyses reject pure FA for four of the five published datasets involving signals (the fifth is equivocal), bur confirm the presence of size-dependent FA in one nonsignaling trait. In the studies not conforming to FA, the data appear to fit more closely a pattern of antisymmetry in individuals with smaller signaling traits. Our results thus suggest that current discussions and conclusions about the role of FA in the evolution of signaling systems should be reconsidered. More specifically, we note that condition-dependent antisymmetry offers a more reliable indicator than condition-dependent FA. We caution, however, that additional work will be needed to determine whether the pattern is general and not an artifact. Our method of analysis could usefully be applied to studies of other continuous factors expected to be correlated with asymmetries, including heterozygosity, inbreeding, and environmental stress. Finally, we suggest that antisymmetry may have commonly been mistaken for FA in a variety of cases dealing with a variety of problems.

AB  - Field observations and measurements of wetland plants have traditionally been used to monitor and evaluate wetland condition; however, there has been increasing use of remote sensing applications for rapid evaluations of wetland productivity and change. Combining key aspects of field- and remote sensing-based wetland evaluation methods can provide more efficient or improved biological indices. This exploratory study set out to develop a raster-based Wetland Vegetation Condition Indicator system that used airborne hyperspectral imagery-derived data to estimate plant-community quality (via wetland classification and Coefficient of Conservatism) and vegetation biomass (estimated using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The Wetland Vegetation Condition Indicator system was developed for three Lake Ontario wetland areas and compared to a field-based floristic quality index and a dominant-plant based Floristic quality index(dom). The indicator system serves as a proof-of-concept that capitalized on the spatial and spectral attributes of high-resolution imagery to quantify and characterize the quality and quantity of wetland vegetation. A Pearson correlation analysis showed moderate r values of 0.59 and 0.62 for floristic quality index and floristic quality index(dom), respectively, compared to the indicator method. The differences are potentially due to the spatial resolution of the imagery and the indicator method only accounting for the dominant plants within each assessment unit (pixel), therefore disregarding understory plants or those with low abundance. However, the multi-metric Wetland Vegetation Condition Indicator approach shows promise as an indicator of wetland condition by using remotely sensed data, which could be useful for more efficient landscape-scale assessments of wetland health, resilience, and recovery.

AB  - Coastal habitats worldwide, including sandy beaches, are becoming increasingly exposed to Artificial Light at Night (ALAN). Despite the spread of this global stressor, research assessing ALAN potential impacts remain scarce, particularly at the molecular level. This study addressed this gap by assessing the influence of ALAN on the physiological condition of the sandy beach insect Phalerisida maculata Kulzer (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae). RNA:DNA ratios were used here as a proxy of the insect's nutritional condition in laboratory trials that lasted 20 d. Insects were exposed to two representative ALAN conditions (either 60 or 120 lx) and compared with those maintained in a natural daylight/night cycle (0 lx at nigth; control). After the trial, organisms from each treatment were frozen in liquid nitrogen and standard protocols were followed to estimate RNA, DNA and RNA: DNA ratios. Estimates of RNA:DNA ratios from insects maintained in control conditions were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those from insects exposed to ALAN. The reduced nutritional condition of insects exposed to light pollution is explained by the lower in situ biosynthetic capacity in these organisms resulting from a reduction in their feeding. ALAN likely altered P. maculata normal locomotor activity, which takes place primarily at night, forcing the insects to remain buried in the sand for extended periods of time. As ALAN continues to spread along coastlines worldwide, there is a likelihood of growing impacts on these and other species living on sandy beaches and other coastal habitats.

AB  - Introduction. To restore and preserve the optimal ecological status of the Western Bug river basin, it is necessary to adhere to the strategic principles of environmental management, and since the river is trans-boundary and tributary basins are located in Ukraine and Poland, it is important to determine the ecological status of small rivers. In the territory of the Volyn region, the rivers-tributaries Luha and Studyanka are most affected by anthropogenic impact. An ecological assessment of water quality based on the condition of macrophytes is given, as macrophytes llow to determine the degree of surface water degradation, first of all, in terms of their trophic status.
   The purpose of article. The purpose of article aims to assess the ecological status of the rivers of the Western Bug river basin using bioindication methods and determination of the Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR).
   Methods. Research methods are expeditionary, methods of mathematical statistics end bioindication methods and determination of the Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR).
   Results. To determine the ecological status of the rivers of the Western Bug basin and to conduct research, three test sites with a length of at least 100 m were laid on two tributaries of the first order - the rivers Luha and Studyanka. To determine the MIR (Macrophyte Index for Rivers) in the test riverbed areas, 42 indicator species of macrophytes were selected, of which 1 species belongs to the division Polipodiophyta and Equisetophyta, 40 species to the division Magnoliophyta, of which 15 belong to the class Magnoliopsida, and 25 belong to the class Liliopsida. According to the classification of the MIR indicator, to determine the ecological status, the rivers Luha and Studyanka belong to lowland watercourses, with the type of macrophytes - M-VIII (organic rivers). As a result of the calculated Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR), it was established (Table 4) that the water quality in the Luha river in test site 1 (Zavydiv village) has a good ecological status, MIR is 39,0; and test site 2 (Volodymyr-Volynskyi city) has a satisfactory or moderate ecological status, MIR is 31,56; in the river Studyanka, the test site 3 (Ustyluh town) has a satisfactory or moderate ecological condition, MIR is 28,31.
   Conclusions. According to the ecological status of rivers determined by the Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR), it is established that the waters of the Luha and Studyanka rivers have a satisfactory or moderate ecological condition. This suggests that the research conducted on test sites and calculations of the Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR) are identical and fully reflect the ecological status of the rivers Luha and Studyanka determined by hydrochemical parameters, which allows the use of this research algorithm for other rivers in the Western Bug river basin and is promising during research on other rivers of Ukraine.

AB  - Under the EU Water Framework Directive, ecological assessment and management are based on type-specific reference conditions. In the EU it may be difficult to find sites in large rivers with at least near-natural conditions, though this is not the case in southeast Europe, where stretches of large rivers still exist with at least near-natural conditions, meaning that there is little or no disturbance from hydromorphological alteration, water quality, land use in the catchment and alien species. We examined benthic invertebrate assemblages in 45 samples collected from near-natural sites of several large rivers: Sava, Drava, Mura, Kupa and Una. The near-natural benthic invertebrate assemblages of large rivers contained several rare or remarkable species, especially among stoneflies, e.g., Marthamea vitripennis, Xanthoperla apicalis. We compared benthic invertebrate communities in river sections with fine and coarse substrates and in three eco-hydromorphological (ECO-HM) types of large rivers, reflecting habitat heterogeneity: lowland-deep, lowland-braided and intermountain. Multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was used to statistically evaluate similarities among assemblages. It was found that the composition of benthic invertebrate assemblages varied by both ECO-HM types and substrate category. Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis showed that the average dissimilarity of benthic invertebrate assemblages was high between all ECO-HM type pairs and between fine and coarse substrate. We found that habitat heterogeneity and substrate independently influenced benthic invertebrate assemblages. To achieve ecological goals in the management of large rivers, in addition to functionality, a holistic view with at least near-natural assemblages, including the names of the taxa present, should also be considered.

AB  - The influence of site-specific conditions on contaminant bioavailability and toxicity to benthic invertebrates is a key consideration in the environmental risk assessment process. This is particularly relevant for contaminants with complex speciation chemistries, such as arsenic. The present study addressed uncertainties regarding arsenic toxicity to a mayfly (Baetis tricaudatus) under low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions characteristic of many contaminated sites. Arsenic toxicity (arsenite, As(III); arsenate, As(V)) to mayfly nymphs was assessed under two DO scenarios (68 and 84% saturation). Arsenic speciation ratios were determined during testing to confirm the nature of arsenic exposure. The present study found that As(III) was more lethal and bioaccumulated to a greater degree in B. tricaudatus compared to As(V), but the sublethal toxicities of the two arsenic species were similar. Nymph growth and development were significantly inhibited after 12 d of exposure to both 1 mg/L of As(III) and As(V). Exposure to arsenic under low DO conditions (6.5 mg/L, 68% saturation) did not significantly affect As(III) orAs(V) toxicity and bioaccumulation over 12 d. The DO level of 6.5 mg/L, however, appeared to be marginally lethal to B. tricaudatus. Results indicate that the Canadian arsenic criterion for the protection of aquatic life (5 mu g/L) is protective of B. tricaudatus and is low enough to accommodate differences in arsenic toxicity because of the interconversions between As(III) and As(V). These findings provide insight regarding the toxicity and speciation of arsenic under DO conditions considered to be low for this lotic mayfly species and representative of existing conditions at mine sites in northern Canada.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Environmental abiotic stimuli, e.g., temperature stress conditions, can influence the phenotype, reproduction, and epigenetics of plants. How a plant responds to cold temperature stress regarding these aspects, together with the interactions between them and the ploidy level, is still not intensively explored. Herein, we test such effects under experimental cold stress conditions on the species Ranunculus kuepferi, an alpine perennial herb, which mainly occurs in two cytotypes. Results suggest that diploid individuals grow better under warm conditions, while tetraploids prefer cold conditions. Moreover, phenotypic characteristics seem to correlate with the epigenetic patterns. Furthermore, cold stress conditions seem to reduce the reproductive fitness of both cytotypes. We propose that results illustrate that phenotypic plasticity, i.e., the ability of an organism, as a single genotype, to differentially respond to environmental stimuli, may affect the potential of the two cytotypes to tolerate cold stress. Finally, our study follows the geographical distribution of the species, i.e., the phenomenon that asexual taxa occupy larger geographical ranges than their sexual progenitors and extend further toward cold environments at high altitudes, which was previously observed for the natural population of the species in the European Alps.
   Plant life in alpine habitats is shaped by harsh abiotic conditions and cold climates. Phenotypic variation of morphological characters and reproduction can be influenced by temperature stress. Nevertheless, little is known about the performance of different cytotypes under cold stress and how epigenetic patterns could relate to phenotypic variation. Ranunculus kuepferi, a perennial alpine plant, served as a model system for testing the effect of cold stress on phenotypic plasticity, reproduction mode, and epigenetic variation. Diploid and autotetraploid individuals were placed in climate growth cabinets under warm and cold conditions. Morphological traits (height, leaves and flowers) and the proportion of well-developed seeds were measured as fitness indicators, while flow cytometric seed screening (FCSS) was utilized to determine the reproduction mode. Subsequently, comparisons with patterns of methylation-sensitive amplified fragment-length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were conducted. Diploids grew better under warm conditions, while tetraploids performed better in cold treatments. Epigenetic patterns were correlated with the expressed morphological traits. Cold stress reduced the reproduction fitness but did not induce apomixis in diploids. Overall, our study underlines the potential of phenotypic plasticity for acclimation under environmental conditions and confirms the different niche preferences of cytotypes in natural populations. Results help to understand the pattern of geographical parthenogenesis in the species.

AB  - Understanding the effects of disturbances on the physical-chemical quality of ecosystems is a crucial step to the development of ecosystem assessment tools. 95 sampling sites distributed among 4 categories of disturbance, i.e.: reference, logging, formerly and currently gold mining, were characterized using stream physical and chemical variables. Our hypotheses were: (i) logging and gold mining activities primarily affect the physical habitat structure of streams and (ii) both have an effect on chemical environments through nutrient and/or fine particulate resuspension. We demonstrate that physical variables describing the river bottom, and suspended solids discriminate both current and formerly gold mined sites from reference sites, while, whatever the type of impact encountered, nutrient concentrations do not prove relevant to measure human impacts. To understand distribution patterns of aquatic organism across FG, future research should thus aim at examining the match between physical-chemical and biological classifications of small streams under reference and impacted conditions.

AB  - The impact of human activities on the Himalayan biogeophysical, socioeconomic and cultural environments has been analyzed. The main man-induced activities which threaten the equilibrium of Himalayan Mountain ecosystems are unplanned land use, cultivation on steep slopes, overgrazing, major engineering activities, overexploitation of village or community forests, shifting cultivation, unplanned tourism and urbanization. Cold desert conditions prevail in 41 692 km2 of the northwestern Himalayas. The geomorphological conditions and arrested succession, checking the climax formation, are major causes of landslides. Sedimentation, changes in surface and groundwater hydrology and clearfelling of broadleaved plant species have caused eutrophication, drying up of natural springs and receding of glaciers. Wild fauna like Musk deer (Moschus mischiferus) and Snow leopard (Panthera uncia) are now under threat due to changes in their habitats. Population pressure, migration and settlements are major causes of poverty and agglomeration, and jeopardize the Himalayan environment. Based on detailed environmental impact assessment, an ecosystem approach has been proposed for resources con-servation and environmentally sustainable development of the Himalayas.

AB  - Agricultural intensification can impact the availability and quality of resources. We analyzed resource use by bumble bees (Bombus spp.), important pollinators of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), collected from conventional highbush blueberry farms, organic highbush blueberry farms, and nearby natural areas in the lower Fraser River valley of British Columbia, Canada. We identified corbicular pollen and measured bee fat content as an indicator of body condition. Bumble bees use non-crop resources, including pollen from plant species not found on farms. Bees from natural areas had higher pollen protein content in corbicular pollen and higher body fat content than those from conventional and organic farms. There was no difference between farm types, and we could not demonstrate a relationship between pollen protein and bee fat content. Our findings illustrate the importance of resource availability throughout agro-ecological landscapes, including not only farms but also off-farm areas.

AB  - The migration of Neotropical birds may provide a robust measure of changing environmental condition along the migratory route. I review previous work on assessing broad-scale stopover quality in the eastern United States and discuss how future research can aid regional environmental assessment. Scientists can quantify how environmental changes affect the migratory system, and then monitor for those effects on migrant abundance from year to year. The cyclical nature of migration provides a constant re-evaluation of habitat quality and spatial distribution by migrant birds. Avian monitoring programs can detect changes in migrant abundance. Migrating birds may thus provide a living sensor of environmental change, enabling broad-scale environmental assessments to detect and address habitat degradation early on, allowing local managers to prioritize restoration efforts accordingly. Understanding the environmental factors driving stopover selection, and how birds move between stopovers during migration, is an important first step.

AB  - Passive acoustic sensors provide a cost-effective tool for monitoring marine environments. Documenting acoustic conditions among habitats can provide insights into temporal changes in ecosystem composition and anthropogenic impacts. Agencies tasked with safeguarding marine protected areas, such as the U.S. National Park Service and U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, are increasingly interested in using long-term monitoring of underwater sounds as a means of tracking species diversity and ecosystem health. In this study, low-frequency passive acoustic recordings were collected fall 2014 - spring 2018, using standardized instrumentation, from four marine protected areas across geographically disparate regions of the U.S. Economic Exclusive Zone: Northwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, South Pacific, and Caribbean. Recordings were analyzed for differences in seasonal conditions and to identify acoustic metrics useful for resource assessment across all sites. In addition to comparing ambient sound levels, a species common to all four sites, the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), was used to compare biological sound detection. Ambient sound levels varied across the sites and were driven by differences in animal vocalization rates, anthropogenic activity, and weather. The highest sound levels [dB(RMS(50 Hz-1.5 kHz)) re 1 mu Pa] were recorded in the Northwest Atlantic in Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (Stellwagen) during the boreal winter-spring resulting from bioacoustic activity, vessel traffic, and high wind speeds. The lowest sound levels [dB(RMS(50 Hz-1.5 )(kHz)) re 1 mu Pa] were recorded in the Northeast Pacific adjacent to a vessel-restricted area of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (Glacier Bay) during the boreal summer. Humpback whales were detected seasonally in the southern latitude sites, and throughout the deployment periods in the northern latitude sites. Temporal trends in band and spectrum sound levels in Glacier Bay and the National Park of American Samoa were primarily driven by biological sound sources, while trends in Stellwagen and the Buck Island Reef National Monument were primarily driven by anthropogenic sources. These results highlight the variability of ambient sound conditions in marine protected areas in U.S. waters, and the utility of long-term soundscape monitoring for condition assessment in support of resource management.

AB  - Mexican tropical dry forests are remarkably extensive and floristically diverse despite manifesting alarming rates of deforestation. Riparian habitats within dry forests provide critical ecological benefits that may mitigate negative impacts, but processes underlying riparian functions are still not well understood. We identified physical environmental conditions affecting the composition and abundance of standing vegetation assemblages and woody and herbaceous components in soil seedbank assemblages of riparian corridors in central Mexico using mainly NMDS ordination techniques, permuted analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), permuted analysis of multivariate dispersions and constrained ordination (CAP). We then determined representative species associated with particular environmental conditions using an indicator species analysis and assessed the effects of physical environmental variables/factors on total seed abundances by fitting a mixed-effect model. For the standing vegetation study, we assessed the effects of the type of the river condition (differing in surface flow permanence), location, and height above river level on the community composition based on three species importance criteria (abundance, coverage and DBH). For the soil seedbank study, we assessed the effects of these variables/factors plus season and land use. Spatial heterogeneity was a prevailing feature in riparian vegetation, in the standing vegetation and soil seedbank of both woody and herbaceous components. Height above river level had a significant effect on the three species importance criteria of standing vegetation and so did the interaction between surface flow permanence and height on coverage. The soil seedbank of woody and herbaceous plants showed significant differences between seasons; Taxodium mucronatum was an indicator tree species in dry seasons. Land use, height, surface flow permanence and the interaction between land use and surface flow permanence had significant effects on the soil seedbank of herbaceous plants. Total seed abundances in the soil varied between years and were higher at lower height values, during the dry seasons, and when rivers were permanent. Tree communities, commonly the most important elements in riparian ecosystems, were preserved in the soil seedbank of cultivated areas for >30 years. Seeds of herbaceous communities were predominant and ecologically relevant as indicator species because of their high sensitivity to several key environmental factors, constituting a critical component of Mexican tropical dry forests riparian corridors.

AB  - The effect of technogenic pressure on the weight indices of major endocrine glands responsible for adaptation to adverse environmental conditions was studied in murine rodents. The data obtained in technogenic and natural ecosystems were compared. Using the method of morphophysiological indicators, it was shown that exposure to heavy pollution (emissions from lead and zinc smelters) caused a significant increase in the adrenal index of virgin animals (0.45-0.56 mg/g, compared to 0.15-0.33 mg/g in the norm); conversely, the liver index decreased to 39.0-49.0 mg/g (below the lower limit of the norm). The simultaneous increase in the adrenal index and decrease in the liver index of rodents in autumn are indicative of exhaustion, which leads to an energy breakdown and mass mortality. The core of the population in the next spring consists of juveniles coming from the neighboring biotopes with more favorable conditions. Thus, under the effect of technogenic pressure, a temporary population of small mammals is formed every year.

AB  - Current literature suggests that grassland degradation occurs in areas with poor soil conditions or noticeable environmental changes and is often a result of overgrazing or human disturbances. However, these views are questioned in our analyses. Based on the analysis of satellite vegetation maps from 1984, 1998, and 2004 for the Xilin River Basin, Inner Mongolia, China, and binary logistic regression (BLR) analysis, we observe the following: (1) grassland degradation is positively correlated with the growth density of climax communities; (2) our findings do not support a common notion that a decrease of biological productivity is a direct indicator of grassland degradation; (3) a causal relationship between grazing intensity and grassland degradation was not found; (4) degradation severity increased steadily towards roads but showed different trends near human settlements. This study found complex relationships between vegetation degradation and various microhabitat conditions, for example, elevation, slope, aspect, and proximity to water.

AB  - Wetland restoration efforts conducted in Louisiana under the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act require monitoring the effectiveness of individual projects as well as monitoring the cumulative effects of all projects in restoring, creating, enhancing, and protecting the coastal landscape. The effectiveness of the traditional paired-reference monitoring approach in Louisiana has been limited because of difficulty in finding comparable reference sites. A multiple reference approach is proposed that uses aspects of hydrogeomorphic functional assessments and probabilistic sampling. This approach includes a suite of sites that encompass the range of ecological condition for each stratum, with projects placed on a continuum of conditions found for that stratum. Trajectories in reference sites through time are then compared with project trajectories through time. Plant community zonation complicated selection of indicators, strata, and sample size. The approach proposed could serve as a model for evaluating wetland ecosystems.

AB  - The necessity to increase soil fertility by identifying their critical condition, which is associated with developing erosion processes, increasing acidity and decreasing humus, has been proven in the article. The requirement of introducing crop rotations and their legal regulation in Ukraine has been determined. The practice connected with the questions of supporting soil quality and crop rotations in different countries, members of the EU has been presented. The assessment of modern farming systems (intensive, organic, no-till, strip-till, precise, bio-enzyme, biogenic) taking into account economic, ecological, technological-energy, and social factors aimed at determining their impact on the natural soil fertility has been conducted. The expediency of improving soil quality in terms of its evaluation has been revealed. The necessity of introducing economic incentives or penalties to landowners or land users for agro-ecological condition of farmlands basing on the methods of land money value has been substantiated.

AB  - Concerns about the effect of sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent on he health of freshwater ecosystems have increased. In this sludy, a unique approach was designed to show the effect of an STP effluent-dominaled stream on naive wild brown Luna (Sohn trultu L.) exposed under fully natural conditions. Zivny stream is located in South Bohemia, Czech Republic. The downstream site of Zivny stream is an STP-affecled sire, which receives 25% of is wafer from Prachalice STP effluent.. Upsffeam, however, is a minimally polluted water site and i is considered Lo be the control sire. Native fish were collected from the upstream site, Lagged, and distributed W both upstream and downstream sites. After 30, 90, and 180 days, fish were recaptured from both sites to determine whether the downstream site of the Zivny stream is associated with the effects of environmental pollution. Several biomarkers indicating the oxidative stress and antioxidant enzyme activities, cytochrome P450 activity, xenoestrogenic effects, bacterial composition, and lipid composition were investigated. Additionally, polar chemical contaminants (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)) were quantified using polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). Fifty-three PPCPs were detected in the downstream site; 36 of those were constantly present during the 180-day investigation period. Elevated hepatic 7-benzyloxy-4trifluoromethylcoumarin-0-debenzyloxylase (BFCOD) (alter 90 days) and blood plasma vitellogenin concentrations in males were detected in fish downstream of the SIP effluent during all sampling events. An increase in the fishes' total fat content was also observed, but with low levels of omega-3 fatty acid in muscle tissue. Two bacterial taxa related to activated sludge were found in the intestines of fish from downstream. Our results show that Prachatice STP is a major source of PPCPs in the Zivny stream, which has biological consequences on fish physiology. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Restoration ecology has provided a suite of tools for accelerating the recovery of ecosystems damaged by drivers of global change. We review both the ecological and economic concepts developed in restoration ecology, and offer guidance on when, what, where, and how to restore ecosystems. For when to restore, we highlight the value of pursuing restoration early to prevent ecosystems from crossing tipping points and evaluating whether unassisted natural recovery is more cost-effective than active restoration. For what to restore, we encourage developing a restoration plan with stakeholders that will restore structural, compositional, and functional endpoints, and whose goal is a more resistant and resilient ecosystem. For where to restore, we emphasize developing restoration approaches that can address the impediment of rural poverty in the developing world and identifying and then balancing the ecosystems and regions in most need of restoration and those that are best positioned for restoration success. For the economics of how to restore ecosystems, we review the advantages and disadvantages of market-based strategies, such as environmental insurance bonds and Payment for Ecosystem Services frameworks, for funding, incentivizing, and ensuring restoration. For the ecology of how to restore ecosystems, we discuss the value of taking into account various ecological theories, site history, and landscape and aquascape perspectives, and employing a more inclusive toolbox that holistically considers alterations to propagule pressure, abiotic conditions, and biotic interactions. Finally, we draw attention to the importance of monitoring; adaptive management; stakeholder involvement; collaborations among scientists, managers, and practitioners; formal evaluation throughout the restoration process; and integrating ecological and economic concepts to maximize restoration success. We hope this overview of key ecological and economic concepts in restoration science sheds light on the discipline and facilitates restoring and maintaining the services and products provided by natural capital, thus improving human livelihoods and hope for posterity.

AB  - 1. Gorgonians are long-lived engineering species and their conservation is crucial to maintaining the biodiversity of marine communities. The slow dynamics displayed by these species make them especially vulnerable when faced with increasing disturbances.
   2. The sessile nature and structural role of gorgonians provide several ecological similarities with trees, allowing the application of different approaches developed by forest ecology studies to overcome the constraint of long time-scales to collect valuable dynamic data. Using these approaches, we examined the distribution and demography of two representative Mediterranean gorgonian species, Paramuricea clavata and Eunicella singularis, along a regional spatial scale as well as their response to disturbances.
   3. The regular spatial distribution and the upper distribution limit of E. singularis suggest that this species is more tolerant to a wide range of environmental conditions than P. clavata, which exhibited a more asymmetrical spatial distribution and variation in the upper distribution limit on the latitudinal scale.
   4. Size distributions of both species showed contrasting population dynamics. The size distribution of E. singularis was characterized by initial stages of populations (0-10 cm) in contrast to the scarcity of this stage displayed by P. clavata. This suggests differences in recruitment between species. Furthermore, only P. clavata populations displayed a strong negative correlation between density and biomass with a slope close to -3/2, indicating a self-thinning mechanism and therefore the existence of a carrying capacity. This result and the trajectories of disturbed populations below the self-thinning line revealed this approach as a useful method to identify the effects of biological or physical disturbance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The approaches used in this study provide insights into management needs in face of the difficulty of having to deal with the population dynamics of very slow-growing threatened species. In particular, gorgonian populations can be used as an indicator of the effects of climatic anomalies on the coralligenous community.

AB  - Management of mangroves in a sustainable ecological as well as economic way is a difficult proposition and needs multi-disciplinary intervention. This paper highlights the importance of criteria and indicators to evaluate the status of performance of communities in managing their mangroves sustainably. The framework developed on the basis of 6 principles, 12 criteria, 36 indicators and 47 verifiers had been applied for assessment of Eco-Development Committees of the Sunderbans, India. Results show the presence of a highly positive correlation between performance of the committees and condition of the mangrove environment. Level of implementation of legal and institutional management strategies to protect mangroves proves to be the essential pre-condition in achieving sustainability. The study further demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed framework in the context of community forestry since the methodology was designed to be simple and flexible so as to apply it in forest management unit level without any major difficulty.

AB  - Taking action to contribute to the preservation of the natural coastal environment, which maintains a diversity of life, is important in today's world. In estuarine ecosystems that are included in marine protected areas (MPA), it is important to conduct biomonitoring over time to monitor the effects of xenobiotics on bioindicator species such as the catfish Cathorops spixii. This study aims to evaluate the toxicogenetic signals in C. spixii from a MPA (Cananeia-Iguape region, Brazilian coast). These genotoxic signals are demonstrated by the presence of micronuclei (MN) and abnormalities in erythrocytes (AE). This study also takes into account the environmental differences signaled by the water's properties (temperature, salinity, pH, DO, dissolved nutrients, and particulate material) over time (2009, 2014, 2017, and 2018). The results show that in the northern region of the estuary, and mainly in 2009, the water properties reveal the influence of the river in the form of the lowest levels of salinity and pH and the highest levels of nutrients. The most significant levels of suspended particulate material and chlorophyll-a are found in the southern region of the estuary, mainly in 2017 and 2018. In general, the C. spixii from the northern region had better well-being than catfish from the more preserved (southern) region. The data on MN and AE show evidence of toxicogenetic damage occurring over time and clastogenic/aneugenic effects mainly in fish sampled in 2018. The presence of a new AE, first recorded in C. spixii sampled in 2018, and named here as double bubbled, is another indicator of toxicogenetic effects. Finally, although the southern region of the estuary has better abiotic properties and conditions for primary production, the obtained toxicogenetic data for C. spixii reinforces the need for - and encourages the implementation of - monitoring actions in this marine protected area using bioindicator species of contamination.

AB  - National water quality monitoring in South Africa has in the past mainly focused on measuring physical and chemical variables. However, it is increasingly realised that measuring physical and chemical variables on their own cannot provide an accurate account of the general ''health'' of an aquatic ecosystem. Biological communities, on the other hand, are accurate indicators of overall environmental conditions. This paper examines the potential and feasibility of incorporating biological monitoring in a programme designed to assess ecosystem health. The current status of biomonitoring within the RSA Department of Water Affairs and Forestry is outlined and challenges for the future are discussed. It is concluded that biomonitoring should form an essential part of ecosystem health assessment, and research and development in this field is encouraged. The developmental process should be a collaborative partnership between resource managers and researchers.

AB  - Natural flow variability is the primary driver of riverine ecosystem function and structure. Alterations in hydrologic regimes modify habitat attributes and impair ecosystem connectivity. The indicators of hydrologic alteration and range of variability approach methods are used to investigate the hydrologic alterations due to Danjiangkou reservoir in the middle stream of Hanjiang river, China, over the past five decades. The results show that Danjiangkou reservoir has significantly changed the ecohydrological flow regime downstream of the dam, especially in the spawning time of the famous four major carps. To minimize the negative ecological impacts, it is necessary to optimize the current operation rules of Danjiangkou reservoir for river ecosystem health protection. We hope the results of the current study could support ecosystem management and restoration plans and provide key ecohydrological parameters for the Danjiangkou reservoir ecological operations in the Hanjiang river.

AB  - Tree leaves are interfaces between the whole organism and the environment. Leaves display a series of attributes that are linked to specific functions (functional leaf traits-FLT) and/or show responses to biotic and abiotic stress factors (stress response traits, SRT), which can be subdivided into: (a) morphological traits; (b) chemical traits; (c) physiological traits; (d) symptoms. The analysis of FLT is a useful tool for tree species and provenance phenotyping, due to the adaptation of trees to environmental stress. Additionally, FLT can be used as response factor in long term and large spatial scales surveys of forest conditions. Despite these potential benefits of leaf traits in the assessment of ecosystem health and functioning, leaf sampling in forests is time-consuming and costly, especially in forests with a complex vertical and horizontal structure and in remote forest areas. Once a foliar sample has been collected, many different analyses can be carried out; however, analyses should be technically simple and able to be performed within one day following the leaf collection (i.e., on fresh samples), or after air-drying the leaves themselves (analysis of dried specimens). This paper reports the results of leaf sampling and foliar analyses carried out in previous research projects and revises the current state-of-the-art. The leaf traits that are easily obtainable from leaf sampling are listed, together with the operational procedures necessary for their measurement, described in a standardized protocol. Their ecological and functional relevance is discussed in relation to their potential information (as indicators of climatic stress, drought, air and soil pollution, tree light-use and competition, plant nutritional status, health and general plant stress conditions). Finally, this review provides suggestions for the elaboration and reporting of data, and proposes some guidelines to improve the effectiveness of foliar analysis in the assessment of forest ecosystem health, properties and functioning.

AB  - The presence of energetic materials (used as explosives and propellants) at contaminated sites is a growing international issue, particularly with respect to military base closures and demilitarization policies. Improved understanding of the ecotoxicological effects of these materials is needed in order to accurately assess the potential exposure risks and impacts on the environment and its ecosystems. We studied the toxicity of the nitroaromatic energetic material 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) on alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli L. Beauv.), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) using four natural soils varying in properties (organic matter, clay content, and pH) that were hypothesized to affect chemical bioavailability and toxicity. Amended soils were subjected to natural light conditions, and wetting and drying cycles in a greenhouse for 13 weeks prior to toxicity testing to approximate field exposure conditions in terms of bioavailability, transformation, and degradation of 2,4-DNT. Definitive toxicity tests were performed according to standard protocols. The median effective concentration (EC50) values for shoot dry mass ranged from 8 to 229 mg kg(-1), depending on the plant species and soil type. Data indicated that 2,4-DNT was most toxic in the Sassafras (SSL) and Teller (TSL) sandy loam soils, with EC50 values for shoot dry mass ranging between 8 to 44 mg kg(-1), and least toxic in the Webster clay loam soil, with EC50 values for shoot dry mass ranging between 40 to 229 mg kg(-1). The toxicity of 2,4-DNT for each of the plant species was significantly (p <= 0.05) and inversely correlated with the soil organic matter content. Toxicity benchmark values determined in the present studies for 2,4-DNT weathered-and-aged in SSL or TSL soils will contribute to development of an Ecological Soil Screening Level for terrestrial plants that can be used for ecological risk assessment at contaminated sites.

AB  - This paper describes an envisioning system (EvS) designed to help rural communities contemplate landscape level changes. Simulations and models project current conditions into the future according to the constraints of scenario-based planning and available land use choices. Possible futures are represented through visual (213, 3D and iconic) indicators. This paper defines four distinct world-views (romantic, pastoral, ecological, and economic) and then reviews system design in the light of these views. Two key system aspects discussed are the indicators of environmental conditions, and the styles of data presentation. A developed EvS was tested in two public workshops. In one the world-views were explicitly introduced, and in the second they emerged naturally through exploration of futures. Our findings suggest that awareness and understanding of four major world-views can help plan and evaluate major software systems while also providing a convenient structure for analysis of results.

AB  - With increasing depth, the ocean is less sampled for physical, chemical and biological variables. Using the Global Marine Environmental Datasets (GMED) and Ecological Marine Units (EMUs), we show that spatial variation in environmental variables decreases with depth. This is also the case over temporal scales because seasonal change, surface weather conditions, and biological activity are highest in shallow depths. A stratified sampling approach to ocean sampling is therefore proposed whereby deeper environments, both pelagic and benthic, would be sampled with relatively lower spatial and temporal resolutions. Sampling should combine measurements of physical and chemical parameters with biological species distributions, even though species identification is difficult to automate. Species distribution data are essential to infer ecosystem structure and function from environmental data. We conclude that a globally comprehensive, stratification-based ocean sampling program would be both scientifically justifiable and cost-effective.

   The accurate characterization of coral reef habitats not only supplies invaluable data to marine researchers but also provides conservation managers the necessary information to protect these fragile ecosystems. Without accurate in situ documentation of benthic coral reef communities, the general health, as well as the effects of stressors on these habitats, cannot be correctly quantified for scientific evaluation. In this study, the benthic ecological assessment for marginal reefs (BEAMR), a comprehensive monitoring protocol for reef characterization, was applied to a nearshore coral reef system in the southeast region of the Gulf of Mexico to determine if the condition of the habitat had negatively altered over the study's duration. BEAMR data sets were collected in three separate sampling events over 5 years, with sampling scheduled around an experimental application of beach compatible sand adjacent to the study area. The results from PRIMER-E v.6 statistical analyses showed that the marine reef community as a whole (i.e., integration of all benthic functional groups) was not negatively affected throughout the study's duration. Additionally, parametric statistical analyses showed that the coral reef habitat in this Gulf region did not sustain significant influxes of sediment or adverse effects to the biota, but rather showed a significant increase in stony coral colony size and cover over time. Overall, it was determined that the condition of this reef resource has maintained a positive level of sustainability during this study, and by using the BEAMR method, marine biologists were able to statistically quantify the health of a coral reef system. Even so, the vulnerability of reef resources remain, which is why specific habitat assessment protocols, such as the BEAMR method, help support the worldwide conservation of coral reef communities. By aiding in the quantification of reef health, BEAMR can help identify and characterize potential reef effects from both natural and human pressures.

AB  - There is a growing consensus among natural and social scientists that sustainability depends on maintaining natural capital. However, progress to put this ecological condition to practice has been slow, not least because of the inability of making these objectives measurable. Therefore, to overcome this obstacle, assessment frameworks for natural capital are needed. This study presents a simple framework for national and global natural capital accounting. It demonstrates, using the example of Italy, an accounting framework which tracks national economies' energy and resource throughput and translates them into biologically productive areas necessary to produce these flows. This calculation has been applied to over 52 countries. With this framework, based on the ecological footprint concept, human consumption can be compared with natural capital production at the global and national level, using existing data.

AB  - Ecological evaluation is essential for remediation, restoration, and Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA), and forms the basis for many management practices. These include determining status and trends of biological, physical, or chemical/radiological conditions, conducting environmental impact assessments, performing remedial actions should remediation fail, managing ecosystems and wildlife, and assessing the efficacy of remediation, restoration, and long-term stewardship. The objective of this paper is to explore the meanings of these assessments, examine the relationships among them, and suggest methods of integration that will move environmental management forward. While remediation, restoration, and NRDA, among others, are often conducted separately, it is important to integrate them for contaminated land where the risks to ecoreceptors (including humans) can be high, and the potential damage to functioning ecosystems great. Ecological evaluations can range from inventories of local plants and animals, determinations of reproductive success of particular species, levels of contaminants in organisms, kinds and levels of effects, and environmental impact assessments, to very formal ecological risk assessments for a chemical or other stressor. Such evaluations can range from the individual species to populations, communities, ecosystems or the landscape scale. Ecological evaluations serve as the basis for making decisions about the levels and kinds of remediation, the levels and kinds of restoration possible, and the degree and kinds of natural resource injuries that have occurred because of contamination. Many different disciplines are involved in ecological evaluation, including biologists, conservationists, foresters, restoration ecologists, ecological engineers, economists, hydrologist, and geologists. Since ecological evaluation forms the basis for so many different types of environmental management, it seems reasonable to integrate management options to achieve economies of time, energy, and costs.

AB  - Haloacetic acids (HAAs) are contaminants of aquatic ecosystems with numerous sources, both anthropogenic and natural. The toxicity of HAAs to aquatic plants is generally uncharacterized. Laboratory tests were conducted with three macrophytes (Lemna gibba, Myriophyllum sibiricum and Myriophyllum spicatum) to assess the toxicity of five HAAs. Myriophyllum spp. has been proposed as required test species for pesticide registration in North America, but few studies have been conducted under standard test conditions. The HAAs in the present experiments were monochloroacetic acid (MCA), dichloroacetic acid (DCA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and chlorodifluoroacetic acid (CDFA). MCA was the most toxic to Myriophyllum spp. with EC50 values ranging from 8 to 12.4 mg/l depending on the endpoint, followed by DCA (EC50 range 62-722.5 mg/l), TCA (EC50 range 49.5-1702.6 mg/l), CDFA (EC50 range 105.3 to > 10,000 mg/l) and with TFA (EC50 range 222.1 to 10,000 mg/l) the least toxic. Generally, L. gibba was less sensitive to HAA toxicity than Myriophyllum spp., with the difference in toxicity between them approximately threefold. The range of toxicity within Myriophyllum spp. was normally less than twofold. Statistically, plant length and node number were the most sensitive endpoints as they had the lowest observed coefficients of variation, but they were not the most sensitive to HAA toxicity. Toxicological sensitivity of endpoints varied depending on the measure of effect chosen and the HAA, with morphological endpoints usually an order of magnitude more sensitive than pigments for all plant species. Overall, mass and root measures tended to be the most sensitive indicators of HAA toxicity. The data from this paper were subsequently used in an ecological risk assessment for HAAs and aquatic plants. The assessment found HAAs to be of low risk to aquatic macrophytes and the results are described in the second manuscript of this series. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dry-rewetting perturbations are natural disturbances in the edaphic environment and particularly in dryland cultivation areas. The interaction of this disturbance with glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) deserves special attention in the soil environment due to the intensification of agricultural practices and the acceleration of climate change with an intensified water cycle. The objective of this study was to assess the response of microbial communities in a soil with a long history of GBHs to a secondary imposed perturbation (a single dry-rewetting event). A factorial microcosm study was conducted to evaluate the potential conditioning effect of an acute glyphosate exposure on the response to a following dry-rewetting event. A respiratory quotient (RQ) based on an ecologically relevant substrate (p-coumaric acid) and basal respiration was used as a physiological indicator. Similarly, DNA-based analyses were considered, including quantitative PCR (qPCR) of functional sensitive microbial groups linked to cycles of carbon (Actinobacteria) and nitrogen (ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms), qPCR of total bacteria and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Significant effects of herbicide and of dry-rewetting perturbations were observed in the RQ and in the copy number of the amoA gene of AOB, respectively. However, no significant interaction was observed between them when analyzing the physiological indicator and the copy number of the evaluated genes. PCR- DGGE results were not conclusive regarding a potential effect of dry-rewetting x herbicide interaction on AOB community structure, suggesting further analysis by deep sequencing of the amoA gene. The results of this study indicate that the perturbation of an acute glyphosate exposure in a soil with a long history of this herbicide does not have a conditioning effect on the response to a subsequent dry-rewetting disturbance according to a physiological indicator or the quantified bacterial/archaeal genes. This is particularly relevant for the sustainability of soils in rainfed agriculture, where frequent exposure to GBHs along with intensification of hydrological cycles are expected to occur. Further studies considering multiple dry-rewetting disturbances and in different soil types should be conducted to simulate those conditions and to validate our results.

AB  - Plant cover acts to maintain the balance between soil chemical, physical, and biological attributes, as well as superficial soil protection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of iron ore mining and their reclamation on soil physical properties and soil visual quality in Fort Lauderdale Municipal Park and Serra do Curral Municipal Park, Iron Quadrangle (Quadrilatero Ferrifero), Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The evaluated areas varied in relation to the post-mining condition, natural revegetation (NR), an area with gully erosion (GA) and area under eucalyptus revegetation (ER) and native vegetation cover, rupestrian field (RF), and seasonal semi-deciduous forest (NF). The main soil physical attributes evaluated were: soil organic matter (SOM), geometric mean diameter (GMD), weighted mean diameter (WMD), bulk density (Bd), air capacity (ACb), plant-available water capacity (AWC), relative field capacity (RFC), and visual soil quality assessment. In addition to the impacts on the landscape, with removal of vegetation and soil cover, iron ore mining process impacts soil physical quality measured through porosity and aggregation properties and therefore could impact ecosystems services. Areas of iron post-mining that are not restored can develop gully erosion. NR shows high erosion risk inferred through aggregation indicators (GMD=3.84 mm; MWD=3.04 mm), despite similar soil organic matter content and higher plant-available water and air (NR [AWC=0.102 m(3) m(-3); ACb=0.328 m(3) m(-3)], NF [AWC=0.062 m(3) m(-3); ACb=0.202 m(3) m(-3)]) compared with NF (GMD=4.77 mm; MWD=4.56 mm). ER had similar soil structure stability compared to NF as well most of the porosity indicators, which is associated with the higher soil organic matter. Soil visual assessment alone was not able to characterize the soil physical quality, mainly in the post-mining areas, because it was designed for agricultural soils.

AB  - The soil microbiota, a key component of natural ecosystems, is considered as a factor determining the stability of meadow communities. The diversity and abundance of the main ecologically significant groups of microorganisms in meadow soils have been studied along a gradient of long-term soil pollution with heavy metals in the Middle Urals. The results provide evidence for stability of the microbial assemblage formed in these soils. It has been found that the functional activity of certain physiological groups of microorganisms (nitrogen-fixing, denitrifying, and cellulolytic bacteria) and the respiratory activity of microbial communities are stimulated under conditions of heavy-metal soil pollution. Probable effects of the observed changes on mineralization of plant remains in meadow communities are discussed.

AB  - The Volta clam, Galatea paradoxa, is a freshwater macrobenthic bivalve which is endemic to the Lower Volta River in Ghana. The range of occurrence of the clam has been influenced by the flow regime in the Lower Volta which is in turn controlled by operation of two dams located upstream. Previous research has documented the changes to the Lower Volta due to the dams and attempts have been made to design environmental flows (e-flows), freshwater flows to sustain ecosystems, to inform the re-operation of the dams. The past attempts were based on the pre-dam, natural flow regime of the Lower Volta. In this study, a designer e-flow approach is explored using the Volta clam as an indicator species. Using knowledge garnered from various sources on the lifecyde, habitat and the local conditions corresponding to historical and current states of the Volta clams, the factors influencing its extent are visualized and quantified in a Bayesian belief network (BBN). Based on this BBN, an e-flow recommendation for the Lower Volta is for low flows, between 50 m(3)/s and 330 m(3)/s, for four months during the Volta clam veliger larva and recruitment life stages which occur in November to March. In addition, it is recommended that full breaching of the sandbar which regularly builds up at the Volta Estuary is done annually and that sand winning on the river bed is prohibited. These e-flow and management recommendations will have consequences for other water users and these have to be investigated, for instance by flow experiments and trade-off analysis. The results show that a BBN is potentially suitable for modelling the linkages between flows, management practices and the status of ecological indicators for the development of e-flows for highly modified rivers in data scarce regions.

AB  - The feasibility and added value of an ecosystem services approach in retrospective environmental risk assessment were evaluated using a site-specific case study in a lowland UK river. The studied water body failed to achieve good ecological status temporarily in 2018, due in part to the exceedance of the environmental quality standard (annual average EQS) for zinc. Potential ecosystem service delivery was quantified for locally prioritised ecosystem services: regulation of chemical condition; maintaining nursery populations and habitats; recreational fishing; nature watching. Quantification was based on observed and expected taxa or functional groups within WFD biological quality elements, including macrophytes, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish, and on published functional trait data for constituent taxa. Benthic macroinvertebrate taxa were identified and enumerated before, during and after zinc EQS exceedance, enabling a generic retrospective risk assessment for this biological quality element, which was found to have good ecosystem service potential. An additional targeted risk assessment for zinc was based on laboratory-based species sensitivity distributions normalised using biotic-ligand modelling to account for site-specific, bioavailability-corrected zinc exposure. Risk to ecosystem services for diatoms (microalgae) was found to be high, while risks for benthic macroinvertebrates and fish were found to be low. The status of potential ecosystem service delivery (ESD) by fish was equivalent to high ecological status defined under the WFD, while ESD was higher for benthic macroinvertebrates than defined by WFD methods. The illustrated ecosystem services approach uses readily available data and adds significantly to the taxonomic approach currently used under the WFD by using functional traits to evaluate services that are prioritised as being important in water bodies. The main shortcomings of the illustrated approach were lack of: representation of bacteria and fungi; WFD predicted species lists for diatoms and macrophytes; site-specific functional trait data required for defining actual (rather than potential) ecosystem service delivery.

AB  - The literature on the use of marine nematodes as bioindicators of anthropogenic impact is extensive. Nevertheless, review studies have reported a high degree of variability among results and no consistent overall pattern has so far emerged. This lack of congruence might be partially because hypotheses formulation in environmental assessment studies has been largely inductive or abductive and not deductive or hypothesis-driven. In the present study, we emphasize the need of using hypothesis-driven designs and conceptual models in impact assessment studies. Hypotheses for individual and population level studies can be derived from the dynamic energy budget model (DEB). By means of differential equations, DEB model can infer whether a stressor promotes a shift in energy allocation along the life history of the individuals. For community/assemblage level studies, the predictions of the dynamic equilibrium model (DEM) for species richness is presented and extended for abundance, evenness, taxonomic distinctness, and changes in assemblage structure and sample dispersion. While it is predicted that species richness peaks at intermediate levels of disturbances and enrichment, evenness decreases with increasing disturbances and reducing enrichment/pollutant concentrations. Based on DEM,enrichment and pollutants may promote change in community structure by favoring the tolerant species, while physical disturbances may promote sample dispersion as a result of unselective mortality. Finally, we discuss the benefits of using niche-based models to select the indicator species, instead of using classical ordination methods, twinspan and similarity percentage analysis. The selection of indicator species have to be independent from the other species and must consider the set of environmental conditions. The use of conceptual models to select the best ecological indicators is highly recommended. It allows a logical way of testing for causalities and of scaling the different studies for comparisons.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility and potential utility of decision-centric socialeconomic monitoring using data collected from Great Barrier Reef (Reef) region. The social and economic long term monitoring program (SELTMP) for the Reef is a novel attempt to monitor the social and economic dimensions of social-ecological change in a globally and nationally important region. It represents the current status and condition of the major user groups of the Reef with the potential to simultaneously consider trends, interconnections, conflicts, dependencies and vulnerabilities. Our approach was to combine a well-established conceptual framework with a strong governance structure and partnership arrangement that enabled the co-production of knowledge. The framework is a modification of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and it was used to guide indicator choice. Indicators were categorised as; (i) resource use and dependency, (ii) ecosystem benefits and well-being, and (iii) drivers of change. Data were collected through secondary datasets where existing and new datasets were created where not, using standard survey techniques. Here we present an overview of baseline results of new survey data from commercial-fishers (n = 210), marine-based tourism operators (n = 119), tourists (n = 2877), local residents (n. =. 3181), and other Australians (n = 2002). The indicators chosen describe both social and economic components of the Reef system and represent an unprecedented insight into the ways in which people currently use and depend on the Reef, the benefits that they derive, and how they perceive, value and relate to the Reef and each other. However, the success of a program such as the SELTMP can only occur with welltranslated cutting-edge data and knowledge that are collaboratively produced, adaptive, and directly feeds into current management processes. Wediscuss how data from the SELTMP have already been incorporated into Reef management decision-making through substantial inclusion in three key policy documents.

TI  - Characteristics of Middle and Lower Drawa River (NW Poland) Aqueous Environment in Vegetative Season
T2  - ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
LA  - Polish
AB  - The Drawa River is an important element of the natural environment in the I West Pomerania. However, all the examinations of this river together with small F streams concern mainly areas of the Drawienski National Park which is located in the upper part of Drawa river. In order to determine influence of sewage and agricultural pollutants on waters of middle and lower Drawa River, physical. and chemical parameters of water were determined in the area of Drawa river basin. In this area there are places, where values of physical, chemical and biological parameter show a strong influence of anthropogenic factors. Sites, which were particularly polluted, showed high concentration of biogenic substances and were covered with macrophytes typical for fast eutrophication. Many sites were characterized by changes of species and quantitative composition of fish, which are indicators of clean waters. The main reasons of disadvantageous changes in the aqueous environment are: sewage, agricultural fertilizers and effluents from fish breeding ponds.
   Results of investigations show, that Drawa River, and especially some of its tributaries and lakes located in its course are characterized by unfavourable environmental conditions. Outflow grounds of agricultural waste, industrial and even domestic waste landfills are located within their catchments, which is surprising in the XXI century. Moreover catchments are located near Drawienski National Park (DNP). Slopica river which estuary to Drawa is located in DNP is a good example of described situation. Within the catchment area of Slopica occur all factors, mainly anthropogenic, degrading its ecosystem.
   Realization of the packets of ,,ecological" programme Agriculture and Environment is a proper method to decrease emission of pollutants flowing down from agricultural areas to waters. Most important activities are: aftercrops and supplementary afercrop, maintenance of meadows and extensive pastures, limiting chemical fertilization. Very essential for the protection of waters is creation of buffer zones, in form of plant belts separating the water reservoir from agricultural tillage.
   Probably, examined water courses in the result of changes, mainly caused by anthropogenic stress will undergo slow, but total degradation. These changes probably will lead to morphological transformations, depriving all chances on existence of desirable for the environment species of flora and fauna, especially valuable fish species.

AB  - Detritivores are small- to medium-sized invertebrates that comminute and break down organic materials such as leaves, twigs and roots, especially within or upon the soil surface, or nearby. Detritivores constitute the majority of the invertebrate biomass pyramid in most environments and provide a key role in organic matter turnover; they also provide alternative food for polyphagous predators that can be active in pest control on crops. Many arthropod taxa are detritivores in soil and litter layers. Here, we focus on the bioindicator potential of three key detritivore groups: slaters, millipedes and oribatid mites. There are possibly 300 species of slaters (terrestrial isopods or Oniscidea) in Australia with 13 of these being introduced, mostly from north-western Europe. These non-native species are the dominant species in disturbed environments such as intensively managed forests and agricultural fields. Slaters are promising indicators of landscape disturbance, soil contamination and tillage. Millipedes are potentially important indicators of stress in agricultural landscapes, given their sensitivity to litter and soil moisture gradients and to physical and chemical perturbations. However, because there is a close association between the millipede fauna and moist plant communities in Australia, they are generally absent from drier landscapes and, therefore, their use as bioindicators in agricultural environments here is problematic. An exception to this association is the increasingly ubiquitous introduced Black Portuguese millipede. This species is tolerant of much drier conditions than most natives, and is likely to change the nature of nutrient cycling processes in pastures and native grasslands in much of southern Australia. Oribatid mites are present in all Australian terrestrial ecosystems. The few studies that have examined their response to disturbance and land use in Australia are consistent with the body of work conducted outside Australia. This consistent response means that the oribatids may be developed as indicators in agricultural, pasture and forested environments. However, the paucity of information on oribatids over appropriate spatial scales in Australia makes the use of this group extremely difficult at this time.

AB  - The deep sea is the largest biome on Earth but the least explored. Our knowledge of it comes from scattered sources spanning different spatial and temporal scales. Implementation of marine policies like the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and support for Blue Growth in the deep sea are therefore hindered by lack of data. Integrated assessments of environmental status require tools to work with different and disaggregated datasets (e.g. density of deep-sea habitat-forming species, body-size distribution of commercial fishes, intensity of bottom trawling) across spatial and temporal scales. A feasibility study was conducted as part of the four-year ATLAS project to assess the effectiveness of the open-access Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool (NEAT) to assess deep-sea environmental status. We worked at nine selected study areas in the North Atlantic focusing on five MSFD descriptors (D1-Biodiversity, D3-Commercial fish and shellfish, D4-Food webs, D6-Seafloor integrity, D10-Marine litter). The objectives of the present study were to i) explore and propose indicators that could be used in the assessment of deep-sea environmental status, ii) evaluate the performance of NEAT in the deep sea, and iii) identify challenges and opportunities for the assessment of deepsea status. Based on data availability, data quality and expert judgement, in total 24 indicators (one for D1, one for D3, seven for D4, 13 for D6, two for D10) were used in the assessment of the nine study areas, their habitats and ecosystem components. NEAT analyses revealed differences among the study areas for their environmental status ranging from "poor" to "high". Overall, the NEAT results were in moderate to complete agreement with expert judgement, previous assessments, scientific literature on human-pressure gradients and expected management outcomes. We suggest that the assessment of deep-sea environmental status should take place at habitat and ecosystem level (rather than at species level) and at relatively large spatial scales, in comparison to shallow-water areas. Limited knowledge across space (e.g. distribution of habitat-forming species) and the scarcity of long-term data sets limit our knowledge about natural variability and human impacts in the deep sea preventing a more systematic assessment of habitat and ecosystem components in the deep sea. However, stronger crosssectoral collaborations, the use of novel technologies and open data-sharing platforms will be critical for establishing environmental baseline indicator values in the deep sea that will contribute to the science base supporting the implementation of marine policies and stimulating Blue Growth.

AB  - Fishing has long been considered the most impactful human activity on the marine ecosystem. To adopt ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) requires consideration of all human impacts, not just those of fishing. The ODEMM (Options for Delivering Ecosystem-based Marine Management) approach provides an integrated ecosystem assessment that is a flexible, cost-efficient and expert-based. The framework traces the sectors affecting the marine environment, the pressures they create, and the ecological characteristics affected. This research presents the first application of the ODEMM framework outside of the ODEMM project, completed for Ireland's marine waters. The assessment places fishing in the context of other anthropogenic pressures and highlights areas of threat to Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) descriptors. From 1874 impact chains, just 59 (44 of which were attributed to the fishing sector) account for 64% of the Total Risk score, highlighting areas for management action with a high risk-reduction return. Of the sectors, The analysis showed Waste Water to have the highest average risk of all sectors, followed by Land-based Industry, Fishing and then Shipping. In terms of total risk, Fishing was the most important sector, due to its high connectance to many ecosystem components and widespread influence, even though many of the impacts are relatively low and the components impacted show a high degree of recoverability. Litter was identified as the pressure with the highest total risk scores (average and summed) due to its persistence, and widespread reach. Among the ecological characteristics, deep water habitats that have low resilience to pressures showed the highest average total risk, yet the highest impact risks were for ecological characteristics that were closer to land and were impacted more frequently. These conclusions highlight the importance of context and interpretation in the analysis. The impact chains were further linked through to the MSFD environmental status descriptors, indicating Biological Diversity and Food Webs as the descriptors most at risk, followed by Sea-floor Integrity. As the first independent application of the method, issues arose with interpretation of some categories and definitions, and some modifications are discussed.
   Overall, this has proven a valuable exercise for helping to identify management priorities. The analysis presented provides useful context for EBFM and a basis for decision making and trade-off analysis for Ireland. The ODEMM framework employed offers a comprehensive, adaptable, globally-applicable tool to guide ecosystem management and the decision-making process, by highlighting risk areas and priorities for management action and research.

AB  - Sustainability assessments were carried out in small-holders' farms in four territories where productive arrangements have been organized for production of minor oleaginous crops under the Brazilian biodiesel program. The study aimed at checking local impacts of the biodiesel productive chains at the rural establishment scale, and promoting the environmental performance of the selected farms, henceforth proposed as sustainable management demonstration units. Assessments were carried out with the APOIA-NovoRural system, which integrates 62 objective and quantitative indicators related to five sustainability dimensions: i) Landscape Ecology, ii) Environmental Quality (Atmosphere, Water and Soil), iii) Socio-cultural Values, iv) Economic Values and v) Management and Administration. The main results point out that, in general, the ecological dimensions of sustainability, that is, the Landscape Ecology and Atmosphere, Water, and Soil quality indicators, show adequate field conditions, seemingly not yet negatively affected by increases in chemical inputs and natural resources use predicted as important potential impacts of the agro-energy sector. The Economic Values indicators have been favorably influenced in the studied farms, due to a steadier demand and improved prices for the oleaginous crops. On the other hand, valuable positive consequences expected for favoring farmers' market insertion, such as improved Socio-cultural Values and Management & Administration indicators, are still opportunities to be materialized. The Environmental Management Reports issued to the farmers, based on the presented sustainability assessment procedures, offer valuable documentation and communication means for consolidating the organizational influence of the local productive arrangements studied. These productive arrangements were shown to be determinant for the selection of crop associations and diversification, as well as for the provision of technical assistance and the stabilization of demand - conditions that promote value aggregation and income improvements, favoring small-holders' insertion in the market. More importantly, these locally organized productive arrangements have been shown to strongly influence the valorization of natural resources and environmental assets, which are fundamental if sustainable rural development is to take place under the emerging agro-energy scenario.

AB  - Recently, ecological water monitoring has become one of the fundamental issues of stream ecology. Out of biotic communities living around streams, macroinvertebrates are commonly used as water quality indicators. In this research, quantitative distributions of macroinvertebrate groups, living on a stream in the Belgrad Forest which represents a status close to the natural one and thus becomes a reference field with this property, were determined and it was explained how the change observed in the hydrological/hydrochemical conditions caused population interaction on the species. Relationships between macroinvertebrate species and environmental hydrological/hydrochemical parameters were established through Canonical Correlation Analysis. It was found that there were strong relationships between Heptagenia sulphurea species and dissolved oxygen amount as well as Potamon fluvitilis and organic substance amount. It was also detected that population of Gammurus pulex increased under conditions with increasing magnesium, nitrate nitrogen amounts and flow- rates.

Currently, C. calceolus is considered as a threatened species in most countries within its range. In many countries, this taxon is extremely rare being included in the national Red Data Books and on Red Lists. To date, there is a lack of research aimed to identify the life strategies of this threatened plant and to determine the ecological and coenotic preferences. The present study is aimed to identify and evaluate the individual and population parameters of C. calceolus in various ecological-coenotical conditions of the southern taiga subzone within the Kirov Region (European Russia) in order to develop methods and approaches for monitoring the C. calceolus populations. In the study area, the edaphic preferences of C. calceolus correspond to regimes from dry-forest-meadow to wet-forest-meadow according to the soil moisture scale. According to Tsyganov's ecological scales, this orchid prefers nitrogen- poor, poorly acidic and nitrogen-poor soils. Cypripedium calceolus confines to a relatively stable to weakly variable moisture. We found a statistically significant influence of habitat conditions to the leaf characteristics, namely leaf width (27.78%) and number of veins (7.17%). The range of the vegetation condition effects on the morphological parameters of the C. calceolus individuals is wider. The leaf length, the number of leaf veins were recognised as stable biological indicator traits. The number of leaves, the lip length, and the length of the lip blade were considered as taxonomic indicator traits, while only the number of flowers was recognised as an ecological indicator trait. Other morphological traits (shoot height, leaf width, lip width) were changing the variability level depending on the year and population by falling into different groups of indicator traits. The vitality analysis of the C. calceolus populations showed that most populations have been estimated as thriving ones. During the study period, we found a positive trend towards the C. calceolus individuals' vitality improvement in spruce (Picea abies) forests. This also affected the conservation status of this threatened orchid.

AB  - Trait-based approaches can provide a generalizable mechanistic understanding of complex post-disturbance succession dynamics of plant communities. Much of our knowledge regarding successional trajectories of functional trait composition come from observations of natural disturbances that leave physical and biological legacy on site for self regeneration. We lack, however, understanding of the long-term recovery in severely degraded lands following reclamation through active revegetation. To address this gap, we examined changes in trait composition of forest understory plant communities in reclaimed oil and gas wellsites using chronosequence data (7-48 years since reclamation) to assess recovery towards that of post-harvest and natural post-fire reference forest sites. We used multiple traits associated with resource acquisition (e.g., fast growth) and performance ability metrics (e.g., shade-tolerance) with putative environmental factors to evaluate the trait-environment relationships underlying plant community recovery in reclaimed sites. We found an overall directional change in functional composition with time since reclamation towards that observed in reference sites, but even older reclaimed sites remained significantly different from reference sites. This could be related to differential trajectory patterns among traits where some trait values progressed towards those of reference (long-distance dispersal by wind decreased with time since reclamation) whereas some fast-resource acquisition traits and exotic species showed no change and remained dominant in older reclaimed sites. The strong link between traits and environment suggests a significant influence of time and subsequent developing site conditions (e.g., canopy cover) as well as enduring legacies of wellsite operation/reclamation (e.g., high soil bulk density and exotic species) on functional composition. Knowledge of functional composition trajectories in severely degraded ecosystems, such as wellsites, could improve our understanding of recovery processes and inform more effective reclamation practices by identifying putative underlying environmental factors and specific ecological attributes that may delay successful recovery.

AB  - Based on a long-term ecological monitoring, the present study chose the most dominant benthic macroinvertebrate (Baetis spp.) as target organisms in Xiangxi River, built the habitat suitability models (HSMs) for water depth, current velocity and substrate, respectively, which is the first aquatic organisms model for habitat suitability in the Chinese Mainland with a long-term consecutive in situ measurement. In order to protect the biointegrity and function of the river ecosystem, the theory system of instream environmental flow should be categorized into three hierarchies, namely minimum required instream flow (hydrological level), minimum instream environmental flow (biospecies level), and optimum instream environmental flow (ecosystem level). These three hierarchies of instream environmental flow models were then constructed with the hydrological and weighted usable area (WUA) method. The results show that the minimum required instream flow of Xiangxi River calculated by the Tennant method (10% of the mean annual flow) was 0.615 m(3) s(-1); the minimum instream environmental flow accounted for 19.22% of the mean annual flow (namely 1.182 m(3) s(-1)), which was the damaged river channel. ow in the dry season; and 42.91% of the mean annual flow (namely 2.639 m(3) s(-1)) should be viewed as the optimum instream environmental flow in order to protect the health of the river ecosystem, maintain the instream biodiversity, and reduce the impact of small hydropower stations nearby the Xiangxi River. We recommend that the hydrological and biological methods can help establish better instream environmental. ow models and design best management practices for use in the small hydropower station project.

AB  - Barite is used as a weighting agent in synthetic and oil based drilling fluids (SBFs and OBFs) to maintain bore hole pressure during offshore oil drilling operations. Substitution of OBFs by SBFs has reduced the risk of ecological impacts. Barite makes up approximately 33% by weight of an SBF and contains traces of heavy metals, which significantly contribute to the toxicity of drilling waste. Due to the hydrophobic nature of SBFs, drilling wastes are not dispersive in the water column. Arsenic, copper and lead are the three important toxic heavy metals, amongst others, found in the drilling waste. The concentrations of heavy metals are determined using a steady state aquivalence-based fate model in a probabilistic mode. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) are employed to determine pore water concentrations at known pollutant loading rates (E) and impact area (An) conditions. This paper considers a hypothetical case study to determine the water quality impacts for 4 and 10% attached SBFs which correspond to proposed best available technology (BAT) option and current discharge practice in US offshore. The exposure concentration (C,) is a predicted environmental concentration (PEC), which is adjusted for exposure probability (P) and bioavailable fraction (BF) of heavy metals. The probabilistic response of an ecosystem is defined by developing an empirical distribution function (EDF) of predieted-no-effect-concentration (PNEC) derived from LC50 and NOEC data. The lowest 10th percentile value of an EDF is defined as a representative response of an ecosystem, R,. The ratio of exposure concentration (C-E) to the representative response (R-E) is defined risk quotient (RQ). The ratio C-E/R-E < 1, is an indicator of the aquatic system's safety. The pollutants' pore water concentrations within the radius (R) of 815 m are estimated and cumulative distributions of RQ are developed to determine the probability, p(RQ > 1).

AB  - Ecological regime shifts in the marine realm have been recorded from a variety of systems and locations around the world. Coral reefs have been especially affected, with their benthic habitat changing from a dominance of stony corals to a dominance of other organisms such as fleshy algae. To detect changes in the benthic habitat of coral reefs, simple tools applicable on a global scale are necessary for future monitoring programs. Hence, the aim of this research is to explore the hypothesis that shifts in assemblages of large benthic foraminifera (LBF) can detect early signs of degradation in the reef benthic habitat. To do so, data on living assemblages of LBF collected between 1997 and 2018 at 12 islands in the Spermonde Archipelago (South Sulawesi, Indonesia) were analyzed. Foraminif-eral specimens were morphologically identified to the species level and statistical analyses performed to assess changes in their assemblage composition. A clear temporal shift was observed. Typical foraminiferal assemblages in a coral-dominated (e.g., Amphistegina lobifera, Calcarina spengleri, Heterostegina depressa) and fleshy algae-dominated (e.g., Neorotalia gaimardi, C. mayori) reef habitats were identified and significantly linked to the substrate type. Other species (e.g., Elphidium spp., Peneroplis planatus and Sphaerogypsina globulus) seem to reflect a spatial and temporal gradient of anthropogenic pollution from local inhabited islands and ongoing urban development on the mainland. Hence communities of LBF consistently follow gradual shifts in environmental conditions. Addi-tionally to foraminiferal assemblages being an indicator for actual reef condition, closely monitoring LBF may pro-vide early information on reef degradation, in time to take action against identified stressors (e.g., eutrophication or intensive fishing) at local and regional scales. The circumtropical distribution of LBF is such that they can be in-cluded worldwide in reef monitoring programs, conditional to calibration to the regional species pool. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - 1. The influence of fire upon biodiversity has been investigated in many ecosystems under a wide range of environmental conditions. However, there is no information on how fire affects faunal biodiversity in deciduous forest ecosystems prone to winter fires, such as those on the southern slopes of the Alps.
   2. The main aim of this study was to analyse the effects of single and repeated fires on the structure and species diversity of spider communities in chestnut forests in southern Switzerland. A second objective was to interpret the ecological response of forest-floor habitats to wildfires, using epigeic spiders as bioindicators.
   3. One-hundred and thirty-three spider species were found in pitfall trap samples collected between April and September in burnt and control sites in chestnut coppices. Species richness and community composition were influenced by fire frequency and the time elapsed since the last fire. About 19% of the species were trapped exclusively in sites that had been repeatedly burnt, while 11% occurred only in unburnt coppice. Post-fire development of the spider community was chiefly from individuals that survived in situ. We found no characteristic pioneer species in any of the burnt sites. There were indirect effects of fire on the spider community, through interactions between species arising from the changing environmental conditions following a fire.
   4. After a single fire, changes in community composition were only observable during the first 2 years. At sites that had experienced repeated fires, there was a more persistent influence on community composition. These sites were characterized by an increase in species richness and species diversity. The presence of a wide ecological range of species in 'repeated fire' sites was probably due to the mosaic structure of the environment and the wide range of microclimate conditions at the soil surface, with a predominance of xeric conditions.
   5. The spider communities of chestnut forests were resilient to disturbance by fire. Both the formerly intensive management of these forests (until the 1950s) and a history of frequent fires that goes back to the Neolithic period have played an important part in the development of the spider community in these forests.

AB  - We present a laboratory practice aimed to clarify and discuss the concept of bioindicator molecules in environmental health. It has been implemented as a hands- on laboratory exercise in postgraduate courses in public health ( in Brazil) and in a course entitled Biology Applied to Natural Resources Sustainability ( in Spain) but can be useful for undergraduate studies. By simple, repeatable, and low cost spectrophotometry methodology, students detect minimal concentrations ( nmol) of metallothionein in biological samples obtained from sites with various status of pollution. They can also expose experimental fish or mollusks to heavy metals in aquarium conditions and then detect metallothionein. This method is excellent for didactic purposes because it can be developed even in modest laboratories with basic equipment for molecular biology.

AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) creates highly productive habitats in coastal areas, providing support for many important species of fish and wildlife. Despite the importance and documented loss of SAV across fresh to marine habitats globally, we lack consistent baseline data on estuarine SAV resources, particularly in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM) estuaries. To understand SAV distribution in the NGOM, SAV biomass and species identity were collected at 384 sites inter-annually (June-September; 2013-2015) from Mobile Bay, Alabama, to San Antonio Bay, Texas, USA. Coastwide, SAV distribution and biomass were consistent across years, covering an estimated 87,000 ha, and supporting approximately 16 +/- 1% total cover with an average biomass of 24.5 +/- 1.9 g m(-2). Differences in hydrology (i.e., precipitation, freshwater input, water depth) and exposure (i.e., wave and wind energy) manifested in unique SAV assemblages and biomass distributions across the region (i.e., Coastal Mississippi-Alabama, Mississippi River Coastal Wetlands, Chenier Plain, Texas Mid-Coast) and estuarine gradient (i.e., marsh zones defined as fresh, intermediate, brackish, saline). Descriptive cluster analyses identified indicator SAV species, known as medoid observations that represented combined salinity, turbidity, and depth conditions unique to different region and marsh zone combinations. While the presence of SAV is often used as an indicator of ecological health, identifying a medoid-based SAV indicator species in aquatic habitats can be used to describe estuarine conditions in more detail and develop aquatic habitat zones. Exploration and the use of this type of field data could be developed as a means to track, manage, and define aquatic habitats across regional and estuarine gradients and further develop ecosystem-based assessment and restoration activities. Identifying aquatic zones through a representative medoid associates SAV species with locations defined by both long-term salinity and salinity variability, water depth, and exposure, which is a powerful potential tool for managers and restoration decision-makers.

AB  - In recent decades, the high introduction rate of alien species (AS) has been mainly due to the increasingly widespread human movements, which often compromise natural barriers, facilitating the invasion of new geographic areas and environments. Being completely new in the recipient habitat, alien invasive species can often have strongly negative impacts on native communities, sometimes causing substantial and irreversible ecological and economic damage. Thus, AS have been branded as "negative" and are often targeted for eradication. However, an accurate assessment of ecological and economic impacts of alien taxa is still lacking in many species, and this is particularly true in marine environments. We focused on the Mediterranean Sea, a very important marine biodiversity "hot spot," which is among the areas that have been most influenced by the arrival of non-native species, a process also linked to global warming, leading to a deep transformation of this basin. We describe both negative and positive aspects of some well-known introductions, assuming a different view of conservation. Biological invasions are, in fact, a fundamental and integral aspect of nature that has always been present in the history of life on Earth. Imagining that nature is static and needs to be restored to a particular state is not a reasonable way of looking at the processes of life. With this in mind, we argue that defining priorities in management and conservation is a prerogative that should not be based on the containment/eradication of one or another species, but on the conservation of those environmental conditions that are essential for the proper functioning of ecosystems. In other words, native versus non-native species distinction cannot be the main guiding principle in conservation and restoration. For this reason, great attention must be paid to the containment of those human activities that cause greater pollution and rapid changes, and therefore threaten the habitats and biodiversity that we care about most.

AB  - Evaluating the causes and consequences of dominance by a limited number of taxa in phytoplankton communities is of huge importance in the current context of increasing anthropogenic pressures on natural ecosystems. This is of particular concern in densely populated urban areas where usages and impacts of human populations on water ecosystems are strongly interconnected. Microbial biodiversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of environmental quality and ecosystem functioning, but there are few studies at the regional scale that integrate the drivers of dominance in phytoplankton communities and their consequences on the structure and functioning of these communities. Here, we studied the causes and consequences of phytoplankton dominance in 50 environmentally contrasted waterbodies, sampled over four summer campaigns in the highly-populated Ile-de-France region (IDF). Phytoplankton dominance was observed in 32-52% of the communities and most cases were attributed to Chlorophyta (35.5-40.6% of cases) and Cyanobacteria (30.3-36.5%). The best predictors of dominance were identified using multinomial logistic regression and included waterbody features (surface, depth and connection to the hydrological network) and water column characteristics (total N, TN:TP ratio, water temperature and stratification). The consequences of dominance were dependent on the identity of the dominant organisms and included modifications of biological attributes (richness, cohesion) and functioning (biomass, RUE) of phytoplankton communities. We constructed co-occurrence networks using high resolution phytoplankton biomass and demonstrated that networks under dominance by Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria exhibited significantly different structure compared with networks without dominance. Furthermore, dominance by Cyanobacteria was associated with more profound network modifications (e.g. cohesion, size, density, efficiency and proportion of negative links), suggesting a stronger disruption of the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities in the conditions in which this group dominates. Finally, we provide a synthesis on the relationships between environmental drivers, dominance status, community attributes and network structure. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Water Quality Criteria were firstly defined in the 1970s by the EPA in the USA and the EIFAC in Europe, recognizing the need for protecting water quality in order to allow the use Of water resources by man. In the 1990s, the European Commission emphasized the importance of safeguarding structure and function Of biologic communities. These approaches were chemically-based. The European Water Framework Directive (WED) substantially changes the concept of Water Quality, by assuming that a water body needs to be protected as In environmental good and not as a resource to be exploited. In this frame, the biological-ecological quality assumes a prevailing role.
   Main Features. The Water Quality concept introduced by the WED is a challenge for environmental sciences. Reference conditions should be defined for different typologics of water bodies and for different European ecoregions. Suitable indicators should be developed in order to quantify ecological Status and to define what a 'good' ecological status is. Procedures should be developed for correlating the deviation from a good ecological to the effects of multiple stressors on function and structure of the ecosystem. The protection of biodiversity becomes a key objective.
   In this frame, the traditional procedures for ecotoxicological risk assessment, mainly based on laboratory testing, Should be overcome by more sire-specific approaches, taking into account the characteristics and the homeostatic capabilities Of natural communities.
   In the paper an overview of the present knowledge and of the new trends in ecotoxicology to get these objectives will be given. A procedure is Suggested based on the concept of Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD).
   Recommendations and Perspectives. The need for more site-specific and ecologically-oriented approaches in ecotoxicology is strongly recommended. The development of new tools for implementing the concept of 'Stress Ecology' his been recently proposed by van Straalen (2003). In the same time, more ecological realism' is needed in practically applicable procedures for regulatory purposes.

AB  - Lowland riparian hardwood forests are valuable habitats protected by EU Habitat Directive (EU code: 91F0). Today, in most areas across Europe they are extremely rare due to deforestation, drainage and river engineering. The remaining small forest patches are important parts of riparian ecological corridors and biodiversity hotspots, and provide valuable ecosystem services (ES) to humans. However, unlike other forest types, due to their rarity and often low accessibility their ES potential has not been duly recognized and assessed to date. In this work we propose a set of biophysical indicators to assess the regulating potential of riparian hardwood forests. Indicator values were obtained through extensive field work and direct measurements carried out on selected test sites located along the middle Vistula River. The specific objectives of this work were: (i) to estimate the potential of riparian hardwood forests to provide 11 regulating services and to identify interactions among them; (ii) to examine the effects of forest and environmental attributes on individual ES; (iii) to determine ES drivers. Our results clearly show that riparian hardwood forests may be regarded as multiservice hotspots. Their regulating potential has proved to be substantial and in case of many services higher than the potential of other forest ecosystems. However, disruption of the natural water regime due to the absence of flooding and artificial drainage reduces their potential mainly for water-related regulating services (e.g. water treatment). On the other hand, more mesic habitats are beneficial for melliferous plant species and thus for wild pollinators. Most of the strong and significant interactions among the studied regulating services are synergistic. The high ES potential quantified by the biophysical ecosystem-condition-related indicators can be used effectively to promote the maintenance or restoration of this type of forests. The outcomes of our research suggest that protective actions should focus on ensuring adequate soil-moisture conditions which determine the specificity of these ecosystems.

AB  - The article presents the analysis of cases of joint impact of dangerous biological, chemical and physical factors. It was possible to reveal that a set of harmful effects on humans and society as a whole increases over time as a result of the technogenic way of development chosen by mankind. At the same time, different regions of the Russian Federation may have a complex of negative factors specific for each territory, both of natural and anthropogenic origin. Against this background, there may be an increase in infectious morbidity from those diseases characteristic of the territory under consideration. Such scenarios can be especially dangerous, for example, in case of an accident at biologically hazardous objects, and terrorist use of infectious agents, taking into account the already existing complex of harmful effects of chemical and physical nature. In modern conditions, environmental pollution continues to increase both in terms of total volume and in terms of the number of harmful factors. At the same time, the ecological situation acquires new qualities. Infectious morbidity increases in such conditions. This is indicated in complication of the clinical course of the infectious process, its longer duration, more frequent development of complications, chronization of the process, an increase in the number of concomitant diseases and convalescence timing. At the same time, qualitative changes occur in already known infectious diseases, and new ones also appear. The data presented in the article clearly demonstrate the need to take into account the joint impact of pathogenic microorganisms and pollutants of another nature on humans. This is also a typical example of the combined effect of several harmful factors different in nature, but already in its modern interpretation. The combined effect of a dangerous biological factor with others (for example, the ones of physical or chemical nature) can significantly increase its impact. In connection with the distinctive features of modern biological threats, special attention is required by the consideration of the existing anthropogenic pollution of the environment on the territory of the Russian Federation. For various regions of the Russian Federation, taking into account local ecological features, new endemic areas can be formed.

AB  - Most impacts on ecosystem services (ESs) are related to land use changes that may cause ecosystem fragmentation and loss of ecosystem functions. Spatial planning focused on sustainable landscape development should consider the local potential for providing ESs as well as ecological conservation due to land use changes. To better address the issues that are related to ecological and the ecological and environmental conservation, ecological compensation could coordinate the development of the energy, the economy, and the environment by internalizing environmental externalities and adjusting for the relationships with stakeholders' benefits. In this study, we developed a framework for analyzing the spatial characteristics of land uses and calculating ecological compensation based on pay for ecosystem services (PESs) from 1995 to 2010 in the upstream of Min River, China. In terms of lacunarity analysis, we firstly explored the spatial patterns of land uses in these two periods that occurred at different spatial characteristic scales. We also observed a strong relationship between lacunarity values and the different distribution patterns of land uses. We then investigated changes in ESs in response to land use change through the assignment of per unit area ecological service value (ESV) method. The total value of ESs dropped from 449.97 billion yuan in 1995 to 441.35 billion yuan in 2010, exhibiting decreasing rate, mainly due to the degradation of woodlands. Soil formation and retention, gas regulation, and biodiversity protection were the three largest ESs, contributing about 50% of the total ESV. Considering the changed relation between social and economic indicators and ESV based on spatial visualization and analysis, we finally constructed a quantitative estimate model for ecological compensation taking a village as study unit and determined standard value so as to evaluate ecological compensation from 1995 to 2010. Spatial differences of the ecological compensation were significant among all the villages and towns. The maximum ecological compensation account (ranged from 1.68 to 8.54 billion yuan) appeared in the villages approximated to Li County, Heishui County, and Songpan County, Sichuan, People's Republic of China. This proposed framework provides a better understanding of spatial characteristic scales of land uses and enables evaluation of the ecological integrity of landscapes. It also fills up the gap in the field of quantitative evaluation of regional ecological compensation and provides a feasible way to reconcile the conflicts among benefits in the economic, social, and ecological sectors.

AB  - Large-scale use of the persistent and potent neonicotinoid and fipronil insecticides has raised concerns about risks to ecosystem functions provided by a wide range of species and environments affected by these insecticides. The concept of ecosystem services is widely used in decision making in the context of valuing the service potentials, benefits, and use values that well-functioning ecosystems provide to humans and the biosphere and, as an endpoint (value to be protected), in ecological risk assessment of chemicals. Neonicotinoid insecticides are frequently detected in soil and water and are also found in air, as dust particles during sowing of crops and aerosols during spraying. These environmental media provide essential resources to support biodiversity, but are known to be threatened by long-term or repeated contamination by neonicotinoids and fipronil. We review the state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of these insecticides on ecosystem functioning and services provided by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including soil and freshwater functions, fisheries, biological pest control, and pollination services. Empirical studies examining the specific impacts of neonicotinoids and fipronil to ecosystem services have focused largely on the negative impacts to beneficial insect species (honeybees) and the impact on pollination service of food crops. However, here we document broader evidence of the effects on ecosystemfunctions regulating soil and water quality, pest control, pollination, ecosystem resilience, and community diversity. In particular, microbes, invertebrates, and fish play critical roles as decomposers, pollinators, consumers, and predators, which collectively maintain healthy communities and ecosystem integrity. Several examples in this review demonstrate evidence of the negative impacts of systemic insecticides on decomposition, nutrient cycling, soil respiration, and / invertebrate populations valued by humans. Invertebrates, particularly earthworms that are important for soil processes, wild and domestic insect pollinators which are important for plant and crop production, and several freshwater taxa which are involved in aquatic nutrient cycling, were all found to be highly susceptible to lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and/ or fipronil at environmentally relevant concentrations. By contrast, most microbes and fish do not appear to be as sensitive under normal exposure scenarios, though the effects on fish may be important in certain realms such as combined fish-rice farming systems and through food chain effects. We highlight the economic and cultural concerns around agriculture and aquaculture production and the role these insecticides may have in threatening food security. Overall, we recommend improved sustainable agricultural practices that restrict systemic insecticide use to maintain and support several ecosystem services that humans fundamentally depend on.

AB  - Effluent clarification and disinfection are major challenges in wastewater management. The cladoceran Daphnia magna has been proposed as a cost-effective and ecosystem-friendly option to clarify and disinfect secondary effluents, but its efficacy has not been fully tested under different sewage conditions. The present study explores the effects of temperature and nitrate on the efficacy of D. magna as a tertiary treatment at two different scales (individual assays and microcosms). Individual assays were employed to determine direct effects of temperature and/or nitrate on D. magna cultured in a suspension of organic matter. Using microcosms under the same environmental conditions, we explored the clearing efficacy of D. magna interacting with a natural microbial community. Individual assays revealed that D. magna mortality increased by 17% at 26 degrees C, 21% at >250 mg NO3-/l and by 60% at 26 degrees C and at >250 mg NO3-/l, and individuals displayed reduced body size, filtering rates and fecundity when compared to those at 21 degrees C and <40 mg NO3-/l. Improved performance under these conditions was also mirrored in the microcosms, with a higher density of D. magna (>100 id/l) at 21 degrees C and <40 mg NO3-/l compared to the number (0-21 id/l) at 26 degrees C and/or >250 mg NO3-/l. In the microcosms at 21 degrees C and <40 mg NO3-/l, turbidity and the density of bacteria, protists and micro-metazoa decreased in relation to those at 26 degrees C and/or >250 mg NO3-/l. Each treatment developed a unique and characteristic microbial assemblage, and D. magna was identified as the major driver of the community structure of protists and micro-metazoa. This enabled us to determine taxa vulnerability to D. magna grazing, and to re-define their tolerance thresholds for nitrate. In conclusion, this study increases our knowledge of how microbes respond to temperature and nitrate pollution, and highlights that D. magna efficacy as a tertiary treatment can be seriously compromised by variable environmental conditions.

AB  - This paper reviews and discusses the methods and metrics used for the assessment of the ecological status of marine angiosperms comparing the European with the South African situation. In Europe salt marsh and sea grasses are an important biological element for establishing the ecological quality status of transitional waters and in South Africa changes over time in the salt marsh and submerged macrophyte habitats (species richness, abundance and community composition) is used nationally to assess the health of estuaries. In Europe several studies have developed metrics that include salt marsh species composition and community structure to assess the ecological quality status. Deviation of taxonomic composition and abundance from a reference situation is investigated. Multi-metric approaches have been shown to provide a more holistic view of the ecological status of the ecosystem. Many indices are highly dependent on historical data to assess the deviation from reference conditions. Within the WFD spirit one widely used approach for salt marsh assessment, the Best's method, the baseline can be determined based on the first sampling effort, by the largest previously recorded size of the salt marsh or using the "maximum potential size" of the salt marsh from habitat prediction models. In South Africa all habitat below the 5 m contour line is considered estuary habitat and any land occupied here by agricultural or other developments is considered as a loss of habitat from the reference condition. For seagrasses European metrics are based on attributes from the community (e.g., taxonomic composition, epiphytes), the population (e.g., bed extent, shoots density), but also quantified at individual species (e.g., leaves length) or physiological levels (e.g., stable isotopic signatures). Seagrass habitats in South African estuaries are highly dynamic in response to floods and an understanding of this is needed before present ecological status can be assessed.

AB  - We evaluated the importance of alien species in existing vegetation along wadeable streams of a large, topographically diverse river basin in eastern Oregon, USA; sampling 165 plots (30 x 30 m) across 29 randomly selected 1-km stream reaches. Plots represented eight streamside community types associated with varying elevation, precipitation, and landform. Mantel comparisons, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS), and Spearman correlation identified relationships of alien species (n = 60) distribution and relative alien cover (RAC) to native species (n = 355) composition, 28 vegetation descriptors, 31 environmental variables, and 30 disturbance conditions. Alien species occurred in 93% of sample plots, in all community types, and along all sampled stream reaches; with RAC ranging from 0.1% to 47% and 1 to 24 alien species occurring along individual stream reaches. Alien richness and RAC were positively related to native diversity where invasion was limited (RAC < 5%), but negatively where invasion was more severe (RAC > 5%). RAC differed among community types: greatest in arid associations (shrubland/grassland), followed by associations with limited tree canopy cover (meadows, dry forest), and lowest in moist, closed forest associations; suggesting differences in invasion status or vulnerabilities to alien invasion among community types. Alien species, as a group had wider ecological amplitude than natives, and species composition among community types was less distinct when both alien and natives were considered compared to native species only. RAC was negatively related to elevation, precipitation, and tree cover; while positive relationships of RAC occurred with grazing pressure, upstream watershed size, stream order, overall level of exogenous disturbance, limited vegetated buffer, agriculture in the upstream watershed, floodplain or south facing slope locations, and proximity to roads. Taken together, these results suggest possible ecological consequences to streamside vegetation related to alien species and identify indicators of conditions, where invasion may be greatest, offering potential for informing decisions for monitoring and managing alien species.

AB  - A key challenge for the ecological risk assessment of chemicals has been to evaluate the relative contribution of chemical pollution to the variability observed in biological communities, as well as to identify multiple stressor groups. In this study we evaluated the toxic pressure exerted by > 200 contaminants to benthic macroinvertebrates in the Danube River using the Toxic Unit approach. Furthermore, we evaluated correlations between several stressors (chemical and non-chemical) and biological indices commonly used for the ecological status assessment of aquatic ecosystems. We also performed several variation partitioning analyses to evaluate the relative contribution of contaminants and other abiotic parameters (i.e. habitat characteristics, hydromorphological alterations, water quality parameters) to the structural and biological trait variation of the invertebrate community. The results of this study show that most biological indices significantly correlate to parameters related to habitat and physico-chemical conditions, but showed limited correlation with the calculated toxic pressure. The calculated toxic pressure, however, showed little variation between sampling sites, which complicates the identification of pollution-induced effects. The results of this study show that the variation in the structure and trait composition of the invertebrate community are mainly explained by habitat and water quality parameters, whereas hydromorphological alterations play a less important role. Among the water quality parameters, physico-chemical parameters such as suspended solids, nutrients or dissolved oxygen explained a larger part of the variation in the invertebrate community as compared to metals or organic contaminants. Significant correlations exist between some physico-chemical measurements (e.g. nutrients) and some chemical classes (i.e. pharmaceuticals, chemicals related to human presence) which constitute important multiple stressor groups. This study demonstrates that, in large rivers like the Danube, the variation in the invertebrate community seems to be more related to varying habitat and physico-chemical conditions than to chemical pollution.

AB  - Most energy conversion systems, and especially electricity generation plants, do not operate at nominal conditions throughout their useful life: periodic, semi-periodic and stochastic changes in the availability of the resource affect solar (thermal and PV), wind, hydraulic, and geothermal plants, which in reality operate at off-design conditions for most of their life. To a smaller extent, fossil-fuelled plants may also be plagued by fuel availability problems and no longer easily predictable demand oscillation. In spite of the ever growing net connectivity, since the demand curve in even larger geographic regions displays a typical quasi-sinusoidal shape, fleet load modulation is unavoidable. Naturally, off-design operation and load cycling affect the cost of the generated kWh.
   This paper presents a general thermoeconomic method to evaluate the economic and environmental effects of energy system integration, taking into account life cycle concerns (supply chains) and the effect of inefficiencies due to off-design operation of the systems. The method here is applied to a realistic case study of an Italian regional utility: an analysis of the implications of the variation of the productive mix between a photovoltaic power plant (PV) and a standard commercial, non-cogenerating gas turbine plant (GT) on the final cost of the electrical kWh. The demand curve is prescribed, and the effect of different mixes is assessed, both on the monetary and on the exergy cost of the electricity.
   The economic cost assessment is performed by standard thermoeconomic techniques, whereas the exergy costs are evaluated using both the Extended Exergy Accounting (EEA) and the Thermo-Ecological Cost (TEC) methods. The results show that a purely monetary cash flow accounting and thermoeconomics lead to contrasting results, and also that the EEA and TEC cost indicators generate different rankings among the studied alternative GT/PV mixes.

AB  - Plant or soil water status is required in many scientific fields to understand plant responses to drought. Because the transcriptomic response to abiotic conditions, such as water deficit, reflects plant water status, genomic tools could be used to develop a new type of molecular biomarker. Using the sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) as a model species to study the transcriptomic response to water deficit both in greenhouse and field conditions, we specifically identified three genes that showed an expression pattern highly correlated to plant water status as estimated by the pre-dawn leaf water potential, fraction of transpirable soil water, soil water content or fraction of total soil water in controlled conditions. We developed a generalized linear model to estimate these classical water status indicators from the expression levels of the three selected genes under controlled conditions. This estimation was independent of the four tested genotypes and the stage (pre- or post-flowering) of the plant. We further validated this gene expression biomarker under field conditions for four genotypes in three different trials, over a large range of water status, and we were able to correct their expression values for a large diurnal sampling period.

AB  - Wetland loss, biological invasions, and ecological restoration are major factors altering wetland resources in the Midwestern United States. Large-scale plant-community change associated with these factors is an under-investigated, potentially strong driver of habitat suitability for wetland-dependent wildlife, such as secretive marsh birds (SMBs), which are of widespread conservation concern. We employed multi-year, hierarchical Bayesian occupancy modeling to investigate sensitivity of 3 SMB species (American bittern, sora, and Virginia rail) to habitat and vegetation characteristics in Wisconsin, USA. We contrasted habitat characteristics and SMB occupancy in natural wetlands with those restored under the federally funded Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). We also examined the extent to which SMB occupancy was explained by 3 levels of habitat assessment that encompassed different spatial scales and levels of sampling effort (landscape, rapid, and intensive). All species were significantly associated with variables derived from intensive assessment, and showed high sensitivity to differences in plant-community composition and vegetation quality. Both American bittern and Virginia rail were negatively associated with abundance of the invasive wetland grass, Phalaris arundinacea (reed canarygrass), and were positively associated with an indicator of plant-community quality (mean coefficient of conservatism, or C-value). Sora occupancy was positively associated with Typha (cattail) abundance. For all 3 species, occupancy was greater in natural sites than in restored sites, which were characterized by greater Phalaris abundance and lower mean C-values. Our results show broad agreement between botanical and avian indicators of wetland quality, suggesting that enhancing the condition of wetland vegetation can yield ancillary benefits for SMBs. In this region, efforts to control Phalaris and restore diverse, native-dominated plant communities are likely to increase wetlands' capacity to support SMBs. (C) 2015 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Because estuaries are naturally stressed, due to variations in salinity, organic loadings, sediment stability and oxygen concentrations over both spatial and temporal scales, it is difficult both to set baseline reference conditions and to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic environmental stresses. This contrasts with the situation in marine coastal and offshore locations. A very large benthic macroinvertebrate dataset and matching concentrations for seven toxic heavy metals (i.e. Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb), compiled over three years as part of the UK's National Marine Monitoring Programme (NMMP) for 27 subtidal sites in 16 estuaries and 34 coastal marine sites in the United Kingdom, have been analysed. The results demonstrate that species composition and most benthic biotic indicators (number of taxa, overall density, Shannon-Wiener diversity, Simpson's index and AZTI's Marine Biotic Index [AMBI]) for sites in estuarine and coastal areas were significantly different, reflecting natural differences between these two environments. Shannon Wiener diversity and AMBI were not significantly correlated either with overall heavy metal contaminant loadings or with individual heavy metal concentrations ('normalized' as heavy metal/aluminium ratios) in estuaries. In contrast, average taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+)) and variation in taxonomic distinctness (Lambda(+)) did not differ significantly between estuarine and coastal environments, i.e. they were unaffected by natural differences between these two environments, but both were significantly correlated with overall heavy metal concentrations. Furthermore, Delta(+) was correlated significantly with the Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb concentrations and Lambda(+) was correlated significantly with the Cr, Ni, Cu, Cd and Hg concentrations. Thus, one or both of these two taxonomic distinctness indices are significantly correlated with the concentrations for each of these seven heavy metals. These taxonomic distinctness indices are therefore considered appropriate indicators of anthropogenic disturbance in estuaries, as they allow a regional reference condition to be set from which significant departures can then be determined.

AB  - Parasites are ubiquitous components of biological systems that have evolved in multiple independent lineages during the history of life, resulting in a diversity of taxa greater than that of their free-living counterparts. Extant host-parasite associations are the result of tight reciprocal adaptations that allow parasites to exploit specific biological features of their hosts to ensure their transmission, survival, and maintenance of viable populations. As a result, parasites may affect host physiology, morphology, reproduction or behaviour, and they are increasingly recognized as having significant impacts on host individuals, populations, communities and even ecosystems. Although this is usually acknowledged by parasite ecologists, fish ecologists often ignore parasitism in their studies, often acting as though their systems are free of parasites. However, the effects of parasites on their hosts can alter variables routinely used in fish ecology, ranging from the level of individual fish (e.g. condition factors) to populations (e.g. estimates of mortality and reproductive success) or communities (e.g. measures of interspecific competition or the structure and functioning of food webs). By affecting fish physiology, parasites can also interfere with measurements of trophic levels by means of stable isotope composition, or have antagonistic or synergistic effects with host parameters normally used as indicators of different sources of pollution. Changes in host behaviour induced by parasites can also modify host distribution patterns, habitat selection, diet composition, sexual behaviour, etc., with implications for the ecology of fish and of their predators and prey. In this review, we summarise and illustrate the likely biases and erroneous conclusions that one may expect from studies of fish ecology that ignore parasites, from the individual to the community level. Given the impact of parasites across all levels of biological organisation, we show that their omission from the design and analyses of ecological studies poses real risks of flawed interpretations for those patterns and processes that ecologists seek to uncover.

AB  - The paleolimnological record of diatoms and climate, spanning the last 2800 years, was investigated in a small subarctic lake (Pocket Lake) that from AD 1948 to 2004 was contaminated by gold smelting waste. An age-depth model was constructed using a combination of Pb-210, C-14, and tephra to determine a 2800 year history of lake ontogeny (natural aging), biological diversity, and regional climate variability. Diatoms form six strong paleoecological assemblages over time in response to changes in local hydrological and sedimentological conditions (including metals). Selected environmental variables explained 28.8% of the variance in the diatom assemblages, with Fe, Ca, and sediment end member distribution being important indicators. The diatom assemblages correlated to the Iron Age Cold Epoch (2800-2300 cal BP), Roman Warm Period (2250-1610 cal BP), Dark Age Cold Period (1500-1050 cal BP), Medieval Climate Anomaly (ca. 1100-800 cal BP), and the Little Ice Age (800-200 cal BP). The disappearance of Staurosira venter highlights the change from the Iron Age Cold Epoch to the Roman Warm Period. After deposition of the White River Ash (833-850 CE; 1117-1100 cal BP), transition to circumneutral conditions was followed in tandem by a transition to planktic influenced communities. Ten discrete peaks of Cu, Pb, and Zn were observed and attributed to soluble mobility from catchment soils through enhanced seepage and spring snowmelt. The prominent metal spikes were aligned with increases in Brachysira neoexilis. Downward mobilization of arsenic and antimony from contaminated surficial sediments highlight the problem of post depositional industrial contamination of paleosediments. Results demonstrate that paleoclimatic changes in the region, modulated by solar radiation, impacted temperature and precipitation in the lake catchment, influencing temporal shifts in diatom ecology. Changes in diatom taxa richness provided valuable information on the relative influence of water quality (planktic taxa) and sediment input (benthic taxa). The diatom assemblage succession also provides evidence that natural aging over time has played a role in the ecological evolution of the lake.

AB  - The characterization of wetting properties (by contact angles) of several undersea artificial (glass plates,) and natural (stones, sand layers, soft-bottom structures, aquatic macrophytes, sediments, and seafloor communities) solid substrata in the Baltic Sea brackish water (Gulf of Gdansk). The studies were performed under laboratory and field conditions using a novel captive bubble air-pipette computer microscope system. A set of the surface wettability parameters: the apparent surface free energy gamma(SV), adhesive layer film pressure Pi, work of adhesion W-A, and work of spreading W-S were determined to quantify the wetting properties of model substrata using the contact angle hysteresis (CAH) approach. The useful technique to measure in situ the contact angle giving reproducible and accurate values of CA turned out to be a captive bubble method, for fully hydrated interfacial layers of highly hydrophilic and porous nature met at seabed (Rodrigues-Valverde et al., 2002). CA measurements revealed mostly hydrophilic nature of the studied solid material (CA < 90 degrees) where the presence of adsorbed organic matter layer or crude oil film covering lead to surface hydrophobization (CA(up arrow), gamma(SV)down arrow, WA down arrow, W-S more negative). The adhesion of biofouling was correlated both with CAH and the dispersive interaction term gamma(d)(SV) of the total gamma(SV). Monitoring of the artificial substrata of the hydrophilic nature with a CA technique can be used to observe the development of the organisms community i.e., microfouling, and to carry out a comprehensive study of surfaces of the submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton lucens in particular). Since aquatic macrophytes can act as bio-indicators of water chemistry their surface wettability may reflect plant surface erosion and organic matter accumulation state being of particular value in biological assessment of ecosystems status.

AB  - Monitoring of ecosystem traits is an important element of ecological restoration. Thus, it is crucial not only to assess vegetation data but also direct ecological factors such as light. The project "Restoration of the Danube Floodplain between Neuburg and Ingolstadt" (Bavaria) was initiated to restore the typical flooding regime and groundwater fluctuations of a near-natural floodplain forest. One monitoring scheme is focusing on vegetation change along transects perpendicular to a new bypass river since 2007. Here the ecological factor light was estimated using the "Worlein scale". The overall aim of the work was to test the reliability of this method in comparison with digital hemispherical photography which is known to deliver quantitative data. The specific questions were (1) whether or not estimates based on the Worlein scale are correlated with results of digital hemispherical photography, and (2) if Ellenberg indicator values would represent a useful alternative to the direct measurement or estimation of the ecological factor light in a floodplain environment.
   A number of specifically designed devices were employed to produce the hemispherical photographs under difficult conditions in the floodplain forest. Data processing was done with the programs "SideLook" for thresholding, and "Gap Light Analyzer" for modeling. Inferential statistical analyses were carried out to check the reliability of the Worlein scale and Ellenberg indicator values.
   The results revealed considerable differences among the three methods. The results based on the Worlein scale were closely related to the photographic measurements, although the resolution under low light conditions was rather poor. Ellenberg indicator values were only weakly correlated with the measured values across a wide range of the dataset, both with logarithmic and pure cover abundance correction.
   We conclude that digital hemispherical photography is a relatively quick and flexible method for measuring light as ecological factor. The Worlein scale also seems to be robust and reliable, although the logarithmic quality of light estimates due to the Weber-Fechner law has to be taken into account. Ellenberg indicator values are not recommended for describing the light climate in a floodplain forest.

AB  - One of the modern methods of spatially estimating anthropogenic impact on a given territory is landscape planning, including the stage of assessment of the conditions of a natural complex. The results of such an evaluation are used in environmental management. The aim of the work is to assess the ecological conditions of the Vasyshchivsky forest area by means of landscape and environmental planning. The aim is achieved by performing the following stages of work: assessment of the distribution and intensity of contamination sources in the Vasyshchivsky forest area; drawing a scheme showing parts of the territory with probable conflicts; making a soil and geochemical survey of the forest area to assess acidity distribution and total content of carbonates in the soil as the consequences of pollution of the forest ecosystem; specification of geochemical characteristics of soils on the forest sites in the established location of former fires; forecast of limits of afte-r fire areas based on the analysis of cartographic works developed by the authors. The geochemical characteristics of the soils in Vasyshchivsky forest have been studied to identify the areas affected by fire, and the results of this study are given in this paper. During the inventory phase of landscape and environmental planning, a complete survey of the forest territory was conducted and a landscape map was drawn. Based on the authors' matrices filled with conflicts of natural use, the areas with low, medium and high levels of conflict have been marked within the study area. Landscape and environmental planning has been evaluated by soil sampling outside the test points on the network and their laboratory analysis. The results of the evaluation phase were maps illustrating the geochemical situation in the forest soil cover. The article presents cartographic models of the spatial distribution of carbonates in the forest soils, water and salt extraction pH. The results of the study are part of an environmental assessment of Vasyshchivsky forest area. In future they will be used in restoration of the forest ecosystems after fire.

AB  - The climate change in the Mediterranean area is expected to have significant impacts on the aquatic ecosystems and particular in the mountain rivers and streams that often host important species such as the Salmo farioides, Karaman 1938. These impacts will most possibly affect the habitat availability for various aquatic species resulting to an essential alteration of the water requirements, either for dams or other water abstractions, in order to maintain the essential levels of ecological flow for the rivers. The main scope of this study was to assess potential climate change impacts on the hydrological patterns and typical biota for a south-western Balkan mountain river, the Acheloos. The altered flow regimes under different emission scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were estimated using a hydrological model and based on regional climate simulations over the study area. The Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) methodology was then used to assess the potential streamflow alterations in the studied river due to predicted climate change conditions. A fish habitat simulation method integrating univariate habitat suitability curves and hydraulic modeling techniques were used to assess the impacts on the relationships between the aquatic biota and hydrological status utilizing a sentinel species, the West Balkan trout. The most prominent effects of the climate change scenarios depict severe flow reductions that are likely to occur especially during the summer flows, changing the duration and depressing the magnitude of the natural low flow conditions. Weighted Usable Area-flow curves indicated the limitation of suitable habitat for the native trout. Finally, this preliminary application highlighted the potential of science-based hydrological and habitat simulation approaches that are relevant to both biological quality elements (fish) and current EU Water policy to serve as efficient tools for the estimation of possible climate change impacts on the south-western Balkan river ecosystems.

AB  - The European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires that all water bodies in Europe achieve good ecological status (GES) by 2015. We developed an ecological classification tool for UK lakes based on benthic diatoms, a key component of the biological-quality element macrophytes and phytobenthos. A database of 1079 epilithic and epiphytic diatom samples and matching environmental data was assembled from 228 UK lakes. The data set was divided into 3 lake types: low, medium, and high alkalinity. A lake trophic diatom index (LTDI) was developed based on modification of the trophic diatom index (TDI) for rivers, and ecological quality ratios (EQRs) were generated for each lake type. The high/good status boundary was defined as the 25th percentile of EQRs of all reference sites (identified based on independent sedimentary-diatom-assemblage data or catchment point-source and landuse data), whereas the good/moderate boundary was set at the point at which nutrient-sensitive and nutrient-tolerant taxa were present in equal relative abundance. The moderate/poor and poor/bad boundaries were defined by equal division of the remaining EQR gradient. Samples from reference sites were used to predict the expected LTDI value for each sample, and these values were compared with the classifications derived from the LTDI. For lakes identified as reference sites, 68% were classified as having high status and 32% as having good. The model predicted 81% of nonreference lakes to have good or worse status. The model was applied to 17 English lakes (10 low-and 7 medium-alkalinity) for which classification based on other WFD tools was available. The classifications based on LTDI gave the same status (within 1 class) as other biological elements for 11 of the 17 lakes (65%). Thus, the LTDI gives a reliable assessment of the condition of the littoral biofilm and is a key component of a WFD-compliant tool kit for classifying UK standing waters.

AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis in the aquatic environment has emerged as a promising tool for diagnosis of the ecological status in comprehensive monitoring strategies and might become useful in context of the EuropeanWater Framework Directive (WFD) and other legislations to derive stressor-specific indicators. Despite many studies having made significant progress for the future use of eDNA in terms of ecosystem composition and detection of invasive/rare species in inland waters, much remains unknown about the transport and fate of eDNA under natural environmental conditions. We designed a specific dual-labelled probe to detect brown trout (Salmo trutta, L.) eDNA and used the probe to describe the fate of eDNA released from an aquaculture facility into the low mountain range stream Wehebach, Germany. The probe was shown to be specific to brown trout, as ponds housing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) did not test positive. Even though we observed different strengths of eDNA signals for three ponds containing different brown trout quantities, no significant correlation was found between biomass (kg/L) and eDNA quantity. Our results indicate that the release of DNA from brown trout might be life stage and/or age-dependent. The effluents of the aquaculture facility were a source of high levels of eDNA which resulted in the greatest abundance of brown trout eDNA directly downstream of the facility. Despite the natural occurrence of brown trout in the Wehebach, as shown by ecological investigations conducted by authorities of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) and personal observations, we observed a significant decrease of relative abundance of eDNA in the Wehebach within the first 1.5 km downstream of the Aquaculture. Our results suggest that concentrations of eDNA in running waters rapidly decrease under natural conditions due to dilution and degradation processes, which might have important implications for the utility of eDNA in environmental research.

AB  - While the phenomenon of increased population tolerance to environmental contaminants has been widely reported for aquatic animal species living in contaminated ecosystems, the question of the nature of the tolerance, i.e., genetic adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, has not yet been studied to the same degree and remains under debate when explaining the variability of toxicological sensitivity among field populations. The occurrence of both processes challenges the ecological risk assessment (ERA) of chemicals, questioning the relevance of toxicity assessment procedures based on bioassays employing organisms from naive reference populations. Nonetheless, given that genetic adaptation and phenotypic acclimation are based on different mechanisms, with different persistence periods over time when exposure is stopped, gaining insight into the mechanism of tolerance to contaminants of field populations is a major concern for ERA. In this context, this study aimed to test whether genetic adaptation underlies the tolerance to cadmium (Cd) in a field Gammarus fossarum population identified in a previous study. Breeding and exposure experiments conducted in laboratory conditions revealed that: (1) first and second cohorts of neonates produced from field-collected parents present an increased Cd tolerance, which is explained by a reduction of between-brood variability of Cd sensitivity with an absence of sensitive broods compared to two reference populations rather than by the existence of more tolerant individuals; and (2) Cd tolerance was no longer evident for broods of the third cohort produced by these breeders when maintained under Cd-free conditions in the laboratory. Hence, this study drew the striking conclusion that the observation of Cd tolerance inheritance within the field population studied does not demonstrate genetic adaptation, but it results from an effect of parental exposure inducing transgenerational plasticity, which deeply influences the variability of population sensitivity. To our knowledge, this study is only the second report of increased tolerance to contaminants in a field population explicitly attributed to the phenomenon of transgenerational acclimation.

AB  - Impervious surfaces have for many years been recognized as an indicator of the intensity of the urban environment and, with the advent of urban sprawl, they have become a key issue in habitat health. Although a considerable amount of research has been done to define impervious thresholds for water quality degradation, there are a number of flaws in the assumptions and methodologies used. Given refinement of the methodology, accurate and usable parameters for preventative watershed planning can be developed, which include impervious surface thresholds and a balance between pervious and impervious surfaces within a watershed.

AB  - Research towards understanding the relationship between maintaining thermal comfort and energy efficiency in the public utility buildings was undertaken among 323 1st year students during class hours. Questionnaires surveys and measurements of indoor conditions were performed. The article identified students' sensations and perceptions concerning indoor conditions. Temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and CO2 concentration measured to assess room conditions showed that the auditorium had almost comfortable conditions according to the literature guidelines. The indices used to assess students' perceptions were: Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV), Thermal Preference Vote (TPV), Air Freshness Sensation Vote (AfSV), Air Movement Preference Vote (AmPV), and Relative Humidity Preference Vote (RHPV). The interpretation of these indicators showed that while the students' requests for temperature changes and increased air movement are adequate for the air conditions in the room, the evaluation of stuffiness and requests for changes in humidity levels are surprising. Striving uncritically to meet the desired room parameters, according to the users votes, can lead to deterioration of the air and not only the increase in energy consumption but even waste it. Better understanding of users' preferences and behaviour and further application of this knowledge indirectly aim at increasing energy efficiency in buildings.

AB  - Studying adverse effects of chemical pressure on aquatic ecosystems needs a comprehensive knowledge of bioaccumulation mechanisms of pollutants in biota to predict internal concentrations, especially for Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). However, the large variability of responses in measured POP concentrations requires explicit consideration of both individual variability and environmental influences. Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory provides a rigorous and generic conceptual framework for tackling these questions in a relevant mechanistic way. In the present study, parameterisation and calibration of previous DEB models for Solea solea were revisited in order to accurately represent the full life cycle with an original emphasis on larval stage, metamorphosis, reproduction rules and sexual differences. We first improved calibration thanks to the use of the estimation procedure developed by the DEB network coupled with a broad compilation of data from literature. Then, we validated this set of parameter estimates on independent datasets of i) individual monitoring of larval growth in controlled food conditions from a novel experiment, and ii) juvenile and adult growth, and female fecundity, from a natural population. Finally, we combined the DEB model developed in the present paper with we used a simple toxicokinetic (TK) model from literature. This TK model was also combined to a previous DEB model and was used to reproduce the mean trajectories of a growth and contamination dataset. We applied the same TK model with our DEB model considering inter-individual variability in food availability. This application highlighted the need to accurately consider inter-individual variability in ingestion to correctly estimate growth and contamination variability. The present work is the first step in the development of a mechanistic TK model that will be used in a companion paper for investigations of juvenile sole sensitivity to warming, nursery quality and prey contamination, in highly fluctuating estuarine environments.

AB  - Carbonates are widespread occurrences in various environmental conditions. Particularly, microbial induced and/or controlled carbonate formations are considered significant archives for recording critical environmental conditions that can be used not only to reconstruct paleo-environments, but also to gain valuable information about evidence of life in environments. Therefore, deciphering carbonate precipitation mechanisms, and the factors controlling these processes, particularly in extreme environments, hold significant insights for industrial applications, and for searching life in extra-terrestrial environments. In the scope of these contexts, we tried to model carbonate precipitation mechanism and possible biological influences in a hypersaline lake, known as an extreme environment in Turkey, in terms of its water chemistry. The aim of this research is to model CaCO3 precipitation in the Acigol Lake, using water quality data from the field, and meteorological data obtained from the Turkish State Meteorological Service for the years 2013 and 2015. To achieve this, AQUATOX model is utilized. The model is calibrated for nine stations of the lake using parameters related to water quality, site characteristics, inflow loadings and lake hydrodynamics. Calibration dataset is obtained from the field measurements and meteorological data, for the year 2013. Model validation is conducted both using experimental data, and field observations, obtained in August, 2015. An integrated modeling approach is undertaken by coupling a geochemical reaction model and a process-based ecosystem model, AQUATOX; using field, experimental and meteorological data. Model results suggest that the amount of CaCO3 precipitation in the system ranges from 35.16 to 128.48 mg L-1 d(-1). Temperature, photosynthesis rate, depth and pH are found to be the most significant variables that govern the biogeochemical processes responsible for CaCO3 precipitation. The model showed a strong relationship between calcite precipitation and certain cyanobacteria species such as Anabaena and Aphanizomenon sp. Results also indicate that the model was successful in representing the relationships between calcite precipitation variations, and phosphate and pH. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient and NRMSE are found to be 0.93 and 0.29, respectively.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics and other biophysical features were measured in the open-water zone of 17 semipermanent/permanent prairie pothole wetlands in Iowa. Relations among variables were used to identify likely determinants of invertebrate abundance and diversity, and useful indicators of wetland condition (i.e., health). Abundant invertebrates included physid and planorbid snails, oligochaetes, leeches, caenid mayflies, corixid bugs, chironomid midges, and amphipods. Abundant taxa were distributed across multiple functional feeding and habit groups. Invertebrate densities and taxonomic diversity were positively associated with plant/coarse particulate organic matter (plant/CPOM) abundance, and negatively related to turbidity, water-column concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, and presence of large-bodied fishes. Results supported hypotheses that plant/CPOM was an important invertebrate resource, and that plant/CPOM abundance was reduced in turbid, hypereutrophic wetlands. Fish likely reduced invertebrate abundance and diversity through predation and/or cascading effects on plants, turbidity, and nutrients. Wetlands with high invertebrate abundance and diversity, abundant plant/CPOM, low turbidity and nutrient concentrations, presence of tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), and absence of large-bodied fishes appeared to be in the best condition. These features should be routinely measured to effectively assess condition of Iowa prairie pothole wetlands. Additionally, eliminating non-native fish populations may be critical to improving condition of these wetlands.

AB  - P>1. An important step in the conservation of biodiversity is to identify what exists, its quantity and its quality (i.e. condition). This can be a daunting task at the landscape-scale, so vegetation communities are often used as surrogates for biodiversity. Satellite imagery has improved our ability to rapidly measure vegetation parameters but the need for calibration still requires rapid and cost-effective on-ground condition assessment. Some management agencies address this need by using visual condition assessments, with unknown consequences for the different purposes of condition data. It is therefore vital to examine the comparability of visual and systematic condition assessment methods to guide their use in conservation decision making.
   2. We compared visual assessments of vegetation condition with more systematic and higher resolution on-ground assessments, using a method where both assessments were made for the same quadrats. We determined both the condition parameters observers respond to when making visual assessments of condition, and the consequences of any differences for the application of these data.
   3. We found that visual assessment of vegetation condition broadly represented measured assessments of the same vegetation, but that observers simplify their assessments by responding to only some of the measured condition parameters. No consistent trends were found in the parameters observers responded to across the different vegetation types sampled.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that visual estimates of vegetation condition are only of sufficient resolution to replace more expensive, high-resolution assessments at a landscape-scale, when condition results are combined over multiple areas and vegetation types. Visual assessment methods potentially can provide an efficient measure of overall condition for conservation management agencies where practitioners can make assessments of condition in the course of their daily management activities - an important step forward. At smaller scales, idiosyncratic effects render visual estimates highly variable when compared with systematic condition assessments. This variability, especially among vegetation types, suggests that more systematic assessments are necessary when management decisions require higher-resolution estimates of changes in individual condition parameters, such as when measuring the success of individual management actions. These findings provide a valuable guide for selecting the most appropriate approach for the different objectives of condition assessments for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - A landscape's long-term capacity to retain, utilize and recycle local resources is an objective basis for assessing its ecological functionality or condition. In subtropical and tropical drylands, where plant growth is moisture-limited for much of the time, land condition is reflected in the local water balance. The ratio of long-term actual evapotranspiration and precipitation (E-a/P) is proposed as an objective indicator of dryland condition. A spatial modelling framework is developed for the quantification of E-a/P over large areas using remotely sensed vegetation density patterns. Model parameters are defined by two particular situations: (i) non-vegetated sites, where E-a/P depends on the long-term runoff coefficient of bare soil surfaces (RCbs, and (ii) non-degraded sites with a vegetation density close to the potential value for which E-a/P congruent to 1.0. Specht's evaporative coefficient is used as an independent variable for the prediction of the potential vegetation density, whereas RCbs is estimated with the curve number method.
   The performance of the method was evaluated in a 900 km(2) area in south-east Spain, where predicted land condition was found to be in good agreement with qualitative field observations on the nature and intensity of land degradation processes.

AB  - As the environment influences soil formation, Quaternary loess-paleosols provide an important, yet complex source on former climate and vegetation conditions. This study revises the paleopedological record of the Rocourt-complex, the pedostratigraphic marker for the Eemian and early Weichselian in the Belgian loess belt. Depth functions were established from an exceptionally well-preserved, in-situ sequence. Based on soil micromorphological features, total element contents, iron fractions and carbon content a reconstruction was made of the polygenetic formation of the Rocourt soil. Results indicate that only by combining multiple soil features, consistent information could be obtained. Furthermore, this study shows that cryogenic processes, transport of colloids, iron dynamics, redox-conditions, organic matter formation and biological activity were major soil forming processes. The hypothesis of six major stages of soil formation under varying climatic conditions was most supported by the data. During the warm to temperate oceanic climate of the Eemian, a strongly weathered argic horizon was formed. This horizon was later disrupted by reticulate ice segregation and stagnogley during the severe and prolonged cold conditions of the first cold stadial following the Eemian. Weak soil formation, during the relatively short continental St. Germain I interstadial, subsequently formed cambic soil properties and a humiferous horizon in a mixture of local and new sediments. These soils were disrupted by fragipan Formation, with its associated cryogenic structure, banded eluviation and redoxfront, during the succeeding stadial with periglacial conditions. During the St. Germain II, another A horizon formed in new, calcareous material during more stable climatic conditions, allowing organic matter build-up, eluviation of smectite and formation of pedogenetic iron. During the evolution from this warmer climate with forest or forested steppe to eventually periglacial open tundra, an accretionary humiferous soil concluded the last episode of soil formation before the onset of pleniglacial Weichselian conditions.

AB  - With an eye to providing a methodology for tracking the dynamic integrity of prices for important market indicators, in this article we use Benford second digit (SD) reference distribution to track the daily London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) over the period 2005 to 2008. This reference, known as Benford's law, is present in many naturally occurring numerical data sets as well as in several financial data sets. We find that in two recent periods, Libor rates depart significantly from the expected Benford reference distribution. This raises potential concerns relative to the unbiased nature of the signals coming from the 16 banks from which the Libor is computed and the usefulness of the Libor as a major economic indicator.

AB  - 1. Regulation of rivers for human demands has led to extensive forest dieback on many floodplains. If these important ecosystems are to be maintained under future drier climates, we need accurate tools for predicting forest dieback. In the absence of spatially explicit flooding histories for many floodplains, changes in groundwater conditions may be a good indicator of water availability and, therefore, an important environmental indicator.
   2. Eucalyptus camaldulensis forests of Australia are an acute example of forest dieback, with 70% of the Victorian Murray River floodplain dying back. We quantified the relationship between forest dieback and ground water across this extensive floodplain (c. 100 000 ha of forest over 1500 km of river length).
   3. A combination of extensive ground surveys, remotely sensed data and modelling methods was used to predict forest dieback at the time of the survey and in the past. This approach provides a valuable tool for accurately monitoring forest condition over large spatial scales. Forest dieback was estimated to have increased from 45 to 70% of the floodplain between 1990 and 2006.
   4. Accurate groundwater data (depth and salinity) over a 20-year period were obtained for 289 bores and summarised using nonlinear regression. Groundwater depth and salinity were strong predictors of stand condition. This suggests that changes in groundwater conditions could be used to signal areas vulnerable to forest dieback and prioritise the limited water available for managed flooding.
   5. In the upper Murray, where ground water is predominantly fresh (< 15 mS cm(-2)), dieback increased with increasing groundwater depth. In contrast, the condition of stands in the lower Murray improved with increases in groundwater depth due its high salinity (> 30 mS cm(-2)). These regional differences in response of the same tree species to groundwater conditions show that our understanding of the drivers of forest dieback is best achieved at spatial and temporal scales representative of the problem.

AB  - The manner in which laboratory rodents are housed is driven by economics (minimal use of space and resources), ergonomics (ease of handling and visibility of animals), hygiene, and standardization (reduction of variation). This has resulted in housing conditions that lack sensory and motor stimulation and restrict the expression of species-typical behavior. In mice, such housing conditions have been associated with indicators of impaired welfare, including abnormal repetitive behavior (stereotypies, compulsive behavior), enhanced anxiety and stress reactivity, and thermal stress. However, due to concerns that more complex environmental conditions might increase variation in experimental results, there has been considerable resistance to the implementation of environmental enrichment beyond the provision of nesting material. Here, using 96 C57BU6 and SWISS female mice, respectively, we systematically varied environmental enrichment across four levels spanning the range of common enrichment strategies: (1) bedding alone; (2) bedding + nesting material; (3) deeper bedding + nesting material + shelter + increased vertical space; and (4) semi-naturalistic conditions, including weekly changes of enrichment items. We studied how these different forms of environmental enrichment affected measures of animal welfare, including homecage behavior (time-budget and stereotypic behavior), anxiety (open field behavior, elevated plus-maze behavior), growth (food and water intake, body mass), stress physiology (glucocorticoid metabolites in fecal boluses and adrenal mass), brain function (recurrent perseveration in a two-choice guessing task) and emotional valence (judgment bias). Our results highlight the difficulty in making general recommendations across common strains of mice and for selecting enrichment strategies within specific strains. Overall, the greatest benefit was observed in animals housed with the greatest degree of enrichment. Thus, in the super-enriched housing condition, stereotypic behavior, behavioral measures of anxiety, growth and stress physiology varied in a manner consistent with improved animal welfare compared to the other housing conditions with less enrichment. Similar to other studies, we found no evidence, in the measures assessed here, that environmental enrichment increased variation in experimental results.

AB  - We have analyzed various methods and models for determining and calculating drainage module. The drainage module is an important indicator of the hydrogeological effect of drainage and soil drainage. For the calculation of the drainage calculation module, an empirical, analytical, water-balance method is used, or it is accepted on the recommendations without sufficient economic and environmentaljustification. This does not meet the modern requirements for the creation and operation of such objects. Traditionally, the designs and parameters of agricultural drainage are determined by the drainage module. It provides the necessary conditions for the removal of excess moisture of the active soil layer in the spring (as the main calculation) and corresponds to a certain level of the calculated security of the formation of the runoff hydrograph. According to the generalized results of the research, in the calculation of drainage parameters, the values of drainage modules were taken within: for mineral soils - 0.4... 0.6 I/s.ha, for peat soils 0.2... 0.6 I/s.ha. These recommended values are not correct because then the defined drainage parameters take into account only the technological conditions of its operation. But this does not take into account the conditions of formation of economic and environmental effect within the system, and they are not economically and environmentally optimal for the calculation of the drainage system and its elements. We have performed research and evaluation of the hydrogeological effect of the drainage and drainage systems. The results of these researches showed the variability of values of drainage modules in time and space. We have also identified many influencing factors and confirmed their difference with the calculated value. A new evaluation of the effectiveness of drainage systems and the calculation of drainage modules are proposed. This evaluation includes the yield criterion for variable natural (climatic) and agricultural conditions. New optimal values of drainage modules are proposed. These values are also presented for critical conditions (maximum daily rainfall of different levels of probability).

AB  - Long-distance migrations can be energetically demanding and can represent phases of high mortality. Understanding relationships between body condition and migratory performance can help illuminate the challenges and vulnerabilities of migratory species. Juvenile anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) may migrate over 1000 km from their freshwater nursery habitats to estuary and ocean feeding grounds. During the period corresponding to the seaward migration of sockeye salmon, we held smolts in the laboratory to ask the following: (i) Does non-feeding migration duration influence prolonged swim performance and survival? (ii) What are the relationships between individual body condition and swim performance and survival? Wild sockeye salmon were intercepted during their migration and held without food for up to 61 days to represent the non-feeding freshwater migration and the extremes of poor estuary habitat. We conducted 40 sets of prolonged swim trials on 319 fish from 3 treatment groups that represented entrance to the marine environment on (i) an average,(ii) a delayed and (iii) a severely delayed migration schedule. Experimentally controlled freshwater migration duration did not impact swim performance or survival. Swim performance decreased concomitant with condition factor, where smolts with a Fulton's condition factor of <0.69 were less likely (<50% probability) to complete the swim test (90 min swim test, at similar to 0.50 m/s). Survival of salmon smolts in the laboratory was less likely at energy densities of less than 3.47 MJ/kg. Swim performance decreased much sooner than survival, suggesting that swim performance, and therefore condition factor, may be a good indicator of survival of migratory smolts, as fish with reduced swim performance will likely be predated. These two relationships, one more ecologically relevant and one more clinical, help reveal the limits of long-distance migration for juvenile salmon and can be used to determine population-specific starvation risk associated with various freshwater and marine habitat conditions.

AB  - Biodiversity loss is a major threat to the integrity of ecosystems and is projected to worsen, yet the path to successful conservation remains elusive. Decision support frameworks (DSFs) are increasingly applied by resource managers to navigate the complexity, uncertainty, and differing socio-ecological objectives inherent to conservation problems. Most published conservation research that uses DSFs focuses on analytical stages (e.g., identifying an optimal decision), making it difficult to assess and learn from previous examples in a conservation practice context. Here, we (1) evaluate the relationship between the application of decision science and the resulting conservation outcomes, and (2) identify and address existing barriers to the application of DSFs to conservation practice. To do this, we develop a framework for evaluating conservation initiatives using decision science that emphasizes setting attainable goals, building momentum, and obtaining partner buy-in. We apply this framework to a systematic review of amphibian conservation decision support projects, including a followup survey of the pertinent conservation practitioners, stakeholders, and scientists. We found that all projects identified optimal solutions to reach stated objectives, but positive conservation outcomes were limited when implementation challenges arose. Further, we identified multiple barriers (e.g., dynamic and hierarchical leadership, scale complexity, limited resource availability) that can inhibit the progression from decision identification to action implementation (i.e., 'decision-implementation gap'), and to successful conservation outcomes. Based on these results, we provide potential actionable steps and avenues for future development of DSFs to facilitate the transition from decision to action and the realization of conservation successes.

AB  - The Department of Energy's Savannah River Site is a former nuclear weapon material production and current research facility located in South Carolina, USA. Wastewater discharges from a fuel and nuclear reactor target manufacturing facility released depleted and natural U, as well as other metals into the Tims Branch-Steed Pond water system. We investigated the current dynamics of this system for the purposes of environmental monitoring and assessment by examining metal concentrations, bioavailability, and trophic transfer of contaminants in seven ponds. Biofilm, detritus, and Anuran and Anisopteran larvae were collected and analyzed for stable isotopes (delta N-15, delta C-13) and contaminants of potential concern (COPC) with a focus on Ni, U, and Hg, to examine metal mobility. Highest levels of Ni and U were found in biofilms U (147 and 332 mg kg(-1) DW, respectively), while highest Hg levels were found in tadpoles (1.1 mg kg(-1) DW). We found intraspecific biomagnification of COPCs as expressed through stable isotope analysis. Biofilms were the best indicators for contamination and Anuran larvae with the digestive tract removed were the best indicators of the specific bioavailability of the focal metals. Monitoring data showed that baseline delta N-15 values differed between ponds, but within a pond, values were stable throughout tadpole Gosner stage, strengthening the case to use this species for monitoring purposes. It is likely that there still is risk to ecosystem integrity as COPC metals are being assimilated into lower trophic organisms and even low levels of this mixture has shown to produce deleterious effects to some wildlife species.

AB  - Dragonflies are commonly used as indicators of environmental quality and different methods have been employed to monitor odonate assemblages, such as surveys of all adults, evaluations based on breeding adults, sampling of larvae and collection of exuviae. Results obtained with different sampling methods may not be interchangeable, as the different life stages (e. g. larvae, adults) differ in mobility (aquatic, aerial) and as they are subjected to different ecological constraints. Therefore generalization about habitat quality based on only one survey method might be questionable. Additionally, detectability of species might vary when different methods are used. In this study, nine retrodunal ponds in the Migliarino, San Rossore, Massaciuccoli Regional Park (Tuscany, Italy) were repeatedly and contemporaneously sampled during May-September 2008 with the following methods: all adults, breeding adults, larvae and exuviae. In total, 22 species were detected and the results showed that the four methods were not interchangeable. First, some species were only found using certain methods. Second, univariate measures of diversity obtained with the four sampling methods were considerably different. Alpha diversity was maximal when computed on all adults and minimal with exuviae; breeding adults and larval collection had intermediate values. Beta diversity showed an inverse trend, with the lowest value for "all adults" surveys and higher values for all the others. Finally, congruence among the assemblages revealed by the four methods was generally low. The results show that the four survey techniques are not interchangeable and that monitoring of Odonata has to be based on a carefully chosen method, which should reflect the aim of the study.

AB  - Ascophyllum nodosum is commercially harvested in the southwestern parts of Nova Scotia. Here the hypothesis is evaluated that harvesting results in a reduction in the abundance of Vertebrata lanosa, an obligate epiphyte of A. nodosum. Sampling at 10 harvested and 16 non-harvested sites showed that percent cover and frequency were significantly lower at harvested sites (i.e. 5.4 +/- 4.0 and 0.6 +/- 0.7% cover, and 61 +/- 24 and 21 +/- 18% frequency for non-harvested and harvested sites, respectively). Vertebrata lanosa is suggested as a useful indicator of ecological integrity at harvesting sites.

AB  - Intermediate metrics of translocation success are useful for long-lived, slow to mature species where survival and reproduction happen over decades. With fewer than 150 individuals in the wild, the Critically Endangered Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis) is one of the most threatened species on Earth. This study presents the first analysis of diet and body condition of wild Philippine crocodiles and headstarted (i.e. captive-reared) individuals released into the wild over the last decade, and uses these results to show how diet and body condition can be pertinent intermediate metrics of translocation success. Analyses of stomach contents revealed 17 different aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate and vertebrate prey species. Interestingly, 70% of Philippine crocodiles showed snails to be the predominent prey type, followed by fish (36.7%), birds (33.3%) and reptiles (33.3%). More than 50% of crocodiles consumed the invasive golden apple snail, a leading agricultural pest. Regardless of crocodile history (wild vs. headstarted) or size class (juvenile vs. adult), no evidence was found for dietary differences in percentage occurrence, percentage composition or prey diversity. Body condition was significantly higher in wild compared with headstarted individuals when analysed together in a pooled group, although neither group differed significantly from the standardized expectation, and headstarted individuals were not significantly different when body condition was derived independently for the two groups. This study provides a working example of how assessing the convergence of diet and body condition between translocated and wild individuals can provide complementary monitoring parameters to demonstrate post-release establishment of translocated crocodylians. The congruent dietary composition and comparable body condition observed in this study suggest that headstarted crocodiles adapt well following release. Crocodylus mindorensis survives in an agricultural landscape and is likely to play an ecologically important role by exploiting invasive species, reinforcing the importance of this species to local communities.

AB  - We compiled details of over 8000 assessments of protected area management effectiveness across the world and developed a method for analyzing results across diverse assessment methodologies and indicators. Data was compiled and analyzed for over 4000 of these sites. Management of these protected areas varied from weak to effective, with about 40% showing major deficiencies. About 14% of the surveyed areas showed significant deficiencies across many management effectiveness indicators and hence lacked basic requirements to operate effectively. Strongest management factors recorded on average related to establishment of protected areas (legal establishment, design, legislation and boundary marking) and to effectiveness of governance; while the weakest aspects of management included community benefit programs, resourcing (funding reliability and adequacy, staff numbers and facility and equipment maintenance) and management effectiveness evaluation. Estimations of management outcomes, including both environmental values conservation and impact on communities, were positive. We conclude that in spite of inadequate funding and management process, there are indications that protected areas are contributing to biodiversity conservation and community well-being.

KW  - DECISION-MAKING
AB  - Sustainable decision-making involves political decisions at the local, regional, or national levels, which aim at a balanced development of socio-environmental systems. A fundamental question in sustainable decision-making is that of defining and measuring sustainable development. Many methods have been proposed to assess sustainability. Recently, a model has been developed, called Sustainability Assessment by Fuzzy Evaluation (SAFE), which uses fuzzy logic reasoning and basic indicators of environmental integrity, economic efficiency, and social welfare, and derives measures of human (HUMS), ecological (ECOS), and overall sustainability (OSUS). In this article, we perform sensitivity analysis of the SAFE model to identify the most important factors contributing to sustainable development. About 80 different indicators are tested and classified as promoting, impeding, or having no effect on the progress toward sustainable development. The proposed method is applied to the Greek and American economics. The conclusion is that there is no unique sustainable path and, accordingly, policy makers should choose different criteria and strategies to make efficient sustainable decisions for each country.

AB  - Redistribution nodes (r-nodes) are load-controlled locations in a mechanical component or a structure. As such r-nodes lie on a distribution of stresses corresponding to primary stresses as defined in the ASME codes. R-Nodes can be determined on the basis of two linear elastic analyses. On account of its load-controlled nature, the 'combined r-node equivalent stress' can be identified with the reference stress, which is widely used in integrity assessments of components and structures. In this paper, the concepts of r-node, reference stress, limit load and primary stress are discussed. Aspects pertaining to lower bound limit loads are addressed because of their relevance in engineering design. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Behaviour links physiological function with ecological processes and can be very sensitive towards environmental stimuli and chemical exposure. As such, behavioural indicators of toxicity are well suited for assessing impacts of pesticides at sublethal concentrations found in the environment. Recent developments in video-tracking technologies offer the possibility of quantifying behavioural patterns, particularly locomotion, which in general has not been studied and understood very well for aquatic macroinvertebrates to date. In this study, we aim to determine the potential effects of exposure to two neurotoxic pesticides with different modes of action at different concentrations (chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid) on the locomotion behaviour of the water louse Asellus aquaticus. We compare the effects of the different exposure regimes on the behaviour of Asellus with the effects that the presence of food and shelter exhibit to estimate the ecological relevance of behavioural changes. We found that sublethal pesticide exposure reduced dispersal distances compared to controls, whereby exposure to chlorpyrifos affected not only animal activity but also step lengths while imidacloprid only slightly affected step lengths. The presence of natural cues such as food or shelter induced only minor changes in behaviour, which hardly translated to changes in dispersal potential. These findings illustrate that behaviour can serve as a sensitive endpoint in toxicity assessments. However, under natural conditions, depending on the exposure concentration, the actual impacts might be outweighed by environmental conditions that an organism is subjected to. It is, therefore, of importance that the assessment of toxicity on behaviour is done under relevant environmental conditions.

AB  - Microbial regrowth needs to be managed during water reclamation and distribution. The aim of present study was to investigate the removal and regrowth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella in water reclamation and distribution system by using membrane integrity assay (PMA-qPCR), reverse transcriptional activity assay (Q-RT-PCR) and culture-based assay, and also to evaluate the relationships among bacterial regrowth, and environmental factors in the distribution system. The results showed that most of the water reclamation processes potentially induced bacteria into VBNC state. The culturable E. coli and Salmonella regrew 1.8 and 03 log(10) in distribution system, which included reactivation of bacteria in the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state and reproduction of culturable bacteria. The regrowth of culturable E. coli and Salmonella in the distribution system mainly depended on the residual chlorine levels, with correlations (R-2) of -0.598 and -0.660. The abundances of membrane integrity and reverse transcriptional activity bacteria in reclamation effluents had significant correlations with the culturable bacteria at the end point of the distribution system, demonstrating that PMA-qPCR and Q-RT-PCR are sensitive and accurate tools to determine and predict bacterial regrowth in water distribution systems. This study has improved our understanding of microbial removal and regrowth in reclaimed water treatment and distribution systems. And the results also recommended that more processes should be equipped to remove viable bacteria in water reclamation plants for the sake of inhibition microbial regrowth during water distribution and usages.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of aquatic macrophytes as biological indicators of the environmental conditions of rivers in north-eastern Spain. To this end, twenty five river basins were studied to assess the species composition and abundance of macrophytes, and to examine their relation with different geographic, morphometric, mineralization, and trophic status parameters. Of the twenty six macrophyte species found, five appeared to be useful as biological indicators of the environmental conditions of the rivers. L. minor was a good indicator of high mineralization (i.e., conductivity and Cl-) and high trophic state (especially, N-NO2-). C. stagnalis was a good indicator of high P-PO43- concentrations. P. crispus, P. polygonifolius, and R. penicillatus seemed to be useful indicators of high N-NO3- concentration. We conclude that, in our study area, aquatic macrophytes can indeed be used as biological indicators of the environmental conditions of rivers.

AB  - Bivalve molluscs represent the most recognized bioindicators of freshwater pollution. However, their ability to indicate specific xenobiotics in complex exposures is unclear. In this study, we aimed to track the particular effects of the pesticide Roundup (Rnd) and the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine (Cpz) on the mussel Unio tumidus at the simpler environmentally relevant models. We treated the mussels by Rnd (17 mu g L-1) Cpz (18 mu g L-1), the mixture of Rnd and Cpz at 18 degrees C (RndCpz), and Rnd at 25 degrees C (RndT) and examined their digestive glands after 14 days of exposure. We analyzed total antioxidant capacity, glutathione (GSH&GSSG) and protein carbonyls levels, total and Zn-related concentrations of metallothioneins (MT and Zn-MT, respectively), the activities of CYP450-related EROD, glutathione S-transferase, cholinesterase, caspase-3, citrate synthase (CS), lysosomal membrane integrity (NRR), and Zn level in the tissue. Shared responses were indicated as the increase of the antioxidant, Zn-MT, and EROD levels, whereas the changes of Zn concentration, NRR, and caspase-3 activity were most diverse compared to control. According to discriminant analysis, complex exposures abolished the individual response traits and intensified the harmful effects that caused a decrease in the Zn level in the RndCpz- and RndT-groups and the loss of lysosomal integrity in the RndT-group. We concluded that multi-marker expertise with the application of integrated indices had benefits when evaluating the effects of complex exposures.

AB  - Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in magnetic resonance imaging scans have emerged as indicators of potentially serious side effects in clinical trials of therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. These anomalies include an edematous type (ARIA-E) that appears as hyperintense (bright) regions by T2-weighted MRI, and a type characterized by the deposition of hemosiderin (ARIA-H) that elicits a hypointense signal, especially in T2* susceptibility weighted images. ARIA in general has been linked to the presence of amyloid-beta (A beta)-type cerebral amyloid angiopathy, an accumulation of misfolded A beta protein in the vascular wall that impairs the integrity of brain blood vessels. However, the pathobiology of ARIA remains poorly understood, in part due to the absence of an animal model of the disorder that would enable a contemporaneous analysis of tissue integrity in the affected region. Here we describe both ARIA-E and ARIA-H in an aged squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), a nonhuman primate model of naturally occurring cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Histopathologic examination of the anomalous region revealed reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis, infiltration of systemic inflammatory/immune cells, damage to axons and myelin, and hemosiderin deposition. The disruption of axons in particular suggests that ARIA-E could have functional consequences for affected regions. The squirrel monkey model can be useful for studying the pathogenesis and long-term effects of ARIA, and for testing the safety and efficacy of emerging therapies for Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - There is a need to quantify the multivariate quality of a recreational fishery at the site scale to better communicate the relative quality among sites to the public and anglers. Borrowing on the general approach of multimetric indices of biotic integrity (IBIs), we developed fishery quality indices (FQIs) from species quality indices (SQIs) based on measures of fish abundance and size structure for northern and central Portuguese streams. Our FQIs showed regional patients indicating a range in fishery quality. Higher coldwater FQI scores were mostly found in the northwestern (Minho and Lima), northeastern Douro, and northern Tagus basins. Higher warmwater FQI scores occurred in the eastern Tagus basin. The species that contributed the most to warmwater FQI scores were largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus. the cyprinid Luciobarbus bocagei, chubs Squalius carolitertii and S. pyrenaicus, and nases Pseudochondrostoma duriense and P. polylepis. The chubs, nases, and brown trout Salmo trutta contributed the most to coldwater FQI scores. As expected, our indices were correlated with river size and with disturbance at the catchment, segment, and site scales. Regression models for separate coldwater and warmwater FQIs were stronger than those for the individual SQIs and for an all-site FQI. The correlation was positive between the coldwater FQI and a coldwater IBI but negative between the warmwater FQI and warmwater IBIs. The proposed FQIs offer a quantitative approach for assessing relative fishery quality among sites and for making regional assessments given an appropriate study design. The component SQIs and SQI metrics of the FQIs can be disassociated to determine the population and species characteristics most affected by various environmental variables.

AB  - Land degradation is a leading cause of biodiversity loss, and understanding its consequences on freshwater ecosystems remains a priority for improving the effectiveness of restoration practices and ecosystem assessments. Freshwater monitoring programs use macroinvertebrates to assess the biotic effects of degradation and management actions, often using the ratio of observed to expected taxa at a site-O/E-for this purpose. Despite the power of the O/E approach, large amounts of data are required to generate an expectation and it can be difficult to define a threshold value for degraded sites. An alternative assessment tool is phylogenetic diversity, which is widely used in academic biology but rarely applied in management despite empirical correlations between phylogenetic diversity and management targets such as ecosystem structure and function. Here, we use macroinvertebrate data from 1400 watersheds, collected since 1998, to evaluate the potential for phylogenetic metrics to inform evaluations of management practices. These watersheds were chosen because their low disturbance levels and high habitat heterogeneity have made them problematic to assess with O/E. Phylogenetic diversity detected degradation of assemblages and was sensitive enough to parse impacts to inform management actions. This is particularly notable given the phylogenetic metrics, unlike O/E, did not require additional "baseline" data. Site disturbance and broader environmental drivers strongly predicted site phylogenetic structure, providing management objectives to increase site quality. We call on others to consider using phylogenetic diversity to complement existing O/E schemes, particularly in systems where O/E is insufficient to prioritize management objectives.

AB  - Dam construction and nutrient loading are among the greatest threats to freshwater ecosystems, altering ecological processes and the provisioning of ecosystem services. Temporal change in hydrology and ambient nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations was studied on the Grijalva, a large tropical river in southern Mexico, where four hydroelectric dams operate and where land conversion has impacted the freshwater environment. Temporal changes in discharge and in river chemistry were examined by analysing long-term discharge and nutrient data using the software Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration and Mann-Kendall tests. Furthermore, additional water chemistry samples were collected to examine seasonal nutrient dynamics in the lower Grijalva. Long-term discharge data indicated dam construction has severely altered temporal patterns in discharge and other hydrological characteristics. The lower Grijalva has also experienced increase in nitrate concentrations through time, which may be attributed to the expansion of agricultural and urban areas in the watershed. In contrast, total phosphorus appeared to decline at the sites influenced by dam construction. Lower nutrient concentrations were recorded upstream from the city of Villahermosa, suggesting that inputs from urban areas may have contributed to nutrient loading. Additionally, higher nitrate and total phosphorus concentrations were detected in tributaries draining intensive agricultural and suburban areas. Collectively, the results from the study suggest that dam construction and land conversion in large, tropical watersheds can produce chemical and hydrological changes, which may negatively impact important ecosystem servicessuch as fisheries and the provisioning of sources of drinking waterand may compromise the integrity of coastal zones.

AB  - The ecosystem function of headwaters is important and increasingly well-recognized, but institutional structures to administer their protection and management are lacking or poorly developed. Although the reasons for this mismatch are various, one of practical concern is the potential administrative burden imposed by the sizable number of headwaters. Two essential components of an administrative framework for managing waters is classification by type so that proper expectations can be set, and development of indicators that measure whether those expectations are being met. Ordinations of macroinvertebrate assemblages sampled from 1016 sites in 934 headwater streams draining <13 km(2) across Ohio, USA, revealed a highly distinct subset of sites characterized by a combination of taxa having an affinity for cold water and sensitivity to environmental disturbance. Bayesian Network (BN) modeling revealed that several environmental variables, notably water temperature, percent forest cover, and drainage area predict membership in this subset. More generally across all streams, macroinvertebrate assemblages signaled ecological status along a stressor gradient defined by habitat quality and intensity of land uses. Collectively, these results suggest a hierarchical administrative framework wherein stream habitat quality, as measured by summary habitat index scores, can screen and assign protections to waters generally expected to support assemblages consistent with good ecological status. Forest cover and water temperature can serve as an additional screen to assign higher levels of protection consistentwith higher ecological status. In cases where levels of protection based on screening are questioned or likely to be contentious, assessment of the macroinvertebrate assemblage can demonstrate the appropriate level.

AB  - We evaluate two 10-year-old mitigation bank wetlands in central Ohio, one created and one with restored and enhanced components, by analysis of vegetation characteristics and by comparison of the year-10 vegetation and macroinvertebrate communities with reference wetlands. To assess different measures of wetland development, we compare the prevalence of native hydrophytes with an index of floristic quality and we evaluate the predictability of these parameters in year 10, given 5 years of data. Results show that the mitigation wetlands in this study meet vegetation performance criteria of native hydrophyte establishment by year 5 and maintain these characteristics through year 10. Species richness and floristic quality, as well as vegetative similarity with reference wetlands, differ among mitigation wetlands in year 1 and also in their rate of change during the first 10 years. The prevalence of native hydrophytes is reasonably predictable by year 10, but 5 years of monitoring is not sufficient to predict future trends of floristic quality in either the created or restored wetland. By year 10, macroinvertebrate taxa richness does not statistically differ among these wetlands, but mitigation wetlands differ from reference sites by tolerance index and by trophic guild dominance. The created wetland herbivore biomass is significantly smaller than its reference, whereas detritivore biomass is significantly greater in the created wetland and smaller in the restored wetland as compared with respective reference wetlands. These analyses illustrate differences in measures of wetland performance and contrast the monitoring duration necessary for legal compliance with the duration required for development of more complex indicators of ecosystem integrity.

AB  - The ejaculate in bulls and boars is heterogeneous in nature, with not all spermatozoa having all attributes needed for fertilization (morphology, motility, membrane integrity, etc) or the ability to undergo capacitation and capacitation-primed modifications, required for fertilization and triggering of early embryo development. Among spermatozoa in the female sperm reservoir, being an aliquot of the ejaculate, such heterogeneity also exists, although at a lesser magnitude and mainly related to the latter abilities. A multitude of methods have been designed during the last decades to measure, and even predict, male fertility in the laboratory, aiming to cut down on the costs and time needed for achieving fertility through the AT of hundreds or thousands of females. When measuring single sperm or semen attributes, those parameters found as most relevant (and related to some extent to fertility) are the patterns of sperm motility, the composition of the seminal plasma (SP), membrane and acrosome integrity, the grade of chromatin stability and the frequency of non-capacitated spermatozoa present. Functional assays yield the most promising results for their relation to semen or male fertility, as the ability of spermatozoa to bind the ZP, to undergo ZP-penetration and to fertilize in vitro (IVF). However, given the complex character of male fertility, it seems imperative to first screen AT sires for fertility markers (as fertility-associated SP-proteins) followed by testing most sperm attributes relevant for fertilization and embryo development not only in individual spermatozoa but within a large cell population, perhaps separated from the sample - a task yet proven rather difficult, yet challenging.

AB  - The paper addresses problems arising from effects of natural environmental factors on toxicity of pollutants to organisms. Most studies on interactions between toxicants and natural factors, including those completed in the EU project NoMiracle (Novel Methods for Integrated Risk Assessment of Cumulative Stressors in Europe) described herein, showed that effects of toxic chemicals on organisms can differ vastly depending purely on external conditions. We compiled data from 61 studies on effects of temperature, moisture and dissolved oxygen on toxicity of a range of chemicals representing pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, plant protection products of bacterial origin and trace metals. In 62.3% cases significant interactions (p <= 0.05 or less) between natural factors and chemicals were found, reaching 100% for the effect of dissolved oxygen on toxicity of waterborne chemicals. The meta-analysis of the 61 studies showed that the null hypothesis assuming no interactions between toxic chemicals and natural environmental factors should be rejected at p = 2.7 x 10(-82) (truncated product method probability). In a few cases of more complex experimental designs, also second-order interactions were found, indicating that natural factors can modify interactions among chemicals. Such data emphasize the necessity of including information on natural factors and their variation in time and across geographic regions in ecological risk assessment. This can be done only if appropriate ecotoxicological test designs are used, in which test organisms are exposed to toxicants at a range of environmental conditions. We advocate designing such tests for the second-tier ecological risk assessment procedures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simulating ecological indicator responses to alternate restoration strategies provides decision support tools for resource managers and restoration planners. Our case study provides a methodology for how to utilize hydrologic suitability for native vegetation to evaluate effects of modeled restoration scenarios. We propose that hydrologic suitability of white water lily. Nymphaea odorata, an indicator species of the native Florida Everglades slough vegetation community, be used to evaluate modeled restoration scenarios in the Everglades ridge and slough landscape. Based on experimentally derived mesocosm and field studies and historical evidence, we developed a predictive performance measure to assess hydrologic suitability for N. odorata. We applied the performance measure to predict the hydrologic suitability for slough vegetation in the Everglades ridge and slough landscape using model-simulated hydrology of existing conditions, future conditions with restoration, and the predrainage Everglades. Our results indicate that Everglades restoration will provide the greatest benefits to native slough vegetation in Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife National Refuge (LNWR), Water Conservation Area (WCA) 3B, and Everglades National Park, and may degrade slough conditions within portions of WCA 2 and WCA 3A. Our analysis indicates that additional restoration efforts are needed to fully restore native slough vegetation communities throughout the Everglades ridge and slough landscape. Performance measure results for the predrainage scenario in the WCAs conflict with paleoecological data; these results indicate a need to improve the modeled predrainage topography as well as flow and evapotranspiration rates of the Natural System Model version 4.6.2 (hereinafter NSM).

T2  - FORSTWISSENSCHAFTLICHES CENTRALBLATT

AB  - Structural changes in plant populations and phytocoenoses permit statements about environmental impacts (passive biomonitoring), and thusly also about changes in ground vegetation caused by air pollution. Besides experimental tolerance tests by means of fumigation and field experiments under controlled trial conditions, geobotanic studies including indicator value analyses are well suited to ascertain stress caused by atmospheric deposition. As for the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge), it is demonstrated that the comparison of historical and recent conditions of the vegetation on identical trial plots allows for inferrences to be made in regard to site changes which are attributed to air pollution. Best results are obtained from investigations in nearly natural forest communities stocking on sites of different nutrient supply (Tilio-Acerion, Galio odorati-Fagion, Luzulo-Fagion).
   In contrast to comparable studies conducted in other regions of Germany for which mainly nitrogen input (eutrophication) has been identified on the basis of indicator values, in the eastern parts of the Ore Mountains after a period of 35 years highly significantly dropped values of soil reaction were found in addition to a drastic decline in the number of species (c2. 50 %). This indicates topsoil acidification, underlining the 'special position' of the Ore Mountains as a 'classical fume damage region'', with the forest damage being primarily caused by atmospheric deposition of SO2. Even the buffering capacity of soils having a good nutrient supply seems to be overstrained. Bioindication of this kind proved to be less suitable for woodland and forest ecosystems comprised of a herb layer poor in species, such as in spruce and pine forests on potential deciduous woodlands (Tharandt Forest) and under extreme site conditions as found in ombrominerotrophic crest site bogs and their environment (central part of the Ore Mountains). Nevertheless, statements of trend are possible provided they undergo cautious interpretation.

AB  - The recognition of the high value of mangrove forests and the wide array of ecosystem services they provide has motivated investment in worldwide restoration efforts. However, current metrics of functional restoration (other than seedling survival rates and plant community composition) are often not readily available for local community managers, highlighting an urgency to identify easy-to-measure indicators to assess the functionality of restored mangroves. The macrozoobenthic community could be such practical indicator, as macrozoobenthic communities are sensitive to changes in their environment, and can be easily surveyed within local managing programs. Focusing on three main mangrove management conditions (natural, planted, and naturally regenerated) in North Sumatra and the province of Aceh, Indonesia, we compared vegetation and macrozoobenthic community diversity indices and identified environmental variables that best describe the forest management conditions and their associated macrozoobenthic community assemblage. Results showed that community assemblage, rather than macrozoobenthic diversity index, was associated with management conditions. The highest dissimilarity in macrozoobenthic community assemblages occurred between planted versus natural mangroves, with nonsignificant dissimilarity between natural and naturally regenerated mangroves. The Lined Nerite gastropod (Nerita balteata) was identified as an indicator of natural mangroves, and the invasive Giant African snail (Achatina fulica) was abundant in mangrove plantations, but also in natural mangroves bordering harbors, oil palm plantations, and aquaculture ponds, suggesting associated anthropogenic pressures. This study showed that the macrozoobenthic community can be used as restoration indicator and could serve as a baseline to empower monitoring activities and community-based adaptive management practices to improve the outcomes of restoration efforts.

AB  - Chironomid larvae are used as indicators of environmental changes in neolimnological and paleolimnological research. In the present study, we evaluated the responses of epiphytic chironomids to changes in environmental conditions over a long time scale. We intended to decipher whether changes in the trophic status of a lake (hypertrophic-eutrophic) would affect the taxonomic structure of epiphytic chironomids by influencing their food availability (structure of periphytic algae) and whether the responses of chironomids are taxa specific. In a shallow hypertrophic lake ecosystem, epiphytic chironomids associated with the emergent macrophyte Phragmites australis were studied from 2001 to 2018. In the autumn of 2006, emergent macrophyte removal led to an improved water transparency and reduced phytoplankton biomass. Epiphytic chironomids responded clearly to the shift from hypertrophic to eutrophic conditions. Under hypertrophic conditions larvae of detritivorous Cricotopus sp. (gr. sylvestris) and filter-feeder larvae of Glyptotendipes sp. prevailed. After macrophyte removal, we observed high relative abundances of Endochironomus albipennis and Paratanytarsus austriacus, which are classified as grazers, utilise periphytic algae (mainly diatoms) as a food source. The results indicated that the density of P. australis, relative abundances of cyanobacteria and diatoms in periphyton communities, Secchi disc depth, and periphytic and planktonic Chl-a are significant determinants of the diversity of epiphytic chironomids. The results can provide a reliable reference to the neolimnological and paleominological studies on chironomid responses to multiple environmental stressors in shallow lakes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a species of primary importance for commercial inland fisheries of Anatolia, where it is native to some areas but has become almost ubiquitous due to historical translocations. Yet, there are concerns that this 'semi-naturalised' species can ultimately pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems, especially when present at high biomass levels. For estimating the latter, knowledge of length-weight relationship (WLR) and condition factor (K) parameters is needed, and these also represent useful indicators of fish population dynamics in general. In this study, WLR and K parameter values from published literature data were comprehensively reviewed for 68 and 75 common carp stocks, respectively, from 52 water bodies across Anatolia, which were surveyed between 1953 and 2011. Overall, Anatolian common carp stocks were characterised by slightly negative allometric growth, which became more pronounced in some over-exploited stocks and/or under critical conditions of pollution and water quality. This tendency to negative allometric growth was unlike other stocks world-wide, which showed isometric growth. Also, no altitudinal gradients were detected in the parameters under study and only slight differences amongst waterbody types (i.e. man-made lakes, natural reservoirs and water courses) were revealed (possibly a result of biassed sampling). It is argued that the level of nativeness present in Anatolian common carp stocks may be responsible for the observed patterns and differences relative to domesticated/feral common carp stocks introduced to non-native areas world-wide. This finding should be accounted for when evaluating ecological benefits vs economic losses of intervention measures for control.

AB  - Patagonian meadows are key for the development and sustainability of rural environments. However, they have been degraded due to a combination of weather conditions and overgrazing. Total soil organic carbon (TOC) has been found as a moderate indicator of meadow soil degradation by long-term heavy grazing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the particulate organic carbon (POC) (a more labile fraction of the soil organic matter) as an ecological indicator for assessing soil changes in natural Patagonian meadows, related to different long-term grazing managements. We worked in three locations along a precipitation gradient in Northern Patagonia. Each location has wet and mesic meadows with good and poor grassland condition, attributed to two long-term grazing pressures (light and heavy). We sampled soil throughout the plant-growing season following the natural soil moisture fluctuations, and quantified the POC content, the POC:TOC ratio, and the F-> 53 proportion. Along the different sampling dates, significant differences between good versus poor grassland condition were found in many cases in POC, a few in POC:TOC ratio, and none in F-> 53 proportion. The POC varies over time, in association with changes in the soil moisture (adjusted R-2 vary between 0.76 and 0.99); therefore, the sampling date must be standardized (we recommend dry periods). The POC appears to be a sensitive indicator when assessing the effect of different soil management practices on soil quality, an important step for meadow conservation, restoration and sustainable use, but further research is needed to validate this exploratory study.

AB  - The environmental flow is a management tool to mitigate the impact of a dam on ecosystems. The Ecuadorian law requires that the environmental flow remains 10% of mean annual flow in old hydroelectric stations, however advances on this area suggest this is not adequate. The objective of this research was to assess the impacts of a 10% release and establish environmental flow recommendations in the Machangara and Chulco rivers which have been dammed by the Chanlud and El Labrado hydroelectric plants, in the watershed of the Machangara River (southern Ecuador). During twelve months physical and chemical parameters, and aquatic macro-invertebrates were recorded. The analysis found significant differences in some parameters, indicating a decline in ecosystem condition and relations were found between the flow, the diversity of macro-invertebrates and the concentration of dissolved 02 (DO). However, determining whether these impacts are unacceptable is difficult because Ecuador does not have established criteria for required ecological condition. This deterioration in ecological conditions can be minimized by applying more modern methods of environmental flow assessment such as the basic flow methodology (BFM) that allows the variability of the river flow. In the Machangara River (3000-4000 m a.s.l.) an environmental flow of 27-51% of the mean annual flow for the rainy season and 29-42% in the dry season were determined by using BFM. Whereas for the Chulco River (3000-4000 m a.s.l.) the environmental flow was 15-45% of the mean annual flow for the rainy season and 15-36% for the dry season.

AB  - Urbanization is dramatically altering biodiversity and ecosystem health worldwide. Birds are highly reactive to environmental change and are thus important indicators of ecological condition at both a global and a local scale. Flight initiation distance (FID) is generally used as a quantitative measure of a bird's tolerance to human-caused disturbance and may indicate how well a species or population has become adapted to chronic environmental stress. Here, we address the following questions, looking at species-specific FID values in different habitats along the urban-rural gradient: (a) Are within-species FID values generally lower in strongly urbanized areas than in more rural areas? And if so, (b) does variation of FID (VFID) indicate species-specific tolerance to urbanization? From 2008 to 2009, we measured FID in coastal bird species at eight sites along the urbanized coast of Xiamen, China, in a total of 254 trials. The results indicate that bird species with a high propensity to disperse and with large population sizes tend to decrease their FID more strongly along the urban-rural habitat gradient. This pattern was most apparent in the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta). Based on VFID, 17 bird species out of 36 were classified as being tolerant to urban environmental conditions, with FID values showing decreasing trends along the urban-rural gradient, as in the Little Egret.

AB  - The article substantiates the basic point of the artistic activity of man - the unity of the meaningfulness of things and the substantiation of meaning, the combination of the activity of cognition and the activity of realization. The philosophical and cultural concept of P. Florensky is considered about the threefold nature of human activity, in which musical instruments occupy a special place as instruments of creative activity possessing the integrity of reality and meaning, preserving unity with mysterially, sacral-archaic and religious thinking. It is in artistic creativity that the practical side - the embodiment by the mind of one's ideas - of the theoretical side - the comprehension of activity - is combined, this connection indicates the integrity of the person's consciousness, and the organic articulation of his activities. The highest sphere is defined by Feurg - the art of the God-doing, penetrating all kinds of human activity and developing from the cult, and culture-making is determined by the ideal basis of human thinking. Ideal-creative aspirations in mental operations that form the semantic essence of human activity which Florensky explains by the rootedness in religious consciousness are considered. "Meditative instrumentalism" religious in its basis of thinking, V. Medushevsky calls "syncresis", indicating a fundamentally new stage of this kind of thinking in relation to the pre-civilization syncretism of the laundry-thinking-behavior-ritual-words. The approach to the problematics of thinking from the "musikiystvo" of Antiquity makes it possible to assert that music makes the higher cosmic expediency of the world structure tangible in sounds, embodied in a monochord-canon where an infinite series of numerical proportions organizes the division of an oscillating string. The mind as Pythagorean numerical mysticism and Socratic "maevtika", "generation of thought", contain in this concept logical-intellectual indicators and extralogical components. Accordingly, the phenomena of "scientific knowledge" and what was later called artistic activity, from Antiquity and up to the Renaissance, formed "interpenetration of qualities", which in itself marked the unity of the logical, intellectual and extra-logical principles. It is emphasized that music from ancient times was intended to distinguish from the context of everyday life certain special, selected situations that have a surplus meaning. These situations led people out of the visible world and, as it were, switched to the invisible world, but for him more significant, because he controlled the visible, stood behind him. There was a mythological consciousness, which included a considerable part of the unconscious. Such situations were the magic cult, the ritual associated with them, the dance, the sound of instruments, singing. In such surplus situations, the integrity of reality and meaning is possessed by both "mythologized" thinking and sounding tools - instruments.

AB  - Deviations in bilateral symmetry or fluctuating asymmetry of an organism may result under environmental stressors that reduce developmental homeostasis and stability. Anthropogenic stressors such as increased urbanization can negatively impact environmental quality of aquatic ecosystems. Researchers have stressed the value in finding easy, accurate and inexpensive methods for assessing potential stress within ecosystems. Here we use fluctuating asymmetry (FA) as a useful quantitative tool in assessing the environmental quality and potential urban-based stressors within eight creeks of the Bull and Upatoi Creeks Watershed within the larger watershed of the Middle Chattahoochee. Using Geographic Information System (GIS), we characterize land-use patterns and a decreasing urbanization gradient as related to each creek's eastward position from Columbus, Georgia. We collected two common fishes (redbreast sunfish; Lepomis auritus and bluegill; Lepomis macrochirus), measured both metric and meristic traits and investigated if the degree of FA in these two common fishes correlated with the urbanization gradient across creeks. We found significant differences in FA among creeks with one of the highest FA measures for the most urban creek. Principal component analysis (PCA) scores of urbanization and water chemistry were regressed against FA scores. We found no significant relationship between urbanization and FA nor environmental water chemistry and FA among creeks. We comment on the use of FA as a potential response variable and biological indicator of environmental stress within this watershed.

AB  - Fish community metrics have been extensively investigated as indicators of fishing effects for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) in temperate systems. Little similar work has been performed in the coral reefs of the Caribbean, where simple indicators are urgently needed. Here, we use 415 coral reef surveys throughout the Caribbean to assess the potential of four simple and intuitive fish community metrics, namely, fish biomass, fish density, average fish weight and species richness, to separate fishing effects from those of other environmental factors at both local (tens of kilometres) and broad (hundreds to thousands of kilometres) spatial scales. We found that these fish metrics differed considerably in environmental correlates and the spatial scales underlying fish metric-environment associations. Average fish weight and fish biomass were most sensitive to fishing indices at both spatial scales, although average fish weight responded more sensitively and specifically to fishing than fish biomass. Fish density and species richness were most sensitive to temperature over broad scales and to macroalgae and relief height over local ones. All fish metrics were negatively correlated with macroalgae over broad scales, supporting the utility of macroalgae to inform about the integrity of entire reef ecosystems. Most of the fish metric variance associated with fishing pressure operated over broad scales, highlighting the need for a Caribbean-wide view of fish community status to establish local management objectives and avoid shifting baselines. Our study clarifies the utility of simple fish community metrics as indicators of fishing effects for EBFM in the Caribbean.

AB  - Invasive species research has traditionally focused on the ecological aspects of invasions and their threats to biodiversity. Few studies have incorporated social dimensions of invasive alien species (IAS) management. In this study, we surveyed visitors (N = 1166) to Cumberland Island National Seashore, GA, USA, to measure their knowledge of, attitudes toward, and preferences for various IAS management options. Multinomial logistic regression, two-step cluster analysis, and the Potential for Conflict Index were used to determine factors that predict support for IAS control, identify subgroups of visitors with unique management preferences, and evaluate the level of consensus among these distinct groups. Results showed that, although knowledge and perceived threat scores were related to management preferences, environmental attitude orientations were the best indicators of support for IAS control. Absolute ecocentric visitors (typically younger, less educated individuals with less experience in parks) believed that all living things have a right to coexist without disruption and favored a hands-off management approach. Adaptive ecocentric visitors (typically older, more educated individuals with more experience in parks) believed that some degree of human interference is necessary to maintain ecosystem integrity and favored hands-on management. Despite these different perspectives, adaptive on-site control of invasive species was viewed as the most acceptable and least controversial management option across all visitor subgroups. This study may inform IAS management practices by providing a framework for identifying stakeholder characteristics and synthesizing public preferences to minimize conflict and highlight ecologically beneficial and socially acceptable outcomes.

AB  - The biomass-size spectrum, at ecological scaling of zooplankton community in a fluctuating basin of Emporda Wetlands was analysed by adjustment to a model based on the Pareto distribution. Different shapes of spectra have been related to the availability of resources. Under flooding conditions biomass-size spectra fit better a linear model (Pareto Type 1), whereas in confinement conditions curved shape biomass-size spectra (Pareto Type 11) were more frequent. Results suggest that under flooding conditions competitive and predatory interactions are low and size distributions reflect mainly population growth, especially of small-size organisms. The result is a linear spectrum. On the other hand, during confinement conditions interactions between species would acquire more relevance due to the lack of resources, favouring the displacement of biomass toward larger sizes. The result is a curved spectrum and a decrease of diversity. Thereby, the shape of the biomass-size spectrum is an indicator of the degree of ecological interactions within the zooplankton functional group.

AB  - Biotic communities are increasingly used to assess and monitor aquatic ecosystems with two fundamentally contrasting approaches: (i) responses sensitive to, and indicative of specific stressors; and (ii) general measures of community change. For assessment of lacustrine macrophyte communities, we compared three trophy-related and one water level fluctuation-related stressor-specific indices (SSIs) with three general measures of taxonomic composition (MTC), using data from 48 reference, 33 eutrophicated and 24 water level regulated boreal lakes. Our hypothesis was that MTCs would yield robust ecological quality estimates across these differing stress-gradients, while the SSIs would only react to the specific pressures they are calibrated against. Judged by the criteria of accuracy, precision and sensitivity, most trophy-specific SSIs performed well with respect to eutrophication and even showed some sensitivity to regulation, whereas the water-level fluctuation index reacted only to heavy regulation amplitude. Metric performance was not significantly affected by inclusion or exclusion of emergent taxa or by the use of abundance instead of occurrence alone. As expected, MTCs responded to both eutrophication and regulation and the best performing MTC - incorporating both taxa loss and gain - indicated impairment almost as often as any one (minimum) of the SSIs. We argue that non-stressor-specific MTCs - with the demonstrated unifying response of biotic community to different stressors - should primarily be used in the assessment of changes in the status of aquatic biota, whereas using SSIs a posteriori might help in identifying the likely causes of these changes.

AB  - The seed rain (SR) is characterized by the arrival of propagules to the soil, caused by dispersion mechanisms and is essential to the natural regeneration dynamics of forests. The objective was to evaluate SR as an indicator of three restoration areas in the municipalities of Mato Grosso do Sul state, Ivinhema 12 years (IV-12), Jatef 13 years (JA-13) e Caarapo 16 years of planting (CA-16). Fifteen 0.64 m(2) collectors were randomly installed in each area and the material collected monthly from May 2015 to January 2016. The Shannon index (H') and Pielou Equability (J') were calculated and the seeds classified as dispersion syndrome, habit and successional class of tree species seeds. A total of 47,124 propagules were identified. For CA-16, 27.033 seeds, 29 families, 39 genera and 41 species were sampled. The JA-13 obtained 8,056 seeds, 22 families, 32 genera and 33 species. The area IV-12 resulted in 12,035 seeds, 13 families, 21 genera and 22 species. From the 61 species found, 88.5% are arboreal. Referring to the dispersion syndrome, most are zoochoric, with emphasis on IV-12 with 93.7%, being 40.9% allochthonous and from animals. Concerning to the successional class, the pioneers were prominent, mainly for the IV-12 (91.7%). The SR can be considered a good indicator for assessing the environmental integrity of areas in restoration by providing subsidies for understanding the maintenance of ecological processes, since in the evaluated areas, most of the seeds were zoochoric species, with expressive contribution of allochthonous species, demonstrating the existence of a dispersal fauna facilitating the forest succession.

AB  - Extensive water development in large rivers has precipitated many negative ecological effects on native fish populations. Mitigation for such development often focuses on restoring biological integrity through remediation of the physical and chemical properties of regulated rivers. However, evaluating and defining the success of those programs can be difficult. We modeled the influence of mitigation-related environmental factors on growth and recruitment of two ecologically important native fish species (Largescale Sucker Catostomus macrocheilus and Mountain Whitefish Prosopium williamsoni) in the Kootenai River, Idaho. Artificial nutrient (phosphorus) addition best predicted the variability in annual growth of both species. Nutrient addition was positively related to Largescale Sucker growth but negatively related to Mountain Whitefish growth. The best model explained 82% of the annual variability in incremental growth for Largescale Suckers and 61% of the annual variability for Mountain Whitefish. Year-class strength of Largescale Suckers was not closely related to any of the environmental variables evaluated; however, yearclass strength of Mountain Whitefish was closely associated with nutrient addition, discharge, and temperature. Most research has focused on biotic assemblages to evaluate the effects of mitigation activities on fishes, but there is an increased need to identify the influence of rehabilitation activities on fish population dynamics within those assemblages. Here, we demonstrate how fish growth can serve as an indicator of rehabilitation success in a highly regulated large river. Future fish restoration projects can likely benefit from a change in scope and from consideration of an evaluation framework involving the response of population rate functions to mitigation.

AB  - Multimetric Fish Community Indices (FCI) were recently developed for assessing the ecological condition of shallow nearshore and deeper offshore waters of the Swan-Canning Estuary, Western Australia. The provisional system for classifying estuarine condition from FCI scores, which divided the possible range of scores (0-100) into four descriptive classes of equal breadth (good, fair, poor, very poor), was shown to be skewed towards producing fair to good grades. An alternative, alphanumeric (A-E) grading system, whose grade boundaries were defined by quantiles of the distribution of historical FCI scores, exhibited greater apparent sensitivity to decreases in ecological condition resulting from a harmful algal bloom than did the provisional classification scheme. These advantages of the quantile-based FCIs have led to their recent implementation as a monitoring and reporting tool by the primary environmental managers of the Swan-Canning Estuary, and their application to other permanently open systems across Western Australia is currently being evaluated.

AB  - Preference divergence is thought to contribute to reproductive isolation. Ecology can alter the way selection acts on female preferences, making them most likely to diverge when ecological conditions vary among populations. We present a novel mechanism for ecologically dependent sexual selection, termed 'the ecological stage' to highlight its ecological dependence. Our hypothesized mechanism emphasizes that males and females interact over mating in a specific ecological context, and different ecological conditions change the costs and benefits of mating interactions, selecting for different preferences in distinct environments and different male traits, especially when traits are condition dependent. We test key predictions of this mechanism in a sympatric three-spine stickleback species pair. We used a maternal half-sib split-clutch design for both species, mating females to attractive and unattractive males and raising progeny on alternate diets that mimic the specialized diets of the species in nature. We estimated the benefits of mate choice for an indicator trait (male nuptial colour) by measuring many fitness components across the lifetimes of both sons and daughters from these crosses. We analysed fitness data using a combination of aster and mixed models. We found that many benefits of mating with high-colour males depended on both species and diet. These results support the ecological stage hypothesis for sticklebacks. Finally, we discuss the potential role of this mechanism for other taxa and highlight its ability to enhance reproductive isolation as speciation proceeds, thus facilitating the evolution of strong reproductive isolation. This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers'.

AB  - Trees are often grown alongside roads in urban areas for their aesthetic and ecological values but are exposed to an array of natural and man-made stresses that impact on their overall health. The aim of this study was to determine the health of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees growing in urban forests alongside the Vilnius-Kaunas-Klaipeda highway in Lithuania. Long-term monitoring was conducted between 1998 and 2014, when health indicators were evaluated in 714 trees at different distances from the highway. The decrease of crown defoliation, amount of dead branches and foliage discolouration at all distances from the roadbed was detected. The results showed that trees furthest (450-500 m) from the roadbed were in better health than those growing close to the highway, exhibiting lowest crown defoliation (25.8 +/- 1.6% in 1998, 12.3 +/- 1.6% in 2014) compared with trees growing close to highway (47.2 +/- 1.6% in 1998; 25.1 +/- 1.7% in 2014), lowest foliage discolouration (14.8 +/- 1.2% in 1998, 9.8 +/- 0.8% in 2014), a lower amount of dead branches (14.8% +/- 1.2% in 1998, 9.8% +/- 0.8% in 2014) and a longer needle retention (3.2 +/- 0.03 years in 2014 comparing with to 1.9 +/- 0.02 close to the highway). The condition of the tree tops was good throughout the study period, with 77% of assessed trees being healthy. Statistically significant improvement in tree health was observed between 1998 and 2014, indicating an improvement in the overall health of the environment. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental challenges are as vast as the universe, allowing for numerous studies on their various dimensions. Using 17 data sets from Asia-Pacific countries between 2000 and 2017, this study attempted to investigate the economic factors influencing the ecological footprint of the fishing sector. The primary contribution of this study is to examine the effects of nine economic freedom indicators, as well as other control variables, on the status of fishery resources due to environmental pressure. The findings confirm the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis in the fishing grounds footprint, indicating that GDP per capita growth has a positive and significant effect, even though its squared form coefficient is negative. Other control variables, including natural resource rents, urbanization, and energy intensity, do not significantly affect the fishing footprint. The different components of economic freedom show different effects, while their cumulative effects in the form of the total economic freedom index positively affect the footprint of fishing and lead to increased extraction from fishing resources. The results show that the government integrity, tax burden, business freedom, and monetary freedom indices increase the fishing footprint. In contrast, indices of trade freedom and investment freedom, by highlighting the adverse effects of fishing on the environment, help countries reduce pressure on their aquatic resources. The findings of this study highlight the importance of examining how various dimensions of economic freedom affect the ability to manage fishery resources effectively.

AB  - For social and economic development in China, the rivers are regulated, but its impact on river ecosystem has not evaluated yet. Maintaining a trade-off between social protection and ecological protection of the rivers is very crucial for a country where competition for water is severe. Thus, the main focus of this study is to carry out a comprehensive assessment of river health in relation to water resources management. In this paper, Guijiang, Nenjiang, and lower Yellow-three regulated river's health statuses were drawn on the river-section scale using Fuzzy Matter Element (FME), Harmony Degree Evaluation (HDE), and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) methods. The results indicated that the alteration of flow dynamics affected the 'hydrology' and 'water ecology' attributes of the rivers for which the River Health Index (RHI) of upstream sections of Nenjiang River was poor and downstream sections of lower Yellow River was critical respectively and the overall health statuses of the three rivers in that order, were good, fair to good, and fair. Particularly, Xiaolandi reservoir regulation at lower Yellow River impaired the habitat of benthic macroinvertebrate population that made the ecosystem health critical. We compared the evaluation methods and the results of FME and HDE were found consistent while GRA produced some discrepancies in the outcome. Finally, we proposed a framework for river health assessment for interpretation and communication of results to the managerial level. Our findings suggest that the water resources management of these regulated rivers should be rationalized and special care should be taken for 'water ecology' health restoration of the lower Yellow River.

AB  - Fjords are sensitive areas affected by climate change and can act as a natural laboratory to study microbial ecological processes. The Chilean Patagonian fjords (41-56 degrees S), belonging to the Subantarctic ecosystem (46-60 degrees S), make up one of the world's largest fjord systems. In this region, Estuarine Water (EW) strongly influences oceanographic conditions, generating sharp gradients of oxygen, salinity and nutrients, the effects of which on the microbial community structure are poorly understood. During the spring of 2017 we studied the ecological patterns (dispersal and oceanographic factors) underlying the microbial community distribution in a linear span of 450 km along the estuarine-influenced Chilean Patagonian fjords. Our results show that widespread microbial dispersion existed along the fjords where bacterioplankton exhibited dependence on the eukaryotic phytoplankton community composition. This dependence was particularly observed under the low chlorophyll-a conditions of the Baker Channel area, in which a significant relationship was revealed between SAR11 Clade III and the eukaryotic families Pyrenomonadaceae (Cryptophyte) and Coccomyxaceae (Chlorophyta). Furthermore, dissolved oxygen and salinity were revealed as the main drivers influencing the surface marine microbial communities in these fjords. A strong salinity gradient resulted in the segregation of the Baker Channel prokaryotic communities from the rest of the Patagonian fjords. Likewise, Microbacteriaceae, Burkholderiaceae and SAR11 Clade III, commonly found in freshwater, were strongly associated with EW conditions in these fjords. The direct effect of EW on the microbial community structure and diversity of the fjords exemplifies the significance that climate change and, in particular, deglaciation have on this marine region and its productivity.

AB  - Ecological impairment is prevalent in built environment and habitat enrichment had begun in cities globally. Most commendable ecological landscaping initiatives are, however, centred around developed countries in temperate region. Thus the systemic approaches may be inept to capture and reflect the natural processes in tropical regions. This paper describes a novel attempt to address the deficiency by developing and testing the idea of using birds as a proxy to drive ecological landscaping in tropical cities. A range of a priori avifauna metrics were applied to measure the biophysical complexity of six exemplar strata in inner and periphery areas of Ipoh city, Malaysia. Data collected were analysed and the metrics were able to reflect biophysical complexity in each stratum, statistically. Additionally, a numerical rating index from "impaired" (0) to "excellent" (100) was also inferred from two reference strata, or "best performers", to provide urban landscape planners with a standardized comparative measure. Numerous intricacies emerging from the "best performers" are highlighted to inform ecological landscape planning and biomimicry design. The implications to the public, policymakers and other stakeholders are also succinctly discussed. The key strength of the system, known as the Avifauna-based Biophysical Index (ABI), is it fosters learning from nature. The system is open to the views of the local stakeholders and sensitive to the realities given that the benchmarks consider regional ecological and anthropogenic variability. The principles of the ABI system are universal since it does not advocate a "one size fits all" resolution. Hence, although the proof of concept was demonstrated in Ipoh, the ABI system is applicable to tropical cities elsewhere.

AB  - A comprehensive ecosystem research strategy was developed and initiated for the Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor (BB-LEH) estuary in New Jersey, United States. This multiyear program (2011-15) examined several environmental management issues and questions involving concerns with water quality (e.g., nutrients) and the health of this ecosystem (e.g., eutrophication). Multiple projects ranging from the assessment of phytoplankton to fish to wetlands, as well as hydrodynamic/water quality and ecosystem modeling, were conducted each year to fill in critical data gaps and to define the bay's baseline condition for future comparisons (e.g., a nuclear generating station on the bay with a once-through cooling system will close in 2019). Issues of concern for environmental agencies and the public include nuisance jellyfish; excess nutrients; benefits of conservation zones; and the status of fish, crab, and shellfish populations. Three projects examined the potential for developing biological indicators of nutrient (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) effects. Three other projects studied the unique habitat features (i.e. salt marshes, sedge islands, submerged aquatic vegetation beds) in BB-LEH that may need protection and/or restoration. Ecosystem baseline conditions were examined by six projects, and data were used in the Ecopath-Ecosim model to predict potential future changes in the biomass of major biological groups and species using specific scenarios (i.e. closure of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, reducing nutrient inputs and fishery management plans). Noteworthy is the collection of these data pre- and post-Superstorm Sandy, which made landfall a few kilometers south of the estuary in 2012. The subsequent 19 papers in this special issue provide an in-depth examination of these areas of concern, the results of which are exceedingly relevant to the management of this and other estuarine systems.

AB  - Interactions between bacteria and protists are essential to the ecosystem ecology of fens. Until now, however, there has been almost no information on how restoration procedures in carbonate fens affect the functioning of microbial food webs. Changes in vegetation patterns resulting from restoration may take years to be observed, whereas microbial processes display effects even after short-term exposure to changes in environmental conditions caused by restoration. Therefore, microbial processes and patterns can be used as sensitive indicators of changes in environmental conditions. The present study attempts to verify the hypothesis that the species richness and abundance of microbial loop components would differ substantially before and after restoration. The effect of restoration processes on the functioning of the food web was investigated for a 10 years in a carbonate-rich fen, before and after restoration. The restoration procedure (particularly the improvement in hydrological conditions) distinctly modified the taxonomic composition and functioning of microbial food webs. This is reflected in the increased abundance and diversity of testate amoeba, i.e. top predators, within the microbial food web and in the pronounced increase in the abundance of bacteria. This study suggests potential use of microbial loop components as bio-indicators and bio-monitoring tools for hydrological status of fens and concentrations of nutrients. Better understanding of what regulates microbial populations and activity in fens and unravelling of these fundamental mechanisms are particularly critical in order to more accurately predict how fens will respond to global change or anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Stable isotope ratios of soil carbonates are useful indicators to establish ecological and environmental changes. The objective of this study was to provide information about the environmental conditions for the formation of calcic horizon in Shahrekord area, in the central west of Iran. The soil moisture and temperature regimes in the Study area are xeric and mesic, respectively. The delta(13)C and delta(18)O values of pedogenic carbonates and bulk soils were measured in 17 calcic horizons of selected soils derived from calcareous alluvium. In addition, the delta(13)C and delta(18)O values of three parent rock samples and the delta(13)C value of soil organic matter in selected pedons and eight native plants in the region were determined. Results suggest that pedogenic carbonates range from 52 to 96% of total carbonates. Stable isotopic composition of carbonatic pendants shows that the older layers are more depleted in C-13 in comparison with younger precipitates. This is likely due to the fact that the older parts precipitated under somewhat different ecological conditions than those of younger parts. Isotopic composition of organic carbon shows that current vegetation consists of C-3 plants; whereas, the pedogenic carbonate in the soils was formed in conditions with a lower proportion of C-3 plant species. This can be attributed to human induced land degradation and inappropriate land management in the area, which caused rapid changes in the community of plant species. The results show that the stable isotope composition of carbon can be a good indicator for assessing the degree of land degradation.

AB  - The integrity of coral reefs has increasingly been threatened by human development and climate change. As a result, the concept of ecological resilience - an ecosystem's capability to resist and recover from environmental stressors - has become an important aspect of coral reef conservation. In this study, coral reef resilience was quantitatively scored in Kenting National Park (KNP), Taiwan, using four different assessment frameworks: the first uses the opinions of local reef experts, the second includes metrics specific to the local reef context, the third combines the previous two approaches, and the fourth relies solely on ecological metrics from biodiversity surveys. To evaluate the accuracy of each assessment, the resulting resilience scores were compared with historical coral recovery rates, which served as a proxy for resilience. While each approach to measuring resilience has its merits and drawbacks, the picture of resilience became clearest when a few key indicators were included to reflect core ecosystem processes. Trends in resilience scores varied depending on the makeup of the assessment's indicators, and there was little correlation between the baseline metrics measured using different data collection methods. However, all resilience assessment trends indicated that KNP's Nanwan area is high in resilience. This is likely due to the effects of local tidally-induced upwelling, which significantly relieve the growing thermal stress placed on surrounding coral communities. Ultimately, the most successful assessments were those that empirically quantified ecological processes and local factors with only a few indicators, rather than broader approaches that measured many indicators. These findings are particularly relevant for reef managers to consider as they develop and employ resilience-based management strategies.

AB  - Assessing soil hydrological conditions can provide essential information for understanding the environmental processes that affect ecosystem services and, particularly in the context of ongoing climate change. This is key in areas affected by water scarcity such as the Mediterranean belt. Therefore, the main goals of this research are (i) to assess the main rainfall dynamics and trends of some representative hotspots along with southern Spain and (ii) to determine the impact on the soil available water content (AWC) over the last two decades. An analysis of daily precipitation and soil hydrological conditions was combined with soil sampling (543) and laboratory analyses to evaluate the properties related to the soil infiltration and retention capacity. The results show that the organic factors control soil properties and their hydrodynamics in southern Spain. Furthermore, a general declining trend in soil water availability is observed over the last two decades. This is more extreme in arid and semi-arid areas, where there have been several years in the last decade with more than 200 days without the available water content. Moreover, in these areas, heavy rainfall during specific moments of the year is the key factor that manifests a greater incidence in areas with steeper slopes, which in turn, also conditions the biological factors and the hydrodynamics of the soil. In short, in the context of climate change, the analysis of soil hydrological dynamics could be used to identify biodiversity thresholds in the Mediterranean area and even to detect phenological changes in specific plant species.

AB  - The lysosomal-autophagic system appears to be a common target for many environmental pollutants, as lysosomes accumulate many toxic metals and organic xenobiotics, which perturb normal function and damage the lysosomal membrane. In fact, autophagic reactions frequently involving reduced lysosomal membrane integrity or stability appear to be effective generic indicators of cellular well-being in eukaryotes: in social amoebae (slime mold), mollusks and fish, autophagy/membrane destabilization is correlated with many stress and toxicological responses and pathological reactions. Prognostic use of adverse lysosomal and autophagic reactions to environmental pollutants can be used for predicting cellular dysfunction and health in aquatic animals, such as shellfish and fish, which are extensively used as sensitive bioindicators in monitoring ecosystem health; and also represent a significant food resource for at least 20% of the global human population. Explanatory frameworks for prediction of pollutant impact on health have been derived encompassing a conceptual mechanistic model linking lysosomal damage and autophagic dysfunction with injury to cells and tissues. Methods are described for tracking in vivo autophagy of fluorescently labeled cytoplasmic proteins, measuring degradation of radiolabeled intracellular proteins and morphometric measurement of lysosomal/cytoplasmic volume ratio. Additional methods for the determination of lysosomal. membrane stability in lower animals are also described, which can be applied to frozen tissue sections, protozoans and isolated cells in vivo. Experimental and simulated results have also indicated that nutritional deprivation (analogous in marine mussels to caloric restriction)- induced autophagy has a protective function against toxic effects mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, coupled measurement of lysosomal-autophagic reactions and simulation modelling is proposed as a practical toolbox for predicting toxic environmental risk.

AB  - Drought periods can have important impacts on plant productivity and ecosystem functioning, but climatic conditions other than the lack of precipitation during droughts have never been quantified and have therefore not been considered explicitly in both experimental and modeling studies. Here, we identify which climatic characteristics deviate from normal during droughts and how these deviations could affect plant responses. Analysis of 609 years of daily data from nine Western European meteorological stations reveals that droughts in the studied region are consistently associated with more sunshine (+45 %), increased mean (+1.6 degrees C) and maximum (+2.8 degrees C) air temperatures and vapour pressure deficits that were 51% higher than under normal conditions. These deviations from normal increase significantly as droughts progress. Using the process-model ORCHIDEE, we simulated droughts consistent with the results of the dataset analysis and compared water and carbon exchange of three different vegetation types during such natural droughts and droughts in which only the precipitation was affected. The comparison revealed contrasting responses: carbon loss was higher under natural drought in grasslands, while increased carbon uptake was found especially in decidious forests. This difference was attributed to better access to water reserves in forest ecosystems which prevented drought stress. This demonstrates that the warmer and sunnier conditions naturally associated with droughts can either improve growth or aggravate drought-related stress, depending on water reserves. As the impacts of including or excluding climatic parameters that correlate with drought are substantial, we propose that both experimental and modeling efforts should take into account other environmental factors than merely precipitation.

AB  - Conservation decision thresholds have most often been described within the context of triggering management actions necessary to maintain an ecological system within a desired state. Thresholds are also applied within conservation legislation, often as triggers to determine when certain regulations may or may not apply. In many applications, thresholds have been criticized for being subjective, inconsistent and open to bias and rather than being derived from sound and objective analysis of ecological data they can result from undocumented judgement and opinion. Although judgement and opinion may be necessary for setting decision thresholds in circumstances where appropriate data are lacking, a failure to use structured processes for obtaining, analysing and presenting these can result in contentious, unsubstantiated thresholds. This paper demonstrates how thresholds for identifying grassland conservation values, for the purposes of decision making under vegetation clearing legislation, can be estimated from simple floristic indicators after combining the judgment of multiple experts through hierarchical modelling. Using two stages of elicitation and modelling, the resulting conservation value states were found to be consistent and predictable, correlated with known paddock-level disturbance history and congruent with prior condition states that define an endangered grassland ecosystem. While the thresholds, and the underpinning coefficients, may not reflect the opinion of all grassland ecologists, they are transparent, testable and can be updated or modified to incorporate additional criteria and a greater diversity of stakeholders. The approach could be adopted to similar contexts in other vegetation types where policy or regulatory decision triggers are required.

AB  - The French southern marine subregion of the Bay of Biscay presents local environmental features explaining the presence of specific communities in remarkable habitats. The aim of the study is, for the first time, to assess benthic macrofaunal assemblages and to identify indicator species of each assemblage within intertidal boulder field habitats in this marine subregion.
   Mobile boulders were sampled with a stratified random sampling design in upper and lower midlittoral zones in March-June 2015. Sessile (in percentage cover) and mobile macrofauna (in abundance) communities were identified and counted within 0.1 m(2) quadrats. Ecological function and precision between the two groups were found dissimilar thus species richness, abundance, macrofauna distribution and indicator species/taxa of sessile and mobile macrofauna were analyzed separately. 78 species/taxa of macrofauna were recorded. A restricted list of 12 singletons (8 for mobile and 4 for sessile macrofauna) and 33 combinations of species/taxa were identified as significant indicators of each assemblage. Species ecological features (food webs, signs of disturbance, alien species, biogeographical range limit) were also considered as additional selection criteria. Therefore, species with a high ecological interest but not considered statistically as valid indicators were also highlighted.
   Thus, this work constitutes a framework for future monitoring of the Basque intertidal rocky shore and could be used as an alternative to sampling the entire biodiversity. It also meets the MSFD requirements (e.g. take into account marine subregion specificities; integrate the metric "macrofauna" and supports several descriptors as the D1 "Biodiversity" and D6 "Seafloor integrity").

AB  - Lemna minor is often used in environmental risk assessment and it can be supposed that usually evaluated parameters will be reliable even for assessing the risk of pharmaceuticals. Subtle changes in duckweed plant number, biomass production, and leaf area size induced by 10-day-exposure to diclofenac (DCF) and paracetamol (PCT) (0.1, 10, and 100 mu g/L), excepting 100 mu g/L DCF, are in contrast with considerable changes on biochemical and histochemical level. Both drugs caused a decrease in content of photosynthetic pigments (by up to 50%), an increase in non-photochemical quenching (by 65%) and decrease in relative chlorophyll fluorescence decay values (by up to 90% with DCF). Both DCF and especially PCT increased amount of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species in roots. DCF-induced effects included mainly increased lipid peroxidation (by 78%), disturbation in membrane integrity and lowering both oxidoreductase and dehydrogenase activities (by 30%). PCT increased the content of soluble proteins and phenolics. Higher concentrations of both DCF and PCT increased the levels of oxidised ascorbate (by 30%) and oxidised thiols (by up to 84% with DCF). Glutathion-reductase activity was elevated by both pharmaceuticals (nearly by 90%), glutathion-S-transferase activity increased mainly with PCT (by 22%). The early and sensitive indicators of DCF and PCT phytotoxicity stress in duckweed are mainly the changes in biochemical processes, connected with activation of defense mechanisms against oxidative stress.

AB  - Changed land use conditions, especially the intensification of agricultural production, have lead to a significant reduction in species diversity over the past several decades. In order to limit the impact of this reduction, indicators were developed and practical measures put forth which should serve to maintain biological diversity, but generally pay too little attention to different natural area conditions. In this light, an indicator concept for area species diversity on the basis of regional particularities has been developed which is based on a clear delineation of natural areas according to their unique landscape conditions. From the large number of species which appear in one area, a small number of key-species typical to the landscape, for which good ecological information is available, are selected as indicators. These species serve as the current status indicators for each area. With the goal of promoting regionally specific species diversity, the composition of indicators varies from area to area, according to each unique landscape. On the basis of an anticipated population change (target indicators) a comparison was made of habitat requirements and deficits in the existing habitats. In this manner, regionally targeted measures to improve habitats could be derived and implemented. So, the abundance of indicator species can be positively influenced and the regionally characteristic species diversity can thus be promoted. Such a set of indicators can serve as the basis for biodiversity management in completely agricultural landscapes and provide a picture of the total of all the single mosaic landscape units.

AB  - Studies of living foraminiferal assemblages provide much information about their roles in present environments and a perspective on interpreting the past. Along modern coasts, benthic Foraminifera act as ecological indicators in their responses to different natural and anthropogenic conditions, such as food availability, oxygen concentrations, salinity, and trace metal concentrations. A detailed survey of foraminiferal populations was undertaken in the Mission-Aransas National Estuarine Research Reserve, Texas, close to the time of its establishment in 2006. The purpose was to gauge the overall status of populations and provide baseline data for future comparison. The arid south Texas Gulf Coast is a variable and often harsh environment where biota are subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors. Despite these rigors, living Foraminifera were prolific in the Reserve. This paper discusses the results from Mesquite (July 2008), Copano (May 2006), and Mission Bays (June 2006). Populations were robust in each bay, with Ammonia parkinsoniana, Ammotium salsum, and Elphidium excavatum being most abundant. Highest numbers corresponded mainly to areas of greater circulation. In Mission Bay, elemental analysis of shells, prompted by the presence of sulfur grains in sediments and by yellow tests, detected elevated levels of barium, strontium, and iron. Most sediment samples were black and sulfidic, and ubiquitous framboidal pyrite in sediment and shells suggests that forams were frequently subject to low-oxygen conditions. Abundant living numbers, tolerance of low-oxygen conditions, and the ability to cycle trace metals emphasize the resilience of Foraminifera in taxing environments and their integral position as lower trophic level members.

AB  - The use of environmental offsets has increased in many parts of the world over the last decade, but assessments of their effectiveness have been rare. We provide the first quantification of the effectiveness of offsets in an Australian State (Western Australia) with an offsets register and history of offset implementation. We determined what outcomes were achieved and the environmental effectiveness of 208 past and current offsets applied as part of environmental approvals between 2004 and 2015 under State jurisdiction legislation. Of the past offsets, we conclude that at most 39% of the offsets studied delivered an outcome and can be considered effective, with land acquisition comparing favourably to other offset types. The outcomes of many offsets were unknown due to reporting too soon after implementation (14%) and inadequate reporting (18%). Thirty percent of past offsets during this time period were found be ineffective through non- or inadequate implementation. We observed significant improvements in the clarity of offset approval conditions over the time period of our study, nonetheless, we suggest that these results provide evidence of the need for better implementation of on-ground management and research into the nature of offsets. We make four suggestions for improvement: 1) timely reporting and compliance with environmental conditions; 2) ensuring approval conditions measure ecological outcomes; 3) improving project planning for offsets; and 4) including contingency and longer term planning in offset design. Conclusions from examining implementation of offsets in Western Australia are likely to be applicable wherever offsets policies are in place or being developed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Spatio-temporal variability in river flow is a fundamental control on instream habitat structure and riverine ecosystem biodiversity and integrity. However, long-term riverine ecological time-series to test hypotheses about hydrology-ecology interactions in a broader temporal context are rare, and studies spanning multiple rivers are often limited in their temporal coverage to less than five years. To address this research gap. a unique spatio-temporal hydroecological analysis was conducted of long-term instream ecological responses (1990-2000) to river flow regime variability at 83 sites across England and Wales. The results demonstrate clear hydroecological associations at the national scale (all data). In addition. significant differences ill ecological response are recorded between three 'regions' identified (RM 1-3*) associated with characteristics of the flow regime. The effect of two major supra-seasonal droughts (1990-1992 and 1996-1997) on inter-annual (IA) variability of the LIFE scores is evident with both events showing a gradual decline before and recovery of LIFE scores after the low flow period. The instream community response to high magnitude flow regimes (1994 and 1995) is also apparent, although these associations are less striking. The results demonstrate classification of rivers into flow regime regions offers a way to help unravel complex hydroecological associations. The approach adopted herein could easily be adapted for other geographical locations, where datasets are available. Such work is imperative to understand flow regime-ecology interactions in a longer term, wider spatial context and so assess future hydroecological responses to climate change and anthropogenic modification of riverine ecosystems.

TI  - Defining conservation strategies with historical perspectives: a case study from a degraded oak grassland ecosystem
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - DIVERSITY
AB  - The restoration of degraded ecosystems can be constrained by uncertainty over former conditions and the relevance of. the past given recent changes. It can be difficult to differentiate among contrasting hypotheses about past ecosystem function, and restoration efforts can emphasize species reestablishment without integrating the ecological and cultural processes that once determined their occurrence. As a case study, we analyzed historical descriptions of an endangered oak grassland ecosystem in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to determine former conditions and assess their validity for defining restoration targets. Twenty-three documents described this ecosystem from 1790 to 1951. Comparison of early survey records with contemporary occurrences suggests habitat loss of >95%. The identity and former range of most native plant species were poorly described, but accounts of ecosystem structure revealed a diversity of floral communities that has been much simplified. Fire, most likely set by indigenous peoples, interacted with edaphic and topographic factors to create this structural diversity. European settlers intensively modified the ecosystem with grazing, cultivation, and introduced flora. These transformations partly explain the current high levels of plant invasion. Restoration must target the ecosystems' former structural diversity and the ecological and cultural processes that maintained it. Given the recent impacts of fire suppression, habitat loss, and plant invasion, however, land managers must balance the reestablishment of historical processes with their potential negative effects in sites with numerous at-risk species. This ecosystem was, and remains, part of a culturally modified landscape, where human activity has maintained unforested areas for millennia but now promotes mostly exotic flora. Although pre-European conditions cannot be fully restored, the historical data provided restoration insights unobtainable from current biological studies emphasizing the end point of long-term ecological change.

AB  - Despite the importance of assessing beta diversity to understand the effects of human modifications on biological communities, there are almost no studies that properly addressed how beta diversity varies along anthropogenic gradients. We developed an algorithm to calculate beta diversity among a set of sites included in a moving window along any given environmental gradient. This allowed us to assess beta diversity among sites with similar conditions in terms of human modifications (e.g., land use or instream degradation). We investigated beta diversity using stream fish community data and indicators of human modification quantified at four spatial scales (whole catchment, riparian, local, and instream). Variation in beta diversity was dependent on the scale of human modifications (catchment, riparian, local, instream, and all four scales combined) and on the type of diversity considered (taxonomic or functional). We also found evidence for non-linear responses of both taxonomic and functional beta diversity to human-induced environmental alterations. Therefore, the response of beta diversity was more complex than expected, as it depended on the scale used to quantify human impact and exhibited opposite responses depending on the location along the environmental impact gradient and on whether the response was taxonomic or functional diversity. Anthropogenic modifications can introduce unexpected variability among stream communities, which means that low beta diversity may not necessarily indicate a degraded environmental condition and high beta diversity may not always indicate a reference environmental condition. This has implications for how we should consider beta diversity in environmental assessments.

AB  - Studies focusing on the effects of spatial processes versus environmental filtering on aquatic metacommunities have so far been focused almost entirely on relatively isolated systems, such as sets of different lakes or streams. In contrast, metacommunity patterns and underlying processes within a single aquatic system have received less attention. In this study, we aimed to examine how strongly variations in different diversity indices are affected by spatial processes (dispersal) versus local environmental conditions (species sorting) within a large lake system. Modern biodiversity research focuses on multiple diversity facets because different indices may be uncorrelated within and between facets, and they may thus describe different phenomena. We investigated the relationship of littoral macroinvertebrate diversity with environmental and spatial factors using 10 indices of species, functional and taxonomic diversity. Using spatial factors as proxies of dispersal, we decomposed variation in diversity indices into fractions attributable to environmental and spatial factors. Our results highlighted generally equal or higher importance of spatial processes in controlling the variation in diversity indices when compared to local environmental variables. Local environmental conditions accounted for higher proportion of variation only in a single index (i.e. taxonomic diversity). These findings suggest that the effects of high dispersal rates (mass effects) may override the influences of local environmental conditions (species sorting) on the diversity in highly-connected aquatic system, such as large lakes and marine coastal systems. Our results further suggest that biodiversity assessment and environmental monitoring in highly-connected systems cannot rely solely on the idea of environmental control. We hence recommend that the roles of both environmental and spatial processes should be integrated in basic and applied ecological research of aquatic systems.

AB  - Automated driving has made considerable progress recently. The multisensor fusion system is a game changer in making self-driving cars possible. In the near future, multisensor fusion will be necessary to meet the high accuracy needs of automated driving systems. This paper proposes a multisensor fusion design, including an inertial navigation system (INS), a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), to implement 3D simultaneous localization and mapping (INS/GNSS/3D LiDAR-SLAM). The proposed fusion structure enhances the conventional INS/GNSS/odometer by compensating for individual drawbacks such as INS-drift and error-contaminated GNSS. First, a highly integrated INS-aiding LiDAR-SLAM is presented to improve the performance and increase the robustness to adjust to varied environments using the reliable initial values from the INS. Second, the proposed fault detection exclusion (FDE) contributes SLAM to eliminate the failure solutions such as local solution or the divergence of algorithm. Third, the SLAM position velocity acceleration (PVA) model is used to deal with the high dynamic movement. Finally, an integrity assessment benefits the central fusion filter to avoid failure measurements into the update process based on the information from INS-aiding SLAM, which increases the reliability and accuracy. Consequently, our proposed multisensor design can deal with various situations such as long-term GNSS outage, deep urban areas, and highways. The results show that the proposed method can achieve an accuracy of under 1 meter in challenging scenarios, which has the potential to contribute the autonomous system.

AB  - Free-ranging animals are often used as bioindicators of both short- and long-term changes in ecosystem health, mainly to detect the presence and effects of contaminants. Birds, and gulls in particular, have been used as bioindicators over a broad range of marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we standardise the conditions for the use of a suite of biochemical markers in non-destructive matrices of Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus) to facilitate future biomonitoring of marine and terrestrial contaminants. We characterized cholinesterase (ChE) in plasma and optimized assay conditions for ChE activity as a marker of neurotoxic damage. Moreover, we quantified variation in activity of ChE, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) as well as variation ranges of lipid peroxidation (LPO), in free-ranging adults and captive chicks. The main ChE form present in plasma of both adults and chicks was butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) followed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), whose relative proportion in plasma tended to decrease with increased chick age. LPO levels and GST activity in blood cells (BCs) decreased significantly with increasing chick age, while BChE and LDH activity in plasma were not age-dependent. CAT in BCs tended to decline non-significantly in older chicks. Results of this study underscore the importance of standardising assay conditions and assessing intrinsic baseline variation in biochemical markers, before biochemical quantification. Data presented here provide a foundation for future use of BChE and LDH activity in plasma, as well as oxidative stress markers (LPO, CAT and GST) in BCs, to monitor environmental stress effects in Lesser Black-backed gulls.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are currently being exposed to changes in chemical inputs and it is suggested that physical climate is also changing. A novel approach has been used to study the effects of ionic inputs and climatic conditions on forest soils by reciprocally exchanging lysimeters containing undisturbed soil columns beween four forest sites in Europe. The soil columns contained no living roots and simulated a clear cut situation. The soils chosen represented different stages of acidification and were taken from sites along a transect of increasing exposure to acidic and nitrogen pollution. The purpose of the study was to quantify the reactions of soils when transferred to different environments. Element balances were used as an aggregated indicator to describe the reaction of the soil. The input of protons in local throughfall increased along the transect from 0.01 kmol ha(-1) y(-1) H+ at the unpolluted site up to 1.10 kmol ha(-1) y(-1) at the most polluted site. Our results show that soil acidification always resulted from a combination of acid deposition and biological transformations of nitrogen through nitrification of imported ammonium, mineralized N, or stored N. The balances indicate that between 54% and 91% of the soil acidification resulted from nitrification processes which were driven by a complex reaction when climatic and pollution conditions were changed simultaneously. The combined changes in atmosphic inputs and climatic conditions, as expected with global change, may have serious consequences for soil acidfication and long term organic matter turnover.

AB  - This work proposes a new type of web-based geospatial decision support system-called Soil Monitor-which provides a multidisciplinary operational tool useful for a multi-stakeholder community to challenge soil sealing. Various technological and technical features of Soil Monitor are presented and discussed with particular reference to the combination of WebGIS with on-the-fly geospatial processing based on GPU computing, specifically designed to allow real-time requests. In addition, we present three quantitative analysis of soil sealing at three different scales. The study at national level illustrated that the type of land use strongly affected soil-sealing dynamics. Indeed, the class complex cultivation pattern resulted the most fragile land use while forests resulted the most resilient one. The study at province level illustrated the key importance of having on-the-fly the map of rural fragmentation for any Italian province. This map-quantifying the landscape integrity of the rural and natural areas-enables to better locate both new green corridors or new urban developments minimizing the environmental impact of human activities. The study at municipality level demonstrated the importance of quantifying a pool of spatial planning indicators and illustrated that (a) the largest urban dispersion occurs in hilly touristic municipalities close to the sea, (b) the increase in soil sealing in rural sites is not related to population growth. As a result, Soil Monitor is deemed useful both to support decision making at different spatial scales and to raise awareness in people, professionals, and experts of other fields.

AB  - Ecosystems, though impacted by global environmental change, can also contribute to the adaptation and mitigation of such large scale changes. Therefore, sustainable ecosystem management is crucial in reaching a sustainable future for the biosphere. Based on the published literature and publicly accessible data, this paper discussed the status and trends of forest, grassland, and wetland ecosystems in China that play important roles in the ecological integrity and human welfare of the nation. Ecological degradation has been observed in these ecosystems at various levels and geographic locations. Biophysical (e.g., climate change) and socioeconomic factors (e.g., intensive human use) are the main reasons for ecosystem degradation with the latter factors serving as the dominant driving forces. The three broad categories of ecosystems in China have partially recovered from degradation thanks to large scale ecological restoration projects implemented in the last few decades. China, as the largest and most populated developing nation, still faces huge challenges regarding ecosystem management in a changing and globalizing world. To further improve ecosystem management in China, four recommendations were proposed, including: (1) advance ecosystem management towards an application-oriented, multidisciplinary science; (2) establish a well-functioning national ecological monitoring and data sharing mechanism; (3) develop impact and effectiveness assessment approaches for policies, plans, and ecological restoration projects; and (4) promote legal and institutional innovations to balance the intrinsic needs of ecological and socioeconomic systems. Any change in China's ecosystem management approach towards a more sustainable one will benefit the whole world. Therefore, international collaborations on ecological and environmental issues need to be expanded.

AB  - Integrity of serum samples is a major concern for biomarker discovery in many fields, including oncology. A gradual degradation of the fibrinopeptide A (fpA) as a result of the preservation process was already observed. In this work, we investigated this process to define a method for the assessment of sera integrity based on the total amount of fpA and its degradation pattern.
   SeraDeg software was developed. It identifies fpA fragments in spectra and extracts their abundances. The SeraDeg Quality Score (SDQS) is finally determined for each spectrum depending on its total fpA abundance and on the ratio of its higher mass versus lower mass fragments abundances.
   Spectra were evaluated for the total amount of fpA and the percent contribution of its fragments. The total fpA abundance is significantly lower in cryo-preserved samples than in fresh sera. Moreover, fresh sera present higher percentages of the most intact forms of fpA. Four relevant fpA fragments were identified.
   We developed and made available on-line SeraDeg, a software able to screen serum spectra, compute fpA related parameters and assign quality scores. SeraDeg was validated using spectra from a set of 250 samples. Biological significance: The susceptibility of fpA to degradation suggests its use as quality indicator of cryo-preserved serum samples. SeraDeg can support the adoption of this method which may especially be useful in differential sero-proteomics for wide-range biomarker discovery. Moreover, it discloses the doors to a critical re-evaluation of previous experiments in light of the quality of serum samples as assessed by fpA degradation analysis.

AB  - Assessing and categorizing habitat needs or population trends of organisms with complex life histories, such as Odonata, is challenging. All Odonata have aquatic nymphs and terrestrial adults. As a consequence, their use as indicators of ecosystem health or as umbrella species in conservation plans may be misleading if data from a particular life stage does not reflect actual residency at a freshwater site. We explored this question with an extensive data set for Odonata from Oklahoma, USA, to determine if ecological niches modeled from records of adults (i.e., lacking any evidence of breeding) differed from niches modeled for records indicating breeding (tandem pairs, ovipositing females, larvae, teneral [recently emerged adults], or exuviae [shed exo-skeletons of larvae]) at surveyed sites. We predicted that models would be comparable if adult presence strongly indicates local breeding but would be dissimilar if adults occupy many more sites than those at which the species breeds. Our results supported the latter prediction. Adult models were broader geographically and had a wider, more equitable (higher evenness) balance of contributing environmental variables (niche dimensions) than did models for breeders, which tended to be more ecologically specialized. These findings suggest that surveys of adult Odonata, which are relatively easy to obtain because of organized efforts to encourage observations by citizen scientists, can paint a misleadingly broad picture of a species' ecological niche. We recommend that evidence of breeding, especially presence of tenerals or exuviae, be used to outline ecological requirements when questions of conservation or population monitoring arise.

AB  - Mixtures of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) occur ubiquitously in aquatic environments, yet relatively little is known regarding their combined toxicities. Emerging reports investigating the additive mortality in metal-PAH mixtures have indicated that more-than-additive effects are equally as common as strictly-additive effects, raising concern for ecological risk assessment typically based on the summation of individual toxicities. Moreover, the current separation of focus between in vivo and in vitro studies, and fine- and coarse-scale endpoints, creates uncertainty regarding the mechanisms of co-toxicity involved in more-than-additive effects on whole organisms. Drawing from literature on metal and PAH toxicity in bacteria, protozoa, invertebrates, fish, and mammalian models, this review outlines several key mechanistic interactions likely to promote more-than-additive toxicity in metal-PAH mixtures. Namely, the deleterious effects of PAHs on membrane integrity and permeability to metals, the potential for metal-PAH complexation, the inhibitory nature of metals to the detoxification of PAHs via the cytochrome P450 pathway, the inhibitory nature of PAHs towards the detoxification of metals via metallothionein, and the potentiated production of reactive oxygenated species (ROS) in certain metal (e.g. Cu) and PAH (e.g., phenanthrenequinone) mixtures. Moreover, the mutual inhibition of detoxification suggests the possibility of positive feedback among these mechanisms. The individual toxicities and interactive aspects of contaminant transport, detoxification, and the production of ROS are herein discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sand-hoppers and beach-hoppers (Amphipoda, Talitridae) are well known as key species of sandy beach ecosystems. Behavioural traits (e.g., orientation) and their variation have been extensively studied in different contexts and proposed as bioindicator of impacts on coastlines. To assess the common sun orientation strategy and its potential use as across-scale bioindicator, a meta-analysis was conducted on a large dataset of observations on talitrid orientation, including beaches in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic coasts. The metaanalysis was conducted through a machine learning application by creating "virtual talitrid orientation" trained with data from beaches of the considered geographical areas and various environmental conditions. Then, the orientation of virtual talitrids was tested on different test sets. In each of the test conditions, the results showed the presence of a dominant direction towards the sea, while the distribution of deviations from the dominant direction corresponded to a random distribution. Meteorological variation or changes in beach morphological features influenced the orientation, causing changes in the orientation angle distributions. The main difference was the variability of orientation around the dominant direction, which was greater in Mediterranean beaches with respect to Atlantic ones. A possible explanation is the lower tide excursion and wind power and the greater variation in exposure of the Mediterranean beaches with respect to the Eastern Atlantic ones, where talitrid orientation showed a more rigid adaptation to beach physical features. The consistency of talitrid orientation can be used as a reference standard for management, revealing natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances at different scales, from local/regional to geographical.

AB  - Dams alter the natural dynamics of river inflow, disrupting biological processes in downstream ecosystems, as observed in the Guadiana estuary (SW Iberian Peninsula, Europe). Here, significant interannual fluctuations in the densities of jellyfish occur during summer, likely due to changes in winter river discharge. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify the relationship between winter river inflow and the abundance of jellyfish in the Guadiana estuary. In addition, the budding and growth of Aurelia aurita polyps, one of the bloom-forming species present in the estuary, were determined at different combinations of constant temperature and salinity. The response of polyps and ephyrae to short-term, low-salinity pulses was also quantified. Maximum winter river discharge and maximum abundance of estuarine medusa (bloom indicator) showed a significant negative correlation. Under constant conditions, polyps showed increased mortality when water temperature was higher than 23 degrees C and salinity was lower than 23, and died when exposed to a short-term, low-salinity pulse (<= 3). After exposure to freshets, polyp budding and feeding rates decreased by 69% and 32%, respectively, when salinity reached values as low as 10. Ephyrae died when salinity was lower than 10, and feeding rates decreased by 88% when salinity was 17, compared with full marine conditions. In conclusion, winter freshwater discharge may regulate the strength of estuarine jellyfish blooms, impairing the survival or condition of polyps and ephyrae during late winter or early spring. River basin managers should consider the prescription of freshets to prevent jellyfish blooms from disrupting ecosystem services (e.g. fisheries, tourism).

AB  - Changes in spring and autumn phenology of temperate plants in recent decades have become iconic bio-indicators of rapid climate change. These changes have substantial ecological and economic impacts. However, autumn phenology remains surprisingly little studied. Although the effects of unfavorable environmental conditions (e.g., frost, heat, wetness, and drought) on autumn phenology have been observed for over 60 y, how these factors interact to influence autumn phenological events remain poorly understood. Using remotely sensed phenology data from 2001 to 2012, this study identified and quantified significant effects of a suite of environmental factors on the timing of fall dormancy of deciduous forest communities in New England, United States. Cold, frost, and wet conditions, and high heat-stress tended to induce earlier dormancy of deciduous forests, whereas moderate heat- and drought-stress delayed dormancy. Deciduous forests in two eco-regions showed contrasting, nonlinear responses to variation in these explanatory factors. Based on future climate projection over two periods (2041-2050 and 2090-2099), later dormancy dates were predicted in northern areas. However, in coastal areas earlier dormancy dates were predicted. Our models suggest that besides warming in climate change, changes in frost and moisture conditions as well as extreme weather events (e.g., drought- and heat-stress, and flooding), should also be considered in future predictions of autumn phenology in temperate deciduous forests. This study improves our understanding of how multiple environmental variables interact to affect autumn phenology in temperate deciduous forest ecosystems, and points the way to building more mechanistic and predictive models.

AB  - Negative human actions on seagrasses affect habitat condition and its associated fauna. Epiphytic hydroid's assemblage response to seagrass condition, water quality, and human impacts was evaluated in two bays of the Sabana-Camaguey Ecosystem of Cuba, using the presence of contamination, causeways, and trawling fishing as impact level proxies to the seagrass meadows. Thirty-eight species composed the hydroid's assemblage including five new records. Symmetroscyphus intermedius was the most abundant species and sensitive to indicators of the seagrass condition. Dynamena disticha and Gastroblasta sp. were sensitive to water quality predictors. Obelia bidentata was exclusive to the most impacted sites. Species richness and abundance were low in impacted sites and were highly affected by fishing trawling and causeways construction. Salinity, depth, NO2, pH, SSV, macroalgae cover, shoot density, and wet weight of Thalassia testudinwn were the best predictors for hydroid's assemblages. Results suggest epiphytic hydroids on tropical seagrass meadows as sentinel organisms.

AB  - Five wetlands in Bogota (Guaymaral, Jaboque, Juan Amarillo, Santa Maria del Lago and Tibanica) and one rural wetland (Meridor, Tenjo municipality) were sampled four times during dry, rainy and transitory climatic periods (between 2007 and 2008). Physico-chemical variables were measured and periphyton was sampled to evaluate the diatom community. The pollution value per taxon (PVT) was established for each diatom species and a periphytic diatom index for Bogota Wetlands (PDIBW) was calculated to evaluate the ecological quality of the wetlands. According to the limnological status thus established, the six wetlands can be classified as follows: Santa Marfa del Lago, Meridor and Jaboque exhibit poor to moderate limnological conditions; Tibanica is in poor condition; Guaymaral has severely impaired to moderate conditions; and Juan Amarillo tends to present permanent severely impaired conditions, which indicates that it is the most polluted wetland. The index proposed was useful to classify the wetlands according to their limnological status, and it adequately represents the ecological quality of the Bogota wetlands.

AB  - Land managers need reliable metrics for assessing the quality of restorations and natural areas and prioritizing management and conservation efforts. However, it can be difficult to select metrics that are robust to sampling methods and natural environmental differences among sites, while still providing relevant information regarding ecosystem changes or stressors. We collected herbaceous-layer vegetation data in wetlands and grasslands in four regions of the USA (the Midwest, subtropical Florida, arid southwest, and coastal New England) to determine if commonly used vegetation metrics (species richness, mean coefficient of conservatism [mean C], Floristic Quality Index [FQI], abundance-weighted mean C, and percent non-native species cover) were robust to environmental and methodological variables (region, site, observer, season, and year), and to determine adequate sample sizes for each metric. We constructed linear mixed effects models to determine the influence of these environmental and methodological variables on vegetation metrics and used metric accumulation curves to determine the effect of sample size on metric values. Species richness and FQI varied among regions, and year and observer effects were also highly supported in our models. Mean C was the metric most robust to sampling variables and stabilized at less sampling effort compared to other metrics. Assessment of mean C requires sampling a small number of quadrats (e.g. 20), but assessment of species richness or FQI requires more intensive sampling, particularly in species-rich sites. Based on our analysis, we recommend caution be used when comparing metric values among sites sampled in different regions, different years, or by different observers.

AB  - Extensive use of neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) worldwide calls for further knowledge on their environmental occurrence and risk. The present study highlighted the need for more research on long-term exposure of NNIs in aquatic environment, which is important but remains elusive. Time weighted average concentrations of five commonly used NNIs in urban waterways of Guangzhou, China were measured using newly developed polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). Acetamiprid (from 18.8 +/- 1.9 to 157 +/- 31 ng/L; mean +/- standard deviation), clothianidin (from 14.8 +/- 3.7 to 47.6 +/- 10.0 ng/L) and imidacloprid (from 32.9 +/- 11.6 to 249 +/- 19 ng/L) were detectable in all samples. Thiamethoxam was found at 71.4% of the 21 sampling sites (from not detected to 52.4 +/- 9.4 ng/L), while thiacloprid was not detected at any site. Vegetable planting and sewage effluent were the main sources of NNIs in surface water in Guangzhou. Probabilistic environmental exposure distributions were subsequently constructed using the measured concentrations and the exceedances of predicted environmental concentrations of NNI to ecological thresholds were assessed. In Guangzhou, 63.5%, 16.2%, 87.8% and 17.2% of acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, respectively, exceeded an interim chronic threshold of 35 ng/L for NNIs. Further risk assessment and control measures for the use of NNIs are advocated for protecting the integrity of aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We classified homogenous river types across Europe and searched for fish metrics qualified to show responsds to specific pressures (hydromorphological pressures or water quality pressures) vs. multiple pressures in these river types. We analysed fish taxa lists from 3105 sites in 16 ecoregions and 14 countries. Sites were pre-classified for 15 selected pressures to separate unimpacted from impacted sites. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to split unimpacted sites into four homogenous river types based on species composition and geographical location. Classification trees were employed to predict associated river types for impacted sites with four environmental variables. We defined a set of 129 candidate fish metrics to select the best reacting metrics for each river type. The candidate metrics represented tolerances/intolerances of species associated with six metric types: habitat, migration, water quality sensitivity, reproduction, trophic level and biodiversity. The results showed that 17 uncorrelated metrics reacted to pressures in the four river types. Metrics responded specifically to water quality pressures and hydromorphological pressures in three river types and to multiple pressures in all river types. Four metrics associated with water quality sensitivity showed a significant reaction in up to three river types, whereas 13 metrics were specific to individual river types. Our results contribute to the better understanding of fish assemblage response to human pressures at a pan-European scale. The results are especially important for European river management and restoration, as it is necessary to uncover underlying processes and effects of human pressures on aquatic communities.

AB  - Fisheries are often accused of starving vulnerable seabirds, yet evidence for this claim is scarce. Foraging energetics may provide efficient, short-term indicators of the fitness status of seabirds competing with fisheries. We used this approach in Cape gannets (Morus capensis) from Malgas Island, South Africa, which feed primarily on small pelagic fish in the southern Benguela upwelling region, thereby competing with purse-seine fisheries. During their 2011-2014 breeding seasons, we determined body condition of breeding adult Cape gannets and measured their chick growth rates. In addition to these conventional fitness indices, we assessed the daily energy expenditure of breeding adults using a high-resolution time-energy budget derived from GPS-tracking and accelerometry data. For these same individuals, we also determined prey intake rates using stomach temperature recordings. We found that adult body condition and chick growth rates declined significantly during the study period. Crucially, most birds (73 %) studied with electronic recorders spent more energy than they gained through foraging, and 80-95 % of their feeding dives were unsuccessful. Our results therefore point to unprofitable foraging in Cape gannets, with a longer-term fitness cost in terms of adult body condition and reproductive performance that corresponds to a local population decline. Based on this evidence, we advocate a revision of regional fishing quotas for small pelagic fish and discuss the possibility of an experimental cessation of purse-seine fishing activities off the west coast of South Africa. These measures are needed for the ecological and socio-economical persistence of the broader southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem.

AB  - The Kirtland's warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii Baird) is an endangered songbird that nests in northern Lower Michigan in ecosystems dominated by young jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.). An ecological, multifactor approach was used to determine the range and characteristics of landform-level. ecosystems supporting the warbler and to compare the spatial and temporal patterns of warbler occupation among these ecosystems. Using an ecosystem rather than a strictly biological approach, the landforms occupied by the warbler are very diverse. Twelve landforms were identified based on 61 sites currently or formerly occupied by the warbler. Average annual jack pine height growth, an indicator of stand structural features that influences initial warbler colonization and duration of occupancy, differed significantly among landforms, resulting in marked differences in warbler occurrence in time and space across the breeding range. Landforms with favorable growing conditions for jack pine were colonized earliest and were occupied for the shortest duration, whereas landforms with unfavorable growing conditions were colonized relatively late but were occupied longest. Different ecological factors, such as the spatial position of landforms, microclimate, soil texture, or a combination of these factors, may account for favorable or unfavorable growing conditions for jack pine, which in turn affects the timing and duration of warbler occupancy. The classification and description of ecosystems occupied by the warbler provides an ecological framework for warbler management, especially when plantations rather than wildfire are the primary source of warbler habitat.

AB  - Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) have been reported to induce cytotoxicity in a structure-dependent manner. The toxic effects may be due to the damage of biomembrane integrity and/or the interference of membrane signal pathway. In this study, the damages of fifteen typical OPFRs (chlorinated phosphates, alkyl phosphates, aryl phosphates, and alkoxy phosphates) to mimetic biomembrane were determined by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The molecular structure descriptors that characterized the action mechanisms were screened by stepwise regression. The six molecular descriptors (MATS7e, DLS_05, Mor19m, Mor22v, Mor12v and MATS8m) were screened to study the actions between OPFRs and mimetic biomembrane. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was developed by the partial least squares (PLS) method. Statistical results indicated that the QSAR model had good robustness and mechanism interpretability. The distribution of atomic electronegativities (MATS7e) and atomic masses in three dimensional spaces (Mor19m) were the key factors influencing the actions between OPFRs and simulated biofilms. The compounds with strong electron-withdrawing property could invade the inner layer of membrane and destroy its integrity. High levels of steric hindrance could impair the damage capacity caused by electronegativity. Moreover, drug-like index (DLS_05), spatial structures of particle (Mor22v, Mor12v) and atomic masses (MATS8m) also affected the actions. The results revealed the mechanism of the actions of OPFRs with simulated biofilms and elucidated the key structural characteristics affecting the actions of OPFRs, which could provide theoretical basis for ecological risk assessment of OPFRs.

AB  - Scurria scurra is a patelogastropod inhabiting the stipes and holdfasts cavities of Lessonia nigrescens complex species forming a herbivore-kelp association highly specialized. It has been proposed that the exploitation of kelp beds of Lessonia berteroana in northern Chile is a disturbance that affects Scurria-Lessonia association such as ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) events. Considering the above, and the important ecological role that have kelps as foundation species, this study proposes the use of Scurria-Lessonia association as an ecological indicator to monitor the integrity of kelp beds of L. berteroana. To achieve this, the abundance and size structure of S. scurra in plants of L. berteroana was evaluated under 3 different types of conservation strategies of fishing resources: open access areas and management areas (with harvest), and marine protected areas (without harvest) in the Region of Atacama and Region of Coquimbo, Chile. In addition, we monitored the time of recovery post-harvest of Scurria-Lessonia association in an experimental site (Lagunillas, 30 degrees S). The results show that S. scurra population in open access areas is dominated by juveniles in low abundances, a situation not detected in management areas and marine protected areas. Furthermore, the recovery of S. scurra post-harvest of Lessonia at the experimental site took more than 2 years (30 months). An indicator was proposed to validate the actions of management plan of brown algae for open access areas to fisheries. This ecological indicator is easy to observe, evaluate and disseminate among users of the productive chain of Chilean kelp resource.

AB  - Mudflats are important for coastal zone ecosystems by providing wildlife habitat and by acting as natural sea defenses that serve to dissipate tidal and wave energy. Geomorphological models of these intertidal flats and estuaries require site-specific bio-physicochemical sediment parameters as input. Hyperspectral remote sensing can be used as a tool providing synoptic maps of these properties. However, the interpretation of hyperspectral remotely sensed images over mudflats is only possible if the appropriate bio-geophysical or empirical models for information extraction are available. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to model the effects of varying sediment properties on the reflectance in laboratory conditions.
   The methodology consisted of (i) hyperspectral measurements of sediment mixtures with varying physical and biological characteristics in laboratory conditions, (ii) determination and quantification of specific absorption features and (iii) regression between the absorption features and physical parameters.
   In laboratory conditions, quantification of clay in dry sediment, moisture in unsaturated sediment and chlorophyll a in sediment mixtures was achieved with coefficients of determination (r(2)) of 0.98, 0.90 and of 0.96 using the scaled band area of absorption features at 2204, 1450 and 673 nm, respectively. Additionally, the water absorption at 1190 nm was identified as suitable to predict moisture content in very wet sediment and preliminary results showed the potential of hyperspectral signals to assess the effect of bioturbation on sediment properties.
   Future work will consider the applicability of this methodology in field situations to relate biophysical sediment parameters to the hyperspectral signal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change models predict that much of western North America is becoming significantly warmer and drier, resulting in overall reductions in availability of water for ecosystems. Herein, I demonstrate that significant declines in the reproductive success of female insectivorous bats occur in years when annual environmental conditions mimic the long-term predictions of regional climate change models. Using a data set gathered on bat populations from 1996 through 2008 along the Front Range of Colorado, I compare trends in population numbers and reproductive outcomes of six species of vespertilionid bats with data on mean annual high temperature, precipitation, snow pack, and stream discharge rates. I show that levels of precipitation and flow rates of small streams near maternity colonies is fundamentally tied to successful reproduction in female bats, particularly during the lactation phase. Across years that experienced greater than average mean temperatures with less than average precipitation and stream flow, bat populations responded by slight to profound reductions in reproductive output depending on the severity of drought conditions. In particular, reproductive outputs showed profound declines (32-51%) when discharge rates of the largest stream in the field area dropped below 7 m(3)/s, indicating a threshold response. Such sensitivity to environmental change portends severe impacts to regional bat populations if current scenarios for climate change in western North America are accurate. In addition, bats act as early-warning indicators of large-scale ecological effects resulting from further regional warming and drying trends currently at play in western North America.

AB  - Range condition assessment procedures that rely on field-collected botanical data face major problems in nonequilibrium rangelands, which are spatially variable and extensively grazed. These problems include the difficulty of interpreting changes in plant species composition and the logistics of obtaining representative data for large areas. Consideration of ecosystem behavior through time and in space shows that certain spatial and temporal patterns exist that may be used to isolate the impact of grazing from other processes. The patterns also make it possible to distinguish between temporary changes and those that are more long term. All relevant patterns may be expressed in terms of total plant cover and may be monitored from remote sensing satellites. It is therefore possible to derive a set of range condition indicators that may be measured and monitored from space. These indicators use trends in average vegetation cover with distance from water at the end of very wet periods, trends in cover variance with distance from water, and the magnitude of observed vegetation response at individual points in the landscape compared with that which is expected when vegetation recovers fully from grazing. It is also possible to use spatial variability in the rate of cover depletion after rainfall to infer relative differences in the amount of forage present. When used in combination, the methods offer a realistic alternative to field-based assessment and are capable of detecting many types of rangeland degradation. They are also considerably cheaper to use.

AB  - The European Union objectives in the Horizon 2020 program aim to reduce environmental impact through strategies such as the improvement of energy efficiency and the use of renewable technologies. With regard to the goal of sustainable development-which integrates environmental, social, and economic dimensions relating to the preservation of the planet and the integrity of consumers-several types of sustainability certification tools are currently used in the construction industry e.g., Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), and the Sustainable Building Tool (SBTool) There are international sustainability methodologies designed specifically for high schools and methodologies specific to the Portuguese reality, such as Natura Domus, LiderA (Liderar pelo Ambiente para a construcAo sustentavel, Leading the Environment for Sustainable Construction) and SBtool(PT) (Sustainable Building Tool, Portugal). Currently, with the concern in Portugal to requalify schools, it has become necessary to develop a specific methodology for school buildings according to the Portuguese reality. This work highlights the SBTool methodology that is employed in several countries and can be adapted to basic education institutions as the basis for the formulation of responsible citizens and the development of a country. The main aim of this study is to adapt an already existing assessment tool of sustainability (SBTool(PT)), maintaining some indicators while modifying and adding others, in order to develop a methodology specifically for conducting a Sustainability Assessment of High School Buildings in Portugal-SAHSB(PT). In order to achieve this goal, other methodologies that already incorporate parameters relating to the school environment are analyzed, such as LEED BD + C Schools (LEED Building Design and Construction School), BREEAM Education 2008, and the SBTool for K-12 schools.

AB  - The establishment of numeric nutrient criteria is essential to aid the control of nutrient pollution and for protecting and restoring healthy ecological conditions. However, it's necessary to determine whether regional nutrient criteria can be defined in stream ecosystems with a poor ecological status. A database of periphytic diatom samples was collected in July and August 2011 and 2012. In total 172 samples were included in the database with matching environmental variables. Here, percentile estimates, nonparametric change-point analysis (nCPA) and Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) were conducted to detect the reference conditions and ecological thresholds along a total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) gradient and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) for the development of nutrient criteria in the streams of the Lake Dianchi basin. The results highlighted the possibility of establishing regional criteria for nutrient concentrations, which we recommended to be no more than 1.39 mg L-1 for TN, 0.04 mg L-1 for TP and 0.17 mg L-1 for NH3-N to prevent nuisance growths of tolerant taxa, and 0.38 mg L-1 for TN, 0.02 mg L-1 for TP and 0.02 mg L-1 for NH3-N to maintain high quality waters in streams. Additionally, the influence of excessive background nutrient enrichment on the threshold response, and the ecological interaction with other stressors (HQI, etc.) in the nutrient dynamic process need to be considered to establish the eventual nutrient criteria, regardless of which technique is applied.

AB  - Non-lethal biological techniques such as blood biomarkers have gained attention due to their value as early signals of anthropic effects of contamination representing significant tools to evaluate ecosystems health. We evaluate and characterize in situ genotoxicity of water samples collected from aquatic ecosystems around a fluorite mine using amphibian frogs Hypsiboas cordobae as bioindicator species complemented with 16 physicochemical parameters. Four stations associated with fluorite mine sampling were sampled: a stream running on granitic rock with natural high fluorite content; two streams both running on metamorphic rock with low fluorite content; and an artificial decantation pond containing sediments produced by fluorite flotation process with high variation in physicochemical parameters. We analyses the blood of tadpoles and adults of H. Cordobae, calculated frequencies of micronuclei, erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities, mitosis, immature and enudeated erythrocytes. Individuals were measured and weighed and body condition was calculated. The results of this study indicate that individuals of decantation pond are exposed to compounds or mixtures which are causing cell damage when compared to those that were collected of stream. Larval stage was more vulnerable than the adult phase and it could be related mainly to the higher exposure time to xenobiotics, which can penetrate easily by skin, mouth and gills; additionally this site offers a reduced availability of food than other sites. Therefore, chronic exposure to pollutants could derive in degenerative and neoplastic diseases in target organs. Moreover these individuals may experience reproductive and behavioral disturbances which could lead to population decline in the long term. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The integration of taxonomic and ecological traits is a more balanced approach in the systematic identification of living organisms. We isolated ten strains of Dunaliella from different geographical regions of Iran, including six terrestrial and four aquatic taxa. All strains belonged to the section Dunaliella based on the morphological and molecular investigation. First, optimal salinity was determined for bio-pigment accumulation. Each alga had its own optimum salinity, and the range of 1.5 to 2.5 M NaCl was further studied. Dunaliella parva YzS produced the maximum biomass density (231.92 mg L-1), while Dunaliella salina MrL accumulated the highest value of total carotenoid (1.72%AFDW). At the early stationary growth phase, the algae had a 11.7 to 41.7% lipid content. FAMEs varied from C10 to C24 with one or more double bonds. The results showed highly significant levels of palmitic (C16) and alpha-linolenic (C18:3n3) acids. According to the fatty acid profiles, the clustering pattern aligns with the sample origin. Compared to aquatic strains, terrestrials were more resistant to harsh conditions, e.g., dry conditions due to the synthesis of very long chain fatty acids. Lipid compositions may therefore be attributable to the environmental origins of taxa. The fatty acid composition was affected by the environmental conditions, while the accumulation of carotenoid was dependent on the biological and genetic entity of algal taxa. Examination of habitat parameters revealed that aquatic strains were well adapted to maintain homeostasis in higher salinity and conductivity; terrestrial strains were much better able to tolerate high concentrations of nitrate and phosphate.

AB  - The concentration of toxic metals in water, sediment, and organs of species Dawkinsia filamentosa and its growth conditions were analyzed from the Tamiraparani river of Tamilnadu, India. The water quality preferred to examine the existence of metals, and the concentration of Pb, Cr and Cd expand the first time were found to be high in sediment, which was followed by water and the organs of the fish gill and liver. Even though, intakes of the toxic metals were highly accumulated in the gill instead of the liver. From that, the histological assessments of organ damages were observed significant variations in the study sites. Within the linear regression parameters for length-weight relationships of coefficient value r(2), 'a' value and 'b' value were showed the allometric growth rate and condition factor of 'K' was fittest. The phylogenetic tree analyses were showing analogy between the opposite groups of Clade III and Clade II showed that the species were closely correlated with the Puntius sp. of other species. And in Clade I was intimately related within the identical population of D. filamentosa as respectively. However, the comparison of metal concentrations of other Indian rivers and of other parts of the world specified that these metals are getting closer to the standard permissible limits. Altogether, the potential ecological risk factor was slightly increased at the sampling sites; therefore, we conclude that the metal contents might pollute the river. Throughout this research, the observed findings emphasize that fish species from the riverine ecosystem may useful for environmental management and genetic diversity.

AB  - Righting behavior has been used extensively in laboratory studies of sea urchins as an indicator of stress under various environmental conditions. In situ measurements of the natural righting response of sea urchins would serve to place such laboratory measurements in an ecological context as well as potentially validate laboratory control conditions. We investigated the righting response of the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus in seagrass and sand bottom habitats of Saint Joseph's Bay, Florida. Field-measured righting times (other than the exception mentioned below) in L. variegatus were similar to those measured in laboratory studies. Moreover, as seen in multiple sea urchin species in laboratory studies, smaller individuals exhibited significantly shorter righting times than larger individuals. Importantly, sea urchins lacking covering material (shell material, seagrass blades) that were placed on open sand patches took significantly longer to right than those with covering material placed on sand patches. Our field observations indicate the importance of sea urchin size, substrate type, and the presence or absence of covering materials when making righting measurements in the laboratory or the field. Our findings also suggest that higher water velocities facilitate righting, as at higher flows on sand patches, the presence/absence of covering material no longer significantly impacted righting time. These findings are ecologically important as they indicate that, under certain natural conditions (sand substrate, low availability of covering materials and low water velocities), L. variegatus that are displaced onto their aboral side are more vulnerable to predation.

AB  - Seawater salinity changes and thermal stress have been considered to be among the most important determinants of rocky intertidal zone organism distribution. The aim of present study was to determine the freshwater influx and evaluate the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis shells as indicators of natural environmental conditions by comparing delta C-13 of shell carbonate layers with seawater salinity and temperature values measured over the 1998-2007 period. Our results show that the salinity was relatively constant in the open sea, with typical values of the northern and southern Adriatic being 37.65 +/- 0.40 and 38.37 +/- 0.19 respectively. It varied in intertidal zones, estuaries, locations close to under-sea freshwater springs and during rainy days in closed lagoons on different locations along eastern Adriatic coast. Salinity and temperature variations at investigated sites showed freshwater influx which was also reflected in lower delta C-13 values of mussel M. galloprovincialis shell carbonates. Based on the measured parameters, three groups of locations in the investigated area (25 locations) can be defined: locations with strong to medium freshwater influence (9), with minor freshwater influence (6) and marine environment locations (10). Our results confirm that mussel M. galloprovincialis responds sensitively to subtle changes in the environmental conditions. Results of the isotopic analyses presented in this study support the hypothesis that the delta C-13 in mussel's shell might be used as an indicator of environmental salinity conditions and hypo-osmotic stress. Therefore such investigations might represent an additional tool for waste water management and environmental protection.

AB  - This paper evaluates the influence of habitat heterogeneity, inter-habitat connectivity, and biogeograhical patterns in the context of a biodiversity hotspot in an Atlantic-Mediterranean marine transition area. We analyzed some biological and ecological aspects of molluscan assemblages inhabiting different habitats located in the northwestern Alboran Sea, in order to elucidate the inter-habitat connectivity among coastal habitats, and to understand the contribution of each habitat to the integrity of the infralittoral ecosystem. The assessment of molluscan assemblages was performed by combining information regarding (1) feeding guilds, to analyze trophic strategies; (2) microhabitat preference, to study the link between habitat heterogeneity with biodiversity; and (3) biogeographical affinities, to identify distributional patterns of molluscs. A total of 354 molluscs were identified, with vegetated habitats harbouring the highest number of species. A wide variety of trophic strategies were observed, with infaunal filter feeders, specialized carnivores living on sessile invertebrates and microalgal grazers dominating the assemblages. Most of the species have a wide distribution while few strictly Mediterranean species have been collected. The presence of subtropical species highlights the uniqueness of this area in European seas. The high beta-diversity value obtained is indicative of high habitat heterogeneity and a high amount of uncommon species, some of them displaying their sole European populations. The different assemblages enrich the global taxocoenosis through complementarity, with an important inter-habitat connectivity reflected by the different temporal ordination of samples according to both microhabitat affinities and feeding guilds. This work highlights the balanced contribution of soft and vegetated bottoms as reservoirs of biodiversity.

AB  - The majority of national governments now dedicate themselves to sustainable development as it aims to produce a long-term, positive relationship between civilization and life-supporting planetary resources. By doing so, societies have also embraced indicators as tools to provide comprehensive assessment of the current position, gauge improvement, and help set future development goals; however there remains no unanimous agreement regarding their theoretical foundation, design, nor use. The number of sustainability measures available for quantifying development is overwhelming to planners, scientists, and policymakers, thus clarification of interrelationships, redundancy, and spatial distributions is needed. First, this study reduced and described a set of 30 multi-metric sustainability indices across 36 European nations. A multivariate factor analysis identified five major dimensions (or axes) that conveyed over 80% of the total variation of the original 30 development measures. Second, spatial autoregressive analyses of childhood mortality, endangered species density, and population growth rate revealed statistical correlations with one or more of the five development factors. The five axes of sustainable development are expressions of: prosperity, equality, and governance; quality of life; ecosystem integrity; environmentally efficient happiness; and environmental management. Of these, Factor 1 (prosperity, equality, and governance) explained more than one-third of the total variance, and positively clustered in northwest Europe and negatively in southeast Europe. Results suggest that a few key indicators could be used when evaluating a country's overall development status during continental and global scale sustainability assessments. Lastly, the findings reveal an overall underrepresentation of ecological (biosphere) wellbeing within current measures of sustainable development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aquaculture ecosystem assessment is a major key for successful aquaculture Planning. There are many aquaculture farms constructed in Egypt, but because of the non-sufficient studies about the environmental conditions of aquaculture ecosystem assessment, many projects achieved negative results and had low economical returns. The present study was conducted to evaluate the aquaculture ecosystem assessment of irrigation water of El-Mahmoudia Canal, Alexandria, Egypt. The result indicated that temperature (24.65 +/- 0.4 degrees C), DO (5.38 +/- 0.20mg/l), COD (14.40 +/- 4.5mg/l) and BOD (2.86 +/- 0.20 mg/l) were in the optimum range for 0. niloticus. Chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids were 10.449 +/- 0.953, 4.685 +/- 0.704 and 2.374 +/- 0.054 mu g/g, respectively. The biochemical composition of plankton showed that protein, lipid and carbohydrate were 37.7 +/- 3.39 %, 16.33 +/- 0.85%, and 11.23 +/- 2.63%, respectively. Moreover, SFA, MUFA and PUFA were 70.29 +/- 4.07%, 11.172 +/- 0.132 %, and 18.55 +/- 0.525% of total fatty acids, respectively. Zooplankton community showed that rotifers and copepods configured the main bulk of zooplankton community (95.9% to the total zooplankton community). These conditions are considered the ideal recommended conditions for cultivation of Oreochromis niloticus that started with 100,000 fingerlings (distributed as 4.76 fish/m(3) of earth pond) for six months with 82% survival rate with final yield of 21.3 ton/1.6 hectare.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities, especially resulting in changes in the water conditions, usually disturb biological and agricultural functions of grasslands, leading to their degradation, often on large areas. Remote sensing observations of such changes in grassland ecosystems evoke a great interest, but they are still a difficult task, especially when performed on industrial and mining areas. This paper presents a new effective method of remote sensing of grassland moisture conditions based on temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI) calculated from free Landsat imagery, and employing the TVDI spatial variability estimated from a semivariance analysis. The practical applicability of the method is demonstrated on the example of monitoring of the extensive neighborhood of lignite open-cast mine within a period of a few years. Besides, the developed method was validated at the studied area, using in situ information. Thus, we demonstrated that TVDI may serve as an effective indicator of grassland moisture conditions, even in problematic areas.

AB  - Infection of barbel with 10 species of metazoan parasites including 3 trematodes, 3 acanthocephalans and 4 nematodes was observed in fish collected from 3 localities in the Bulgarian part of the river Danube between summer 2004 and summer 2007. The composition as well as the diversity characteristics of the parasite communities were analysed seasonally and showed a clear correlation with the composition of the invertebrate fauna and water quality. The most prevalent species was the acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis, which was also the dominant species of the intestinal component communities at all sampling sites. The second most frequent parasite at all Danube localities was Rhabdochona hellichi, which occurred in significantly higher numbers at the less polluted sites. Overall, the diversity of helminth communities increased with decreasing levels of nutrients and pollutants at all sampling sites. Therefore, the composition and diversity of parasite communities may be used to characterize ecosystem health and integrity.

AB  - The ecological health and integrity of watersheds throughout the world are being threatened by a variety of stressors. Often, restoration practices focus on single problems whereas comprehensive, multidisciplinary approaches are needed to address both the symptoms and underlying causes of impairment. A comprehensive assessment of a small, urbanized watershed in west Michigan, USA was conducted to evaluate the major stressors in the system. This assessment approach for the Mona Lake watershed included analyses of land use/land cover change, water quality in both the major surface inflows and the receiving water body, and toxic inputs into a major inflow. Because these issues are common to many watersheds, we developed a conceptual model that spatially links these stressors and predicted impacts, allowing us to assess them in a comprehensive manner. Based on our results, we generated a set of recommendations targeted for specific source or problem areas. This approach can be applied to other watersheds.

AB  - Background
   Many studies have evaluated the ecological integrity of large-scale estuaries of continental rivers using biotic indicators such as fish, phytoplankton and benthic communities. However, few studies have focused on the river estuaries of small and medium rivers. Molluscan fauna data in large estuaries or in the estuaries of large rivers have been collected by the The National Census on River Environments (conducted by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) or National Survey on the Natural Environment (conducted by the Ministry of Environment). On the other hand, molluscan fauna of small and medium rivers are managed by local governments and have rarely been investigated.
   New information
   This paper provides basic information on the molluscan fauna of 70 rivers in Kyushu, Japan, collected with the aim of conserving estuaries of small and medium rivers. In total, 37 families, 82 species and 21,827 individuals were collected. The data are all accessible from the document "A dataset of shellfish fauna sampled in estuaries of medium and small rivers in Kyushu, Japan (http://ipt.pensoft.net/resource.do?r=shellfishes_in_kyushu)". According to the Red Data Book published by the Japanese Ministry of Environment in 2018, 3 species were determined as Critically endangered and Endangered, 6 species were determined as Vulnerable and 13 species were determined as Near Threatened. The proportions of individuals classified as Critically endangered and Endangered from the total number of individuals were extremely low, but the proportions of Near Threatened individuals were high. Our results indicate that the risk of molluscan extinction in small-and medium-sized river estuaries in Kyushu is high and that immediate conservation is necessary.

AB  - This study describes the impact of a wildfire caused by a tourist at Torres del Paine Biosphere Reserve in 2005, which destroyed approximately 2,000 ha of forests. Changes on biodiversity attributes of Nothofagus pumilio stands including structure, floristic composition and regeneration, are shown. We compared three plot groups having similar site and structure: Cordon Masle burned plots (CMBP); Cordon Masle unburned plots (CMUP), adjacent to the first ones; and Cerro Paine unburned plots (CPUP), outside the fire perimeter. Data was analyzed using univariate (Mann-Whitney) and multivariate (MRPP and ISA) non-parametric analysis. In CMBP, the fire reduced in average 91.7% of the tree density and 70.9% of the basal area. In the unburned plots the average of seedling was 23,625 and 22,750 ha(-1) in CPUP and CMUP respectively, whereas in burned ones it was only 1,125 ha(-1) in CMBP. Canopy layer collapsed and species richness and cover on ground increased significantly in burned plots. The average of exotics increased from 1.5 and 0.6 in CPUP and CMUP respectively to 11.9 in CMBP. Tree mortality, lower regeneration, biological invasion and broken canopy-ground balance in burned stands, are altering the successional pathways of forests, making difficult the forest regeneration and restoration efforts. Based on this information, we propose managers to encourage efforts in fire prevention and to incorporate a database on biodiversity indicators for management plans, in order to know more about the ecological integrity of ecosystems and the impacts provoked by recreation.

AB  - The vast boreal biome plays an important role in the global carbon cycle but is experiencing particularly rapid climate warming, threatening the integrity of valued ecosystems and their component species. We developed a framework and taxonomy to identify climate-change refugia potential in the North American boreal region, summarizing current knowledge regarding mechanisms, geographic distribution, and landscape indicators. While "terrain-mediated" refugia will mostly be limited to coastal and mountain regions, the ecological inertia (resistance to external fluctuations) contained in some boreal ecosystems may provide more extensive buffering against climate change, resulting in "ecosystem-protected" refugia. A notable example is boreal peatlands, which can retain high surface soil moisture and water tables even in the face of drought. Refugia from wildfire are also especially important in the boreal region, which is characterized by active disturbance regimes. Our framework will help identify areas of high refugia potential, and inform ecosystem management and conservation planning in light of climate change.

AB  - Mexico harbors more than 10% of the planet's endemic species. However, the integrity and biodiversity of many ecosystems is experiencing rapid transformation under the influence of a wide array of human and natural disturbances. In order to disentangle the effects of human and natural disturbance regimes at different spatial and temporal scales, we selected six terrestrial (temperate montane forests, montane cloud forests, tropical rain forests, tropical semi-deciduous forests, tropical dry forests, and deserts) and four aquatic (coral reefs, mangrove forests, kelp forests and saline lakes) ecosystems. We used semi-quantitative statistical methods to assess (1) the most important agents of disturbance affecting the ecosystems, (2) the vulnerability of each ecosystem to anthropogenic and natural disturbance, and (3) the differences in ecosystem disturbance regimes and their resilience. Our analysis indicates a significant variation in ecological responses, recovery capacity, and resilience among ecosystems. The constant and widespread presence of human impacts on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is reflected either in reduced area coverage for most systems, or reduced productivity and biodiversity, particularly in the case of fragile ecosystems (e.g., rain forests, coral reefs). In all cases, the interaction between historical human impacts and episodic high intensity natural disturbance (e.g., hurricanes, fires) has triggered a reduction in species diversity and induced significant changes in habitat distribution or species dominance. The lack of monitoring programs assessing before/after effects of major disturbances in Mexico is one of the major limitations to quantifying the commonalities and differences of disturbance effects on ecosystem properties.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the impact of livestock grazing management systems on soil and vegetation dynamics under different environmental conditions of Botswana. Soil and vegetation were randomly sampled along transects located in three ranches and adjacent communal grazing land in 2009 and 2010. Our results showed that grazing management systems did not consistently affect soil texture, organic carbon, pH and bulk density. The soil characteristics such as soil carbon and clay content were strongly associated with variation in rainfall, and contributed to improved rangeland condition characterised by high herbaceous biomass and low bush encroachment. Livestock grazing management systems do not impact soil and vegetation properties differently as indicators of degradation are observed in both grazing systems. Thus, there is a need to develop a sustainable land management model that will improve soil carbon, increase herbaceous biomass and generally improve the condition of rangelands in Botswana.

AB  - Environmental risk assessment of chemicals for the protection of ecosystems integrity is a key regulatory and scientific research field which is undergoing constant development in modelling approaches and harmonisation with human risk assessment. This review focuses on state-of-the-art toxicokinetic tools and models that have been applied to terrestrial and aquatic species relevant to environmental risk assessment of chemicals. Both empirical and mechanistic toxicokinetic models are discussed using the results of extensive literature searches together with tools and software for their calibration and an overview of applications in environmental risk assessment. These include simple tools such as one-compartment models, multi-compartment models to physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models, mostly available for aquatic species such as fish species and a number of chemical classes including plant protection products, metals, persistent organic pollutants, nanoparticles. Data gaps and further research needs are highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Carbohydrazides of N-substituted beta-amino acids exhibit a variety of different biological activities including antibacterial, antiviral, fungicidal, antihelminthic, anticancer, antiinflammatory, etc. New potentially biologically active N-(4-iodophenyl)-beta-alanine derivatives, N-(4-iodophenyl)-N-carboxyethyl-beta-alanine derivatives, and their cyclization products were designed and synthesized. To determine the most propitious directions for further investigation of the obtained compounds, we tried to appraise their biological activity in silico using the ChemSpider and chemical structure lookup service (CSLS), chemical similarity assessment (Integrity and SuperPred), and machine learning methods [prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS)]. No useful hints on potential biological activity of the obtained novel compounds were delivered by ChemSpider, CSLS, Integrity or SuperPred. In contrast, PASS predicted some biological activities that could be verified experimentally. Neither antibacterial nor antifungal activity was predicted for the compounds under study despite these actions being known for compounds from this chemical class. Evaluation of antibacterial (Escherichia coli B-906, Staphylococcus aureus 209-P, and Mycobacterium luteum B-91) and antifungal (Candida tenuis VKM Y-70 and Aspergillus niger F-1119) activities in vitro did not reveal any significant antimicrobial action, which corresponds to the computational prediction. Advantages and shortcomings of chemical similarity and machine learning techniques in computational assessment of biological activities are discussed. Based on the obtained results, we conclude that academic organic chemistry studies could provide a significant impact on drug discovery due to the novelty and diversity of the designed and synthesized compounds; however, practical utilization of this potential is narrowed by the limited facilities for assaying biological activities.

AB  - Quercetin, a dietary-derived falvonol-type flavonoid, is ubiquitous in fruits and vegetables and plays important roles in human health by virtue of its antioxidant function. The present study was performed to investigate effects of quercetin on oxidative damage that was induced by an environmental endocrine disrupter, Aroclor 1254 (A1254), in cultured spermatogonial cells of embryonic chickens. Spermatogonial cells were dispersed from 18-day-old embryo and exposed to A1254 alone or in combination with quercetin. The oxidative damage was estimated by measuring contents of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS, an indicator of lipid peroxidation), activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD, a scavenger of superoxide), and activity of glutathione (GSH, an intracellular antioxidant). Results showed that quercetin had no deleterious effect on spermatogonial cells at 0.01 similar to 1 mu g/ml. Exposure to A1254 (10 mu g/ml) induced an increase of spermatogonial cell number, and membrane integrity was damaged by elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage. Exposure to A1254 also induced an elevation in TBARS but a decrease in SOD activity and GSH content. However, compared with A1254 treatment alone, simultaneous supplementation with quercetin decreased LDH leakage to maintain the cell integrity, decreased the levels of TBARS to quench the free radicals, increased SOD activity and GSH content to restore the endogenous antioxidant defense system. Thus, quercetin displayed protective effects on spermatogonial cells from A1254-induced oxidative damage through increasing intracellular antioxidant levels and decreasing lipid peroxidation. Consequently, the antioxidant, such as quercetin, from food or feed consumed by human and animals may attenuate the negative effects of environmental endocrine disrupters.

AB  - Introduction: Nutritional condition indices are morphophysiological estimators that quantify the nutritional status of organisms. In the natural habitat, unsatisfactory nutritional stage of numerous individuals is an expression of unfavorable factors. Objectives: Determine spatio-temporal variations in the nutritional condition of lobsters Panulirus argus, relate them to variations reported in the benthic community, and to demonstrate, through the application of analytical and morphometric indices, that variations of environmental factors affects both groups of indices due to its potential magnitude and its generalized nature. Methods: Lobsters were captured at six sites. Nutritional condition was estimated by three non-destructive, inexpensive and quick indices also easy to apply, which it means extensive indices: blood refractive index (BRI), relationship between total weight and total length (K), and condition factor (CFA). Because there are no historical records of BRI, long-term variations (60 years) were determined using morphometric indices (Klt and CFA). Data from the periods 1963-1964 (N = 29 001), 1983-1993 (N = 3 123) and 2011-2017 (N = 3 600) were analyzed, separating them in the rainy and dry seasons. Results: In all the periods the nutritional condition varied significantly between sites, but without similarities between periods. Despite this, it increased progressively in three sites. This indicates that factors impacting nutritional condition have a stochastic influence that is constantly changing, which is more characteristic of environmental factors than anthropogenic factors. Although the three indices showed a lower nutritional condition in 2017, only BRI gradually decreased between 2011 (16.6) and 2017 (14.2), which suggests that this index, and the morphometrics (Klt and CFA), express different information. All correlations were statistically significant but greatest coefficients were established between morphometric indices. The total weight and the Klt index did not show differences between rainy and dry seasons. However, BRI and CFA were statistically greater in dry season, a fact that was found for each sex. Both CFA and Klt decreased slightly (P > 0.05) between the first (1963-1964) and the second (1983-1993) period and then increased (P < 0.05) in the current period (2011-2017). Because they both are morphometric indices, this was attributed to the presence of greater weight lobsters. Conclusions: The lowest values in 2017 and gradually decreasing trend in BRI, corroborate the generalized nature of the environmental deterioration in the Gulf of Batabano, but this was not equally expressed by the three indices.

AB  - The present work aimed to investigate golden grey mullet (Liza aurata) liver protection versus damage responses at a polluted coastal lagoon, Ria de Aveiro (Portugal), as a tool to evaluate the human impacts on environmental health at five critical sites in Ria de Aveiro (Portugal) in comparison to a reference site (Torreira; TOR). Protection was evaluated by measuring non-enzymatic [total glutathione (GSHt) and non-protein thiols (NPT)] and enzymatic [catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR)] antioxidant defenses. Damage was assessed as DNA integrity loss and lipid peroxidation (LPO). No significant differences were found between sites in terms of non-enzymatic defenses (GSHt and NPT). CAT did not display significant differences among sites. However, GPx at Barra (BAR, associated with naval traffic), Gafanha (GAF, harbor and dry-dock activities area), Laranjo (LAR, metal contaminated associated with chlor-alkali plant), and Vagos (VAG, contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) was significantly lower than the reference site. GST was lower at GAF, Rio Novo do Principe (RIO, pulp mill effluent area), LAR, and VAG, whereas GR was lower at RIO. The loss of antioxidant defenses was paralleled by higher LPO levels only at GAF and VAG. However, no DNA integrity loss was found. Results highlight the importance of the adopted multibiomarkers as applied in the liver of L. aurata in coastal water pollution monitoring. The integration of liver antioxidant defense and damage responses can improve the aquatic contamination assessment.

AB  - P>1. The use of species traits to interpret biological changes in invertebrate assemblages across environmental gradients has been suggested as a method to improve discrimination over existing species composition methods. One reason for greater potential discrimination and predictive ability is the assumed universality of traits across a range of spatial and temporal scales. We explore this assumption by comparing the consistency of stressor-response relationships of a trait characteristic (percent clinging taxa) and a common taxonomy-based metric [percent Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT)] over a stressor gradient of increasing benthic fine sediment.
   2. We use invertebrate assemblage and environmental data from three large-scale surveys that cover the western United States, eastern United States and the Mid-Atlantic Highlands of the US. These three datasets allow us to compare stressor-response relationships in terms of geographic position (west versus east) and spatial scale (entire east versus a sub-region of the east). We compare the slopes and intercepts of the two measures of assemblage response.
   3. Trait characteristics exhibited more consistent stressor-response relationships than identity characteristics. Stressor-response relationships generated for clinging invertebrate richness had statistically similar slopes over sediment gradients, regardless of spatial scale or geographic location. In contrast, slopes were significantly different for relationships generated with EPT richness over sediment gradients.
   4. Results of this study support the hypothesis that trait-based measures have a more consistent response to a stressor gradient than identity-based assemblage measures. Choosing consistent measures of community response will facilitate comparisons among assemblages across large spatial scales.

AB  - P>1. Urbanisation and landuse changes threaten the ecological integrity of rivers and streams globally. A major challenge in such impacted environments is to develop functional indicators for use by waterway managers. We first reviewed cellulose decomposition potential (CDP) as one such indicator, and here present current understanding and highlight the knowledge gaps which hinder its widespread incorporation into programmes monitoring stream health. In a field study, we also evaluated two differing cellulose materials (Shirley soil burial test material and unbleached calico) and measurement techniques.
   2. We also investigated the effects of urbanisation and riparian cover on CDP as a standardised indicator of ecosystem function. Cotton fabrics were deployed in paired open and closed reaches across six stream catchments varying in degree of urbanisation (in south-eastern Australia). After 7, 14 and 21 days materials were retrieved and their decomposition assessed in conjunction with a number of physicochemical variables.
   3. We observed a strong positive relationship between the decomposition of Shirley and calico materials, thus indicating unbleached calico is an effective substitute for Shirley test cloth, which is no longer available.
   4. Across sites, CDP was positively correlated with ammonium concentrations and also, to a lesser extent, with filterable reactive phosphorus and sediment silt and clay content/carbon availability. Despite these relationships, cellulose decomposition was not correlated with urbanisation or riparian cover.
   5. Cellulose decomposition is a simple, rapid and sensitive functional indicator of water quality and associated anthropogenic landuse changes and is thus a valuable tool for monitoring stream health.

AB  - Clearing tropical vegetation impacts biodiversity, the provision of ecosystem services, and thus ultimately human welfare. We quantified changes in land cover from 2000 to 2015 across the Cerrado biome of northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil. We assessed the potential biophysical and socio-economic drivers of the loss of Cerrado, natural regeneration and net cover change at the municipality level. Further, we evaluated correlations between these land change variables and indicators of human welfare. We detected extensive land cover changes in the study area, with the conversion of 23 446 km(2) and the natural regeneration of 13 926 km(2), resulting in a net loss of 9520 km(2). The annual net loss (-1.2% per year) of the cover of Cerrado is higher than that reported for the whole biome in similar periods. We argue that environmental and economic variables interact to underpin rates of conversion of Cerrado, most severely affecting more humid Cerrado lowlands. While rates of Cerrado regeneration are important for conservation strategies of the remaining biome, their integrity must be investigated given the likelihood of encroachment. Given the high frequency of land abandonment in tropical regions, secondary vegetation is fundamental to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services. Finally, the impacts of Cerrado conversion on human welfare likely vary from local to regional scales, making it difficult to elaborate land-use policies based solely on socio-economic indicators.

AB  - Due to Turkey's reliance on imported electricity, it has been using hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) to cover some of its electrical energy needs since 2011. However, HPP projects, which do not take landscape sensitivity into account, cause the ecological integrity of the basins and the ecosystem structure to deteriorate. This study presents the Tokat-Niksar HPP project field example in Turkey's Central Black Sea region with its steep slopes, rich forest and creek vegetation, protected endemic plants and wildlife, cultural heritage dating back to 3000 BC agricultural activities, and long-established local culture. The study, in fact, aims to develop a landscape restoration plan that considers the sensitivity of landscapes in the HPP project area. For this purpose, a landscape sensitivity analysis consisting of water, habitat, visibility, erosion functions, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) determining priority of functions conducted with experts were performed. According to the results, the water function was found to have the highest, and the visibility the lowest priority in the ranking. Consequently, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-degree sensitive areas with very high, high, and moderate landscape sensitivity were determined by weighted sum function by considering the priority of each landscape function, and accordingly, a five-stage landscape restoration model was developed including soil protection, areas to be protected, erosion control, vegetation screening, and creek reclamation. This study presents a framework for sustainable landscape restoration solutions in the town by combining landscape sensitivity analysis via MCDA.

AB  - Whereas habitat conservation plans (HCPs) have been intended to provide comprehensive environmental mitigation for multiple species, they often narrow in focus to one species and either one mitigation site or unspecified sites. We developed an indicators framework from which to rate land units for their ecological integrity, collateral values (nonbiological qualities that can improve conservation), and restoration and conservation opportunities. The ratings of land units were guided by the tenets of conservation biology and principles of landscape and ecosystem ecology, and they were made using existing physical and floral information managed on a GIS. As an example of how the indicators approach can be used for HCPs, the 29 legally rare species targeted by the Yolo County HCP were each associated with vegetation complexes and agricultural crops, the maps of which were used for rating some of the landscape indices. The ratings were mapped so that mitigation can be directed to the places on the landscape where the legally rare species should benefit most from conservation practices. The most highly rated land units for conservation opportunity occurred along streams and sloughs, especially where they emerged from the foothills and entered the Central Valley and where the two largest creeks intersected the Sacramento River flood basin. We recommend that priority be given to mitigation or conservation at the most highly rated land units. The indices were easy to measure and can be used with other tools to monitor the mitigation success. The indicators framework can be applied to other large-area planning efforts with some modifications.

AB  - Oceans absorb a huge part of the atmospheric heat, leading to the rise in water temperature. Reefs are among the most affected ecosystems, where the complex behavioral repertoire of fishes is usually an indicator of environmental impacts. Here, we examined whether temperature (28 and 34 degrees C) and habitat complexity (high and low) interact to affect the agonistic behavior (mirror test) of the dusky damselfish (Stegastes fuscus), a key species in Brazilian reefs because of its gardening capacity and territorial behavior. Higher temperatures altered basal behavior in both high and low-complexity conditions. Fish kept at 28 degrees C under the high-complexity condition were more aggressive than those at a higher temperature (34 degrees C) and in a low-complexity condition, which also exhibited lower dispersion. Our data show that changes in behavior of coral reef fish is associated to fluctuations in environmental conditions. Thus, it is important to implement management or conservation strategies that could mitigate global change effects.

AB  - The conservation and restoration of freshwater ecosystems require the understanding of potential biota of the target area. My ultimate study goal was to clarify the potential fauna of the watershed unit of the Japanese archipelago, a hotspot of biodiversity. Here, I attempted to classify the macroinvertebrate community of the major rivers within the Japanese archipelago, thereby elucidating its biogeography, and to investigate the extent to which environmental factors drive the watershed?s macroinvertebrate community. I classified the rivers located in the northern region of the Japanese archipelago geographically, but did not group the geographically adjacent rivers in the western region together. Differences in watershed size, geological history (including river conflict), and paleo-drainage systems seem to affect the classification results. Moreover, Indicator Species Analysis results suggest that river groups in the northern part of the Japanese archipelago had highly endemic species, whereas, the river groups in the western part of the Japanese archipelago had few highly endemic species. The result of the canonical correspondence analysis indicated that topographic factors, the flow regime, geology, water quality, and anthropogenic factors were significantly correlated with macroinvertebrate classification and distribution. The results of the decision tree model indicated that water temperature and maximum specific discharge were explanatory factors in the classification of the macroinvertebrate community. Further, my results also suggest that environmental factors at a smaller scale than that of the watershed were needed to explain further subdivisions in classification of the macroinvertebrate community.

AB  - Key decisions in the design of biomonitoring programs include taxonomic resolution, geographic extent, and site selection, each of which can affect our ability to infer human impacts on biodiversity from biomonitoring data. These decisions are constrained by monitoring goals and budget limitations, which may require trade-offs between them. In this study, we use species distribution models (SDMs) to assess the effects of key decisions in biomonitoring design on our ability to infer the effects of natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions on the occurrence of benthic macroinvertebrates in streams. We compared 4 datasets that differ in their site-selection strategy, geographic extent, and taxonomic resolution using data from Swiss federal and cantonal biomonitoring programs. We used individual SDMs with 3-fold cross validation to identify the environmental variables that best predict the probability of taxa occurrence across the datasets. We then used a hierarchical multi-species distribution model (hmSDM) to identify how key aspects of biomonitoring design influence the relative importance of the selected explanatory (predictor) variables in the model as well as the model's predictive performance. The relative importance of the explanatory variables in the hmSDMs was lowest for the dataset with a grid-based site-selection approach and family-level resolution. An increase in predictive performance was achieved by either using a species-level taxonomic resolution for Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera or by combining different biomonitoring programs at the family level to increase the number of sites and improve the coverage of environmental conditions. Selecting monitoring sites to provide a good coverage of environmental conditions, while also targeting sites with rare combinations of environmental conditions, could further improve biomonitoring program data. Models based on finer taxonomic resolution revealed that widespread families consist of species and genera with different and stronger responses to environmental conditions. However, many families include species that are too rare to allow inference of significant responses to environmental conditions. We show that hmSDMs of stream invertebrates can contribute to the selection of specific taxa for identification at finer taxonomic resolution. This strategy could facilitate the standardization and combination of multiple biomonitoring datasets and improve the identifiability of stream invertebrate responses to environmental conditions in biomonitoring programs.

AB  - Identification of spatial gradients in ecosystem vulnerability to global climate change and local stressors is an important step in the formulation and implementation of appropriate countermeasures(1,2). Here we build on recent work to map ecoregional exposure to future climate, using an envelope-based gauge of future climate stability-defined as a measure of how similar the future climate of a region will be to the present climate(3,4). We incorporate an assessment of each ecoregion's adaptive capacity, based on spatial analysis of its natural integrity-the proportion of intact natural vegetation-to present a measure of global ecosystem vulnerability. The relationship between intactness (adaptive capacity) and stability (exposure) varies widely across ecoregions, with some of the most vulnerable, according to this measure, located in southern and southeastern Asia, western and central Europe, eastern South America and southern Australia. To ensure the applicability of these findings to conservation, we provide a matrix that highlights the potential implications of this vulnerability assessment for adaptation planning and offers a spatially explicit management guide.

AB  - Population dynamics studies and harvesting strategies often take advantage of body size measurements. Selected elements of the skeletal system such as mandibles, are often used as retrospective indices to describe body size. The variation in mandibular measurements reflects the variation in the ecological context and hence the variation in animal performance. We investigated the length of the anterior and posterior sections of the mandible in relation to the conditions experienced by juveniles of 8-10 months of age during prenatal and early postnatal life and we evaluated these parameters as ecological indicators of juvenile condition as well as female reproductive condition in a roe deer population living in the southern part of the species range. We analyzed a sample of over 24,000 mandibles of roe deer shot in 22 hunting districts in the Arezzo province (Tuscany, Central Italy) from 2005 to 2015 per age class. Mandible total length in juveniles is equal to 90% of total length in adults. In this stage of life the growing of the mandible's anterior section is already completed while that of the posterior section is still ongoing. Environmental conditions conveyed by forest productivity, agricultural land use, local population density and climate strongly affected the growth of the anterior and posterior sections of the mandibles. Conditions experienced both by pregnant females and offspring played an important role in shaping the length of the anterior section, while the size of the posterior section was found to be related to the conditions experienced by offspring. Temporal changes of the length of the anterior section are a particularly suitable index of growth constraints. Anterior section length in fact differs according to more or less advantageous conditions recorded not only in the year of birth, but also in the previous year. Similarly, the sexual size dimorphism of the anterior section of the roe deer mandible can be used to describe the quality of females above two years of age, as well as habitat value. Hence the anterior section length of the mandible and its sexual size dimorphism are indexes that can provide cues of population performance, because they capture the system's complexities, while remain simple enough to be easily and routinely used in the majority of European countries where roe deer hunting period extends from early autumn to late spring.

AB  - The abundance and taxonomic richness of the adult aquatic insect fauna were determined at two sites located 2 km apart on the Ethiope River, Delta State, Nigeria. Adults were collected by ultraviolet light traps and sweep nets on seven occasions between May and November 2010. Twenty-eight (28) different taxa were identified and 869 individuals were caught at sites 1 and 2 combined. The orders represented were Diptera, Odonata, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera in decreasing order of abundance. The distribution of these organisms varied from site 1 to 2 according to the different human activities, abiotic factors and riparian vegetation at the sites. Generally, the most dominant taxonomic order was Diptera, closely followed by Odonata, while the least dominant was Plecoptera. Margalef's species richness (d), Shannon-Weiner diversity and evenness (E) indices were significantly higher (P < 0.05) at site 1.

AB  - Ecotourism originated in the 1980s, at the dawn of sustainable development, as a way to channel tourism revenues into conservation and development. Despite the "win-win" idea, scholars and practitioners debate the meaning and merits of ecotourism. We conducted a review of 30 years of ecotourism research, looking for empirical evidence of successes and failures. We found the following trends: Ecotourism is often conflated with outdoor recreation and other forms of conventional tourism; impact studies tend to focus on either ecological or social impacts, but rarely both; and research tends to lack time series data, precluding authors from discerning effects over time, either on conservation, levels of biodiversity, ecosystem integrity, local governance, or other indicators. Given increasing pressures on wild lands and wildlife, we see a need to add rigor to analyses of ecotourism. We provide suggestions for future research and offer a framework for study design and issues of measurement and scaling.

AB  - The appropriateness of species richness as an ecological indicator or decision variable for setting conservation and management priorities depends on many assumptions. Most critical is that current levels of species richness allow prediction of future contributions of various locations to biodiversity conservation and ecological function. Also important is the assumption that estimates of species richness can be compared among locations. Challenges arise because estimates of species richness are affected by area, scale and intensity of sampling, taxonomic grouping, estimation methods, and the dynamic nature of species richness. Nonetheless, species richness can contribute to prioritizing locations for biodiversity conservation provided it is not used in isolation-additional metrics, such as species composition, endemism, functional significance, and the severity of threats, are also required. The spatial domain of measurement also must be documented and justified. A multicriteria decision process is more likely to realize comprehensive conservation goals than prioritization of locations based on species richness alone. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
