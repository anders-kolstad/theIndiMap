AB  - During summer 2019 15 specimens of round-scaled barbell (Barbus cyclolepis Heck-el, 1837) and 12 specimens of Orpheus dace (Squahus orpheus Kottelat & Economidis, 2006) from Topolnitsa River were collected and examined with standard techniques for parasites. Helminth parasites were recorded in 9round-scaled barbell specimens (60%) and 7 Orpheus dace specimens (58.33%) from Topolnitsa River. Only one parasite species was identified in both cyprinid fishes - the acanthocephalan species Pomphorhynchus laevis (Zoega in.duller, 1776). Bioindicator significance of established parasite species was discussed fyr ecological evaluation of the state of the studied freshwater ecosystem. New data for the helminths of round-scaled barbell and Orpheus dace from Topolnitsa River are presented.

AB  - In the last decades, anthropogenic disturbances have altered the ability of soils to provide diverse functions. Certain anthropogenic soils, with a low fertility level and often contaminated, ended up underused and derelict. Although derelict for humans, these soils may be refuges for biodiversity, but their biological functioning remains poorly understood. To this end, a trait-based approach of soil invertebrate communities might be an effective predictor of ecosystem state. The present work aims to highlight the in situ links between the abiotic characteristics of derelict soils and the taxonomic and functional structure and composition (through a trait-based approach) of macrofauna and Collembola communities inhabiting these soils. We studied 6 different derelict soils: two soils from coking plants, one soil from a settling pond, two constructed soils, and an inert waste storage soil. We measured fifteen abiotic soil parameters that inform on fertility and contamination. We took into account sixteen traits and ecological preferences to characterize the functional structure and composition of Collembola and macrofauna communities. Soil fertility (organic matter content, C:N ratio, P, Ca and Mg concentrations, cation-exchange capacity, and clay content) and moderate contamination (Pb, Cd, Zn, and PAH concentrations) altered the taxonomic and functional composition of Collembola and macrofauna communities by selecting traits such as body length, pigmentation, vertical distribution, diet type, and habitat preference. Compost-amended constructed soil properties selected taxonomic and functional community composition of slightly disturbed soil. In contrast, metal-contaminated constructed soil harbored a higher proportion of Collembola displaying the traits and ecological preferences of instable ecosystems. The study of functional profiles of Collembola and macrofauna communities in the derelict soils evidenced that they support different communities with more or less wide functional potential. It underlines the interest of multiple biotic component studies to reach a better ecosystem description.

AB  - In the high-mountain tributaries of the Sulak and Samur river basins, the variability of the morphological characteristics of brook trout was studied and the density of the trout population was estimated. Trapping of brook trout was carried out by the method of rut with the help of a net trap, dragnet and specially designed fishing gear. In the basin of the Sulak river 18 medium and small tributaries were chosen as a model ones, and 13 tributaries in the basin of the Samur river. The conducted studies showed that in all the streams under consideration the brook trout made non-extended migrations inside the rivers between spawning and feeding grounds. Comparative data on brook trout of mountain rivers testifies to the extraordinary plasticity of this fish, while each of the studied populations of trout on a number of grounds different from each other. The fluctuations in morphometric traits do not extend beyond the species specificity because they are ecological forms of single taxonomic category. In recent years due to anthropogenic impacts a decrease in spawning grounds and the number of brook trout. of mountain rivers has been occur. Brook trout is a freshwater form of the Ciscaucasian trout, so the populations of brook trout can serve as an important reserve for the recovery of the migratory population - the Ciscaucasian trout. In this regard, to increase the reserves of both brook trout and Ciscaucasian trout, we recommend in the high-mountain tributaries of the Sulak and Samur rivers to organize artificial breeding of brook trout, and fry them to be released into spring sources, while it is necessary to expand the protective zone of the state nature reserve of Federal importance "Tlyaratinsky" by including a number of key watercourses in it, which will create a promising trout site.

AB  - Environmental research has contributed significantly since 1990 to a strong reduction of environmental pollution associated with dairy farming in the Netherlands. To judge possible pollution, state indicators and threshold values are distinguished. Threshold values for: (i) N and P in ground- and surface-water, (ii) air quality in terms of ammonia and greenhouse gasses and (iii) deposition rates of N on nature areas, are still exceeded. New approaches are needed as the EU dairy quota system will expire in 2015 and production is likely to increase. Four are suggested: (i) change the top-down character of regulations to a bottom-up self-governing procedure where farmers receive clear guidelines and are challenged by government and assisted by research to meet them. The future commitment of farmers is crucial as "the low environmental fruit" has been harvested; (ii) abolish confusing and overly complex proxy systems and focus on direct measurement of state indicators, using newly developed sensing systems and proper statistical sampling procedures for expressing variability; (iii) make the derivation of threshold values for environmental state indicators more science-based and transparent and start with focusing on individual farms and nature areas to be followed by upscaling to regions and the entire country. (iv) Follow the recommendations of the Trojan report and develop comprehensive regional management plans and a strategic plan for the entire country. Environmental research has been fragmented and often reactive rather than pro-active. Recent research on farm level, using life cycle analysis, applies an integrated approach to study water, air and soil qualities as well as economic aspects and can therefore form the basis for future management plans on farm level and for regional and national plans, all to be focused on sustainable development.

AB  - Sediment grain size, and specifically changes in the percent mud content (i.e. the fraction <63 mu m) over time is often used as an indicator of estuarine environmental health. Using sediment samples from three distinct estuarine systems, we determined that different analytical methods (laser diffraction and wet sieving) gave significantly different results in terms of percent mud content. These differences are also ecologically meaningful when considering the influence of mud on estuarine macrofauna. We propose an approach to measuring sediment grain size termed Environmentally Available Sediment (EAS), which advocates for the measurement of the sediment that biota are directly exposed to. For the purposes of environmental monitoring, it is also essential to monitor sediment grain size in a repeatable way which is likely to be achieved using consistent (or no) pre-treatment and the use of a measurement technique that is unlikely to change over time, e.g. wet sieving.

AB  - The larch (Larix) genus is the most important species group in the forest ecosystems in Northeastern China, occupying about 25% of the forest areas. The high tolerance to coldness and relatively fast growth rate make this genus the main species group for forestation. According to the predictions of the global circulation model CGCM3, temperature could rise by 2-4 degrees C over the next 100 years. Few studies have been conducted on the response of larch species to climate warming in Northeastern China. Such studies are becoming increasingly needed due to the economic and ecological significance of this genus. This paper studies the potential distribution ranges of three larch species under the current and the warming climate conditions. A new classification and regression tree technique, Random Forest, was used to investigate the potential distributions of three larch species, based on 18 environmental variables which reflect the climate, topography and soil conditions of Northeastern China. The results showed that the biological coldness index (BCI) is the most important factor for Dahurian larch, annual precipitation (AP) is the most important factor for Korean larch and elevation (DEM) is the most important factor for Prince Rupprecht larch.
   Under the current climate regime, in general, the prediction accuracy for the training dataset is much higher than that of testing dataset. The prediction accuracy for Dahurian larch is much higher than that of other two larch species. Under three climate warming scenarios, the southeast boundary of suitable habitat of Dahurian Larch was modeled to retreat northwestward by 90 km (CGCM3-B1) via 105 km (CGCM3-Al B) to 140 km (CGCM3-A2) scenario. The potential area would thus decrease from 25.5 million ha currently to 13, 9.5 and 7.2 million ha, correspondingly. The northwest boundary of suitable habitat for Korean larch was modeled move northwestward by 100 km (CGCM3-B 1) via 125 km (CGCM3-A1B) to 340 krn (CGCM3-A2), while the southern boundary may move northeastward 125 km via 170-200 km, respectively. The modeled potential area thus decreased from 14.6 million ha to 14.5, 12.6 and 9.7 million ha, correspondingly. The suitable habitat of Prince Rupprecht Larch was modeled to disappear under each of the three scenarios. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many factors must be considered in order to develop and implement treatment systems to improve the microbial quality of surface water and prevent the accidental introduction of plant and human pathogens into vegetable crops. The efficacy of chlorine. gas (Cl-2(g))and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) injection systems in combination with rapid sand filtration (RSF) was evaluated in killing fecal indicator microorganisms in irrigation water in a vegetable-intensive production area. The efficacy of ClO2 and Cl-2(g) was variable throughout the distribution systems and coliform bacteria never dropped below levels required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for recreational waters. Sampling date and sampling point had a significant effect on the abundance of coliforms in Cl(2()g())- and ClO2-treated water. Sampling date and sampling point also had a significant effect on the abundance of generic Escherichia coli in Cl-2(g) treated water but only sampling point was significant in ClO2 treated water. Although the waterborne plant pathogen Phytophthora capsici was detected in five different sources of surface irrigation water using baiting and P. capsici-specific PCR, in vitro studies indicated that ClO2 at concentrations similar to those used to treat irrigation water did not reduce mycelial growth or direct germination of P. capsici sporangia and reduced zoospore populations by less than 50%. This study concludes that injection of ClO2 and Cl-2(g) into surface water prior to rapid sand filtration is inadequate in reducing fecal indicator microorganism populations and ClO2 ineffectively kills infectious propagules of P. capsici. Additional research is needed to design a system that effectively targets and significantly reduces both plant and human pathogens that are present in surface irrigation water. A model for a multiple barrier approach to treating surface water for irrigation is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Chico river, located in the center of Santa Cruz, runs 600 km from its source to its mouth. In its middle reaches, is the town of Gobernador Gregores (48 degrees 45' 3 '' S, 70 degrees 14' 54 '' W), which exerts influence on the river through agricultural activities and the discharge of urban sewages. In order to know the degree of impact on the water quality of the river, the analysis of the community of benthic macroinvertebrates was carried out and the Biotic Monitoring Patagonian Streams (BMPS) index was calculated. A first survey was performed in March 2017 at six sampling stations arranged in a gradient design, with two control stations upstream and four stations downstream of the town. At each station, water samples were taken for physicochemical analysis, environmental data were recorded with a multiparameter probe, and four samples of macrobenthos were collected using a Surber network with 0.5 mm mesh. The collected organisms were identified and counted under optic and stereoscopic microscopes. For each sample, species richness (S), total abundance (N), diversity (H') and evenness (J) were calculated, and the abundance data were analyzed using multivariate statistics. A total of 25 taxa were identified. The best represented were the oligochaetes Naididae, the hirudineans, the mollusks Chilinidae and Lymnaeidae, and the insects Chironomidae, Baetidae and Glossosomatidae. At the stations located downstream closest to the town the community was dominated by oligochaetes and chironomids, and presented the lowest values of S, H' and J. The values of BlViPS at these stations indicated the existence of polluted to heavily polluted water. At the control and the furthest downstream stations, the values of S, H' and J increased significantly, and the BlViPS index indicated better conditions in the environmental quality of the river.

AB  - Hypotheses on the factors affecting forage fish species distributions are often proposed but rarely evaluated using a comprehensive suite of indices. Using 24 predictor indices, we compared competing hypotheses and calculated average models for the distributions of capelin, age-0 Pacific cod, and age-0 pollock in the eastern Bering Sea from 2006 to 2010. Distribution was described using a two stage modeling approach: probability of occurrence ("presence") and density when fish were present. Both local (varying by location and year) and annual (uniform in space but varying by year) indices were evaluated, the latter accounting for the possibility that distributions were random but that overall presence or densities changed with annual conditions. One regional index, distance to the location of pre flexion larvae earlier in the year, was evaluated for age-0 pollock. Capelin distributions were best predicted by local indices such as bottom depth, temperature, and salinity. Annual climate (May sea surface temperature (SST), sea ice extent anomaly) and wind (June wind speed cubed) indices were often important for age-0 Pacific cod in addition to local indices (temperature and depth). Surface, midwater, and water column age-0 pollock distributions were best described by a combination of local (depth, temperature, salinity, zooplankton) and annual (May SST, sea ice anomaly, June wind speed cubed) indices. Our results corroborated some of those in previous distribution studies, but suggested that presence and density may also be influenced by other factors. Even though there were common environmental factors that influenced all species' distributions, it is not possible to generalize conditions for forage fish as a group.

AB  - A Sediment Quality Triad (SQT) study consisting of chemical characterization in sediment, sediment toxicity and bioaccumulation testing, and benthic community assessments was performed in the Lower Hackensack River, New Jersey. Chemistry data in sediment and porewater were evaluated based on the equilibrium partitioning approach and other published information to investigate the potential for chemical effects on benthic organisms and communities. Relationships were supported by laboratory toxicity and bioaccumulation experiments to characterize chemical effects and bioavailability. Benthic community results were evaluated using a regional, multimetric benthic index of biotic integrity and four heterogeneity indices. Evidence of slight benthic community impairment was observed in five of nine sediment sample stations. Severe lethal toxicity to amphipods (Leptocheirus plumulosus) occurred in four of these five stations. Although elevated total chromium concentrations in sediment (as high as 1900 mg/kg) were the rationale for conducting the investigation, toxicity was strongly associated with concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) rather than total chromium. PAH toxic units (Sigma PAH TU) in sediment and Sigma PAH concentrations in laboratory organisms from the bioaccumulation experiment showed a clear dose-response relationship with toxicity, with 0% survival observed in sediments in which Sigma PAH TU > 1-2 and Sigma PAH concentrations in Macoma nasuta were >2 mu mol/g, lipid weight. Metals detected in sediment and porewater, with the possible exception of copper, did not correlate with either toxicity or levels in tissue, likely because acid-volatile sulfide levels exceeded concentrations of simultaneous extracted metals at all sample locations. The study reinforces the value of using multiple lines of evidence approaches such as the SQT and the importance of augmenting chemical and biological analyses with modeling and/or other approaches to evaluate chemical bioavailability and toxicity of sediments.

AB  - As a land-sea interface, the fingerprints of climate perturbations may be immediately and profoundly felt in sandy beaches and the macroinvertebrates they harbour. In particular, extreme climatological events can result in long-lasting or irreversible ecological changes, and therefore, it has become critical to understand how these ecosystems respond to strong pulse perturbations. This study assessed the main impacts prompted by the 2015-2016 El Nino on a Southwestern Atlantic sandy beach ecosystem. A long-term (1982-2019) analysis was carried out, attending historical climate components and multilevel indicators of change across levels of ecological organization. The trophic networks of four ecosystem states were compared, and the macroinvertebrate community structure was analysed in terms of species richness, abundance and biomass and deconstructed by taxonomy, beach zone occupied, feeding, and developmentmodes. The potential recovery pathway of the system was also assessed. Climatic effects were reflected in a marked increase in sea surface temperature anomalies, rainfall, and in the discharge of thewidest estuary of theworld (Rio de la Plata). An abrupt disruption of ecological attributes due to El Nino effects was evidenced. After the event, the ecosystem shifted to a higher organization of the flow structure (Ascendency), a lower adaptive potential (Overhead), and a marked increase in efficiency (Robustness), reflecting a more vulnerable state to absorb disturbances. The decrease in species abundance and biomass was particularly noticeable in molluscs, filter feeders, and low intertidal/subtidal groups. By contrast, polychaetes/deposit feederswere favoured, triggering a transitional community state dominated by opportunistic species. The results highlight how extreme climatic events could prevent the recovery of a sandy beach ecosystem, as pulses may induce lag and legacy effects. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ecological risks of pesticides to wildlife are assessed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with a simple quotient model. A risk factor is calculated by dividing the estimated dietary concentration by the chemical's dietary toxicity. The risk factor, which can be used to predict population mortality, serves ns a regulatory criterion to identify compounds that could pose unacceptable risk. Under the ''New Paradigm, '' the Environmental Protection Agency recently cut by 50% the critical risk factor, yielding more-rigorous decision-making criteria by decreasing acceptable wildlife mortality from 50 to 8.8% following one pesticide application and by increasing the number of pesticides that pose unacceptable risk to wildlife. The quotient model depends on at least one implicit and approximately 11 explicit assumptions; deviations from these assumptions may bias outputs and consequent regulatory decisions. To correct error-prone assumptions we present three modifications that improve ecological risk estimates. We used the agency's quotient model to survey risks to a regional avifauna (Florida birds) in relation to mosquito pesticide exposure (fenthion, malathion, and naled). Certain groups (small-bodied, insectivorous passerines) were predicted to face the highest ecological risk due to taxonomy, diet and body mass. Finally, we performed a risk assessment for Black-whiskered Vireos (Vireo altiloquus barbatulus) exposed to fenthion. The results revealed that this species could potentially suffer 42% mortality in a population exposed to one application of fenthion. Ecological risk assessments increasingly will be based on mathematical models. To improve predictions of the effects of xenobiotic compounds on wildlife, biologists-especially conservationists-should work with ecotoxicologists to improve current models, develop new models, and provide data to parameterize models. Equally important conservationists should participate in defining regulatory levels of ecological risk for wildlife.

AB  - Stream health is often measured by the multimetric benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI). For Puget Sound Lowland (PSL) streams, the B-IBI comprises ten metrics which quantify the well-being of benthic inhabitants of the stream. Each metric is converted to a score of 1, 3 or 5, where a higher value indicates a healthier stream with respect to the metric. Summing the metric scores yields the B-IBI. Stream health is then rated as very poor poor fair, good or excellent according to the index value.
   Different metrics may be measured on different scales. A scoring scheme is therefore required to standardize values across metrics. Conventional scoring for the B-IBI metrics requires subjective and space/time-dependent input on the cutoff points for discretizing each metric. In contrast, simple statistical standardization (centering and division by the standard deviation) appears to be more natural, is non-study-specific, and maps the metric space onto a continuous scale centered at 0. Comprising the same ten metrics of the PSL B-IBI, our stream health index for the Puget Sound Lowland (SHIPSL) is the sum of all statistically standardized scores. We use benthic taxonomy data on field samples from 1997 to develop a SHIPSL-based rating scheme of grades A to F for stream health. We also discuss an alternative version of SHIPSL defined using 'gold-standard' values.
   Bootstrap simulations are used to compare the performance of the two versions of SHIPSL to B-IBI in reflecting PSL stream health. Results show that both versions of SHIPSL are more efficient in measuring stream health. Without sacrificing information on underlying biological conditions, SHIPSL reduce bias and variability of the health index, and eliminates sensitivity of the rating to slight changes in the metric scoring scheme.

AB  - As a result of conducted air quality policy, including recent legal regulations (the local anti-smog resolution), the number of individual solid fuel heating devices in Cracow (Poland) gradually decreased. Reports on air quality in the city indicate that the concentration of pollutants in Cracow's air shows a downward trend. However, a similar tendency in terms of improving air quality is also observed in the entire voivodeship, where, as a result of analogous although less radical measures, the number of individual solid fuel heating devices is also decreasing. The paper discusses the impact of legal regulations in Cracow on the improvement of air quality in the context of changes taking place in nearby cities. Trends in changes in PM10 and BaP (PM10) concentrations are analyzed. The rate of decline of the analyzed pollutants concentrations is estimated with the use of nonparametric linear regression. Analysis showed that the rate of decline in the average annual concentrations of PM10 and BaP (PM10) in Cracow is always higher than for the analyzed cities of the Malopolskie Voivodeship. The difference is more pronounced with regard to the months of the heating season. The rate of changes for the average annual BaP (PM10) concentrations in Cracow, compared to other analyzed cities of the Malopolskie Voivodeship, is more intensive than in the case of PM10 concentrations (1.5 times stronger with regard to the months of the heating season). Since the concentration of BaP (PM10) is a better indicator of the effects of liquidation of high-emission furnaces than the concentration of PM10, it can be concluded that the impact of actions related to the improvement of air quality in Cracow in the context of changes taking place in selected cities of the Malopolskie Voivodeship is more visible.

AB  - Trace fossils are important evidence of benthic activity and proxies of bottom and interstitial water oxygen content, making them a promising tool to understand the oceanic redox evolution and extinction patterns during the end-Permian mass extinction (EPME). Detailed bed-by-bed ichnologic studies were performed at a high-resolution scale from two uppermost Permian sections (Shangsi and Dongpan) in South China, documenting the presence of Chondrites targionii, Chondrites isp., Nereites isp., Planolites isp. A, Planolites isp. B, Palaeophycus isp., Phycosiphon incertwn, Thalassinoides isp., and Zoophycos isp. The uppermost Permian strata at the Shangsi section mainly comprise siliceous limestone interbedded with illite-montmorillonite claystone and shale, recording a deep shelf setting. The uppermost Permian strata at the Dongpan section consist of mixed chert, mudstone and claystone, formed in a slope environment. Bioturbation index in uppermost Permian strata is mostly 1-2, but with thin intervals reaching 3-4. Fluctuating bioturbation intensities, ichnofaunal composition (Thalassinoides, Planolites, Zoophycos) and ethologies, as well as the ratio of highly reactive iron to total iron (Fe-Hr/Fe-r) and the proportion of the highly reactive iron pool in the form of pyrite (Fe-py/Fe-HR) suggest that bottom and interstitial oxygen levels were not permanently anoxic/euxinic, but were interrupted by brief periods of aerobic conditions during the latest Permian. Three bioturbation phases in the EPME are identified. Phase I is characterized by the absence of typical pascichnia ichnotaxa (e.g. Nereites isp.) and relatively large fodinichnia burrow (e.g., Planolites isp. B; Zoophycos isp.). Phase II mainly consists of smaller Planolites isp. A, Thalassinoides isp. and Chondrites isp., recording a transition from softground to firmground. Only occasional smaller Planolites isp. A occur in Phase III without any associated vertical burrows. Ichnodiversity and bioturbation index from Phase I to Phase III show a step by step decline, corresponding to the two-stage extinction patterns. Long-term environmental stress (e.g., oceanic anoxia, volcanic winter, global warming, ocean acidification, hypercapnia) may have played major role in the collapse of the infaunal ecospace and only facies-crossing, highly tolerant, opportunistic organisms may have persisted in otherwise vacant ecological niches in the aftermath of the extinction.

AB  - In rivers, the ecological effects of drought typically result in gradual adjustments of invertebrate community structure and functioning, punctuated by sudden changes as key habitats, such as wetted channel margins, become dewatered and dry. This paper outlines the development and application of a new index (Drought Effect of Habitat Loss on Invertebrates - DEHLI) to quantify the effects of drought on instream macroinvertebrate communities by assigning weights to taxa on the basis of their likely association with key stages of channel drying. Two case studies are presented, in which the DEHLI index illustrates the ecological development of drought conditions and subsequent recovery. These examples demonstrate persistent drought effects months or several years after river flows recovered. Results derived using DEHLI are compared with an established macroinvertebrate flow velocity-reactive index (Lotic-invertebrate Index for Flow Evaluation - LIFE score) and demonstrates its greater sensitivity to drought conditions. Data from a number of rivers in south east England were used to calibrate a statistical model, which was then used to examine the response of DEHLI and LIFE to a hypothetical multi-year drought. This demonstrated a difference in response between sampling seasons, with the spring model indicating a lagged response due to delayed recolonisation and the autumn model differentiating habitat loss and flow velocity-driven responses. The application of DEHLI and the principles which underlie it allow the effects of drought on instream habitats and invertebrates associated with short or long term weather patterns to be monitored, whilst also allowing the identification of specific locations where intervention via river restoration, or revision of existing abstraction licensing, may be required to increase resilience to the effect of anthropogenic activities exacerbated by climate change.

AB  - Maternal nutritional stress lowers the organic content of egg and slows the initial growth of larvae of sea urchins and bivalves. Also, larval nutritional stress changes the form and developmental sequence of larvae as an adjustment to scarce food. If effects of nutrient supplies in eggs were like those of nutrient supplies in planktonic food, then maternal nutrition would affect larval form and developmental plasticity in the same way as larval nutrition. We used natural variation in maternal habitat to test this hypothesis, using laboratory growth experiments. In the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, mothers from greater depth (100 m) had smaller ovaries and smaller eggs than mothers from shallower depth (<6 m), which indicated poorer maternal nutrition at depth. Effects of maternal habitat, gonad size, and egg size on larval growth rate were significant but small compared to the effect of abundance of larval food. The growth of larvae was little affected by differences in maternal habitat that had a large effect on fecundity and some effect on egg size. There were no effects on larval body or juvenile rudiment that resembled the developmental plasticity in response to larval food. Food-limited mothers did not produce larvae with larger larval feeding apparatus or retarded development of juvenile rudiments. Uncoupled morphogenetic effects of endogenous and exogenous nutrients should be advantageous where benthic and planktonic food supplies vary independently. Finely tuned responses to stimuli may restrict the evolutionary consequences of developmental plasticity. Because maternal nutrition did not affect form of the larvae, larval form can be used at on index of planktonic conditions affecting feeding larvae.

AB  - Background To assess the Volturno River pollution and its environmental impact on the Tyrrhenian Sea (Central Mediterranean Sea) caused by Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 32 PCBs and aldrin, alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, delta-BHC, gamma-BHC (lindane), 4,4 '- DDD, 4,4 '-DDE, 4,4 '-DDT, dieldrin, endosulfan I, endosulfan II, endosulfan sulphate, endrin, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide (isomer B) and methoxychlor have been selected and were analyzed in three different phases: dissolved phase (DP), suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediments. PCBs and OCPs were extracted using an SPE column for the DP and glass fiber filter for SPM and sediment samples. Cleaned extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detector (ECD) and mass spectrometry (MS) detector for PCBs and OCPs, respectively. Results Pollutants discharges of PCBs and OCPs into the sea were calculated in about 106.9 kg year(-1)(87.1 kg year(-1)of PCBs and 19.7 kg year(-1)of OCPs), showing that this river could be a major source of PCBs and OCPs pollution to the Central Mediterranean Sea. Total concentrations of PCBs ranged from 4.1 to 48.0 ng L(-1)in water (sum of DP and SPM) and from 4.3 to 64.3 ng g(-1)in sediment samples. The concentrations of total organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) obtained in water (sum of DP and SPM) ranged from 0.93 to 8.66 ng L(-1)and from 0.52 to 9.89 ng g(-1)in sediment samples. Principal component analysis shows that all PCB compounds are more likely to come from surface runoff than an atmospheric deposition. Conclusion The data show that higher levels of PCBs and OCPs were found in sediment samples than in DP and SPM samples, which are an indication of no fresh inputs of these compounds. Based on our results, unintentionally produced PCBs by industrial processes (and other processes) were considered to be the main sources of PCBs in Volturno River and Estuary sediments. Considering the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs), the Ecological Risk Index (ERI), the Risk Quotient (RQ) and the USEPA Environmental Quality Standards (EQS), the Volturno River and its Estuary would be considered an area in which the integrity is possibly at risk.

AB  - Smoke-haze episodes, caused by uncontrolled peat and forest fires, occur almost every year in the South-East Asian region with increased concentrations of PM2.5 (airborne particulate matter (PM) with diameter <= 2.5 mu m). Particulate-bound trace elements (TrElems), especially carcinogenic and toxic elements, were measured during smoke haze as well as non-haze periods in 2014 as they are considered to be indicators of potential health effects. The bioaccessibilities of 13 TrElems were investigated using two types of simulated lung fluids (SLFs), Gamble's solution and artificial lysosomal fluid CALF), instead of the commonly used leaching agent (water). The dissolution kinetics was also examined for these TrElems. Many TrElems showed higher solubility in SLFs, and were more soluble in ALF compared to the Gamble's solution. Cu, Mn and Cd were observed to be the most soluble trace elements in ALF, while in Gamble's solution the most soluble trace elements were Cu, Mn and Zn. The dissolution rates were highly variable among the elements. Health risk assessment was conducted based on the measured concentrations of TrElems and their corresponding toxicities for three possible scenarios involving interactions between carcinogenic and toxic TrElems and SLFs, using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) human health risk assessment model. The cumulative cancer risks exceeded the acceptable level (1 in a million i.e. 1 x 10(-6)). However, the estimation of health quotient (HQ) indicated no significant chronic toxic health effects. The risk assessment results revealed that the assessment of bioaccessibility of particulate-bound TrElems using water as the leaching agent may underestimate the health risk. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - When high-speed train runs in the environment with a large number of airborne particles, these particles may accumulate on the bogie of the train, which will further challenge the normal operation of the bogie and reduce the riding comfort and train safety. In order to prevent particles entering into the bogie area, different protective devices around the bogie are used. However, up to present, the systematical analysis on the protective effects of diverse protective measures against different types of particles are still very limited. In this study, with the widely-used shirt boards and spoilers as protective devices, the airborne particle transport processes around the bogie were simulated in the wind tunnel Lab. Three kinds of typical particles, including artificial snow particle, wheat bran (substitute of snowflake) and sieved soil, were chosen to represent different airborne particles under real conditions. Three evolution indexes, including the relative reduction ratio of artificial snow particles, the relative particle flux reduction ratio of fine wheat bran, and the relative concentration reduction ratio of fine sieve soil particles, were used to assess their protective effects. Results showed that the combination of short-skirt board and straight triangular spoiler (i.e., in A5 case, the straight triangle spoilers installed at the front and rear ends of the train bogie, and the short-skirt boards installed on both sides of the train bogie) was the best protection with the studied three particles. The relative reduction ratio of the average snow mass in this case was 75.59%, the relative reduction ratio of the flux in the level of fine wheat bran exceeded 78%, and the relative reduction ratio of the fine soil particle concentration was more than 96%.

AB  - Land-use and climate change are significantly affecting stream ecosystems, yet understanding of their long-term impacts is hindered by the few studies that have simultaneously investigated their interaction and high variability among future projections. We modeled possible effects of a suite of 2030, 2060, and 2090 land-use and climate scenarios on the condition of 70,772 small streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, United States. The Chesapeake Basin-wide Index of Biotic Integrity, a benthic macroinvertebrate multimetric index, was used to represent stream condition. Land-use scenarios included four Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, and B2) representing a range of potential landscape futures. Future climate scenarios included quartiles of future climate changes from downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 5 (CMIP5) and a watershed-wide uniform scenario (Lynch2016). We employed random forests analysis to model individual and combined effects of land-use and climate change on stream conditions. Individual scenarios suggest that by 2090, watershed-wide conditions may exhibit anywhere from large degradations (e.g., scenarios A1B, A2, and the CMIP5 25th percentile) to small degradations (e.g., scenarios B1, B2, and Lynch2016). Combined land-use and climate change scenarios highlighted their interaction and predicted, by 2090, watershed-wide degradation in 16.2% (A2 CMIP5 25th percentile) to 1.0% (B2 Lynch2016) of stream kilometers. A goal for the Chesapeake Bay watershed is to restore 10% of stream kilometers over a 2008 baseline; our results suggest meeting and sustaining this goal until 2090 may require improvement in 11.0%-26.2% of stream kilometers, dependent on land-use and climate scenario. These results highlight inherent variability among scenarios and the resultant uncertainty of predicted conditions, which reinforces the need to incorporate multiple scenarios of both land-use (e.g., development, agriculture, etc.) and climate change in future studies to encapsulate the range of potential future conditions.

AB  - In this study, we aim to reconstruct long-term limnoecological development of the clay-turbid Lake Tiilaanjarvi in Askola, southern Finland, using fossil Chironomidae assemblages. The study lake suffers from hypereutrophic conditions and late-winter and end-of-summer anoxia. The retrieved sediment record revealed a succession from oligo-mesotrophic (similar to AD 1940-2000) to eutrophic community (similar to AD 2000-2010) that finally reached hypereutrophic climax community in the most recent sediments. The initial state of the record was characterized by stable ecological conditions, but the biological integrity (community and functional diversity) was completely lost in the upper part of the sediment profile. The number of taxa markedly decreased following the nutrient enrichment and only one taxon (Chironomus plumosus-type), tolerant of temporary anoxia, remained in the surface sample. During the period of available observational data (since AD 1978), variance in midge community composition was mostly explained by limnological factors, namely total phosphorus (TP), whereas the influence of climate was statistically insignificant, thus enabling quantitative midge-based reconstruction of autumnal epilimnetic TP. The midge-based reconstruction showed an identical trend compared to sediment characteristics, which correspond to increased lake productivity and anthropogenic activities in the catchment. The inferred values for the initial state indicated mesotrophic conditions, which are typical for non-disturbed clay-turbid lakes in southern Finland, and a subsequent increase to eutrophic conditions, with hypereutrophic state reached at the top of the core. This development corresponds with the instrumentally monitored development. In addition, when the reconstruction was compared with the instrumental values, the inferences were mostly (75 % of the samples) within the error estimates of the model. The present results provide invaluable information on the limnoecological development of Lake Tiilaanjarvi, and more generally, support the theory that fossil remains of chironomids provide a useful tool for assessments of eutrophication history and biological integrity.

AB  - A large-scale field experiment was conducted to test whether the physical structure of biogenic reef habitat controls physical conditions (hydrodynamics and hydrographics) with subsequent influence on the performance (recruitment, growth, and survival) of a benthic suspension feeder. The experimental system consisted of restored subtidal oyster reefs inhabited by the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To determine whether the size of reefs influences the flow environment and oyster performance, reefs of four heights-tall (2 m), short (1 m), dredged (0.6 m), and low (0.1 m)-were constructed at 3-m water depth in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. To test whether oyster performance varies with water depth and hydrographic conditions, tall and short reefs were also constructed at 6-m water depth. Flow speed, sedimentation, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and the performance of oysters were measured as a function of reef height, position on reef, and water depth over a 10-mo period. Flow speed was found to increase on reefs with reef height and elevation on reefs. Rates of sediment deposition were seasonally highest where flow speed was lowest, at the bases of reefs, and seasonally decreased with increasing water depth. More than 90% of the surface area of low reefs was buried after only 16 mo of exposure in the estuary, indicating that reef height controls habitat quality (and quantity) indirectly through its effect on flow. Short reefs and the bases of tall reefs at 6-m depth were exposed to a total of 26 d of hypoxia/anoxia. No other reef treatment was exposed to >5 d of hypoxia.
   Physical conditions on experimental reefs had a profound influence on the performance of oysters as the flow environment alone explained 81% of variability in oyster growth and mortality. Recruitment of oysters over a 2-mo period was slightly higher on the front bases than the crests of reefs, but did not vary with reef height or water depth. After 10 mo, the shell growth and condition index of genetically similar, hatchery-raised oysters were greatest on the crests of tall and short reefs, where flow speed and quality of suspended food material were highest, and sediment deposition was lowest. Growth was greatest overall at the crests of tall reefs located at 6-m water depth where flow speed was high, and the numbers of days exposed to hypoxia/anoxia and variation in salinity were lowest. Total percentage mortality of oysters after 10 mo was greater on low reefs located at 3-m depth than on all other reef types and was greater on the bases than crests of tall, short, and dredged reefs. Predation by crabs and fishes accounted for 4-20% of total oyster mortality and showed no pattern across reef treatments. Results of this experiment indicate (1) that the physical structure and location of biogenic habitat controls local physical variables and (2) that, in turn, physical variables, especially flow speed, have a profound influence on the performance of a resident species. Realization that an ecological function of habitat is to indirectly control local population production through physical-biological coupling should improve our ability to conserve, restore, and manage habitat and associated species diversity. Better ecological engineering of restored oyster reef habitat is likely to improve fishery production and help maintain estuarine biodiversity.

AB  - As much as 70% of prairie wetlands in Canada have been lost. Although further degradation of natural wetlands is considered to be somewhat offset by wetland construction and restoration, Canada lacks bioassessment tools that can track ecosystem health in prairie wetlands. Indices of biological integrity (IBIS) use one or more biotic communities to compare the biological condition of a particular site to conditions found in least-impacted reference sites. Using the IBI approach, we evaluated the potential of 5 biotic communities to assess wetland health in northern prairie wetlands in Canada. Vegetation in the wet meadow, emergent and open-water zones as well as wetland-dependent songbirds and waterbirds were sampled at 81 semi-permanent/permanent natural and compensation wetlands spanning an environmental stress gradient. Metrics with strong linear relationships to the stress gradient (R-2 > 0.2) were combined into an IBI for each biotic community and were subsequently validated at a suite of test sites. After validation, the entire data set was combined and each IBI was evaluated based on its linear relationship to environmental stress. Wet meadow zone vegetation was a strong indicator of environmental stress (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.001). as was the wetland-dependent songbird community (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.001). The emergent zone vegetation community was a relatively weak and inconsistent indicator of environmental stress, while the open-water zone vegetation and waterbird communities were poor indicators. To evaluate whether monitoring more than one biotic community provided additional information about a site's biological and environmental condition, we produced a two-taxon IBI that combined wet meadow zone vegetation and wetland-dependent songbird metrics. The two-taxon IBI had a marginally stronger linear relationship to the stress gradient (R-2 = 0.72, p < 0.001) than any single biotic community alone, although we argue that this added information would not warrant the extra cost, effort, and logistical barriers of sampling both plants and birds. The wet meadow zone vegetation and wetland-dependent songbird IBIs were strong surrogates of one another (R-2 = 0.57). suggesting that wet meadow zone vegetation can be used to predict the health of wetland-dependent songbirds, and visa versa. Our results suggest that habitat for healthy wet meadow zone vegetation and wetland-dependent songbird communities is being degraded as compensation sites are replacing their natural analogs.

The aim of this study was to provide population-representative YLDs of noncommunicable diseases and injuries using a prevalence-based approach, with the disability weight measured in subjects with specific diseases or injuries. We included a total of 44969 adults, who completed the EQ-5D questionnaire as participation in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2014. We estimated the prevalence of each of 40 conditions identified from the noncommunicable diseases and injuries in the WHO list. Modified condition-specific disability-weight was determined from the adjusted mean difference of the EQ-5D index between the condition and reference groups. Condition -specific YLDs were calculated as the condition's prevalence multiplied by the condition's disability-weight. All-cause YLDs, estimated as "number of population x (1-mean score of EQ-5D)" were 2165 thousands in 39044 thousand adults aged >= 20. The combined YLDs for all 40 conditions accounted for 67.6% of all-cause YLDs, and were 1604, 2126, 8749, and 12847 per 100000 young (age 20-59) males, young females, old (age >= 60) males, and old females, respectively. Back pain/osteoarthritis YLDs were exceptionally large (442/40, 864/146, 2037/836, and 4644/3039 per 100000 young males, young females, old males, and old females, respectively). Back pain, osteoarthritis, depression, diabetes, periodontitis, and stroke accounted for 22.3%, 9.1%, 4.6%, 3.3%, 3.2%, and 2.9% of all cause YLDs, respectively. In conclusion, this estimation of YLDs using prevalence rates and disability-weights measured in a population-representative survey may form the basis for population-level strategies to prevent age-related worsening of disability.

AB  - Objectives: (1) To evaluate how ecosystem services may be utilized to either reinforce or fracture the planning and development practices that emerged from segregation and economic exclusion; (2) To survey the current state of ecosystem service assessments and synthesize a growing number of recommendations from the literature for renovating ecosystem service analyses.
   Methods: Utilizing current maps of ecosystem service distribution in Bushbuckridge Local Municipality, South Africa, we considered how a democratized process of assessing ecosystem services will produce a more nuanced representation of diverse values in society and capture heterogeneity in ecosystem structure and function.
   Results: We propose interventions for assessing ecosystem services that are inclusive of a broad range of stakeholders' values and result in actual quantification of social and ecological processes. We demonstrate how to operationalize a pluralistic framework for ecosystem service assessments.
   Conclusion: A democratized approach to ecosystem service assessments is a reimagined path to rescuing a poorly implemented concept and designing and managing future social-ecological systems that benefit people and support ecosystem integrity. It is the responsibility of scientists who do ecosystem services research to embrace more complex, pluralistic frameworks so that sound and inclusive scientific information is utilized in decision-making.

AB  - Switchgrass is being evaluated as a potential feedstock source for cellulosic biofuels and is being cultivated in several regions of the United States. The recent availability of switchgrass land cover maps derived from the National Agricultural Statistics Service cropland data layer for the conterminous United States provides an opportunity to assess the environmental conditions of switchgrass over large areas and across different geographic locations. The main goal of this study is to develop a data-driven multiple regression switchgrass productivity model and identify the optimal climate and environment conditions for the highly productive switchgrass in the Great Plains (GP). Environmental and climate variables used in the study include elevation, soil organic carbon, available water capacity, climate, and seasonal weather. Satellite-derived growing season averaged Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GSN) was used as a proxy for switchgrass productivity. Multiple regression analyses indicate that there are strong correlations between site environmental variables and switchgrass productivity (r = 0.95). Sufficient precipitation and suitable temperature during the growing season (i.e., not too hot or too cold) are favorable for switchgrass growth. Elevation and soil characteristics (e.g., soil available water capacity) are also an important factor impacting switchgrass productivity. An anticipated switchgrass biomass productivity map for the entire GP based on site environmental and climate conditions and switchgrass productivity model was generated. Highly productive switchgrass areas are mainly located in the eastern part of the GP. Results from this study can help land managers and biofuel plant investors better understand the general environmental and climate conditions influencing switchgrass growth and make optimal land use decisions regarding switchgrass development in the GP.

AB  - Multidisciplinary investigations based on integration of chemical and biological measurements, represent an added value to monitoring and management protocols, and their use is recommended by European Directives to evaluate the environmental status of aquatic ecosystems. However, assessing the overall significance of results obtained in different typologies of studies is often a difficult challenge. The aim of this work was to present a quantitative Weight Of Evidence (WOE) model (Sediqualsoft) to integrate huge amounts of heterogeneous data and to validate this approach in complex monitoring scenarios. Using the case-study of an off-shore platform field in the Adriatic Sea, procedures are presented to elaborate different typologies of data (lines of evidence, LOEs), including chemical characterization of sediments, bioavailability, biomarkers, ecotoxicological bioassays and benthic communities around three platforms. These data are initially evaluated by logical flowcharts and mathematical algorithms, which provide specific hazard indices for each considered LOE, before their different weighting and overall integration in an environmental risk index. The monitoring study selected for the WOE elaboration consisted on chemical analyses of trace metals, aliphatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons carried out on 60 sediment samples; the same samples were also characterized for the status of benthic communities; bioavailability of metals from sediments was assessed in laboratory conditions on the polychaete Hediste diversicolor, while bioaccumulation of inorganic and organic chemicals and biomarker responses were measured in native and transplanted mussels; ecotoxicological properties of sediments were evaluated through a battery of bioassays determining algal growth of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, bioluminescence of the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri, survival of the copepod Acartia tonsa and embryotoxicity of sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Overall, almost 7000 analytical results were elaborated and summarized in specific hazard indices. The WOE integration of multiple typologies of data allowed more robust and weighted conclusions compared to the use of individual LOEs, highlighting the feasibility of this procedure for multidisciplinary monitoring and risk assessment approaches. On a practical side, the WOE evidences also suggested a revision of actual monitoring procedures. Overall, the proposed WOE model appeared as a useful tool to summarize large datasets of complex data in integrative indices, and to simplify the interpretation for stakeholders and decision makers, thus supporting a more comprehensive process of "site-oriented" management decisions.

AB  - This paper aims to apply Focused Environmental Assessment (FEA) to measure the impacts of solid waste disposal (SWD) sites in Jordan. The proposed methodology is based on a multi-criteria analysis and decision theory. A case study for major solid waste sites in Jordan is presented. The paper argues that the goals of waste management should be governed by the criteria of socio-economic environmental factors. This criterion states that a solid waste management (SWM) program is feasible only if it reduces energy, resource use, and pollution. The paper recommends the adoption of decision theory in the evaluation SWD sites.

AB  - In the EU, the mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services, abbreviated to MAES, is seen as a key action for the advancement of biodiversity objectives, and also to inform the development and implementation of related policies on water, climate, agriculture, forest, marine and regional planning. In this study, we present the development of an analytical framework which ensures that consistent approaches are used throughout the EU. It is framed by a broad set of key policy questions and structured around a conceptual framework that links human societies and their well-being with the environment. Next, this framework is tested through four thematic pilot studies, including stakeholders and experts working at different scales and governance levels, which contributed indicators to assess the state of ecosystem services. Indicators were scored according to different criteria and assorted per ecosystem type and ecosystem services using the common international classification of ecosystem services (CICES) as typology. We concluded that there is potential to develop a first EU wide ecosystem assessment on the basis of existing data if they are combined in a creative way. However, substantial data gaps remain to be filled before a fully integrated and complete ecosystem assessment can be carried out. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, multi-objective optimization of the methyl di-ethanolamine-based industrial natural gas sweetening process is carried out using the improved multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm for the enhancement of the plant performance by tuning the critical process parameters. Due to the involvement of conflicting objectives, i.e., minimizing the environmental, and process safety objective, and maximizing economic objective, the natural gas sweetening process is a perfect contender for multi-objective optimization. Several multiobjective optimization cases are studied and solved in MS Excel-visual basic application interfaced with natural gas sweetening process simulator (i.e., Aspen-Hysys). The acidification potential for environmental objective, damage index for process safety, and profit before tax is successfully optimized together with the enhanced removal of acid gas for the industrial natural gas sweetening process. Pareto-optimal solutions are obtained for all multi-objective optimization problems studied. The temperature and pressure of the feed gas, the flow rate of the feed gas, and the temperature of the regenerator are the most influencing operating variables among the seven decision variables used in this study. Energy-saving potential and profitability analysis of the operating plant has also been established under normal and deteriorating feed conditions to meet the desired sweet gas purity and process safety, which has resulted in improvement of damage index (DI), profit before tax (PBT) and energy savings under normal feed quality approximately by 2%, 16% and 4.5 x 105 kJ/h, respectively. An identical H2S removal (i.e., 98.8%) with -9% energy conservation can be achieved in the same plant for deteriorating feed quality by compromising - 6% DI and -6.5% PBT.

AB  - This study was carried out on the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of phytoplankton community structure and the environmental factors that affect its distribution and the changes in Izmit Bay, which is an eutrophic bay of Marmara Sea. The water samples were collected bimonthly between February 1999 and September 2000 from the 10 sampling sites (from surface, -5 m, -10 m, and -20 m). Phytoplankton densities were calculated as cells l(-1), biomass was estimated by biovolumes and chlorophyll a content. During the study period, a total of 77 taxa from five algal classes, Bacillariophyceae, Dinophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Haptophyceae and Dicthyochophyceae were determined. Species composition of phytoplankton was typical of eutrophic conditions and was frequently characterized by the presence of Dinophyceae. In general, the most important groups were Dinophyceae and Bacillariophyceae in species numbers and density. The bay was characterized by intensive dinoflagellate (mainly Prorocentrum spp.) dominated bloom in all sampling periods, while the diatoms (shifts were observed in dominant diatoms) contributed most to the settling phytoplankton biomass. Differences among sampling sites and depths were recorded in terms of phytoplankton density, biovolumes and chlorophyll a values. Correlation between chlorophyll a, cell count and biomass was significant. In general, the bay sustained a poor phytoplankton community with higher diversity relatively towards the outer than the interior zone in terms of Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H'). Some environmental parameters seem to play an important role in determining the phytoplankton community succession and then diversity, favoring or limiting the growth of the different groups of the phytoplankton. The Secchi disc depth, an indicator of primary production in the marine environment was comparatively low and limited vertical distribution of phytoplankton. The results indicate that primary production of the bay may be limited by nitrogen and silicate in some periods. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Health state parameters in natural populations can be used as bioindicators of environmental health if they respond to environmental cues. We studied to which extent health state parameters (morphological, biochemical, and haematological) were determined by the environment in which nestling birds were reared or by their genotype, using a cross-fostering experiment in great tits Parus major. Morphological parameters and plasma protein, had a higher environmental than genetic component of variance which could be related with food availability differing between rearing nests. Glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme involved in antioxidant protection, also had a relatively high environmental component of variance, suggesting that nestlings in different rearing nests were exposed to different degrees of oxidative stress. Plasma cholinesterases were more influenced by the birds' genotype than by the rearing environment. The parameters with the lowest residual variance and the highest environmental component of variance such as glutathione peroxidase, plasma protein and morphological parameters (tarsus length and weight) would be more adequate as bioindicators.

AB  - Soil pollution by heavy metals is a major challenge for soil ecosystems; therefore, many countries have published thresholds or standards for protecting soil organisms based on toxicity testing. However, there have been few studies on the mechanism of metal toxicity on organisms in soils, especially relationships between metal's ionic properties and its toxicity. Herein, we selected environmental soil screening levels (Eco-SSLs), which are internationally recognized ecotoxicity values recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and investigated relationships between Eco-SSLs and metal ionic characteristics. The results showed that several ionic characteristics were significantly correlated with Eco-SSL using a classification of metal ions according to hard and soft acids and bases. Electro-chemical potential, atomic ionization potential, the first hydrolysis constant, the maximum complex stability constant, a polarization force parameter and covalent radius showed significant correlations with Eco-SSLs for borderline plus hard ions, while the soft index exhibited significant fitting for borderline plus soft ions, suggesting that ionic bonding and covalent bonding played important roles in metal toxicity on borderline plus hard ions and soft ions, respectively. Then, we chose characteristics that had the strongest correlations with Eco-SSLs, and developed quantitative ion character-activity relationship (QJCAR) for soil organisms. The QJCARs predicted Eco-SSLs for metals that were reasonably consistent with those recommended by USEPA, with differences between them generally <0.5 orders of magnitude. Overall, QJCAR provide a basis for ecological risk assessment and could be useful to interpret relationships between metal's ionic properties and its toxicity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We report the contents of elements in feathers of Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus), which had not been informed up to now, such as silver and bromine and others listed as hazardous by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as arsenic, cobalt, chromium, and mercury. Analyses of the element concentrations in feathers, adult and chicken, from Barton Peninsulas at 25 de Mayo (King George) Island, South Shetlands, were made by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis. Samarium, lanthanum a, thorium, and uranium concentrations in Chinstrap penguin feathers were below 0.1 mg/kg. This suggests that the elements in feather do not come from atmospheric particles surface deposition. Arsenic (0.120 +/- 0.050 mg/kg) and cobalt (0.030 +/- 0.020 mg/kg) concentrations were lower than the reports for other colony of Chinstrap penguins, and essential elements as iron (26 +/- 12 mg/kg), zinc (78.0 +/- 5.3 mg/kg), and chromium (0.51 +/- 0.27 mg/kg) were in the same range while Se (2.90 +/- 0.65 mg/kg) content were the lowest reported. Mercury (0.43 +/- 0.21 mg/kg), chromium (0.210 +/- 0.060 mg/kg), and silver (0.083 +/- 0.003 mg/kg) in chicks tended to be lower than in adults. Iron, cobalt, and arsenic concentrations in feathers found in this study were the lowest compared to measurements were in several penguin species in Antarctica. These results confirm to feathers like effective indicators for the trace elements incorporated in the penguins and it provide a data set which can adds to the baseline for bioindication studies using feathers.

AB  - Kazakhstan has all the prerequisites for the formation of innovative potential. However, to ensure the innovative economic development of Kazakhstan, it is necessary to create favorable conditions that promote the commercialization of innovations. Otherwise, all expenditures that are currently primarily of a state nature will not have the required economic indicators. The modern theory of sustainable economic growth is based on the concept of innovation. That is why the main indicators of overall economic development depend on innovative development. The article studies the variability of a data group formed from indicators of innovative development of the economy of Kazakhstan, using one of the methods of reducing dimension as a correlation analysis. The data of 2000-2018 are analyzed, that is, for 19 years. Discusses the correlation analysis of indicators characterizing the amount of research and development costs and gross domestic product. The obtained correlation coefficients demonstrate a strong linear relationship between the selected indicators. The statistical analysis showed: patterns of change in the GDP of the economy internal R&D costs are almost identical, correlation-regression model of the impact of GDP on domestic R&D expenditures. That is, the number of innovatively active enterprises and internal R&D costs are interdependent variables with a close correlation. High correlation coefficients between the registration of patent applications and the grant of patents in Kazakhstan and the number of employees performing R&D. A strong but negative relationship between the number of organizations performing research and development and the rest, perhaps some organizations exist only nominally and their economic activity is minimal.

AB  - Growth tests upon marine microalgae can provide important information about factors limiting algal growth, and bicavailability of nutrients, and can be used as indicators of the water trophic state and toxicity levels. This study was aimed at assessing the quality of the Regione Campania (Italy) coastal waters through algal bioassays with the marine chlorophyta, Dunaliella tertiolecta. Superficial waters were sampled monthly, from October to December 2000, in 22 stations along the Campania shoreline, with the objective to evaluate the environmental trophic state and likely chronic toxicity.
   Experimental results showed eutrophication and high toxicity effects in the northern part of the study area, particularly, near the Garigliano, Volturno and Sarno rivers. The growth response of microalgae to nutrient addition indicated phosphorus as limiting factor in the proximity to river mouths, probably as a result of the high nitrogen load carried by rivers, and nitrogen in all other stations.
   In our study microalgal test cultures have proven to be a sensitive chronic toxicity assay and a useful tool to evaluate the "health" of marine coastal waters by allowing their classification into quality categories.

AB  - Specimens of Mora moro were collected in two seasons and three localities of the Balearic Sea (NW Mediterranean Sea) and parasitological, dietary (to prey-species level), enzymatic and histological data were obtained, alongside with environmental information (T, S, O-2). The relationships among fish parasite load, condition indices, diet, enzymatic activity of muscular acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), intensity of splenic melano-macrophage centres (MMC) and hepatic granulomas were tested. M. moro showed a rich and abundant parasite fauna, and was a new host record for 17 out of the 18 different endoparasite taxa found. Significant differences were detected among locality-season groups, in turn related to different environmental variables, for Anisakidae gen. sp., Anisakis Type II and Tetraphyllidea fam. gen. sp.; thus, they are proposed as potentially useful as biological tags for geographical discrimination of M. moro in the NW Mediterranean Sea. Detailed relationships were found between parasite taxa and prey ingested (e.g. Anisakidae gen. sp. related with meso-bathypelagic crustaceans; Anisakis Type I with benthopelagic squids). Most parasites were linked to samples with highest levels of near-bottom O-2, which is consistent with direct relationships found between near-bottom O-2 and zooplankton biomass in the Balearic Basin. Total parasite abundance and the abundance of Tetraphyllidea fam. gen. sp. showed a significant relationship with the activity of AChE and the abundance of Anisakis Type II with LDH. AChE was associated with hepatosomatic index (HSI) and condition factor (K); LDH with gonadosomatic index (GSI), K and fish total length (TL). LDH activity showed differences among sampling groups. Splenic MMC and hepatic granulomas were not associated with fish parasite load. A positive relationship was found between MMC area and fish TL and LDH activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Intersex (specifically, testicular oocytes) has been observed in male smallmouth bass (SMB; Micropterus dolomieu) and other centrarchids in the South Branch of the Potomac River, USA, and forks of the Shenandoah River, USA, during the past five years. This condition often is associated with exposure to estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals in some fish species, but such chemicals and their sources have yet to be identified in the Potomac. In an attempt to better understand the plausible causes of this condition, we investigated the reproductive health of bass sampled up-and downstream of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent point sources on the Potomac River in Maryland, USA. Smallmouth bass were sampled from the Conococheague Creek and the Monocacy River, and largemouth bass (LMB; Micropterus salmoides) were collected near the Blue Plains WWTP on the mainstem of the Potomac River. Chemical analyses of compounds captured in passive samplers at these locations also were conducted. A high prevalence of intersex (82-100%) was identified in male SMB at all sites regardless of collection area. A lower prevalence of intersex (23%) was identified in male LMB collected at the Blue Plains site. When up-and downstream fish were compared, significant differences were noted only in fish from the Conococheague. Differences included condition factor, gonadosomatic index, plasma vitellogenin concentration, and estrogen to testosterone ratio. In general, chemicals associated with wastewater effluent, storm-water runoff, and agriculture were more prevalent at the downstream sampling sites. An exception was atrazine and its associated metabolites, which were present in greater concentrations at the upstream sites. It appears that proximity to effluent from WWTPs may influence the reproductive health of bass in the Potomac watershed, but inputs from other sources likely contribute to the widespread, high incidence of testicular oocytes.

AB  - Clear, quantitative biological standards are-needed for stream protection. Three hundred ninety-seven sites in Wisconsin were used to develop and test stream macroinvertebrate indices of biotic integrity (IBI) designed to provide such standards for the upper Midwestern United States. The IBI development approach was unique in 1) selecting base assemblage metrics a priori, 2) using watershed land cover and local habitat to quantify human influence, 3) weighting local- and watershed-scale variables to characterize human influence in a biologically meaningful way, and 4) weighting macroinvertebrate metrics to characterize the assemblage in a way that detects human influence. Canonical correlation analysis provided IBI models by identifying the strongest relation between a set of macroinvertebrate metrics and a set of environmental condition measures. Metrics related to assemblage composition, structure, and function represented the macroinvertebrates, including organic pollution tolerance, sediment tolerance, species richness, proportion or number of Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera, Amphipoda, Isopoda, Diptera, and Chironomidae taxa, and proportion that feed by shredding, scraping, and gathering. Environmental condition measures included proportions of urban, forage crop, row crop, forest, open-water, and wetland land cover at the watershed scale, and riparian condition, bed and bank condition, and habitat heterogeneity at the local scale. The Driftless Area and Northern Forest ecoregions were unique and warranted separate models, whereas the Central and Southeast ecoregions were merged into one model. Partial regressions identified the relative influence of variables at the watershed and local scales. Model testing with independent data indicated the appropriateness of classification into the 3 regions, and that the IBIs could predict human influence well. The IBI models show promise for land-cover planning, pollution monitoring, and developing biological criteria for stream and watershed protection.

AB  - Phthalate esters (PAEs) are well known for their environmental contamination and endocrine-disrupting effects on wildlife and humans. In this study, the occurrence of PAEs and ecotoxicological risk assessments were performed in one of the significant canals in southern Thailand, named U-Tapao. Water samples were collected and analyzed for the six most common PAEs by using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Of the 6 PAEs analyzed, only three PAEs, including di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), di (2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) were detected in water samples. The total concentration of PAEs ranged from 1.44 to 12.08 mu g/L, with a mean level of 4.76 mu g/L. The total average concentration of PAEs found in the canal was higher than the criteria of 3 mu g/L for PAEs recommended for the protection of fish and other aquatic organisms by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The results of the potential ecological risk assessment of the risk quotient (RQ) method revealed that DEHP and DiNP posed a high risk to algae and crustacean and crustacean and fish, respectively, whereas DBP posed a medium risk to the different aquatic species. However, current levels of noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks via ingestion and dermal exposure in children and adults are within acceptable limits. The baseline data of PAEs in this canal will be beneficial to the strategic and future pollutant control along the canal network.

TI  - Indicators of climate chance for the Russian Federation
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA  - English
AB  - Observed climate changes over the Russian Federation (RF) territory are considered. Several indicators based on monthly mean temperature and precipitation station data are used to quantify regional climate changes. Some of these are the components of two aggregated indices of climate change, suggested by Karl et al. (1996). the Climate Extremes Index (CEI) and the Greenhouse Climate Response Index (GCRI). For the RF territory as a whole, and for its western part, the "Russian Permafrost Free (RPF) territory" in particular, changes in surface air temperature are investigated, together with changes in precipitation and drought indices, and also the fraction of the Russian territory experiencing climatic anomalies below and/or above certain specified percentiles. Composite indices CEI-3 and GCRI-3 based on three parameters (air temperature, precipitation and drought indices) are examined, as well as the Climate Anomaly Index (CAI), known in Russia as Bagrov's coefficient of "anomality".
   It is shown, that over the area of the RPF as a whole, air temperature and the occurrence of drought has increased somewhat during the 20th century, while precipitation has decreased; these changes were non-uniform in space. The linear trend accounts for only a small fraction of the total variability, but the role of climate variations on decadal scales seems more substantial. The CEI, determined as the percentage of the area experiencing extreme anomalies (with a 10% or less frequency of occurrence) of either sign, increased for mean annual temperature, decreased for total precipitation and increased slightly for the occurrence of drought conditions; the aggregated index based on all three of these quantities increased slightly. There was also an increase in the GCRI-3 index, which is indicative of an agreement between the observed climate changes and the changes owing to the greenhouse effect as predicted by climatic models.
   The observed climate changes are too small to enable us confidently to reject a hypothesis that they are a reflection of the natural variability of climatic parameters within the context of a stationary climate. However, there is no doubt about the reality and importance of the observed changes.

AB  - Previous research indicates that transition between lowland heath and scrub ecosystems depends upon soil phosphorus (P) sorption capacity (PSC). Experimental work found a positive relationship between P availability and tree invasion but the relationship between PSC, P availability and scrub invasion is poorly understood making it difficult to clearly link landscape invasion patterns with small-scale experimental findings. Using a combination of descriptive and experimental studies we re-examined the relationship between PSC and tree invasion and investigated the hypothesis that PSC is a key determinant of P retention and therefore the P available to scrub colonists. In a statistical model fitted to soil data from three regions soil organic matter (SOM) content explained most of the variation in available P but PSC also accounted for a significant portion of the variance. Additional models suggest that soil P saturation and the proportion of available P in water desorbable form, both indicators of leaching losses, are strongly dependent on PSC. These findings are supported by experimental results; there was greater retention of added P, in plant available form, on high PSC soils and low PSC soils saturated at lower levels of addition. When synthesized with existing data, these results demonstrate that the relationship between PSC and P availability operates via a variety of mechanisms and at several spatio-temporal scales. PSC may for instance, influence post-disturbance SOM accumulation rates. Therefore PSC, by controlling P-availability and ecosystem development, may control the propensity of a site to either heath or scrub.

AB  - The Landsat program of remote sensing of Earth from space has been started in July, 1972 with launch of the first Landsat satellite in USA. Now two space vehicles of this series - Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 work at their orbits. Landsat 7 is close to exhaustion of a technical resource therefore the main source of urgent imagery is the Landsat 8 satellite. The satellite images received from the Landsat 8 are widely used for the solution of the scientific and practical tasks related to operational control of natural resources, a research of dynamics of natural processes and the phenomena, the analysis of the reasons, forecasting of possible consequences and the choice of ways of the prevention of emergency situations. In comparison with the previous devices of a series the spectral range of the Landsat 8 equipment is expanded at the expense of two new channels which allows to carry out studying of water objects and aerosols.
   Various combinations of channels of visible and near infrared radiation are used for the solution of a large number of thematic tasks: classification and analysis of a condition of a vegetable cover; studying of farmlands, wetlands; analysis of a condition of water objects; classification of changes in forests; mapping of economic and biometric characteristics of forest plantings; definition of stocks of tree species; mapping of soils; studying of dynamics of the fires and post-fire analysis of the territory. Combination of various channels of the Landsat 8 satellite for research depends on conditions of a concrete scene (the area, a shooting season etc.).
   The possibilities of use of various combinations of spectral channels of satellite imagery from the Landsat 8 satellite are considered in this paper on the example of two sites of the territory of the Kirov region differing on degree of anthropogenic load - the State Nature Reserve "Nurgush" and the administrative center of the Kirov region (city of Kirov). Use of these tools of satellite imagery allows revealing various characteristics of natural ecosystems in large territories without carrying out extra field researches.

AB  - This study investigated and compared the behaviour of two types of natural waxes, beeswax and Chinese wax, by means of two different ageing tests: an artificial accelerated ageing test using UV light and a simulated natural ageing test (indoors conditions) based on the action of natural, window-filtered light. The same tests were employed to evaluate the influence of wax finishing on the ageing behaviour of Chinese Ash (Fraxinus mandshurica) wood surfaces. Ageing effects were evaluated by direct and microscopic observation, colour measurements in the CIELab system and FTIR investigations. The results yielded by both accelerated UV ageing (72 h) and simulated indoors natural ageing (6 months) indicate that the waxes under analysis here are materials with a good ageing resistance. FTIR investigation revealed only minor chemical changes following ageing, more evident with beeswax than with Chinese wax. Finishing Chinese Ash wood surfaces with the two types of waxes influenced their ageing behaviour in terms of colour and surface chemistry changes. For both UV and natural ageing the maximum colour differences occurred for the samples finished with Chinese wax. The colour differences Delta E after 72 h accelerated UV ageing were in all the cases higher than those occurring after 6 months of indoors simulated natural ageing. Acceleration indexes for UV exposure compared to exposure to natural window-filtered sunlight, of about 40X-60X, were calculated. Both UV accelerated ageing and natural simulated ageing resulted in significant surface chemistry changes for the unfinished Chinese ash wood samples, consisting mostly in lignin degradation and formation of carbonyl containing chromophores. FTIR investigation of wax finish wood samples revealed only very minor chemical changes of the top wax layers, although chemical changes occurring beneath the coating layer on the wood surface are highly probable. Overall, the experiments presented in this paper indicate that Chinese wax seems slightly more resistant to ageing than beeswax.

AB  - Using a variety of techniques we estimated energy expenditure and allocation of energy in free-living green iguanas (Iguana iguana) in a seasonal environment on Curacao, Netherlands Antilles.
   1) Daily energy expenditure (DEE) was measured by means of the doubly labeled water (DLW) technique, using O-18 and deuterium (H-2). The method was validated in green iguanas at ambient temperature and humidity levels occurring on Curacao. Energy expenditures from the DLW method differed by 2.1 +/- 8.2% compared to respirometry and balance methods. This value falls within the range of deviations found in other validation studies, and indicates that the DLW method is acceptable in green iguanas even at high ambient humidity.
   2) Average DEE was 71.7 kJ . kg-1.d-1. There were no significant differences in DEE between males and females, although males tended to have higher metabolic rates during the mating season. Energy expenditure on a yearly basis including clutch production in females did not differ between females and males, indicating comparable annual levels of energy expenditure between the sexes.
   3) Temperature dependence of standard metabolic rate (SMR) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) were determined by respirometry experiments. RMR increased with temperature with a Q10 of 2.24. In combination with field body temperatures SMR and RMR of free-living iguanas could be determined. SMR amounted to 15-22% of the DEE. DEE was 1.8-2.8 times RMR.
   4) The energy expenditure above RMR was allocated between activities involving locomotion and stationary activities. DEE in combination with behavioral data revealed an indirect measure of the costs linked to locomotion in the field, including climbing (255 kJ.km-1.kg-1). Locomotion with a climbing component imposed six times the costs of horizontal walking. Although time spent locomoting was only a very small fraction of the total time, the costs linked to locomotor activities amounted to almost-equal-to 23% of the daily energy expenditure. Postural adjustment costs were almost-equal-to 33% of the DEE. Locomotion could explain 78% of the observed variation in DEE. If other activities, such as foraging and social activities, were included in multiple regression analyses, 96% of the variation in DEE could be explained.
   5) Body condition of males decreased during the mating period (March/April), while most of the decrease in body condition of females occurred during the time of oviposition (May/June). Time spent in social activities was higher during the mating period, especially so in males, but time devoted to other activities (locomotion, foraging) did not differ significantly between the seasons. Comparison between the sexes revealed that males spent more time locomoting than females, throughout the year.
   6) Differences in body condition in the course of the year were not due to differences in DEE, but were mainly a result of differences in metabolizable energy intake. Though on a yearly basis energy expenditure was equal in both sexes, energy allocation differed between the sexes. Females devoted almost-equal-to 15% of their annual energy budget to the production of eggs, while males showed heightened social activity during the mating phase and spent twice as much time in locomotor activities than females.

AB  - Humanity's reliance on clean water and the ecosystem services provided makes identifying efficient and effective ways to assess the ecological condition of streams ever more important. We used high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA region to explore relationships between stream microbial communities, environmental attributes, and assessments of stream ecological condition. Bacteria and archaea in microbial community samples collected from the water column and from stream sediments during spring and summer were used to replicate standard assessments of ecological condition performed with benthic macroinvertebrate collections via the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (BIBI). Microbe-based condition assessments were generated at different levels of taxonomic resolution from phylum to OTU (Operational Taxonomic Units) in order to understand appropriate levels of taxonomic aggregation. Stream sediment microbial communities from both spring and summer were much better than the water column at replicating BIBI condition assessment results. Accuracies were as high as 100% on training data used to build the models and up to 80% on validation data used to assess predictions. Assessments using all OTUs usually had the highest accuracy on training data, but were lower on validation data due to overfitting. In contrast, assessments at the order-level had similar performance accuracy for validation data, and a reduced subset of orders also performed well, suggesting the method could be generalized to other watersheds. Subsets of the important orders responded similarly to environmental gradients compared to the entire community, where strong shifts in community structure occurred for known aquatic stressors such as pH, dissolved organic carbon, and nitrate nitrogen. The results suggest the stream microbes may be useful for assessing the ecological condition of streams and especially useful for stream restorations where many eukaryotic taxa have been eliminated due to prior degradation and are unable to recolonize.

AB  - We describe an approach to assessing biological health in a heavily utilized, large lowland river setting, using the example of the lower Yellow River, China. In this study, the river was divided into four reaches, and a field survey of fish, benthic macroinvertebrates, and riparian plants was undertaken. Data from historical records were used for reference. The scoring system used weighting to adjust for differences in the importance of the chosen indicators and the relative efficiency of the sampling effort. The results indicated that the biological health of the lower Yellow River is distant from historical reference conditions, with its condition generally declining in the downstream direction. This result is consistent with the river's history of impairment of hydrology, water quality, wetland area and character, and physical form. We conclude that the reference river state based on historical conditions is unlikely to equate to the best attainable river health because certain changes have occurred in the river that may prohibit a return to the previous state of ecological health. On the basis of the results of this assessment as well as a review of the literature, we propose field data collection methodologies and indicators that can be applied in future assessments.

AB  - An updated trophic model of the southern Benguela ecosystem in the period 2004-2008 was constructed, complementing trophic models for earlier periods. The model represents the trophic structure of the system after a southward shift of major resources. There was an increase in biomass of small pelagic fish and cephalopods between the 1980s and 2004-2008 periods, accompanied by declines in several higher trophic level groups. A 3 step process was followed: (1) a series of snapshots of the ecosystem was used to explore changes in the food web structure over time, (2) trophic indicators were extracted from these models to detect changes, and (3) model-derived ecological indicators which were deemed most meaningful for management within the ecosystem were selected for use in decision trees, providing a logical framework in which to access synthesised information on trends in ecosystem status as a result of fishing. Three decision trees were developed which examined the ecosystem at the community level (pelagic-caught fish and demersal-caught fish community decision trees) and at the system level (ecosystem decision tree). The decision trees classified one period of the southern Benguela ecosystem as 'Deteriorating' (the period after the onset of industrial fishing: 1960s vs. 1900s), and 3 periods as 'Not improving' (1980s vs. 1960s, 1990s vs. 1980s, and 2004-2008 vs. 1980s). The current management strategy has ensured that the offshore southern Benguela ecosystem has not deteriorated further since the 1960s in terms of ecosystem functioning and at the scale of the fish community. Although the decision trees are conservative with regard to trends, the logic they employ is sound and robust, providing fisheries managers with a coherent framework to access synthesised information and the reasoning behind conclusions reached.

AB  - The aim of the research is to argue theoretical fundamentals and develop practical recommendations concerning improvement of the mechanisms of land use of farming enterprises in Ukraine. The calculated indicators of land supply, presented in the paper, confirm the tendency to consolidation of farms; actualization of the problems of establishment of new farms by restriction of lands and still not organized turnover of agricultural lands; forcing out of the system of landholding and land use. It is defined that family farming eventually demonstrates better indicators of efficiency of land use and ecological load on land (a lower level of plowing). The research characterizes legitimation of agricultural land turnover in favor of development offamily-farming model of agriculture, protection of village communities, multi functional development of rural territories, food self-sufficiency of the state and environmental protection. The work proposes to provide free land parcels, which are determined by the audit, to the people, who wish to start or expand their family farming not by means of an auction, but by immediate obtaining of land according to the resolution of local authorities on the base of land contests. In the contests, the principle criterion to name a winner considers conditions of the following land parcel use and consistency of performance of the future farming enterprise.

AB  - Metal in the environment arises from both natural sources and human activities. Toxic metals in air, soil, and water have become a global problem. They are potential hazards to aquatic, animal, and human life because of their toxicity, bioaccumulative, and non-biodegradable nature. The major impacts of metal pollutants can be stated as ecosystem contamination and health problems of exposed human populations. Those problems have been a cause of increasing public concern throughout the world. Some trace metals are used by living organisms to stabilize protein structures, facilitate electron transfer reactions, and catalyze enzymatic reactions. But even metals that are biologically essential can be harmful to living organisms at high levels of exposure. An increasing concentration of heavy metals in the environment can modify mineral and enzyme functions of human beings. During the last two decades, the interest in using bioindicators as monitoring tools to assess environmental pollution with toxic metals has increased. Bioindicators are flora and fauna members, which are collected and analyzed to measure the levels of metal contaminants. Bioindicators therefore identify health hazards. Various living organisms, such as microbes, fungi, plants, animals, and humans, are used to monitor toxic metals from air, water, sediment, soil, and food chain. Here, we review recent bioindicators, toxicity assessment, and ecological effects.

AB  - We used field-derived data from streams in Nevada, USA, to quantify relationships between stream biological condition, in-stream stressors, and potential sources of stress (land use). We used 2 freshwater macroinvertebrate-based indices to measure biological condition: a multimetric index (MMI) and an observed to expected (O/E) index of taxonomic completeness. We considered 4 categories of potential stressors: dissolved metals, total dissolved solids, nutrients, and flow alteration. For physicochemical factors that varied predictably across natural environmental gradients, we quantified potential stress as the site-specific difference between observed (O) and expected (E) levels of each factor (O-E-stress). We then used 2 sets of Random Forest models to quantify relationships between: 1) biological condition and potential stressors, and 2) stressor values and land uses. The 2 indices of biological condition were differentially responsive to stressors, indicating that no single measure of biological condition could fully characterize assemblage response to stress. Total dissolved solids (as measured by electrical conductivity [EC]) and metal contamination were the stressors most strongly associated with biological degradation. The most likely sources of these stressors were agriculture, urban development, and mining. Our findings highlight the need to develop EC criteria for streams. Measures of biological condition and stress that account for natural variability should reduce errors of inference and increase confidence in causal analyses. This approach will require development of robust models capable of predicting physical and chemical reference conditions. Causal analyses for individual sites require appropriate hypotheses about which stressors and what levels of stress can cause biological degradation. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of field data collected from multiple sites within a region for developing these hypotheses.

AB  - Environmental impact assessments, not only in Brazil, but also globally, have long had their effectiveness questioned. Among the most frequently debated problems are: low quality of the impact assessment statements, weak public participation, project delays, increased costs for proponents, amongst others. The ineffectiveness of the environmental impact assessment system is corroborated by recent scholarly articles that argue that poor follow-up is one of the key elements behind the worst environmental disaster in Brazil, the Fundao Dam failure. The quality of monitoring programs has long been criticized in Brazil for being partially implemented and for failing to clearly translate into better environmental decision-making. This paper discusses the state of environmental impact assessment related to biodiversity monitoring programs in Brazil's mining regions, highlighting the political interference around this practice. Biodiversity monitoring programs should set a collection protocol, using a robust sampling design, with sufficient survey effort, spatial replication, methodological consistency and time to detect eventual ecological alterations. Without scientific rigor, collected data may have no value for decision-making, representing a complete waste of time and money. (c) 2017 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances impact freshwater biota but are rarely incorporated into conservation planning due to the difficulties in quantifying threats. There is currently no widely accepted method to quantify disturbances, and determining how to measure threats to upstream catchments using disturbance metrics can be time consuming and subjective. We compared four watershed-scale ecological threat indices for the Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB) using landscape-level threats of land use (e.g., agricultural and urban lands), waterway development and diversions (e.g., number of canals, dams), and human development (e.g., road and railroads density, pollution sites). The LCRB is an ideal region to assess ecological threat indices because of the increasing need for conservation to ensure the persistence of native fishes in highly altered habitat. Each threat was measured for severity (i.e., level of influence on the upstream watershed) and frequency throughout each watershed; both severity and frequency were measured using two different methods. Severity values were based either on peer-reviewed literature and weighted in accordance to their published ecological impact, or assumed equal severity across stressors. Threat frequency was calculated according to either the presence/absence of each stressor, or on the relative density of each stressor in the watershed. Each measure of severity was combined with a measure of frequency, creating four ecological threat indices, and transformed to a 0-100 scale. Threat indices were highly correlated (slopes of 0.94-1.63; R(2) of 0.82-0.98), and were highest for watersheds close to urban centers, including Phoenix, Tucson, and Flagstaff. Arizona, and Las Vegas, Nevada. Road crossings and density appeared to be the most influential stressors in the index, but the removal of any individual stressor only changed the index by <5.1 units. Our results indicate that a simpler index with less subjectivity (i.e., presence/absence of a stressor in a watershed) provides similar results to the more subjective measure of threats (i.e., peer-reviewed threat severity). Because these threats have been linked to ecological health, the development of the index should be a useful tool to identify regions of greatest potential threat to aquatic biota and can aid in conservation planning for the Lower Colorado River Basin.

AB  - Ozone has a strong oxidation power that allows effective inactivation of waterborne viruses. Few stud-ies have accurately measured the kinetic relationship between virus inactivation and ozone exposure, because the high reactivity of ozone makes it difficult to measure them simultaneously. A continuous quench flow system (CQFS) is a possible solution for analyzing such a fast reaction; however, previous studies reported that CQFS provided different results of inactivation rate constants from the batch system. The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a CQFS to evaluate the kinetics of microbial inactivation accurately, (2) to evaluate the inactivation rate constants of waterborne virus by ozone, and (3) to compare the results with previous studies. The results indicated that the simple plug flow assumption in the reaction tube of CQFS led to underestimation of the rate constants. The accurate measurement of rate constants was achieved by the pseudo-first-order reaction model that takes the residence time distribution (RTD; i.e., the laminar flow assumption) into account. The results of inactivation experiments suggested that the resistance of viruses were getting higher in the following order: Q beta < MS2, fr, GA < CVB5 Faulkner, X-174, PV1 Sabin, CVB3 Nancy. The environmental isolates of CVB3 and CVB5 had a 2-fold higher resistance compared with their lab strains. Predicted CT values for 4-log inactivation ranged from 0.018 mg sec L-1 (Q beta) to 0.31 mg sec L-1 (CVB3 Environmental strain). The required CT values for 4-log PV1 inactivation was 0.15 mg sec L-1, which was 166-fold smaller than those reported in the United States Environmental Protection Agency guidance manuals. The overestimation in previous studies was due to the sparse assumption of RTD in the reactor. Consequently, the required ozone CT values for virus inactivation should be reconsidered to minimize the health risks and environmental costs in water treatment. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of an environmental review and assessment is to incorporate environmental considerations into the planning process. Prior to the selection of a specific project alternative, a thorough and unbiased analysis of the environmental impacts of every reasonable project alternative should be made. It is intended that environmental concerns be considered on an equal basis with engineering feasibility, economics, and social considerations in wastewater reclamation and reuse. This paper discusses the ''procedural'' and ''substantive'' provisions of environmental law in the United States; National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and more specifically the law in California; California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The procedural aspects require the preparation of an environmental document such as an environmental impact statement (EIS) or an environmental impact report (EIR) and the substantive provisions require mitigation of harmful environmental impacts. Suggested outlines of the content of an EIS and an EIR are provided. Specific impacts associated with wastewater reclamation projects such as groundwater impacts and growth inducing impacts are discussed. This paper is intended to be a useful tool for the planning of any wastewater reclamation and reuse project, Two examples are given for this purpose. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

AB  - Protecting the environment is a matter of great importance that must be treaty very seriously, both internationally as well as nationally. The actual situation in Romania, about the economy and the state of the environment, requires the development of a program corresponding to its own interests. Given the specific situation of Romania, the transition to a strong market economy, the restructuring of the economy, the stages that we will go through this market strategy, will mark certain phases with clear objectives. The paper will present the objectives of environmental protection strategy's, industrial risk analysis that affect environmental quality, environmental impact assessment methods and problems of ecological marking of the products. Based on strategies can be developed economic and environmental programs, which must be completed in order to achieve the set objectives, either macroeconomic, sectorial, regional, operative coordination (mandatory) or programs of measures at the firm level, and, why not, national plans.

AB  - Background: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a genetically influenced condition although indicators of environmental risk including maternal smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight and low social class have also been found to be associated with the disorder.
   ADHD is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder in terms of the predominant symptom types (inattention, hyperactiveimpulsivity), their severity and comorbidity, notably Conduct Disorder. It is possible that these different clinical manifestations of the disorder may arise because of the differing effects of the environmental indicators of environmental risk. We set out to test this hypothesis.
   Methods: In a sample of 356 children diagnosed with ADHD, we sought to investigate possible effects of three indicators of environmental risk - maternal smoking during pregnancy, birth weight and social class - on comorbid Conduct Disorder, conduct disorder symptoms and inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptom severity.
   Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that, after controlling for significant covariates, greater hyperactive-impulsive symptom severity was significantly associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy (r(2) = 0.02, Beta = 0.11, t = 1.96, p = 0.05) and social class ( r(2) = 0.02, Beta = 0.12, t = 2.19, p = 0.03) whilst none of the environmental risk indicators significantly predicted number of inattentive symptoms. Conduct Disorder symptoms were positively predicted by maternal smoking in pregnancy ( r2 = 0.04, Beta = 0.18, t = 3.34, p = 0.001) whilst both maternal smoking during pregnancy and social class significantly predicted a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder ( OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.54, 6.41, Wald = 9.95, p = 0.002) and ( OR = 1.95 95% CI: 1.18, 3.23 Wald = 6.78, p = 0.009) respectively.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that indicators of environmental risk, in this instance maternal smoking in pregnancy and environmental adversity indexed by lower social class, independently influence the clinical presentation of the ADHD phenotype. Other types of study design are needed to investigate whether these associations between indicators of environmental risk factors and ADHD clinical heterogeneity are attributable to causal risk effects and to further establish the magnitude of these effects. These findings have implications, not only for our understanding of the aetiology of ADHD, but may also be of clinical value, enabling the identification of individuals who are at higher risk of problematic behaviours in ADHD, notably conduct disorder, to enable earlier, targeted risk reduction strategies.

AB  - Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) or multimetric indices have been developed as an approach for monitoring and evaluating biological condition of aquatic organisms. Quantitative evaluations of IBIs to determine whether they can explicitly link environmental condition with anthropogenic activities are needed to effectively use them in management. Analytical approaches using supervised neural networks are potentially powerful techniques to evaluate IBIs. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of neural networks to identify ecosystem characteristics related to IBI response and to explicitly quantify relationships between variables using sensitivity analyses. An aquatic macrophyte-based IBI developed for Minnesota lakes was used as an example. The study was particularly interested in the usefulness of neural networks to highlight key predictors of IBI performance and to be used as a technique to evaluate multimetric index performance in other systems or regions. Neural networks made accurate predictions of overall IBI scores using an independent dataset, whereas predictive performance of the models varied for individual metrics. Bootstrap analyses to evaluate the effects of different training data on model performance indicated that predictions were highly sensitive to the training data. More conventional modeling techniques, such as multiple regression, performed similarly in predicting IBI scores, although diagnostic tools developed for neural networks provided novel insight into variables influencing IBI response. We suggest that neural networks have the ability to quantify ecological relationships that affect biotic integrity, but the statistical uncertainty associated with multimetric indices may limit the use of predictive models to infer causation. Accordingly, the statistical properties of multimetric indices should be carefully evaluated during index development, with specific attention given to the diagnostic capabilities of individual metrics.

AB  - The Landscape Development Intensity index (LDI), which is based on non-renewable energy use and integrates diverse land use activities, was compared to other measures of LU (e.g., %agriculture, %urban) to determine its ability for predicting benthic diatom composition in freshwater marshes of peninsular Florida. In this study, 70 small, isolated herbaceous marshes located along a human disturbance gradient (generally agricultural) throughout peninsular Florida were sampled for benthic diatoms and soil and water physical/chemical parameters (i.e., TP, TKN, pH, specific conductance, etc.). Landscape measures of percent agriculture, percent urban, percent natural, and LDI index values were calculated for a 100 m buffer around each site. The strongest relationships using Mantel's r statistic, which ranges from -1 to 1, were found between benthic diatom composition, the combined soil and water variables, and LDI scores (r=0.51, P < 0.0001). Although similar, soil and water variables alone (r=0.45, P < 0.0001) or with percent agriculture or percent natural were not as strongly correlated (both Mantel's r=0.46, P < 0.0001). Little urban land use was found in the areas surrounding the study wetlands. Diatom data were clustered using flexible beta into 2 groups, and stepwise discriminant analysis identified specific conductance, followed by LDI score, soil pH, water total phosphorus, and ammonia, as cluster-separating variables. The LDI explained slightly more of the variation in species composition than either percent agriculture or percent natural, perhaps because the LDI can combine disparate land uses into a single quantitative value. However, the ecological significance of the difference between land use metrics and diatom composition is controvertible, and additional tests including more varied land uses appear warranted.

A retrospective analysis of the literature shows that microphytobenthos, with its primary production that often exceeds the production of phytoplankton, plays an important role in coastal marine ecosystems. Benthic diatoms in the coastal waters of Peter the Great Bay (Sea of Japan), which are the primary food object for many marine invertebrates and mammals, are also used as important indicators of the state of the aquatic environment. Despite the great number of publications on the region, knowledge of the microphytobenthos in taxonomic and ecological-floristic aspects is still insufficient.

AB  - I link institutionalism in organizational theory with research on stratification and document the effects of the institutional environment, a noneconomic variable, on economic inequality, Using multiple indicators, I create a scale measuring how much the social environment within a state endorses equality of opportunity. Using 1980 Census data, I test whether industries with more of their employment in stares with environments less supportive of equality exhibit greater race/gender inequality in earnings and in access to good (skilled white-collar) jobs. I find that the more egalitarian the institutional environment, the less the inequality between Black men or Black women and White men. Results on whether the stale institutional environment affects inequality between White women and White men are equivocal. Industries with stronger ties to the national institutional environment are more favorable in terms of jobs and earnings for slack men, Black women, and White women, relative to White men. All analyses include controls for group differences in human capital, hours worked, average establishment size, and whether the industry is in the core sector.

AB  - One of the unsolved problems today is that of the division of the natural (geochemical background) and anthropogenic components of substance migration flows, such as complex integrated systems in the supergene zone. Not only qualitative, but also quantitative assessment of each component allows greater understanding of the correlation between the processes within the geological body and their impact on the environment. This study is based on academic knowledge in the field of geological sciences and study group research-developments aimed at the detailed examination of the migration of pollutants in anthropogenically modified city soils and the creation of a methodological framework in the field of the geochemical zoning of substance migration flows in the hypergenesis zone. We demonstrate that certain parameters of "zero-level" pollutant concentration for functional area land use can be developed for each city - the state of the environment before the beginning of a new stage of technogenesis.

AB  - The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), part of the global Thermohaline Circulation (THC), is variable. In the present analysis, an Atlantic Dipole Phosphate Utilization (ADPU) index, related to the existing Atlantic Dipole Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (ADSA) index, is used to represent 20th century changes in AMOC strength that are applied to global ecosystem variability. ADPU index cycles set the timing for the calculation of six 2 degrees latitude-longitude resolution world ocean maps depicting higher surface phosphate utilization (SPU) in some regions when AMOC is weaker and in other regions when AMOC is stronger. The average of these six maps yields a summary map with a pattern of alternating latitudinal SPU regions differentiated by AMOC strength that exhibits relationships with ocean bathymetry and wind-driven currents through a consideration of the THC deep and shallow limbs. The latitudinal pattern of SPU regions exhibits conceptual associations with sardine (S) and anchovy (A) population ranges off Japan (J), California (C), Peru (P) and South Africa (B). These sardine and anchovy populations have exhibited apparently synchronous fluctuations on decadal scales through at least part of the 20th century that is summarized in a Regime Indicator Series (RIS= (JS+CS+PS+BA)-(JA+CA+PA+BS)) index. In the present analysis based on Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO) catch data, a revised Regime Indicator Series index formulation (RIS3 =(JS+CA+PS+BA)-(JA+CS+PA+BS)), in which CS and CA catches reverse positions, is defined. AMOC variability represented in ADPU is significantly correlated with the RI53 index (no lag but a significant range of 14 years) and four of eight small pelagic fisheries (JS, PS, BA, and JA). The post-1950 RIS3 index is significantly correlated with seven of eight small pelagic fisheries but not CS. When the regional small pelagic fisheries are considered as normalized species differences (S-A), ADPU has significant positive correlations with Japan and Peru, and negative tendencies with California and South Africa, while the RIS3 index has significant positive correlations with Japan and Peru and significant negative correlations with California and South Africa. An extended RIS3 index, with pre-1950 catch data based only on Japan and California, continues a coherent, significantly correlated trend with the APDU index through 1920 (no lag but a significant range of 14 years). Though the mechanisms for multidecadal global synchrony are speculative, the global pattern of cyclical AMOC-related, alternating latitudinal SPU regions through the 20th century and the correlation of the ADPU index with the RIS3 and the extended RIS3 indices suggest a link between varying AMOC strength, ocean fertility and global marine ecosystem response. Signals from AMOC variability due to changes in both deep and shallow limb flow intensities propagate as Rossby and Kelvin waves through the Atlantic Ocean and possibly into the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Similar Rossby and Kelvin wave generation outside the Atlantic Ocean as a result of concurrent but complex global THC variability could reinforce AMOC-related planetary waves and contribute to the multidecadal global synchrony of ocean state and of responsive ecosystems. If present patterns continue into the future decades, a weaker AMOC associated with global warming would favor sardine off Japan and Peru and anchovy off California and South Africa.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to define the kind of trait inheritance through stability estimations of various traits in maize, to define the relationship between different environments and maize hybrids, and to propose the best environments and hybrids for farmers. Field experiments were conducted in two years (2011 and 2012) at four different locations in Greece: Florina, Trikala, Kalambaka and Giannitsa which were selected as they represent different environments. The genetic materials tested in a Randomized Complete Block (RCB) design, were 15 F1 commercial maize hybrids and 15 open-pollination lines developed from 4-cycle Honeycomb evaluation. Materials were sown and harvested by hand at different dates according to local conditions. Trait stability index (x over bar /s)2 across environments was computed for each maize trait studied: yield, specific weight, 1000-kernel weight, axis (spindle) weight, spike weight, number of kernels per spike, spike length and diameter, number of kernel rows, spindle diameter, main spike and plant height, prolificacy and number of kernels per row. The findings showed great differences in stability index between traits and also for the same trait across environments or between maize genotypes. GGE biplot for yield distributed genotypes in a different way for Florina on the basis of one main factor and managed to depict Trikala's differential response on the basis of two factors. Almost the same trend was found for 1000-kernel weight and specific weight, where there was a wide core for similar responding genotypes. Basic conclusions of this research are summarized in great differences of various traits, indicating qualitative, medium or quantitative inheritance. Estimations for trait stability can be easily performed in a multi-genotype experiment using trait stability index. The most stable hybrids were proved to be 31Y43, COSTANZA and FACTOR. The environment favouring a general stable performance proved to be Florina.</p>

AB  - Background: The rate of Parkinson's disease (PD) progression varies widely between patients. Current knowledge does not allow to accurately predict the evolution of symptoms in a given individual over time. Objectives: To develop regression-based models of PD progression and to explore its predictive value in a three-year follow-up.
   Methods: At baseline, 300 consecutive PD patients were assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) - subscales II and III, Hoehn&Yahr (H&Y) and Schwab and England Independence Scale (S & and the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG-Q). UPDRS-III and H&Y were applied in OFF and ON medication conditions. An axial index was derived from the UPDRS-III. Based on multiple linear regression coefficients, algorithms were developed to adjust test scores to the characteristics of each individual. Sixty-eight patients were reevaluated three years later.
   Results: In the construction of the models, disease duration, age >= 70, age at disease onset >= 55, tremor as the first symptom alone, and medication description explained between 35% (UPDRS-III in ON) and 57% (axial index in ON) of the variance of test scores. The predictive r(2) of the models in a 10-fold cross-validation ranged between 33% (UPDRS-III in ON) and 55% (axial index in ON and S&E in OFF). All measures, except UPDRS-III OFF, H&Y ON, and S&E ON, had moderate/good absolute agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient between 0.60 and 0.72) between baseline and follow-up.
   Conclusions: A cross-sectional assessment of a PD population allowed the development of models of disease progression, whose predictive value was validated on a three-year longitudinal study.

AB  - A recent paradigm shift from purely biophysical towards social-ecological assessment of watersheds has been proposed to understand, monitor, and manipulate the myriad interactions between human well-being and the ecosystem services that watersheds provide. However, large-scale, quantitative studies in this endeavour remain limited. We utilised two newly developed 'big-data' sets-the Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) and the Human Well-Being Index (HWBI)-to explore the social-ecological condition of watersheds throughout the conterminous U.S., and identified environmental and socio-economic influences on watershed integrity and human well-being. Mean county IWI was highly associated with ecoregion, industry-dependence, and state, in a spatially-explicit regression model (R-2 = 0.77, P < 0.001), whereas HWBI was not (R-2 = 0.31, P < 0.001). HWBI is likely influenced by factors not explored here, such as governance structure and formal and informal organisations and institutions. 'Win-win' situations in which both IWI and HWBI were above the 75th percentile were observed in much of Utah, Colorado, and New Hampshire, and lessons from governance that has resulted in desirable outcomes might be learnt from here. Eastern Kentucky and West Virginia, along with large parts of the desert southwest, had intact watersheds but low HWBI, representing areas worthy of further investigation of how ecosystem services might be utilised to improve well-being. The Temperate Prairies and Central USA Plains had widespread areas of low IWI but high HWBI, likely a result of historic exploitation of watershed resources to improve well-being, particularly in farming-dependent counties. The lower Mississippi Valley had low IWI and HWBI, which is likely related to historical (temporal) and upstream (spatial) impacts on both watershed integrity and well-being. The results emphasise the importance of considering spatial and temporal trade-offs when utilising the ecosystem services provided by watersheds to improve human well-being.

AB  - The personal assessments of the Current and expected future state of the environment by 3232 community respondents in 18 nations were investigated at the local, national, and global spatial levels. These assessments were compared to a ranking of each country's environmental quality by air expert panel. Temporal pessimism ("things will get worse") Was found in the assessments at all three spatial levels. Spatial optimism bias ("things are better here than there") was found in the assessments of current environmental conditions in 15 Of 18 countries, but not in the assessments of the future. All countries except one exhibited temporal pessimism, but significant differences between them were common. Evaluations of current environmental conditions also differed by country. Citizens' assessments of current conditions, and the degree of comparative optimism, were strongly correlated with the expert panel's assessments of national environmental quality. Aside from the value of understanding global trends in environmental assessments, the results have important implications for environmental policy and risk management strategies.

AB  - The permafrost environment in the Muli mining area, an opencast mining site in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, is now undergoing significant degradation because of the ongoing mining activities. The permafrost environment in this mining site had already been evaluated by previous study, in which analytic hierarchy process was applied. Although this method can roughly characterize the permafrost environment of this mining site, it has limitations by being easily affected by man-made factors. In view of this limitation, this study attempts to employ a new method, the catastrophe progression method, to estimate the current stage of the permafrost environment in this mining area. The results show that, by catastrophe progression method, currently the calculated indexes of the permafrost freezing-thawing disintegration, permafrost thermal stability, permafrost ecological fragility, and the permafrost environment are 0.43 (general situation), 0.77 (general situation), 0.71 (bad situation) and 0.83 (general situation), respectively. These values imply that the permafrost environment has been damaged by anthropologic activities to a certain degree and potentially may be further degenerated. However, at this degree, a new equilibrium stage of permafrost environment could be achieved if the current state of environmental degradation is stabilized and treatments are constructed against further damages.

AB  - Biotic descriptors - both taxonomic (diversity indices, species richness, and indicator species) and nontaxonomic (biomass, oxygen consumption/production, and anatomical deformities) - are useful tools for measuring a stream's ecological condition. Nontaxonomic parameters detect critical effects not reflected taxonomically. We analyzed changes in Chironomidae populations as taxonomic parameters and mentum deformities as a nontaxonomic parameter for evaluating a South-American-plains stream (Argentina). We performed samplings seasonally (March, June, September, and December; 2005) and physical and chemical measurements at three sampling sites of the stream (DC1 at river source, through DC3 downstream). The specimens collected in sediment and vegetation were analyzed to investigate mouth deformities in Chironomidae larvae. We identified a total of 9 taxa from Chironomidae and Orthocladiinae subfamilies. Shannon's diversity index for Chironomidae decreased from 1.6 bits ind(-1) (DC1) to 0.3 bits ind(-1) (DC3). The total density of the Chironomidae exhibited a great increase in abundance at site DC3, especially that of Chironomus calligraphus. Chironomidae taxonomic composition also changed among the three sites despite their spatial proximity: C. calligraphus, Goeldichironomus holoprasinus, Parachironomus longistilus, and Polypedilum were present at all three; Cotynoneura and Paratanytarsu at DC1 only; Cricotopus at DC1 and DC3; Apedilum elachistus notably at DC2 and DC3; and Parametriocnemus only at DC2. C. calligraphus individuals from DC1 showed no mentum deformities; only 2 from DO exhibited mouth-structure alterations; while specimens from DO presented the most abnormalities, especially during autumn and late winter. Type-II deformities (supernumerary teeth and gaps) were the most common. Anatomical deformities are sublethal effects representing an early alert to chemically caused environmental degradation. Mentum deformities in benthic-Chironomidae larvae constitute an effective biological-surveillance tool for detecting adverse conditions in sediments and evaluating sediment-quality-criteria compliance. Taxonomic (community composition) and nontaxonomic (condition of larval mouth parts) descriptors, used together, can indicate a stream's ecological state. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Funil Reservoir receives a large amount of xenobiotics from the Paraiba do Sul River (PSR) from large number of industries and municipalities in the watershed. This study aimed to assess environmental quality along the longitudinal profile of the Paraiba do Sul River-Funil Reservoir system, by using biomarkers and bioindicators in a selected fish species. The raised hypothesis is that Funil Reservoir acts as a filter for the xenobiotics of the PSR waters, improving river water quality downstream the dam. Two biomarkers, the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD), measured as fluorimetricly in S9 hepatic fraction, and the micronuclei frequency (MN), observed in erythrocytes of the cytoplasm, and three bioindicators, the hepatosomatic index (HSI), gonadosomatic index (GSI) and condition factor (CF) were used in Pimelodus maculatus, a fish species widely distributed in the system. Four zones were searched through a longitudinal gradient: 1, river upstream from the reservoir; 2, upper reservoir; 3, lower reservoir; 4, river downstream of the reservoir. EROD activity and HSI and GSI had significant differences among the zones (P<0.05). The upper reservoir had the lowest EROD activity and HSI, whereas the river downstream of the reservoir had the highest EROD and lowest GSI. The river upstream from the reservoir showed the highest HSI and GSI. It is suggested that the lowest environmental condition occur at the river downstream of the reservoir, where it seems to occur more influence of xenobiotics, which could be associated with hydroelectric plant operation. The hypothesis that Funil reservoir acts as a filter decanting pollution from the Paraiba do Sul River waters was rejected. These results are novel information on this subject for a native fish species and could be useful for future comparisons with other environments.

AB  - Statement of the problem. At present close attention is paid to environmental safety of any new manufacturing, because the anthropogenic influence on the state of the river basin should be minimal. The solution to this problem is impossible without a complex assessment of the state of natural waters in a given area before and after the start of the activities of an ore mining plant on a number of hydrochemical indicators.
   Results. Complex hydrochemical indices of contamination of samples taken in the zone of impact of ore mining are determined. An excess of the maximum permissible concentrations for the content of iron, copper, zinc, manganese, chemical and biological oxygen consumption was found. According to the obtained values of the specific combinatorial water quality Index, it is established that the water being studied is characterized as very polluted. By the multiplicity of exceeding the MPC, the level of contamination is characterized as high.
   Conclusions. It has been established that in the period of an increased runoff, stable pollutants are zinc, iron and copper. It is assumed that the technogenic factor plays an important role in increasing the concentration of these elements. The results allows one to predict the effect of possible impacts of mining sulfide copper-nickel deposits on aquatic ecosystems of vast adjoining territories in the Novokhopersky region.

AB  - This article aims to enhance fundamental conceptualisation in performance measurement through the development of a standard conceptual typology of the field. Performance measurement is a common phenomenon in the worldwide public sector, and one that has attracted substantial academic attention. However, analysis has been hindered by confusing and inconsistent terminology, and a lack of clear and explicit classification schemes. The proposed typology is based on five explicit design considerations and three fundamenta divisionis. The typology produced has four elements: levels; measures; targets; and actuals. These elements relate to the nature, specific aspect and state of performance phenomena. It is likely that a standard conceptual approach will have benefits for academic analysis, by clarifying language and conceptual definitions. It is also likely to have beneficial practical implications.

AB  - Human-induced changes in landscapes are one of the major drivers of wetland loss and degradation. The Poyang Lake wetland in China has been experiencing severe degradation due to human disturbance and landscape modification. Indicators to assess the condition of this wetland are thus needed urgently. Here, a landscape-based multi-metric index (LMI) is developed to evaluate the condition of the Poyang Lake wetland. Twenty-three candidate metrics that have been applied to wetland health assessment in published studies were tested. Metrics that show strong discriminative power to identify reference and impaired sites, having significant correlations with either benthic macroinvertebrate- or vegetation-based indices of biotic integrity (B-IBI or V-IBI), were chosen to form the LMI index. Five of these metrics (largest patch index, modified normalized differential built-up index, Shannon's diversity index, connectance index, and cultivated land stress index) were selected as our LMI metrics. A 2 km buffer zone around sample sites had the strongest explanatory power of any spatial scale on IBIs, suggesting that protecting landscapes at local scales is essential for wetland conservation. The LMI scores ranged between 1.05 and 5.00, with a mean of 3.25, suggesting that the condition of the Poyang Lake wetland is currently in the "fair" category. The areas along lakeshores were mainly in poor or very poor conditions, while the less accessible inner areas were in better conditions. This study demonstrates significant links between landscape characteristics and wetland biotic integrity, which validates the utility of satellite imagery-derived data in assessing wetland health. The LMI method developed in this study can be used by land managers to quickly assess broad regions of the Poyang Lake wetland.

AB  - Climate variability and recurrent droughts have caused remarkable strain on water resources in most regions across the globe, with the arid and semi-arid areas being the hardest hit. The impacts have been notable on surface water resources, which are already under threat from massive abstractions due to increased demand, as well as poor conservation and unsustainable land management practices. Drought and climate variability, as well as their associated impacts on water resources, have gained increased attention in recent decades as nations seek to enhance mitigation and adaptation mechanisms. Although the use of satellite technologies has, of late, gained prominence in generating timely and spatially explicit information on drought and climate variability impacts across different regions, they are somewhat hampered by difficulties in detecting drought evolution due to its complex nature, varying scales, the magnitude of its occurrence, and inherent data gaps. Currently, a number of studies have been conducted to monitor and assess the impacts of climate variability and droughts on water resources in sub-Saharan Africa using different remotely sensed and in-situ datasets. This study therefore provides a detailed overview of the progress made in tracking droughts using remote sensing, including its relevance in monitoring climate variability and hydrological drought impacts on surface water resources in sub-Saharan Africa. The paper further discusses traditional and remote sensing methods of monitoring climate variability, hydrological drought, and water resources, tracking their application and key challenges, with a particular emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, characteristics and limitations of various remote sensors, as well as drought and surface water indices, namely, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Normalized Difference Vegetation (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI+5), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI+5), Automated Water Extraction Index (shadow) (AWEI(sh)), and Automated Water Extraction Index (non-shadow) (AWEI(nsh)), and their relevance in climate variability and drought monitoring are discussed. Additionally, key scientific research strides and knowledge gaps for further investigations are highlighted. While progress has been made in advancing the application of remote sensing in water resources, this review indicates the need for further studies on assessing drought and climate variability impacts on water resources, especially in the context of climate change and increased water demand. The results from this study suggests that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data are likely to be best suited to monitor climate variability, hydrological drought, and surface water bodies, due to their availability at relatively low cost, impressive spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics. The most effective drought and water indices are SPI, PDSI, NDVI, VCI, NDWI, MNDWI, MNDWI+5, AWEI(sh), and AWEI(nsh). Overall, the findings of this study emphasize the increasing role and potential of remote sensing in generating spatially explicit information on drought and climate variability impacts on surface water resources.
   However, there is a need for future studies to consider spatial data integration techniques, radar data, precipitation, cloud computing, and machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve on understanding climate and drought impacts on water resources across various scales.

AB  - An important consideration in conservation and biodiversity planning is an appreciation of the condition or integrity of ecosystems. In this study, we have applied various machine learning methods to the problem of predicting the condition or quality of the remnant indigenous vegetation across an extensive area of south-eastern Australia-the state of Victoria. The field data were obtained using the 'habitat hectares' approach. This rapid assessment technique produces multiple scores that describe the condition of various attributes of the vegetation at a given site. Multiple sites were assessed and subsequently circumscribed with GIS and remote-sensed data.
   We explore and compare two approaches for modelling this type of data: to learn a model for each score separately (single-target approach, a regression tree), or to learn one model for all scores simultaneously (multi-target approach, a multi-target regression tree). In order to lift the predictive performance, we also employ ensembles (bagging and random forests) of regression trees and multi-target regression trees. Our results demonstrate the advantages of a multi-target over a single-target modelling approach. While there is no statistically significant difference between the multi-target and single-target models in terms of model performance, the multi-target models are smaller and faster to learn than the single-target ones. Ensembles of multi-target models, also, improve the spatial prediction of condition.
   The usefulness of models of vegetation condition is twofold. First, they provide an enhanced knowledge and understanding of the condition of different indigenous vegetation types, and identify possible biophysical and landscape attributes that may contribute to vegetation decline. Second, these models may be used to map the condition of indigenous vegetation, in support of biodiversity planning, management and investment decisions. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Use of the geological strength index (GSI) rock mass classification system and the associated m, s and a parameter relationships linking GSI with the Hoek-Brown failure criterion provides a demonstrated, effective and reliable approach for prediction of rock mass strength for surface and underground excavation design and for rock support selection for most normal rock masses. One of the key advantages of the index is that it allows characterization of rock masses difficult to describe, such as flysch, and the geological reasoning it embodies, allowing adjustments to be made to its ratings to cover a wide range of rock masses and conditions compared to a typical engineering approach. Flysch, having high heterogeneity in its petrographic nature and a tectonically disturbed structure, forms very weak rock masses in many cases and needs a particular geotechnical classification according to the engineering geological characteristics it presents. After a decade of application of the GSI for the classification of heterogeneous rock masses (Marinos and Hoek 2001), this paper attempts to re-evaluate or verify the original values and to contribute to the appropriate selection of the index for various conditions. A revised GSI diagram for heterogeneous rock masses, such as flysch, is presented, where a certain range of GSI values for every rock mass type is proposed according to the siltstone-sandstone participation and their tectonic disturbance. Data from the design and construction of a large number of tunnels in a variety of geological conditions were assessed for this purpose. In addition to the GSI values, the selection of the appropriate intact rock properties for this type of heterogeneous rock mass is also discussed, where characteristic sigma(ci), E-i and modulus ratio (MR) values are proposed.

AB  - A recent article in this Journal reported the synthesis and characterisation of a new manganite brownmillerite series, La1-xNaxSrMn2O5+delta (0.1 <= x <= 0.3). On the basis of Rietveld refinements against powder x-ray diffraction data, the authors stated that all synthesised members of the series crystallised in the brownmillerite structure with Pnma symmetry. However, the reported synthesis procedure did not include any reaction steps under the strongly reducing conditions normally required to obtain the mixed +2/+3 oxidation state of Mn in the claimed brownmillerites. Furthermore, the presented diffraction data do not contain key indicators of brownmillerite-like structural distortions, but rather, point to oxidised pseudo -cubic perovskite phases with delta >= 0.5. Here, we present a reinterpretation of the structural data for La1-xNaxSrMn2O5+delta and assess the validity of the previously reported magnetic properties of the series, which were based upon incorrect coordination environments and oxidation states determined for the Mn ions. Some general guidelines for distinguishing between brownmillerite and perovskite phases using x-ray diffraction data are also given. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Fish are invaluable ecological indicators in freshwater ecosystems but have been less used for ecological assessments in large Mediterranean rivers. We evaluated the effects of sampling effort (transect length) on fish metrics, such as species richness and two fish indices (the new European Fish Index EFI+ and a regional index, IBICAT2b), in the mainstem of a large Mediterranean river. For this purpose, we sampled by boat electrofishing five sites each with 10 consecutive transects corresponding to a total length of 20 times the river width (European standard required by the Water Framework Directive) and we also analysed the effect of sampling area on previous surveys. Species accumulation curves and richness extrapolation estimates in general suggested that species richness was reasonably estimated with transect lengths of 10 times the river width or less. The EFI+ index was significantly affected by sampling area, both for our samplings and previous data. Surprisingly, EFI+ values in general decreased with increasing sampling area, despite the higher observed richness, likely because the expected values of metrics were higher. By contrast, the regional fish index was not dependent on sampling area, likely because it does not use a predictive model. Both fish indices, but particularly the EFI+, decreased with less forest cover percentage, even within the smaller disturbance gradient in the river type studied (mainstem of a large Mediterranean river, where environmental pressures are more general). Although the two fish-based indices are very different in terms of their development, methodology, and metrics used, they were significantly correlated and provided a similar assessment of ecological status. Our results reinforce the importance of standardization of sampling methods for bioassessment and suggest that predictive models that use sampling area as a predictor might be more affected by differences in sampling effort than simpler biotic indices.

AB  - Aim. On the basis of four experimental bottom stations installed at various depths of the North Caspian shelf, the local communities of marine organisms were formed, on various constructions and in close proximity to them were investigated. The aim of the work is to study the features of community development on the basis of bottom biological stations, to measure their quantitative characteristics, to assess the informative character of the structural and functional characteristics of local communities for analyzing the state of the marine environment. Methods. Experimental bottom stations were installed in various regions of the North Caspian shelf using diving equipment to study their impact on the environment. Control over the development of associated fauna was carried out with the help of traps and the method of direct accounting for the materials of photo-video surveys. Sampling of fouling was carried out by the method of registration sites. Based on the number of species of flora and fauna of local communities, a ballroom information system has been suggested, that can be used for monitoring. Results. Research materials indicate a significant difference in the species composition, biomass and the structure of communities of local cenoses formed at the bottom stations with the same design and ecological capacity at various depths of the North Caspian shelf. In the shallow shelf zone at depths of 6-8 m in the local community of the bottom station, the vegetation component is dominant. At great depths, the total biomass increases in local cenoses and animal communities, including filter-feeders, make significant contribution to the self-purification of the marine environment. Conclusions. The results indicate the possibility of using complex observations of the structure and functional characteristics of local communities formed on the base of bottom stations, as well as the development of species of indicators and objects of accumulation of toxicants for assessing the state of the marine environment. The development of this approach involves the experiments with different station costructioons and materials and use of biotechnology implantation of test organisms on the design of bottom stations.

AB  - The technological process of basic chemical organic compounds synthesis is included among the economic activities that can affect the environment quality. The environmental impact of chemical organic synthesis is evaluated using the alternative method of global pollution index that considers the concentric circles graphical methodology proposing a scale of the arithmetic mean values for the evaluation scores of each environmental components (e.g. water resources, gaseous emission, soil and subsoil etc.), correlated with the global state of the environment. The environmental components evaluated into this impact study were the final effluent into emissary (i.e. surface water) as a type of water resource - wafer component, and respectively the gaseous emission into air around the company, considered as the air component. Applying this assessment methodology, the evaluation score for water component is of 4.96, and respectively 5.20 for air. The value of global pollution index (I-GP* = 3.869) corresponds to the situation of ,,an environment modified by industrial activities generating distress to life forms".

AB  - This paper considers the meaning of "sustainable development", emphasising the broad sense in which development needs to be constructed.  For governments, sustainable development means taking account of environmental consequences, both beneficial and damaging, in all decision making.  It is argued that, given present economic structures, governments need to intervene in favour of the environment.  The main contention is that government, and in particular Ministers and agencies with a mandate for environment protection, need to formulate a strategy for sustainable development as the basis for a coherent approach across government agencies and the private sector.  Such a strategy requires the support of monitoring and reporting mechanisms, yielding accurate and comprehensive data on which to base decisions.  This paper examines the availability of environmental data in New South Wales and recommends the introduction of State of the Environment reporting.  It also recommends the setting of environmental quality goals and measuring of the performance of all agencies whose activities affect the environment against these goals.  Finally, looking to prospects for implementation of the recommended changes, it refers to the greater environmental awareness apparent in institutions and the general public and the need to ensure this becomes a genuine commitment to change.

AB  - The green turtle, Chelonia mydas, is a circumglobal species and a primary herbivore in marine ecosystems. Overexploitation as a food resource for human populations has resulted in drastic declines or extinction of green turtle populations in the Greater Caribbean, Attempts to manage the remaining populations on a sustainable basis are hampered by insufficient knowledge of demographic parameters, In particular, compensatory responses resulting from density-dependent effects have not been evaluated for any sea turtle population and thus have not been explicitly included in any population models.
   Growth rates of immature green turtles were measured during an 18-yr study in Union Creek, a wildlife reserve in the southern Bahamas, We have evaluated the growth data for both straight carapace length (SCL) and body mass with nonparametric regression models that had one response variable (absolute growth rate) and five potential covariates: sex, site, year, mean size, and recapture interval. The SCL model of size-specific growth rates was a good fit to the data and accounted for 59% of the variance. The body-mass model was not a good fit to the data, accounting for only 26% of the variance, In the SCL model, sex, site, year, and mean size all had significant effects, whereas recapture interval did not.
   We used results of the SCL model to evaluate a density-dependent effect on somatic growth rates. Over the 18 yr of our study, relative population density underwent a sixfold increase followed by a threefold decrease in Union Creek as a result of natural immigration and emigration. Three lines of evidence support a density-dependent effect. First, there is a significant inverse correlation between population density and mean annual growth rate, Second, the condition index (mass/(SCL)(3)) of green turtles in Union Creek is positively correlated with mean annual growth rates and was negatively correlated with population density, indicating that the green turtles were nutrient limited during periods of low growth and high population densities. Third, the population in Union Creek fluctuated around carrying capacity during our study and thus was at levels likely to experience density-dependent effects that could be measured.
   We estimate the carrying capacity of pastures of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum, the major diet plant of the green turtle, as a range from 122 to 4439 kg green turtles/ha or 16-586 million 50-kg green turtles in the Caribbean. Because green turtle populations are probably regulated by food limitation under natural conditions, carrying capacity can serve as a baseline to estimate changes in green turtle populations in the Caribbean since pre-Columbian times and to set a goal for recovery for these depleted populations.
   Finally, we compare the growth functions for green turtle populations in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Not only does the form of the size-specific growth functions differ between the two regions (monotonic declining in the Atlantic and nonmonotonic in the Pacific), but also small juvenile green turtles in the Atlantic have substantially higher growth rates than those in the Pacific. Research is needed to evaluate the causes of these differences, but our results indicate that demographic parameters between ocean basins should only be extrapolated with great caution.

AB  - Decision-making that impacts sustainability occurs at national and subnational levels, highlighting the need for multi-scale Earth observations (EO) and geospatial data for assessing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). EnviroAtlas, developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and partners, provides a collection of web-based, interactive maps of environmental and socio-economic data relevant to the SDGs. EnviroAtlas maps ecosystem services indicators at national, regional, and local extents that can contribute to targets set forth in numerous goals, such as SDG 6 for clean water, SDG 11 for sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 15 for life on land. Examples of EnviroAtlas indicators that provide a way to view spatial inequalities, help fill gaps in environmental indicators, and integrate socio-economic and environmental data for the SDGs are explored herein. Remotely sensed EO data are essential for producing these indicators and informing planning and decision-making for the SDGs at subnational scales. The National Land Cover Dataset is the basis for many EnviroAtlas maps at the national extent, while National Agriculture Imagery Program and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are used to classify Meter-scale Urban Land Cover in select US metro areas. These 30 m and 1 m land cover products are combined with demographic and other geospatial data (remotely sensed and otherwise) to produce integrated indicators that can aid in target setting of the SDGs. Though EnviroAtlas was created for the conterminous US, the methods for indicator creation are transferable, and the open-source code for the EnviroAtlas resource may serve as an example for other nations. Achieving the SDGs means assessing targets and decision-making outcomes at local, regional, and national levels using consistent and accurate data. Geospatial resources like EnviroAtlas that provide open access to indicators based on EO data and allow for assessment at multiple extents and resolutions are critical to broadly addressing national to subnational SDG goals and targets.

AB  - Despite rapid advancements in the development of non-monetary techniques for the assessment of social values for ecosystem services, little research attention has been devoted to the evaluation of their underpinning paradigms. This study evaluates two contrasting paradigms for the assessment of social values in non-monetary terms: an instrumental paradigm involving an objective assessment of the distribution, type and/or intensity of values that individuals assign to the current state of ecosystems and a deliberative paradigm involving the exploration of desired end states through group discussion. We present and then justify through case examples two approaches for assessing social values for ecosystem services using the instrumental paradigm and two approaches using the deliberative paradigm. Each approach makes different assumptions about: the underlying rationale for values assessment; the process through which values are elicited; the type of representativeness sought, and; the degree of involvement of decision-makers. However, case examples demonstrate that the boundaries between instrumental and deliberative paradigms are often not concrete. To accommodate this fluidity, we offer a third, pragmatic paradigm that integrates some of the qualities of both. This paradigm has implications for engaging multiple community groups and decision-makers in the articulation and mapping of social values for cultural ecosystem services. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is an economically important region (e.g. oil and gas, fisheries) and with the expansion of oil drilling, harmful algal bloom events, oil blowouts, dead zones, anthropogenic eutrophication and contaminant loading, it is important that the ecological quality statuses (EcoQS) of different localities in the Gulf are closely monitored. The EcoQS, as implemented by the European Water Framework Directive, is an effective tool for monitoring ecological health and developing reference conditions. One such index used to define EcoQS is the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI), which pairs species abundance with environmental stressors. Benthic foraminifera are ideal specimens to populate the index due to their varying environmental sensitivities among species, preservation potential, and high diversity and abundance in nearly every marine environment. To calculate the benthic foraminiferal AMBI (Foram-AMBI), species are assigned to one of five groups ranging from sensitive (I) to first-order opportunists (V) based on their correlation to total organic matter and sediment grain size. This study constructs a Foram-AMBI from benthic foraminifera assemblages collected at 59 sites throughout the GoM. This approach provides reference EcoQS for the GoM and will satisfy the need for widespread geospatial coverage in the case of future natural or anthropogenic disturbances. This study provides a master assignment list of 155 species and identification plates of 44 of those species from a depth range of 42 m-2975 m. The development of a GoM Foram-AMBI encourages collaborative partnerships between academic scientists and living resource managers throughout the GoM to operationalize, refine and implement the Foram-AMBI as a decision support tool.

AB  - Multimetric indices based on fish assemblages assessing the ecological status of rivers have been widely developed. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of environmental conditions, biological assemblages, and human pressures require the development of suitable indices for different regions. In the Iberian Peninsula, where there is a lack of an accurate tool for monitoring systems under temperate oceanic conditions, indices are developed under a Mediterranean climate. Therefore, our goal was to develop and validate a multimetric index based on fish assemblages to evaluate the ecological status of streams and rivers from the Northern Iberian Peninsula under a temperate oceanic climate. For this, 147 streams (41 reference and 96 disturbed streams) were monitored from 2010 to 2014. At each site, we calculated the stress level based on human alterations. For the index development, the rivers were grouped into two large classes: salmonids and cyprinids. Ninety-one metrics were tested for their capability to discern stress level. The index was calculated as the mean of five metrics for salmonid rivers: the percentage of density of benthic species, the percentage of richness of species intolerant to contamination, the percentage of richness of species intolerant to low oxygen concentrations, the percentage of insectivore density, and the percentage of Salmo trutta density. As the mean of two metrics for cyprinid rivers, we considered the percentage of density of water column species and the percentage of density of species intolerant to low oxygen levels. In salmonid rivers, the longitudinal connectivity was evaluated by measuring the presence of Anguila anguila. The index was split into five ecological status classes, ranging from 0 (bad ecological status) to 1 (high ecological status). This index was compared with four other biological indices and its performance was validated for 793 study cases, thus demonstrating its suitability for employment in biomonitoring works to assess the ecological status of stream and river ecosystems from the Northern Iberian Peninsula under temperate oceanic conditions.

AB  - The comprehensive analysis of environmental risk for heavy metals in pig manure was essential for optimization of pyrolysis conditions and scientific utilization of pig manure biochars as soil amendment. However, in previous studies, the selected pyrolysis temperature points were limited and temperature interval was large, it's was difficult to accurately verify the effect of pyrolysis temperature on chemical speciation and environmental risk of heavy metals. Therefore, in this study, pig manure was pyrolyzed at 300-700 degrees C with a small interval of 50 degrees C to study the effect of pyrolysis temperature on characteristics and environmental risk of Cr, Mn, Cu and Zn in pig manure biochar. Results indicated that the characteristics of biochars (>500 degrees C) were relatively stable. The biochar obtained at 700 degrees C exhibited the largest surface area (8.28 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (25.17 m(3)kg(-1)), secondly is the biochar derived at 500 degrees C. The total percentages of exchangeable and acid fraction and reducible fraction decreased from 16.98% to 9.43% for Cr, 85.60% to 65.55% for Mn, 57.26% to 10.61% for Cu, 37.90% to 13.78% for Zn, respectively, suggesting that exchangeable and acid fraction and reducible fraction of Cr, Mn, Cu and Zn in pig manure were transformed into oxidizable and residual fractions after pyrolysis. The leaching rates, risk assessment code and potential ecological risk index values significantly decreased after pyrolysis and presented lower value at 500 and 700 degrees C. Biochars derived at 300-700 degrees C conditions posed no phytotoxicity with germination index >80%. Correlation analyses revealed that larger surface area, pore volume and pH values of biochars may help to immobilize heavy metals and reduce bioavailability. These findings demonstrated that bioavailability and toxicity of Cr, Mn, Cu and Zn in pig manure biochar were greatly reduced after pyrolysis and the optimum temperature was 500 degrees C considering energy cost.

AB  - Temporary streams and rivers, also referred to as intermittent, are defined as waterways that cease to flow at some points in space and time along their course. They are shaped by alternating wet and dry periods over annual and inter-annual cycles, making them one of the most dynamic freshwater ecosystems. These distinctive systems represent a substantial proportion of the total number, length and discharge of the global river network and are expected to become more widespread and face increasing pressures in many regions as a result of human activities and climate change. This collection of papers arose from the Conference on Ecohydrology and Ecological Quality in Temporary Rivers' held at the University of Evora, Portugal, 12-14 September 2012. The primary objectives of the meeting were to bring together researchers and expertise from a range of temporary ecosystems, from small temporary Mediterranean and Californian streams to intermittent rivers from semi-arid and arid zones. A common thread through the discussions was the assessment of ecological conditions within these dynamic ecosystems. To undertake a 'condition assessment' is challenging because of the need to differentiate between biotic responses to anthropogenic pressures and natural variability associated with the hydro-climatology and disturbance regime typical of these systems, that is, drought, drying and flooding. The management of degraded intermittent streams and rivers presents many new challenges, not least how to reconcile ecological and societal goals for emerging novel' ecosystems. Reconciliation ecology presents a realistic way of managing novel ecosystems given their value and desirable ecological services to society, rather than trying to restore to an original ecological state that may not be sustainable or economically possible.

AB  - Eutrophication and chemical pollution are typical threats to the ecosystem of the Gulf of Finland. This paper aims to make a comprehensive assessment of the environmental status of coastal habitats in the easternmost Gulf of Finland (Neva River estuary) by using different physical, chemical and biotic variables to find cost-effective indicators for further monitoring. During summers of 2014 and 2015 we measured water salinity, phosphorus (eutrophication marker), biomass of harmful filamentous macroalgae (coastline hypoxia inductor), sediment hazardous substances (trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and other concomitant characters at 12 sites in the gulf. Also, we analyzed responses of the phytoplankton and benthic organisms, including metal tolerant and hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria, meio- and macrofauna, to these factors. We compared the indicative sensitivity and efficiency of several well-known biotic indices and methods, including a Saprobity system (basing on phytoplankton), Raffaelli and Mason index (meiobenthos), and two macrobenthic derived indices (Goodnight-Whitley Index and Benthic Quality Index). Also, we applied a new index - the embryo malformation frequency in benthic amphipods. To estimate the level of bottom hypoxia induced by the macroalgae blooms, we measured the algal cover and thickness of the algal mats. To verify our assessment, we tested correlations between all used variables. Biotic communities of these areas are subjected to high phosphorus and macroalgae blooms, toxic pollution, water salinity and other factors. We concluded that environmental state of coastal habitats at several southern sites (in Koporskaya Bay and near the developing port Bronka) and near port Primorsk in the north was bad, while the state of the rest of sites was moderate or good. The integrated approach for the assessment may be recommended for monitoring programs as an important tool for studying human-mediated and other effects on brackishwater coastal environments.

A previous report identified in Piracicaba, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, a large contingent of migrants originating at the Municipality of Novo Cruzeiro, State of Minas Gerais. The present study explores whether migrant families from Cruzeiro to Piracicaba have now reached similar or better living conditions as those of the inhabitants of the former location, justifying the their moving. Evidence has shown that migrant families from Novo Cruzeiro to Piracicaba have reached similar or better living conditions than those families who remained home (Novo Cruzeiro-MG), which justify moving from one state to another Socio-environmental indicators showed that living conditions improved among the Piracicaba inhabitants as to housing, family income and maternal school attendance.

AB  - Recovering areas from disturbance, after agriculture and livestock activities, increases secondary forests extension, which might change the quantity and quality of available habitat for birds. The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) compare the structure, composition and function of bird assemblages in secondary regeneration forest, from early succession to mature forest, to evaluate the ecological condition. Thus, the ecological condition along four stages of secondary forest in Antioquia, Colombia were studied using the IBI. This index was compared with richness and Shannon's diversity Index of the same bird assemblages. Five field surveys were conducted between June 2016 and February 2017, using fixed-radius point counts. In total 9 516 individuals, from 187 bird species, belonging to 42 families and 15 orders were recorded. Habitat of occurrence, foraging guild and potential indicators groups were established for every species. Species richness and Punctual Abundance Index (PAI) of all categories were defined as candidate metrics, and after evaluating a total of 34 metrics, 13 were selected for further analysis. Metrics that were positively correlated with successional forest gradient, from highest to lowest disturbance, were: species richness of forest interior insectivorous, abundance of exclusively forest species, abundance of forest interior and edge species, abundance of endemic species and abundance of threatened species. Metrics that were negatively correlated with successional forest gradient, from highest to lowest disturbance, were: abundance of species from open areas, abundance of open areas and edge species, abundance of frugivorous, abundance of granivorous, abundance of omnivorous, abundance of insectivorous, abundance of scavengers and abundance of migratory species. IBI showed a positive significant linear correlation with the gradient of secondary forest regeneration, from early to mature forest, while Shannon's diversity Index and species richness showed a negative significant linear correlation. So that, in this particular case, IBI proved to be better indicator that the classical measures for assessing and interpreting ecological and environmental condition along the secondary forest succession evaluated.

AB  - Many warmwater streams in the midwestern United Slates have been negatively influenced by human land-use practices. From Jun.. through Aug. 2002 and 2003, tributaries (n = 50) of the upper Wabash River basin, Indiana, were sampled to investigate ecosystem health and integrity. Stream fish and macroinvertebrates were sampled along with in-stream habitat according to National Water-Quality Assessment Program protocols to examine relationships among fish community structure, benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, physical-habitat complexity and water chemistry tinder varying land-use practices. Stream fish abundance was best. explained by in-stream habitat quality (QHEI), watershed area and the amount of forested land use upstream of each sampling site. Overall index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores were low (mean = 35.58; range, 20 to 52), and varied predictably by riparian land-use type. The abundance of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa was best explained by the substrate QHEI metric (lambda = 0.24; P = 0.005). Macroinvertebrate community index (ICI) scores showed more variability than IBI scores (mean = 20.40; range, 0 to 36). In-stream habitat quality (QHEI) was directly related to riparian land-use practices. Forested sites had higher QHEI scores than fallow field and agricultural sites due to increased habitat heterogeneity, large-woody debris loading and larger substrate sizes. The best model for predicting IBI scores incorporated both watershed and reach-scale variables combining slope and erosion power with maximum depth, percent canopy Closure, percent fine substrates, degree of channelization and LWDI (r(2) = 0.24; adjr(2) = 0.19). Reach-scale variables (i.e., QHEI score, stream width, the proportion of unstable banks and percent fine substrates) best predicted ICI scores (r(2) = 0.69; adjr(2) = 0.66). Based on these results, we recommend that resource managers incorporate both biotic and abiotic factors at various temporal and spatial scales to predict the effects of land-use practices oil community health in agriculturally dominated, warmwater streams.

AB  - Existing environmental legislation and ecological quality definitions such as ecosystem integrity tend to rely on measures that, either implicitly or explicitly, utilize naturalness as a key criterion. There are marked practical difficulties with employing the concept of naturalness in human dominated landscapes, and the management of such ecosystems is inevitably going to need to take account of human needs and expectations. We propose that ecological quality could be assessed by its ecosystem service profile (ESP): the overlap between societal expectations for, and the sustainable provision of, suites of ecosystem services. The status for each individual ecosystem service is defined by the ratio of its sustained provision to the expected level of provision for the service. The ESP measure is a multi-criterion, context-specific assessment of the match between expectation for and sustainable supply of ecosystem services. It provides a flexible measure of quality which takes into account that the "ideal" ecosystem state is largely dependent on the specific management context. The implementation of ESPs challenges us to develop indicators for the sustained provision of individual ecosystem services, much better understanding of the trade-offs among services, and practical tools for gauging societal demands. All of which are challenging problems. The proposed framework can help to strategically address research needs and monitoring requirements and foster a more integrative approach to ecosystem assessment and management in the future. The need for this follows from the fact that the undisturbed reference state represents only one aspect of an ecosystem and that ecological quality in human dominated landscapes will, ultimately, be determined by the value society places on the sustainable provision of multiple ecosystem services.

AB  - The loss of biotic integrity in ecosystems due to human pressure has been receiving much attention from the scientific community. The primary aim of this study is to understand how the increasing human pressure on natural forests in the Azorean archipelago (North Atlantic) is affecting their epigean arthropod communities and which biological parameters it affects most. An expert team did fieldwork covering most of the natural forests (mainly inside nature reserves) of the archipelago using standardized pitfall trapping. To build a multimetric index we tested a number of taxonomic and ecological parameters that can potentially be influenced by disturbance. Sixteen of these were found to be significantly influenced by disturbance in forests. We retained seven metrics due to both, desirable scalability properties and relatively low correlation between them. These included the percentages of endemic and predator species richness and also predator abundance, which are inversely related to disturbance; and the percentages of native and saprophagous species richness and introduced and herbivore abundance, which are positively related to disturbance. All seven metrics were combined in an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) value. We then proceeded to understand which potential disturbance factors are influencing the biotic integrity of communities and how such influence is felt. Five disturbance factors were found to influence the IBI, although in different ways: the size and fragmentation of reserves, the distance of sites to the reserve borders, the invasion by alien plants and the density of human paths at the sites. Given that only percentages of taxonomical or ecological characteristics were chosen as metrics, we tested and found the scalability of the IBI to be possible, allowing the comparison of sites with different collecting effort or even the comparison of reserves with different areas and numbers of collecting sites in each. Finally, we propose a novel graphical representation for multimetric indices like the IBI, one which allows retaining much of the information that is usually lost in multimetric indices.

AB  - A new method for classifying soft-bottom zoobenthic assemblages along the Finnish coasts (northern Baltic Sea) is presented and tested against traditional physicochemical monitoring data in the complex Archipelago Sea. Although multivariate methods for assessing the state of the marine environment have become widely used, few numerical indices can operate over a wide salinity range. We compare indices currently in use and propose a new index, BBI (brackish water benthic index), for the low-saline and species-poor Baltic coastal waters. BBI offers a salinity-corrected tool for classification of the soft-bottom zoobenthos under the demands of the European Union Water Framework Directive.

AB  - Effects of pollution on biotic integrity are difficult to identify when correlations occur between environmental gradients and contaminant effects, as they do in estuaries. In this broad-scale study, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to distinguish influences of natural and contaminant-related gradients on macrobenthic community structure among 319 sites from estuaries throughout the northern Gulf of Mexico. Natural gradients in salinity, depth, and sediment composition obscured the detection of macrobenthic responses to sediment contamination. After adjusting for natural environmental variability, however, partial CCA revealed important macrobenthic variation in relation to sediment contamination. A rotated principal component analysis (PCA) distinguished five composite environmental factors, each largely reflecting contaminant or natural variation. Two complex gradients in sediment contamination identified by the PCA diverged in partial CCA space and correlated with different macrobenthic indicator taxa. Contaminant gradients represented variation in two different classes of sediment contaminants: trace metals and organic chemicals. Dispersion patterns of CCA site coordinates enabled cross validation of implied contamination-related variation in community function and the utility of several interpretive or management metrics. Trophic diversity decreased with sediment contamination, linking shifts in macrobenthic community function and community structure along contaminant gradients. The CCA model complemented an earlier benthic index developed from these data to examine biotic integrity, but the benthic index could not discern macrobenthic responses to the different contaminant gradients. Neither was the benthic index useful for showing transitions in macrobenthic community structure commensurate with different levels of contamination. Ampelisca amphipod sediment bioassays were inadequate for identifying contaminant effects on biotic integrity, whereas Mysidopsis mysid sediment bioassays conservatively reflected sediment contamination and associated macrobenthic indicators.

AB  - While the succession of benthic diatoms on scoured substrata has been widely studied to better understand community recovery from high flow disturbances, how anthropogenic stressors affect this common and dynamic process has received little attention; yet, it could have consequences for bioassessment and subsequent management decisions. Our objectives were to examine if the severity of acid mine drainage (AMD), a stressor of common concern in several countries, affected patterns of community development, diversity, and stream assessment outcomes (based on diatom metrics and indices) when diatoms are sampled during succession. In southeastern Ohio (USA), we deployed unglazed ceramic tiles in three streams along an AMD-impact gradient and in a control stream with no upstream AMD sources, and we sampled diatoms on days 5, 12, 19, 26, and 33. Diatom diversity decreased as AMD severity increased. In more severely AMD-impacted streams, diatom succession was simplified with less community turnover during the 33-day study than the least impacted AMD stream and control stream. Variability in community structure, diversity, and index scores was greatest at the least impacted AMD site. This stream was misclassified during succession by the Diatom Model Affinity index (severely impaired, then unimpaired, then ultimately moderately impaired) and the AMD - Diatom Index of Biotic Integrity (fair condition, then ultimately good condition). The control stream and the two more severely AMD-impacted streams were never misclassified during succession. Severe pollution may reduce niche availability by overriding effects of other environmental gradients important to diatoms (e.g., light and nutrients). The variability at intermediate stressor levels might lead to misclassification and misdirected management decisions if care is not taken to ensure a community has fully recovered from disturbance.

AB  - Qualitative and quantitative analysis of fossil diatoms and geochemical signals preserved in the sediments of Lac Dauriat (subarctic Quebec) were performed to evaluate the impacts of nearby mining activity and the expansion of the town of Schefferville on the water quality of the lake, and to reconstruct the changes of its trophic status. The presence of taxa typical of nutrient-enriched environments (e.g., Cyclostephanos invisitatus, Nitzschia gracilis, Nitzschia perminuta) and the low percentages of chrysophytes were indicative of the advanced state of eutrophication of the lake during the peak of mining activity, and were evidence of the negative impacts of municipal waste on the water quality of Lac Dauriat. Sedimentary analysis of metals, notably lead, mercury, cadmium, bismuth, cobalt, copper and zinc, showed maximum concentrations between 1940 and 1960 with mining era to pre-development enrichment factors ranging from 4.5 to 7.9. The changes seen in recent sediments reflected 3 distinct stages in the recent history of this ecosystem: (a) the non-perturbed, pre-mining (1882-1939), (b) the perturbed, mining period (1939-1977) with accelerated eutrophication, and (c) the post-mining period (1977-1999) with indications of natural recovery of the system after the installation of a water treatment plant in 1975, the closing of the mine in 1983, and the subsequent exodus of the town's population. Despite the trajectory towards a return to the lake's natural conditions, water resource managers and (paleo-)limnologists should be alarmed that the impacts of past human disturbance are still in evidence more than 20 years after the closure of the mines, and that Lac Dauriat has yet to reach its natural state of the period preceding extreme anthropogenic impact.

AB  - "How much conservation is enough?" is one of the most important and difficult questions to answer. In this work, we demonstrate an approach to specifically answer this question for conservation strategies designed to address nonpoint source pollution in agriculturally-dominated watersheds. We developed empirical models relating conservation investments and actions to measures of stream water quality and fish community health. Our results are consistent with other studies that demonstrate a need for extensive implementation of conservation practices in agricultural landscapes to see measurable improvements in ecological conditions. Our results also demonstrate the influence spatial grain can have on answering "how much conservation is enough?" Our coarse-grained analyses suggest that water quality in at the outlets of four watersheds could be improved to the point that water quality was no longer limiting the fish community with only about 18% of the agricultural lands treated with conservation practices and incentive payments totaling $7.7M. Yet, finer-grained subbasin analyses predict fish communities would still be limited in many tributaries of these watersheds even with 50% of lands treated and incentive payments totaling $44M. Consequently, coarsegrained analyses could significantly underestimate scope of the solution needed to address these impacts to stream ecosystems. Finding balanced solutions to address agricultural nonpoint source pollution throughout the Great Lalces will require unprecedented collaboration from local to regional scales. Herein, we provide examples of how this work is supporting collaborative efforts to establish realistic ecological goals and associated performance measures and strategic implementation of practices throughout the Saginaw Bay drainage.

AB  - Some of the several hundred Lusatian mining lakes originating from lignite mining will be among the largest and deepest lakes in Germany. A special problem of many of these lakes is severe acidification. According to the EC Water Framework Directive (WFD), artificial lakes larger than 0.5 km(2) have to be monitored and managed in order to establish or maintain a state of so-called good ecological water quality. Therefore the WFD demands the definition of type-specific reference conditions as those of the closest comparable surface water body type in nature, such as natural acidic volcanic crater lakes or oligo- to mesotrophic neutral hard water lakes. We propose a classification scheme for mining lakes applying acidity and planktonic colonization as criteria. Five types of lakes are distinguished ranging from extremely acidic to neutral hard water lakes. Phytoplankton and especially metazoan zooplankton are introduced as intriguing and simple indicators for different states of ecological quality in highly acidic mining lakes. We recommend that extremely and very acidic lakes should remain in the acidic state to protect these as valuable ecosystems, whereas moderately and weakly acidic lakes can be managed by external flooding, chemical or ecotechnological measures to achieve neutral water quality conditions necessary for recreation or fishery use.

AB  - Tracking long-term environmental change is important, particularly for freshwater ecosystems, often with high rates of decline. Waterbirds are key indicators of freshwater ecosystem change, with groups reflecting food availability (e.g. piscivores and fish). We store waterbird (species abundance, numbers of nests and broods) and wetland area data from aerial surveys of waterbirds across Australia, mostly at the species' level (similar to 100 species) from three aerial survey programs: Eastern Australian Waterbird Survey, National Survey and Murray-Darling Basin wetlands. Across eastern Australia, we survey up to 2,000 wetlands annually (October, since 1983), along 10 survey bands (30 km wide), east to west across about one third of Australia. In 2008, we surveyed 4,858 wetlands across Australia and each year (since 2010) we survey the major wetlands in the Murray-Darling Basin. These data inform regulation of hunting seasons in Victoria and South Australia, Game bird culling in NSW, State of the Environment Reporting, environmental assessments, river and wetland management, the status of individual species and identification of high conservation sites.

AB  - River basins are extremely complex hierarchical and directional systems that are affected by a multitude of interacting stressors. This complexity hampers effective management and conservation planning to be effectively implemented, especially under climate change. The objective of this work is to provide a wide scale approach to basin management by interpreting the effect of isolated and interacting factors in several biotic elements (fish, macroinvertebrates, phytobenthos and macrophytes). For that, a case study in the Sorraia basin (Central Portugal), a Mediterranean system mainly facing water scarcity and diffuse pollution problems, was chosen. To develop the proposed framework, a combination of process-based modelling to simulate hydrological and nutrient enrichment stressors and empirical modelling to relate these stressors-along with land use and natural background - with biotic indicators, was applied. Biotic indicators based on ecological quality ratios from WFD biomonitoring data were used as response variables. Temperature, river slope, % of agriculture in the upstream catchment and total N were the variables more frequently ranked as the most relevant. Both the two significant interactions found between single hydrological and nutrient enrichment stressors indicated antagonistic effects. This study demonstrates the potentialities of coupling process-based modelling with empirical modelling within a single framework, allowing relationships among different ecosystem states to be hierarchized, interpreted and predicted at multiple spatial and temporal scales. It also demonstrates how isolated and interacting stressors can have a different impact on biotic quality. When performing conservation or management plans, the stressor hierarchy should be considered as a way of prioritizing actions in a cost-effective perspective. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper describes a process for the selection of a suite of ecosystem health indicators for the Great Lakes, as called for in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The paper also presents some preliminary data on status and trends in ecosystem components based on those indicators. The indicator selection process was carried out by over 150 scientists and managers from both Canada and the USA, and involved the presentation of the proposed indicators at the State of the Lakes Ecosystem Conferences (SOLECs). An open period for comment followed the conferences where input from scientists involved in Great Lakes programs was received. The suite of indicators will, over time, present information in an understandable format that will allow for more informed management decisions.

AB  - Extensive and long-term use of Ukraine's rivers in various spheres of human activity has caused them to undergo significant changes. In many cases, their condition is approaching a crisis or has already acquired it. The flow of various pollutants into rivers results in significant changes in hydrochemical characteristics. The state environmental monitoring of water bodies uses a comprehensive approach, but not all water bodies are covered by state monitoring. We have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the ecological status of water bodies in Central Polissya, using current and retrospective data of hydrochemical, hydrobiological analysis for rivers described in this article. The article presents the results of the ecological assessment of surface water quality of rivers Uzh and Irsha, taking into account hydrochemical parameters that indicate the polluted state (class III) during 2018-2020 with a significant contribution and in the formation of the quality class of salt composition, trophosaprobiological block, and block of other toxic substances. Flushing from urban areas contributes a significant share to the pollution of Polissya's surface springs. An essential component of bioresources is fish stocks, which have been declining in recent years. The main factors hindering the development of fisheries and negatively affecting the reproduction of fish stocks are pollution of water bodies, violation of the hydrological regime, weakening of state control over the catch and sale of aquatic living resources. Analysis of the age composition of the ichthyofauna of the studied rivers by catching nets and tools for catching young fish makes it possible to determine perch (Perca fluviatil is) and silver carp (Carassius gibelio) dominate in the reservoirs. Currently, fish stocks in the rivers of the Dnieper basin are under intense pressure from poaching, which is one of the most negative anthropogenic factors.

AB  - Simple Summary: Dairy cow welfare has become a significant topic in recent years. Lying (down) behavior is considered a useful indicator for dairy cow health, welfare, reproductive and productive status. The study evaluated the interaction of climatic conditions on the lying behavior of a group of dairy cows. The developed model seems helpful to identify and predict this important indicator of the welfare of the herd. The prediction model developed, with automatic monitoring of cow behavior, could be a valid early warning system to identify any deviation from the expected behavior, and could be also used to evaluate the goodness of management and to evaluate the heat stress mitigation strategy.
   Abstract: Currently, lying behavior can be assessed using continuous observations from sensors (e.g., accelerometers). The analysis of digital data deriving from accelerometers is an effective tool for studying livestock behaviors. Despite the large interest in the lying behavior of dairy cows, no reference was found in literature regarding the prediction of lying behavior as a function of the interaction of environmental parameters. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of climatic conditions (temperature-humidity index, solar radiation, air velocity and rainfalls) on the lying behavior of a group of primiparous dairy cows, using data from accelerometers, and develop a prediction model to identify and predict the lying behavior of dairy cows as a function of the effects of environmental conditions. Results from the. GLM Procedure (SAS) showed that the model was highly significant (p < 0.001) and the r(2) was 0.84. All of the effects in the model resulted in being highly significant (p < 0.001). This model, if validated properly, could be a valid early warning system to identify any deviation from the expected behavior, and to assess the effectiveness of thermal stress mitigation strategies.

AB  - The sub-Himalayan foothill region is experiencing rapid land-use transformation over the last few decades resulting in the decay of several rivers such as Mahananda, Balason, Sahu, Rakti, Panchanai, Dharala, and Karala. A small rain-fed tributary of Teesta, Karala, has almost decayed in recent years but no notable assessment of its condition has been done to date. This study mainly aims to measure the intensity of human interventions and related responses of Karala through reach-wise, multiple indicator-based assessments. Initially, the reaches have been delineated by segmenting the river into 10 equidistant segments. Characterization of land-use and land-cover has been done for all such reaches. To determine the nature of hydro-geomorphology and water quality of the river 14 indicators are selected and categorized into 3 indices. According to the measured reach-wise mean (R-m), with the highest 4.70 (Reach 1) and lowest 2.21 (R9), it is clear that the need for restoration increases downstream since those areas portray massive deviation from least disturbed conditions (LDC). It is also revealed that the change in the bar area (ID7), vegetation condition (ID3), non-point sources of pollution (NPSP), and channel width (ID8) indicate also an alarming condition within the lower part of the river channel. It is evident that as the river approaches downstream, the natural state of landcover is lost due to intensive human intervention, mostly due to massive land-use transformation reflected in a 600% increase in built-up area in and around the Jalpaiguri region from 1990 to 2020. Hydrologically as well as ecologically sensitive rivers like Karala are the inseparable parts of the sub-Himalayan foothills. Degradation of such, due to, the human alteration would eventually disarrange the entire ecosystem. This easy-to-use, rapid, and coast effective methodology was found useful in distinguishing the extent of alterations by human intervention and the responses of such river systems.

AB  - Five integrative biomarker indices are compared: Bioeffects Assessment Index (BAI), Health Status Index (HSI), integrated biological response (IBR), ecosystem health condition chart (EHCC) and Integrative Biomarker Index (IBI). They were calculated on the basis of selected biomarker data collected in the framework of the Prestige oil spill (POS) Mussel Watch monitoring (2003-2006) carried out in Galicia and the Bay of Biscay. According to the BAI, the health status of mussels was severely affected by POS and signals of recovery were evidenced in Galicia after April-04 and in Biscay Bay after April-05. The HSI (computed by an expert system) revealed high levels of environmental stress in 2003 and a recovery trend from April-04 to April-05. In July-05, the health status of mussels worsened but in October-05 and April-06 healthy condition was again recorded in almost all localities. IBR/n and IBI indicated that mussel health was severely affected in 2003 and improved from 2004 onwards. EHCC reflected a deleterious environmental condition in 2003 and a recovery trend after April-04, although a healthy ecosystem condition was not achieved in April-06 yet. Whereas BAI and HSI provide a basic indication of the ecosystem health status, star plots accompanying IBR/n and IBI provide complementary information concerning the mechanisms of biological response to environmental insult. Overall, although the integrative indices based on biomarkers show different sensitivity, resolution and informative output, all of them provide coherent information, useful to simplify the interpretation of biological effects of pollution in marine pollution monitoring.

AB  - The process of desertification is complex, involving interaction between many factors, both environmental and anthropogenic. However, human activities, especially from land-use change and inappropriate land use, are the most influential factors associated with the desertification risk. This study was conducted in Huay Sai, a degraded land in Thailand. The Environmentally Sensitive Area Index (ESAI) model incorporating Geogracphic Information System (GIS) was applied to investigate and map the desertification sensitivity area. The study aimed to analyze and assess measures to reduce the desertification risk. This study emphasized three group factors with nine subcriteria influencing desertification risk: soil (texture, fertility, drainage, slope gradient, and depth), climatic (precipitation and aridity index), and vegetation factors (land use and soil erosion). In terms of the required spatial measures to reduce the desertification vulnerability, policy and defensive measures that were closely related to drought and desertification of the area were considered. Three main measures covering soil and water conservation, soil improvement, and reforestation were implemented. The area development and restoration plans have been implemented continuously. The study found that 47.29% of the Huay Sai area was at a high risk, with a further 41.16% at a moderate risk. Implementation of three measures indicated that desertification risk was significantly decreased. Addressing the causes of the highest risk areas could help reduce the overall desertification risk at Huay Sai, where most areas would then be at either a moderate (61.04%) or low (32.43%) desertification risk with no severe- or high-risk areas. The success of the area restoration is from the formulation of a restoration and development plan that understands the local conditions. Moreover, the plan integrated the restoration of the soil, forests, and water together in order to restore the ecosystem so that the implementation was able to solve problems directly.

AB  - A wide-ranging river ish survey was executed in the summer of 2009 as part of the preparatory actions for the establishment of a monitoring programme for the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). This was the first extensive electrofishing campaign for WFD standardised bioassessment in Greece and the experience and insights gained are used here to provide a review of ish-based assessment conditions and requirements in this country. The survey sampled 85 sites on 25 rivers throughout mainland Greece, collecting 70 species of freshwater ish. Quantitative site-based assemblage data is used for taxonomic and ordination analyses revealing a strong biogeographic regionalisation in the distribution of the ichthyofauna. The structural and spatial organisation of the ish fauna using species-level and community-level data analyses is explored in three ecoregions where data was deemed sufficient. Transitions in community taxonomic composition among ecoregions were abrupt and concordant with geographical barriers, reflecting the influence of historical biogeographic processes. Community-based analysis revealed a substantial degree of variation in quantitative attributes of the ish assemblages among ecoregions. Key conclusions of this work are: (a) the ish-based bioassessment system must be regionalised to reflect biogeographic variation; (b) high faunal heterogeneity among ecoregions (taxonomic, structural), and to a lower degree among basins, constrains the transferability of bioassessment metrics and indices created for explicit regions to other regional frameworks; (c) faunal depauperation in most of the study areas reduces the utility of functional bioassessment metrics and also limits the utilisation of rare species and the applicability of the classical form of the "Index of Biotic Integrity" concept. Recommendations to cope with these problems are discussed.

AB  - Scientific monitoring of river health is well established and has a significant role to play in environmental assessment by communities, managers and policy makers. Cultural indicators help to articulate cultural values, assess the state of the environment from a cultural perspective and assist with establishing a role for Maori in environmental monitoring. We reviewed the philosophies behind cultural and scientific monitoring of river health and compared the results from the two approaches at 25 sites in the Motueka and Riwaka catchments. Both scientific and cultural indicators suggested a decrease in river health in relation to increased land-use pressure. There were also correlations between the results from the two approaches suggesting cultural indicators could be used in a similar manner as scientific indicators to set environmental benchmarks. Using scientific approaches alongside culturally based monitoring provides a wealth of knowledge to understand better what we mean by river health. The two approaches can be regarded as complementary and reflect two different knowledge systems and perspectives.

AB  - Pollinators and pollination are crucial in the functioning of almost all terrestrial ecosystems including those dominated by agriculture because they are in the front line of sustainable productivity through plant reproduction. Pollinators are bioinidicators as individuals and populations in that they can be used to monitor environmental stress brought about by introduced competitors, diseases, parasites, predators as well as by chemical and physical factors, particularly pesticides and habitat modification. Honeybees an useful as samplers of the environments in which they are kept and have been used to assess atmospheric and other types of pollution. Pollinator guildes offer new means of assessing ecosystemic health because the species diversity and abundance relationship is changed from the log-normal standard expected from ecological principles and niche theory.

AB  - The objective was to develop spatially based (type-specific) methods to assess the ecological status of European rivers according to the EU Water Framework Directive. Some 15 000 samples from about 8000 sites were pre-classified within a five-tiered classification system based on hydromorphological and physico-chemical pressures. The pre-classification was used to identify reference conditions and to calibrate the assessment methods. Clustering reference sites based on relative species composition resulted in 60 fish assemblage types within 11 of the ecoregions under study. Discriminant function analyses (DFAs) were employed to identify environmental parameters characterising fish assemblage types; altitude, river slope, wetted width, mean air temperature and distance from source were the principal predictors. These environmental parameters were used to assign impacted sites with altered fish assemblage composition to the reference fish assemblage type. Metrics (fish assemblage descriptors) responding to human pressures were selected based on correlation and DFAs. Assessment methods were developed for 43 fish assemblage types. Metrics based on individual sentinel species were more often used in type-specific methods than metrics related to reproduction, habitat and feeding. Metrics based on long-distance migrants and potamodromous species were more sensitive to human pressures than overall composition metrics, e.g. total number of species. Only some of the tested metrics showed pressure-specific responses, i.e. reacted to one type of pressure but not to others. Insectivorous, intolerant and lithophilic species exclusively responded (decreased) to chemical and hydromorphological pressures in 14-19%. Omnivorous species was the only metric type that showed a consistent reaction (increase) to continuum disruptions in 25% of the cases. Accuracy of methods based on cross-validation with pre-classification varied between 47% and 98% (mean 81%) when contrasting calibration data set (class 1 and 2) with degraded sites (class 3, 4 and 5).

AB  - Metabolomics is a promising "omics" field in systems biology; its objective is comprehensive analysis of low-molecular-weight endogenous metabolites in a biological sample. It could enable mapping of perturbations of early biochemical changes in diseases and hence provide an opportunity to develop predictive biomarkers that could result in earlier intervention and provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of diseases. Because of the possible discovery of clinically relevant biomarkers, metabolomics has potential advantages that routine approaches to clinical diagnosis do not. Monitoring specific metabolite levels in serum, the most commonly used biofluid in metabolomics, has become an important way of detecting the early stages of a disease. Serum is a readily accessible and informative biofluid, making it ideal for early detection of a wide range of diseases, and analysis of serum has several advantages over analysis of other biofluids. Metabolite profiles of serum can be regarded as important indicators of physiological and pathological states and may aid understanding of the mechanism of disease occurrence and progression on the metabolic level, and provide information enabling identification of early and differential metabolic markers of disease. Analysis of these crucial metabolites in serum has become important in monitoring the state of biological organisms and is widely used for diagnosis of disease. Emerging metabolomics will drive serum analysis, facilitate and improve the development of disease treatments, and provide great benefits for public health in the long-term.

AB  - The idea of sustainable development introduced the strong connection between human wellbeing and the state of natural environment. In the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) perspective, wellbeing is correlated with sustainable development and with ecosystem services, both seen as inextricable elements of one global process, necessary to lead properly Our common future. An important consequence of MA is the necessity for wellbeing strategies to be implemented by governments of many countries, including member states of the European Union. In spite of appearances, this is not an easy task not as much with regard to the difficulties in application (obvious for every type of activity) as with regard to the specific mess in defining what wellbeing is.
   The aim of this paper is to contribute to wellbeing and sustainability research by presenting a relational conceptualization of wellbeing. The paper is divided into three sections. The author begins with the presentation of wellbeing conceptual background, including Gross National product (GDP), Human Development Index (HDI), Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) monetary valuation, Concept of Capabilities, Societal Indicators, QoL and ecosystems wellbeing theory. The second section focuses on subjective wellbeing conceptual framework, including hedonic and eudaimonic accounts, the Self Determination Theory, the Theory of Subjective Wellbeing Homeostasis and finally the Responsible Wellbeing one. The third section discuss how wellbeing is presented in official directives and policies such a Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 5 dimensions valuation and its implementations in different countries.

AB  - Valuing natural assets is important for tracking the performance of management, for sustainability assessments based on wealth accounting, for environmental income and product accounting, and for benefit-cost analysis of specific projects. Developments in valuing natural capital have focused on implicit intertemporal exchange revealed by resource management behavior that maps the state of the natural system in a continuous fashion onto a management response. However, the management of many real assets, including many natural assets, is best described as inaction with punctuated adjustment. We develop natural asset valuation theory and approximation methods for such cases. We illustrate the theory and methods for the case of forests managed through even-aged management, that is, clear cuts. These forests may provide "passive" or "inaction" value while standing and timber benefits at harvest. We find that the passive flow value of the forests can be positive and depend on site class, and that wealth held in private industrial Oregon Douglas-fir forests increased over the first decade of the twenty-first century.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are likely to affect individual condition as they usually alter the quality of habitat. However, responses of individuals of different species to these processes may be subtle and difficult to detect, despite that such responses may reveal interesting and diverse strategies of persistence of species in fragmented landscapes. Here, we used model selection to 1) compare the body condition (Scaled Mass Index) of 2 Neotropical marsupials (Didelphis aurita and Philander frenatus) from 6 continuous forest sites and 25 forest fragments, and 2) determine whether local habitat structure and landscape and temporal factors affect body condition in forest fragments. Body condition of both species was lower in forest fragments compared to continuous forest sites, but only in the super-humid season for D. aurita and in the humid season for P. frenatus. When only forest fragments were compared, body condition of D. aurita was higher in the humid season, in sites with fewer Cecropia trees and water courses, lower percent forest cover, and surrounded by a mixed matrix (plantation and cattle ranching), or located in small rural properties. Body condition of P. frenatus was slightly higher in the super-humid season, in sites surrounded by a mixed matrix, with fewer Cecropia trees and water courses, more lianas, and greater percent forest cover. Our results revealed negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on both species, but also different responses of each species to local extrinsic environmental factors. We suggest that body condition should not be used as a direct indicator of animal fitness or habitat quality. Nonetheless, body condition may still reveal subtle and previously undetected responses of species to habitat disturbance and fragmentation.

AB  - Urbanization of coastal cities has altered the ecosystem services provision in littoral areas around the world. Beach regulating services have been intensely modified particularly in touristic areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the state of regulating and natural perturbations services of the coastal ecosystem in the cities of Miramar and Mar del Sur (Argentine). Five beaches with different geomorphological characteristics and anthropic intervention were studied. Anthropic and natural indicators were selected for the evaluation of the state of the services. Services provision was good in beaches with minor antropic intervention, and was regular in beaches with high antropic intervention. The elaboration of a costal management program is considered necessary, because if the urbanization and tourism growth continues, the negative tendency of the regulating services will increase.

AB  - Lake Gokgol is a small lake with a tectonic origin located in Ordu, Turkey. Algal diversity and distribution as well as the trophic structure of the lake in the summer period were examined. It is a lake with poor acidic character, low dissolved oxygen content, high electrical conductivity, with very hard water characteristics, having nutritive elements particularly phosphorus, and high mineral concentration. In the phytoplankton, the highest diversity of species belongs to Bacillariophyta (33 taxa), followed by Cyanobacteria (6 taxa), Charophyta (5 taxa), Euglenozoa (3 taxa), Chlorophyta (3 taxa), Cryptophyta (1 taxa), and Miozoa (1 taxa), respectively. During the summer months, the biggest contribution to phytoplankton abundance is from Cyanobacteria (96%) and Bacillariophyta (4%). Of blue-green algae, Chroococcus dispersus and Dolicospermum affine, of the diatoms Cyclotella radiosa, Achnanthidium exile, Ampohora ovalis, of euglenoids Euglena gracilis are the taxa making a significant contribution to the phytoplankton abundance. The phytoplankton community was applied with various diversity, species richness, and evenness indices (Shannon, Pileou, Simpson, and Margaleff), and the environmental factors were applied with cluster analysis and correlation analysis. According to the correlation analysis results, the highest positive correlation is between NH4-N, TP, and Cyanobacteria (p < 0.01). To determine the trophic level, phytoplankton compound quotient (PCQ), Palmer's algal genus pollution index, dominant genus scores, Carlson's trophic state index, and Burns's trophic level index were used. In conclusion, when evaluated according to the average of all parameters during the summer months, the Gokgol Lake shows eutrophic character and clean to moderate water quality. Toxic Cyanobacteria bloom was not detected in the lake, which could pose a risk to human health. Gokgol Lake, which does not carry the risk of eutrophication, can be evaluated for health tourism because it contains high mineral salts.

AB  - Our understanding of hillslope subsurface flow relies on assumptions about how storm characteristics affect the hillslope runoff response. Experiments in hillslopes dominated by preferential flow features often show that runoff is dynamic and is affected by antecedent conditions, rainfall conditions, and position of the slope. We applied tracers to a hillslope under natural and steady state flow boundary conditions to determine the relationship between lateral tracer velocities and various hillslope lengths and storm indicators. Tracer velocities were similar to the fastest velocities measured in other similar experiments. The velocities were dependent on the boundary conditions and slope length, and the subsurface flow velocity was most closely related to the 1-h rainfall intensity. Unlike some studies, there was little correlation between our measured flow velocities and storm volume or antecedent conditions. We attributed this to the hillslope characteristics and the relatively consistent wet antecedent conditions during the experiments. This experiment showed that the connectivity of the hillslope preferential flow network is an important factor governing the average subsurface flow velocity.

AB  - Tobacco streak virus (TSV), inciting cotton necrosis, exhibits multifarious symptoms. Common types of symptoms include, purplish brown, necrotic lesions in the leaves, squares, and petioles. Telangana (India) had the highest incidence of TSV (51.11 PDI - hybrid RCH659), among the surveyed locations including, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra states of India. Environmental factors greatly influenced the establishment of TSV in cotton. Minimum temperature (22.81 A degrees C), relative humidity (81.42%), and leaf wetness (23.94 h) favoured maximum TSV incidence with a mean PDI of 30.68 at Annur, (Tamil Nadu, India). Serological assay through DAC-ELISA confirmed the presence of TSV in cotton samples expressing necrosis symptoms. Bioassay revealed that Chenopodium amaranticolor and Chenopodium quinoa are excellent indicator host plants with high virus titres. Further, molecular characterization revealed the conserved nature of the coat protein gene, among the TSV isolates infecting cotton in four different states (Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra).

AB  - Understanding response of streamflow to environmental changes is crucial for large-scale water resources management and ecosystem restoration. There is no consensus on how environmental change influence streamflow in different regions across climate gradient, as previous studies mainly focused on a single river basin or climate region. This study analyzed the variations of aridity index and its contributions to streamflow change based on Budyko's framework approach using bias-corrected precipitation measurement, parameters-optimized potential evapotranspiration and observed streamflow in 144 basins across China. The parameter n in the Budyko type equation exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity, with larger values in the water-limited region than in the energy-limited region, which suggests more pronounced impact of basin characteristic or vegetation change on hydrological cycle. The absolute value of sensitivity coefficient in the water-limited region (-256) was larger than both equitant (-2.13) and energy limited region (-1.57), indicating that the streamflow was more sensitive to aridity index change in the water-limited region than in the equitant and energy-limited regions. The dominant factor affecting streamflow under energy-limited and equitant conditions is aridity index (i.e. climate change), with median relative contribution rates of 79.9% and 55.5%, respectively. In contrast, non-climatic factors dominate the variation of streamflow in the water-limited region, the effect of climate change on streamflow has been offset by other factors. This study suggests that the water management practices, such as water diversion across river basins and ecological restorations, should fully consider the differences in hydrological responses to climatic conditions.

AB  - In the Angolan province of Uige, environmental mitigation constitutes an unsolved problem from the perspective of the sustainable development of mining activity. The purpose of this research is to propose a set of corrective measures, based on the identification of the causes that cause the impacts, in the study the pressure state and response model was taken into account to identify the mining activities that are carried out, the state of the affected environment and the set of actions that must be implemented to mitigate the affected area. From this perspective, the intensity, extension, duration, reversibility and risks were considered as determining variables in the evaluation. The use of the method of comprehensive relevant criteria (CRI) made it possible to assess and rank the values of environmental impacts and by categorizing them, the necessary measures were chosen to mitigate the means: biological, physical and social affected.

AB  - Drought over a period threatens the water resources, agriculture, and socioeconomic activities. Therefore, it is crucial for decision makers to have a realistic anticipation of drought events to mitigate its impacts. Hence, this research aims at using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) to predict drought through time series analysis techniques. These adopted techniques are autoregressive integrating moving average (ARIMA) and feed-forward backpropagation neural network (FBNN) with different activation functions (sigmoid, bipolar sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent). After that, the adequacy of these two techniques in predicting the drought conditions has been examined under arid ecosystems. The monthly precipitation data used in calculating the SPI time series (SPI 3, 6, 12, and 24 timescales) have been obtained from the tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM). The prediction of SPI was carried out and compared over six lead times from 1 to 6 using the model performance statistics (coefficient of correlation (R), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE)). The overall results prove an excellent performance of both predicting models for anticipating the drought conditions concerning model accuracy measures. Despite this, the FBNN models remain somewhat better than ARIMA models with R >= 0.7865, MAE <= 1.0637, and RMSE <= 1.2466. Additionally, the FBNN based on hyperbolic tangent activation function demonstrated the best similarity between actual and predicted for SPI 24 by 98.44%. Eventually, all the activation function of FBNN models has good results respecting the SPI prediction with a small degree of variation among timescales. Therefore, any of these activation functions can be used equally even if the sigmoid and bipolar sigmoid functions are manifesting less adjusted R-2 and higher errors (MAE and RMSE). In conclusion, the FBNN can be considered a promising technique for predicting the SPI as a drought monitoring index under arid ecosystems.

AB  - Efficient implementation of nematodes-based indices for ecological quality assessment requires fundamental knowledge on their biodiversity and functional patterns along with the drivers that generate these patterns. Though, it is still unclear if nematodes taxonomical attributes are driven by the same environmental drivers as their functional (biological traits) counterparts, or if their taxonomical diversity is also enhanced by their functional diversity. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated taxonomical (based on nematode genera abundances dataset) and functional attributes: trophic groups (TG) and life history strategies (LHS) of benthic nematodes collected from 35 sampling stations along the Sado Estuary, SW Portugal. Along with biological samples we measured environmental variables in the water and sediments as well as sediment grain size.
   Our results demonstrated that taxonomy-based assemblages were mainly structured by the salinity gradient and further by the interplay of granulometry and organic matter content. Contrastingly, trait-based distribution patterns were largely driven by the variations in the above sediment dissolved oxygen concentration. This finding largely draw attention to the role that above sediment dissolved oxygen concentration exerts on nematode assemblages and their functional distribution patterns. Consequently, our results demonstrate that biological traits introduce a new dimensionality in multivariate data that otherwise could not be detected using solely taxonomical information, thereby enhancing our knowledge on ecological gradients existing within an estuary.
   Additionally, we found a strong correlation between functional richness (based on the combination of TG and LHS traits) and diversity taxonomic metrics (species richness, Simpson and Shannon diversity), although no correlation was found between taxonomic diversity indices and single nematode ecological indices (ITD index of trophic diversity and MI Maturity Index). Therefore, the combined use of functional traits and its derived metrics was demonstrated to effectively reflect taxonomical diversity presenting reliable and highly complementary information for the assessment and monitoring of marine coastal sediments using benthic nematodes.

AB  - As climate change and other anthropogenic factors increase the uncertainty of vegetation ecosystem persistence, the ability to rapidly assess their dynamics is paramount. Vegetation and sessile communities form a variety of striking regular spatial patterns such as stripes, spots and labyrinths, that have been used as indicators of ecosystem current state, through qualitative analysis of simple models. Here we describe a new method for rigorous quantitative estimation of biological parameters from a single spatial snapshot. We formulate a synthetic likelihood through consideration of the expected change in the correlation structure of the spatial pattern. This then allows Bayesian inference to be performed on the model parameters, which includes providing parameter uncertainty. The method was validated against simulated data and then applied to real data in the form of aerial photographs of seagrass banding. The inferred parameters were found to be able to reproduce similar patterns to those observed and able to detect strength of spatial competition, competition-induced mortality and the local range of reproduction. This technique points to a way of performing rapid inference of spatial competition and ecological stability from a single spatial snapshots of sessile communities.

AB  - The green revolution laid the foundations of modern agriculture, by using science and technology to produce more from same resources. The pesticides contributed to agricultural output in the last decades; however, their use has resulted in environmental pollution, health problems, soil and water contamination and negative impact on biota. The impacts of agricultural activities to the environment depended on the practices adopted during the production process. Measurement tools to assess the impacts of those practices are necessary to improve agricultural systems and must be evaluated in different ecosystems. Different soils, climates and crops impose many phytosanitary arrangements. This complex network and the fact that most of the indicators and measurement tools are developed for temperate climates makes it difficult to quantify the environmental impacts under subtropical regions. The I-Phy index is a predictive indicator that assesses the risks of pesticide usage in agriculture and identifies as to which practices generate the main environmental impacts of pesticides. The objective of this study was to test the suitability of the I-Phy index for subtropical conditions and, if suitable, compare the pesticide risk between two regions. Five crops were assessed under three different cropping systems: no-tillage, minimal tillage and conventional tillage. The I-Phy index was sensitive in both regions and capable of identifying that no-tillage generally presented risks of environmental pollution slightly lower than the other tillage systems. The results of I-Phy index showed that high environmental vulnerability of the fields and the numerous applications of active ingredients with high risks resulted in high risks of general contamination. The application of I-Phy on these two case studies showed the indicator can be useful as a support tool to farmers, research and extension institutions pursuing management practices with lower impact on the environment.

AB  - Natural streams longitudinal dispersion coefficient (Kx) is an essential indicator for pollutants transport and its determination is very important. Kx is influenced by several parameters, including river hydraulic geometry, sediment properties, and other morphological characteristics, and thus its calculation is a highly complex engineering problem. In this research, three relatively explored machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GTB), and XGboost-Grid, were proposed for the Kx determination. The modeling scheme on building the prediction matrix was adopted from the well-established literature. Several input combinations were tested for better predictability performance for the Kx. The modeling performance was tested based on the data division for the training and testing (70-30% and 80-20%). Based on the attained modeling results, XGboost-Grid reported the best prediction results over the training and testing phase compared to RF and GTB models. The development of the newly established machine learning model revealed an excellent computed-aided technology for the Kx simulation.

AB  - Ambient water quality is much used to show progress in water pollution control. The state of the environment is not easy to measure reliably and may be subject to very many factors other than the impact of polluting discharges and those who seek to control them. Even measured trends in water quality do not prove that the pollution control activity is being managed to the best standards of efficiency and effectiveness. So managers may have great difficulty in measuring their success or in correctly attributing change in the environment to their action. On the other hand, owners of pollution control systems, both public and private, make little allowance for scientific scruples in their demands for objective measures of effectiveness. The paper examines the theory behind these contradictions and uses the recent development of performance indicators for environmental management in Hong Kong to consider how theory and practice differ. It concludes that effectiveness is relative, but pollution control managers can help themselves if they integrate into their organizations a constant alertness to fundamental goals.

AB  - The ecological conditions that a bird experiences during any stage of its life cycle may have consequences that become manifested at later life stages, and these carry-over effects may be major components of variance in individual performance. Condition-dependent feather growth rate, as assessed by growth bars width (GBW), provides a unique, though largely under-exploited tool to investigate carry-over effects of ecological conditions and individual physiological state during molt. In this study of breeding barn swallows Hirundo rustica, which undergo a single complete annual molt of tail and wing feathers during wintering in sub-Saharan Africa, we first show that old (>= 2 yr) females have larger GBW than old males and yearlings. GBW was smaller with larger infestations by common ectoparasites of barn swallows, independent of the swallows age or sex, and larger GBW was associated with a higher index of body condition during the breeding season in males. Larger GBW predicted higher seasonal reproductive output of older males, but not reproductive output of younger males or females of any age class, with this higher reproductive output of older males mediated by higher offspring fledging success. However, no relationship with GBW was observed for seasonal reproductive output of males in the spring preceding the winter when the feathers were grown. Hence, this study suggests that the analysis of the rate of feathers growth (ptilochronology) has a larger potential to serve as a powerful tool in the study of carry-over effects than has been appreciated to date. Specifically, the present results support the idea that conditions experienced during wintering in Africa and proximately reflected by GBW have carry-over effects on body condition and breeding success. These effects are sex and age specific, being more pronounced in older males, possibly as a consequence of differences in annual time routines and susceptibility to extrinsic factors among sex and age classes.

AB  - Forests contribute to the economy in several ways. While forests are a source of timber with market values, they also influence local and regional climate, preserve soil cover on site, and in the case of watersheds, protect soil downstream from floods - functions, which are not in the production boundary of SNA. Further, the net value added in forestry sector does not reflect sustainability of forest resources, because it ignores the consumption of natural capital (depletion) that occurs when forests are harvested or converted to other uses. The only costs of depletion considered in the national accounts are the extraction costs and records the potential loss in forest wealth as other changes in assets that have no effect on Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The study tries to incorporate forest resources into the national accounts and adjust the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the depletion of forest capital, using the Satellite System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA). The value of net accumulation (positive or negative) of forests is calculated and the net Domestic Product is adjusted for the depletion of the forest resources to get Environment adjusted Domestic Product (EDP). The results show that the EDP equals 98.4% of the adjusted net domestic product in 1993-1994. A proper accounting framework would better reflect not only the long term value of the state's natural wealth but also its immediate contribution to the state economy in the current accounts.

AB  - Ticks expend energy while host-seeking and must consume blood to advance to the next life stage. The energy required for activity is derived from the tick's lipid reserves, a valuable resource that sustains the tick until it finds the next host and can take another bloodmeal. The amount of lipid reserves in an unfed tick has been proposed as an index of tick biological age. Two different methods for aging nymphal blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say, were analyzed in this study. To study lipid usage, colony-raised nymphs were held in lab-controlled chambers at 21.0 degrees C and >= 95% relative humidity, with a photoperiod of 12: 12 (L:D) h. Samples of ticks were frozen at -80 degrees C every 2-3 wk, starting at 12-wk postmolt and continuing until 38-wk postmolt. Lipid reserves were determined indirectly through measurements of "physiological age" that estimate the energy a tick has based on the evaluation of morphometric size ratios of the tick scutum and alloscutum, and quantified directly through chloroform extractions of lipid from individual ticks. Morphometric age ratios and lipid amounts were compared to determine if morphometric measurements accurately estimated a tick's physiological state. Although the morphometric age ratio did correlate significantly with total tick lipid content, the predictive value of the ratio was not reliable; chloroform extraction results showed that lipid amounts declined steadily through the study and more accurately characterized the physiological condition of nymphal I. scapularis. The study of physiological aging of blacklegged ticks may lead to a better understanding of how changing environmental conditions affect tick longevity.

AB  - The assessment of the ecological status of freshwater ecosystems is a key issue for many international laws such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in light of the actual impoverished status of these ecosystems. Different multimetric approaches have been successfully developed in different freshwater environments. However, multimetric indices are difficult to apply to Mediterranean rivers basins, characterized by freshwater fish communities very low in species richness and support a high number of endemics with generalist and opportunistic life strategies. Here we follow a site-specific approach to develop an adaptation of the multimetric procedure usually used in Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBI), resulting in the Index of Community Integrity (ICI). We modeled the presence-absence of 10 native freshwater fish species from the Guadiana River basin using the Assessment of Nearest Neighbor Analyses (ANNA) model, to assess the deviation of the observed and expected community composition at reference condition. ANNA, which is a multi-species model, allowed incorporating in the index some rare species, though not all of them present in the basin. Deviations were transformed into probabilities of belonging to a reference site and species by species measures were then integrated in a final score. The use of presence-absence only data reduces potential errors associated with estimations of species' abundance and its seasonal changes, which is especially important in Mediterranean environments. The ICI was sensitive to both habitat degradation and the degree of dominance of non-native species within the freshwater fish community (or biotic perturbation), which have been traditionally overlooked in IBIs, but was unresponsive to natural sources of variation. Given the site-specific nature and the simplicity of the index that we propose here, we expect it to be applicable to other Mediterranean basins for which predictive models can be produced.

AB  - The prospect of likely catastrophic transitions in ecosystems requires the development of early warning indicators that will provide advance warnings for undesired transitions. A grass hill is a unique microtopography that plays a crucial role in the functioning of wetland ecosystems. However, it is unclear whether grass hill size could serve as an important warning indicator to predict vegetation dynamics and ecosystem transitions during wetland degradation. Six degradation levels were selected along a grazing gradient in the alpine wetlands on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. General linear and segment regression were used to analyze whether grass hill area (GHA) can be used as an important warning indicator to predict biotic and abiotic factors and ecosystem transitions from typical alpine wetlands to meadows. The species diversity and biomass of aboveground vegetation increased slowly before the threshold point but decreased sharply after the threshold point (GHA (grass hill area) = 0.13 m2). The species diversity of both persistent and transient seed banks and the seed density of persistent seed banks also increased slowly but increased sharply before and after the threshold point (GHA = 0.2 m2). Soil moisture (SM), soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) decreased slowly but decreased sharply before and after the threshold point (GHA > 0.2 m2). Surprisingly, we also found the same threshold point (GHA = 0.13-0.2 m2) for the ecosystem transition from alpine wetlands to meadows as that for the other factors. GHA accurately predicted biotic (species diversity of vegetation and seed bank) and abiotic (SM, SOC, and TN) changes and the ecosystem transition from alpine wetlands to meadows.

AB  - The spatial distribution pattern of the economic development among counties is an important external representation of a balanced and sustainable regional development in China. The natural topography has been regarded as one of the most important factors that controls the economic development of a county. Moreover, natural topography determines land availability and regional accessibility and further influences the objective environment of wealth creation. On the basis of the digital elevation model (DEM) data and geographic information science (GIS) spatial analysis method, this study utilizes the poverty-stricken counties in China to explore the influential factors of the spatial distribution of county's wealth by considering the natural topographic environment. The indexes of slope gradient, terrain relief, river length and river density are calculated to investigate the spatial relationship between the wealth distribution of counties and their natural topographic condition. Results show that the poverty-stricken counties in China are mainly located on the second Gradient Terrain of the Three Gradient Terrains in the country and are particularly concentrated in the Loess Plateau, Qinling-Daba Mountains, and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. These areas are also located near both sides of the traditional Hu Huanyong Population Line of China. Results also show that the complex conditions of the natural topography have a positive driving effect on the spatial distribution of the poverty-stricken counties. By contrast, non-poverty-stricken counties are mainly located in areas with good topographic conditions. A total of 70% of the poverty-stricken counties are characterized by severe topographic condition with an average slope gradient of over 10 calculated from the 90 m cell size DEM. However, only 32% of the non-poverty-stricken counties are characterized by severe topographic condition. In addition, 72% of the poverty-stricken counties have an average terrain relief of over 50 m in a local 3 x 3 cell size (270 m x 270 m), whereas non-poverty-stricken counties accounted for only 34%. Furthermore, the scale effect of the topographical feature derivation from DEM makes the actual topographic condition of the poverty-stricken counties even worse, and the land should be considerably difficult to cultivate. Finally, the primary industry seems to experience difficulty in addressing poverty in poverty-stricken counties. The sheep-flock effect of government-led industries that enter the poverty-stricken counties is expected to be an important policy direction for a balanced regional development. This study provides a reference to the driving force of the natural topographic conditions on the wealth accumulation among counties for a balanced and sustainable regional development.

AB  - There are several emergent properties useful as indicators of marine ecosystem status. Some of these are based on the cumulative trophic theory, which posits that biomass and production accumulate in repeatable and predictable patterns across trophic levels. These patterns result in a suite of curve parameters that can delineate when a marine ecosystem is undergoing perturbation or recovery. When looking at this suite of curve parameters, and their trajectories over time, a clear sense of perturbation, recovery, or transition can be delineated. From a set of over 3700 observations we established empirical threshold levels for the curve parameters, i.e., Trophic Level inflection point, Biomass inflection point and Steepness at 3.38 +/- 0.05, 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.50 +/- 0.56, respectively. When the three parameters are examined collectively to determine whether a particular ecosystem datum was below or above each of these three thresholds, clear three-dimensional patterns emerged. First, some volumes in this 3-D space of parameters simply did not have data, and many volumes had very little. The majority of data (approximately 40%) occurred in situations with Steepness and Biomass inflection point higher than thresholds. Almost none of the ecosystems (< 1%) was below all three thresholds at any point in time, a quarter of the data resulted in critical conditions for at least a couple of indicators, a little less than half of the ecosystems (52%) at any point in time seem to be quite functional from this emergent property perspective, and finally, a moderate number of ecosystems, at any point in time (22%), seem to be in some type of transition state. We assert that these emergent properties have value for delineating ecosystem state, and at the very least when the Biomass inflection point is < 33% an ecosystem is understood to have been severely degraded. Using these three thresholds, and identifying whether data trajectories are crossing them or not, has strong potential to better indicate the status of marine ecosystems, trajectories thereof, and hence when management interventions are needed.

AB  - This paper presents two installation concepts intended to reduce emissions in hard coal mines: emissions of the gas which is high in methane from methane capture process, emissions of the ventilation air which is low in methane, and emissions of the saline mine water. In one concept, the heat from gas combustion in the ventilation air is used to generate superheated steam in a local steam boiler. The superheated steam in a turbine set with a backpressure turbine generates electricity, and the backpressure steam flows into a multi-stage evaporation station where it is used for desalination of portions of mine water. In the second concept, the stream of gas with a high content of methane is supplemented with hard coal in order to utilise the entire stream of mine water. Mathematical models of the component balance of heat and mass are developed for both installations, and calculations are performed using real emissions data from a selected coal mine. Results are shown in mass flow and energy flux Sankey diagrams. We find that full utilisation of the high-methane gas reduces emissions of mine ventilation air by 2.5% and of the saline mine water by 21%. Also, co-firing with supplementary coal ensures a 100% desalination of the mine water and 10% utilisation of the ventilation air.
   An approximate estimate of the economic evaluation and a sensitivity analysis are also presented for both concepts. Results indicate that the first concept is more profitable than the second concept. This is because the payback period (PP) is shorter (7.67 and 9.67 years, respectively), and the rate of return based on cash flows (ARRa) is greater (13.03 and 10.36%, respectively) at an unchanged load factor of 90% and a 10-year life cycle. Also, the first concept is found to be significantly less risky. Technical and economic analysis of the proposed solutions shows that both solutions are useful; therefore, the most suitable solution should be chosen based on other conditions such as indicators of state environmental policy.

AB  - Genetic improvement of rice for aerobic (non-flooded) environments has received less attention than breeding for lowland production systems. Aerobic rice has traditionally been grown in low-input systems, but as fresh water for irrigation becomes increasingly scarce, aerobic rice cultivation is expected to expand into regions with more intensive cropping. The primary yield constraints for the low-input aerobic crop include water deficit, acid and infertile soils, weed competition, and disease. Yield potential has been improved through traditional breeding approaches, and some improved upland rice cultivars show a similar pattern of interactions with environments as traditional cultivars. Critical environmental factors that interact with genotype are the distribution of rainfall during the season, the amount of solar radiation received in the period just prior to flowering, and disease pressure. In systems where adequate inputs are applied, aerobic rice tends to yield less than lowland rice, and yield reductions are dramatic when water deficit occurs. The poor adaptation of the lowland cultivar IR72 to aerobic soils is associated with reduced height and harvest index in aerobic conditions, but IR72 had similar biomass production by anthesis as better-adapted upland cultivars. The best-yielding upland lines had very stable pre-anthesis biomass production across five contrasting environments. The physiological and molecular dissection of aerobic rice yield is expected to identify opportunities to accelerate progress in the areas of aerobic adaptation, tolerance to water deficit, and improved weed competitiveness. QTLs have been reported for a number of traits potentially related to performance under water deficit, such as improved root morphology and osmotic adjustment. In an upland-by-lowland mapping population, alleles from the lowland cultivar contributed significantly to improved yield in aerobic environments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Najas flexilis (Willd.) Rostk. & Schmidt is a submerged annual macrophyte, rare in Europe, which is protected under the EC Habitats Directive.
   2. N. flexilis grows in deep, often coloured or turbid water in mesotrophic lakes. Because of this habitat preference it is difficult to locate and assess the ecological state of populations of the species for conservation monitoring purposes.
   3. A method is described based on plant community information that can be used to determine the baseline probability that conditions in a lake are suitable for supporting N.,flexilis growth. This can be applied to conservation management decisions, such as whether a detailed underwater survey is justified for monitoring the integrity of existing populations of N.flexilis, or whether the lake may be a suitable site for introduction, or reintroduction, of populations of the plant.
   4. Two methods of plant community description are compared: a quantitative micro-habitat scale approach and a whole-lake-scale qualitative approach. Plant community data collected using each method were grouped using TWINSPAN, and environmental descriptors of the sites comprising each plant community group were compared statistically.
   5. Micro-habitat-scale community groups differed significantly only in the light extinction coefficient, indicating the zone within the lake in which N.,flexilis occurred.
   6. The whole-lake-scale community groups differed in a number of environmental variables indicative of eutrophication and acidification, two major environmental threats to N. flexilis survival.
   7. This study suggests that a lake-scale qualitative plant community description would be a better indicator of site suitability for N.flexilis growth than a quantitative micro-habitat plant community description. This is because the whole-lake-scale approach could detect a difference ill the environmental factors that affect N.flexilis growth, which the micro-habitat scale approach could not.

AB  - Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) rely on sea ice for hunting marine mammal prey. Declining sea ice conditions associated with climate warming have negatively affected polar bears, especially in the southern portion of their range. At higher latitudes, the transition from multi-year ice to thinner annual ice has been hypothesized to increase biological productivity and potentially improve polar bear foraging conditions. To investigate this possibility, we used quantitative fatty acid signature analysis to characterize the diet composition of 148 polar bears in two high-latitude subpopulations from 2012 to 2014: (1) Viscount Melville Sound, where little is known about marine mammal ecology, and (2) Northern Beaufort Sea, a subpopulation considered stable with comparatively more ecological data. We used adipose tissue lipid content as an index of body condition. To characterize long-term habitat conditions, we examined trends in sea ice metrics from 1979 to 2014 in both regions. Although the diets of bears in both subpopulations were dominated by ringed seal (Pusa hispida, mean biomass consumption = 45%), bears in Viscount Melville Sound showed higher proportional consumption of beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas; mean biomass consumption = 37%) than any other polar bear subpopulation studied to date. Although the three-year duration of our study precludes long-term insights, relatively lighter sea ice conditions in Viscount Melville Sound were associated with reduced consumption of preferred prey (i.e., ringed seal), especially among female polar bears. Further, polar bears in Viscount Melville sound were in poorer body condition than those in the Northern Beaufort Sea. Our results do not indicate that declining sea ice has had any positive effect on polar bear foraging at high-latitudes.

AB  - Captive-reared animals used in reinforcement programs are generally less likely to survive than wild conspecifics. Digestion efficiency and naive behaviour are two likely reasons for this pattern. The Mallard is a species with high adaptability to its environment and in which massive reinforcement programs are carried out. We studied physiological and behavioural factors potentially affecting body condition and survival of captive-reared Mallards after being released. Digestive system morphology and an index of body condition were compared among three groups: captive-reared birds remaining in a farm (control), captive-reared birds released into the wild as juveniles (released) and wild-born birds (wild). We also compared behaviour and diet of released vs. wild Mallards. Finally, we conducted a 1-year survival analysis of captive-reared birds after release in a hunting-free area. Gizzard weight was lower in control Mallards, but the size of other organs did not differ between controls and wild birds. The difference in gizzard weight between released and wild birds disappeared after some time in the wild. Diet analyses suggest that released Mallards show a greater preference than wild for anthropogenic food (waste grain, bait). Despite similar time-budgets, released Mallards never attained the body condition of wild birds. As a consequence, survival probability in released Mallards was low, especially when food provisioning was stopped and during harsh winter periods. We argue that the low survival of released Mallards likely has a physiological rather than a behavioural (foraging) origin. In any case, extremely few released birds live long enough to potentially enter the breeding population, even without hunting. In the context of massive releases presently carried out for hunting purposes, our study indicates a low likelihood for genetic introgression by captive-reared birds into the wild population.

AB  - This paper further develops the ideas of V. B. Sochava's Siberian school of thematic mapping concerning an integral approach in generating synthesis and assessment maps of the habitat on objective grounds confirmed by quantitative calculations. Maps of the natural environment display the invariant structure of the sites of a territory and their variable states. Integral indicators of the state of environment combine differentquality spatial information on the geographical location of the sites having regard to the scientific principles of qualimetry. An unbiased calculation of integral indicators is ensured through the use of the method of principal component analysis. The first principal component characterizes a maximum of variation in information on the geosystem, and the second component refers to a stable environment background. Their difference for each location corresponds to the potential of geosystem variability. The resulting integral indicators are displayed on assessment cartograms. The entire array of independent principal components is used for a classification of geosystems using the method of k-means clustering to create the typological map of the territory. Calculations are based on data for forest management of the Slyudyanka Leskhoz within the boundaries of the Slyudyanka municipal district of Irkutsk oblast. The territorial norm of the geographical environment corresponds to geosystems of the mountain-taiga belt of the Siberian stone pine and larch taiga on different-aspect slopes. Negative deviations from the norm are induced by high-mountain goletz and subgoletz geosystems on steep slopes, and positive deviations correspond to flat interfluves and gentle slopes.

AB  - Multiple-species habitat conservation plans (MSHCPs) are designed to eliminate project-by-project review and minimize species-by-species conflicts; but these onetime, short-term processes invariably compress the divergent expectations of interest groups into an exercise driven by economic, amenity, and aesthetic values rather than scientific values. Participants may define an MSHCP as an exchange of habitat preserves for federal permits to take populations of endangered animals and plants, but the outcome is typically driven by overarching arguments over land development and suburban sprawl. Existing land uses also constrain the size, shape, and linkages among wildlife habitats, leading to a divergence of MSHCPs from the scientific preserve selection and design literature. Problems created by constraints to preserve configuration (e.g., land costs, fragmentation, pre-existing amounts of edge, lack of connectivity) must be resolved by long-term, post facto management. To date, estimates of preserve persistence have not been used in MSHCPs. Rather than focus on map-based exercises of preserve elements, it may be more productive to set goals for the persistence of species (states) and ecosystems (processes) within the preserves-accepting that preserve configurations and arrays will be defined by the landscape and politics of suburban areas and that long-term management will provide the primary means of maintaining biodiversity along the wildland/urban interlace.

AB  - Although gender differences in conformity are noticed in human studies, cultural norms and psychosocial factors inevitably affect such differences. Biological factors, especially the gonadal hormones and the brain regions involved, contributing to the sex differences in behavioral conformity remained scarcely explored. To prevent psychosocial and cultural norm confounds, intact and gonadectomized male and female mice were used to assess the modulating effects of gonadal hormones on behavioral conformity and such conformity-related brain regions using an approach of choice paradigm. Intact and gonadectomized mice' choices for the nonrewarded runway were assessed when these experimental mice were alone versus with a group, consisting of three same-sex noncagemates choosing the respective experimental mice' nonrewarded runway, in a double-J-shaped maze test. Although male and female mice exhibited comparable rewarded runway choices at the conclusion of the operant training procedures and in the test individually, male mice demonstrated greater conformity index as compared to female mice when group tested. Gonadectomy, done at their 4 or 9 weeks of age, decreased males' conformity index but did not affect females' when both sexes were group tested. Such gonadectomy did not affect the conditioning or conformity index when tested individually in either sex. Female mice had higher serum corticosterone (CORT) levels when group tested as compared to the female mice tested individually and male mice. Finally, the number of FOS-staining cells in high conformity-displaying mice was found less than it in the low conformity-performing mice in the nucleus accumbens. Taken together, we conclude that testis-derived hormones, at least, play a role in enhancing behavioral conformity in male mice. CORT and nucleus accumbal neuronal activity deserve further investigation for their involvement in behavioral conformity.

AB  - Street dust forms as a result of the interaction of the atmosphere, lithosphere (pedosphere) and anthroposphere and can be regarded as an index of the condition of the environment in urban areas. At the end of the twentieth century, there was a significant decrease in heavy metal emissions in Europe, but not so intensive in Poland. The question arises: Is the intensity of pollution still decreasing? The study objective was to assess changes in street dust pollution with heavy metals in Lublin (E Poland) in the years 2013 and 2018. The sample collection sites (68) were located within streets with a varying intensity of motor traffic. Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn concentrations were determined in two dust fractions, 63-200 mu m and < 63 mu m, by means of an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The levels of street dust pollution with heavy metals, expressed both in absolute concentrations and geochemical indices, were lower in 2018 than those in 2013. The clearest decrease of concentration levels occurred within the main roads, in the 63-200 mu m fraction for Cu and Cd, and in both fractions for Pb. The mean concentrations of the investigated metals, normalised to the background values, are in the following order for both fractions in 2013 and 2018: Zn > Cd > Cu > Cr > Pb > Ni. Metals form the following order for I-geo and EF: Zn > Cd > Cu > Pb > Cr > Ni. This order is slightly different for the ecological risk factor: Cd > Cu > Pb > Zn > Cr > Ni. In general, street dust in Lublin does not show contamination with Cr, Ni and Pb. I-geo and EF indices show moderate levels of pollution with Cu, Cd and Zn.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. Life cycle assessment models typically use product-specific, plant-level or national aggregate data. However, many decisions by regional policy makers would be better informed by local or regional aggregate data. This research is intended to construct and apply a regional US economic input-output analysis-based life cycle assessment (REIO-LCA) model based upon publicly available datasets. The model uses Gross State Product (GSP) estimates to calculate regional economic multipliers and then link them to regional electricity and fuel use, and air emission factors. Target audiences are governmental decision makers, industry experts and researchers concerned,with the regional economic and environmental effects of public and private decisions.
   Methods. A regional version of the existing US EIO-LCA model was developed using-regional economic multipliers and state environmental data. The national model is based on the US 491 by 491 economic input-output model, and uses sectoral energy consumption and emission factors to approximate the environmental effects of production and services. The proportion of the regional value added (Gross State Product) to the national value added for each sector was used to develop economic multipliers to allocate the output of industries to individual states and multi-state regions. Inter-sectoral transaction matrices were constructed for eight regions. Regional environmental emission and resource use factors were formed based upon publicly available data of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of Energy. The Toxics Release Inventory include facility location parameters, enabling the estimation of sectoral toxic emissions for the regions. The national electricity and fuel use, air pollutants (CO, NOx, PM10, SO2 and VOC) and greenhouse gas emissions used by the EIO-LCA model were proportioned based upon state totals for each sector.
   Results. A regional economic input-output model was created for US regions; and sectoral energy use and environmental emission factors were estimated for Pennsylvania, the Far West (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and Washington) and the Mideast (Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) economic areas. The use of the framework for regional IO-LCA model is demonstrated through two case studies.
   Discussion. As a validation exercise, the regional outputs of petroleum refineries were calculated using the regional input-output matrices and the outcomes were compared to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Petroleum State Profile data. The model results show that approximately 70% of the total national sectoral production takes place in three regions, i.e., South West, South East and Far West, which corresponds with the EIA statistics. The REIO-LCA model constructed for the Far West is used to conduct a second case study estimating the annual toxic air emissions of power plants in the region in 2003. The results are evaluated by comparison to data provided by the US EPA. The estimated pollutions do not differ significantly from those presented in the Toxics Release Inventory reports.
   Conclusions. The usefulness of IO LCA models can be improved through the incorporation of local economic and environmental characteristics. Wiht the lack of US regional sectoral data, the allocation of national industrial production to regions can provide a framework to create smaller scale IO models. The results of case studies support the assumption that the GSP multipliers may be used to allocate the sectoral production to the regions, and show that the framework IO LCA model provides a reasonable approximation of supply chain economic activities and environmental effects caused by production and services.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. The quality of data, e.g., age and level of aggregation, and the assumed linearity between sectoral outputs and environmental emissions represent the main sources of uncertainty in the model. The results show that the GSP estimates are appropriate to construct a framework for a regional economic input-output and environmental assessment model. However, further research is recommended to construct more specific state-level input-output matrices incorporating interstate commodity flows, and state environmental factors in order to mitigate the parameter uncertainties. Further, the model might be improved by updating it regularly, as more recent data become available.

AB  - The Grafs-Seneque/Riverstrahler model was implemented for the first time on the Loire River for the 2002-2014 period, to explore eutrophication after improvement of wastewater treatments. The model reproduced the interannual levels and seasonal trends of the major water quality variables. Although eutrophication has been impressively reduced in the drainage network, a eutrophication risk still exists at the coast, as shown by the N-ICEP indicator, pointing out an excess of nitrogen over silica and phosphorus. From maximum biomass exceeding 120 mu gChla l(-1) in the 1980's, we observed decreasing maximum values from 80 to 30 mu gChla l(-1) during the period studied. Several scenarios were explored. Regarding nutrient point sources, a low waste water treatment scenario, similar to the situation in the 1980's, was elaborated, representing much greater pollution than the reference period (2002-2014). For diffuse sources, two agricultural scenarios were elaborated for reducing nitrogen, one with a strict application of the agricultural directives and another investigating the impact of radical structural changes in agriculture and the population's diet. Although reduced, a risk of eutrophication would remain, even with the most drastic scenario. In addition, a pristine scenario, with no human activity within the basin, was devised to assess water quality in a natural state. The impact of a change in hydrology on the Loire biogeochemical functioning was also explored according to the effect of climate change by the end of the 21st century. The EROS hydrological model was used to force Riverstrahler, considering the most pessimistic SRES A2 scenario run with the ARPEGE model. Nutrient fluxes all decreased due to a N50% reduction in the average annual discharge, overall reducing the risk of coastal eutrophication, but worsening the water quality status of the river network. The Riverstrahler model could be useful to help water managers contend with future threats in the Loire River, at the scale of its basin and at smaller nested scales. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Eli's Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 sets a 15% restoration target. However, the understanding of restoration as a management tool remains ambiguous at EU and Member State levels.
   As a country with rich biodiversity but low GDP, a well-defined priority setting approach is key for Bulgaria. The "Methodological framework for assessment and mapping of ecosystem condition and ecosystem services in Bulgaria" proposes a transition towards ecosystem management and monitoring of the Socio-Ecological System (SES), to be embedded in the environmental policy framework.
   We extend the analogy between SES and the human body's system in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as a way to inform restoration priority setting and development of restoration and monitoring tools at several levels:
   1. Overall objective: the sustainability goals correspond to the TCM's objective of a healthy, balanced body
   2, Restoration objectives and functioning: the desired ecosystem state can be better understood in analogy between the ecosystem structure and functioning framework for multiparametric optimization, and the TCM framework of Ying-Yang, Eight principles, Five elements and organs
   3. Ecosystem monitoring: Integrated monitoring may benefit from comparison to TCM diagnostics
   4. Ecosystem management approaches can benefit from the analogy to the TCM system of meridians
   We apply the analogy and find that spatially explicit decision making on restoration, streamlined ecosystem monitoring and a number of other issues (green infrastructure, designation of protected areas, defragmentation and connectivity, cumulative impact assessment, etc.), are easier to understand, communicate, account for and manage. Ecosystem restoration is priority for China and the country has accumulated research and practical experience, including study of links between ecosystem management and the historical principles of Chinese philosophy.
   The Bulgarian and European approach to ecosystem based management can benefit from analogies to TCM. We derive policy recommendations by analogy, and illustrate them on the example of Natural Capital Accounting, (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Herbicides are commonly used in agriculture and silviculture to reduce interspecific competition among plants and thereby enhance crop growth, quality, and volume. Internationally, formulations of glyphosate-based herbicides are the most widely used herbicides in both these sectors. A large amount of work has focused on the effects of these herbicides on amphibians. Several laboratory and mesocosm studies have demonstrated that various formulations of glyphosate herbicides can be acutely toxic to larval and juvenile amphibians at concentrations at the upper end of environmental realism. However, to date there has been little work done investigating such effects in natural systems, limited work on juvenile amphibians, and only a few studies have investigated interactions with other stressors. We conducted a 16 day field experiment in which juveniles of two amphibian species (Lithobates clamitans and Lithobates pipiens) were exposed to the herbicide Roundup WeatherMax (TM) at four application rates (0, 2.16, 4.32 and 8.64 kg a.e./ha) to investigate effects on survival, liver somatic index (LSI), body condition, and incidence of disease caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). In a separate 16 day laboratory experiment, we exposed juvenile L. clamitans to both the herbicide and Bd. Results of our studies showed that this particular herbicide formulation had no effect on juvenile survival, LSI, body condition, or disease incidence, nor was there an interaction between exposure to herbicide and exposure to the disease in tests which closely mimic real world exposure scenarios. These experiments suggest that Roundup WeatherMax as typically used in agriculture is unlikely to cause significant deleterious effects on juvenile amphibians under real world exposure conditions.

AB  - Drought stress during the reproductive stage is one of the most important environmental factors reducing the grain yield and yield stability of pearl millet. A QTL mapping approach has been used in this study to understand the genetic and physiological basis of drought tolerance in pearl millet and to provide a more-targeted approach to improving the drought tolerance and yield of this crop in water-limited environments. The aim was to identify specific genomic regions associated with the enhanced tolerance of pearl millet to drought stress during the flowering and grain-filling stages. Test-crosses of a set of mapping-population progenies, derived from a cross of two inbred pollinators that differed in their response to drought, were evaluated in a range of managed terminal drought-stress environments. A number of genomic regions were associated with drought tolerance in terms of both grain yield and its components. For example, a QTL associated with grain yield per se and for the drought tolerance of grain yield mapped on linkage group 2 and explained up to 23% of the phenotypic variation. Some of these QTLs were common across stress environments whereas others were specific to only a particular stress environment. All the QTLs that contributed to increased drought tolerance did so either through better than average maintenance (compared to non-stress environments) of harvest index, or harvest index and biomass productivity. It is concluded that there is considerable potential for marker-assisted backcross transfer of selected QTLs to the elite parent of the mapping population and for their general use in the improvement of pearl millet productivity in water-limited environments.

AB  - Rapid advances in redox systems biology are creating new opportunities to understand complexities of human disease and contributions of environmental exposures. New understanding of thiol-disulfide systems have occurred during the past decade as a consequence of the discoveries that thiol and disulfide systems are maintained in kinetically controlled steady states displaced from thermodynamic equilibrium, that a widely distributed family of NADPH oxidases produces oxidants that function in cell signaling and that a family of peroxiredoxins utilize thioredoxin as a reductant to complement the well-studied glutathione antioxidant system for peroxide elimination and redox regulation. This review focuses on thiol/disulfide redox state in biologic systems and the knowledge base available to support development of integrated redox systems biology models to better understand the function and dysfunction of thiol-disulfide redox systems. In particular, central principles have emerged concerning redox compartmentalization and utility of thiol/disulfide redox measures as indicators of physiologic function. Advances in redox proteomics show that, in addition to functioning in protein active sites and cell signaling, cysteine residues also serve as redox sensors to integrate biologic functions. These advances provide a framework for translation of redox systems biology concepts to practical use in understanding and treating human disease. Biological responses to cadmium, a widespread environmental agent, are used to illustrate the utility of these advances to the understanding of complex pleiotropic toxicities.

AB  - The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 has been a turning point in the World history that left a unique footprint on the Northern Eurasian ecosystems. Conducting large scale mapping of environmental change and separating between naturogenic and anthropogenic drivers is a difficult endeavor in such highly complex systems. In this research a piece-wise linear regression method was used for breakpoint detection in Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE) time series and a classification of ecosystem response types was produced. Supported by earth observation data, field data, and expert knowledge, this study provides empirical evidence regarding the occurrence of drastic changes in RUE (assessment of the timing, the direction and the significance of these changes) in Northern Eurasian ecosystems between 1982 and 2011. About 36% of the study area (3.4 million km(2)) showed significant (P<0.05) trends and/or turning points in RUE during the observation period. A large proportion of detected turning points in RUE occurred around the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and in the following years which were attributed to widespread agricultural land abandonment. Our study also showed that recurrent droughts deeply affected vegetation productivity throughout the observation period, with a general worsening of the drought conditions in recent years. Moreover, recent human-induced turning points in ecosystem functioning were detected and attributed to ongoing recultivation and change in irrigation practices in the Volgograd region, and to increased salinization and increased grazing intensity around Lake Balkhash. The ecosystem-state assessment method introduced here proved to be a valuable support that highlighted hotspots of potentially altered ecosystems and allowed for disentangling human from climatic disturbances.

AB  - Growth variability was examined for Pacific saury Cololabis saira larvae under contrasting environments across the Kuroshio axis, based on samples collected during the winter spawning season in 2013 and 2014. The growth rate index (residual of the otolith marginal 3-day mean increment width from the linear regression on knob length) of larvae was compared among three areas: the inshore side of the Kuroshio axis, the Kuroshio axis, and the offshore side of the Kuroshio axis in relation to sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS) and chlorophyll-a (CHL) concentration. The larvae were more densely distributed in the Kuroshio axis and offshore areas of higher temperature and salinity and lower chlorophyll-a concentration than in the inshore areas of lower temperature and salinity and higher chlorophyll-a concentration. No marked differences in the growth rate index were found among the three areas, even though the larvae in the inshore areas showed slightly higher growth rates in 2013. Despite the broad ranges of environmental factors, no clear relationship between the growth rate index and any environmental factor was detected. The survival potential of Pacific saury larvae was considered to be at least comparable under contrasting environments across the Kuroshio axis. Such a geographical homogeneity is concluded to be attributable to compensable effects of physical and biological factors. We hypothesize that the minority under physically-unfavorable but biologically-favorable conditions on the inshore side of the Kuroshio axis could survive equally well as the majority under physically-favorable but biologically-unfavorable conditions around the Kuroshio axis and on the offshore side of the Kuroshio axis.

AB  - We examined the effect of individual environmental factors on the current spruce tree growth assessed from a repeated country-level statistical landscape (incl. forest) survey in the Czech Republic An extensive set of variables related to tree size, competition, site characteristics including soil texture, chemistry, N deposition and climate was tested within a random-effect model to explain growth in the conditions of dominantly managed forest ecosystems. The current spruce basal area increment was assessed from two consecutive landscape surveys conducted in 2008/2009 and six years later in 2014/2015. Tree size, age and competition within forest stands were found to be the dominant explanatory variables, whereas the expression of site characteristics, environmental and climatic drives was weaker. The significant site variables affecting growth included soil C/N ratio and soil exchangeable acidity (pH KCI; positive response) reflecting soil chemistry, long-term N-deposition (averaged since 1975) in combination with soil texture (clay content) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), a drought index expressing moisture conditions. Sensitivity of growth to N-deposition was positive, although weak. SPI was positively related to and significant in explaining tree growth when expressed for the growth season. Except SPI, no significant relation of growth was determined to altitude-related variables (temperature, growth season length). We identified the current spruce growth optimum at elevations about 800 m a.s.l. or higher in the conditions of the country. This suggests that at lower elevations, limitation by a more pronounced water deficit dominates, whereas direct temperature limitation may concern the less frequent higher elevations. The mixed linear model of spruce tree growth explained 55 and 65% of the variability with fixed and random effects included, respectively, and provided new insights on the current spruce tree growth and factors affecting it within the environmental gradients of the country.

AB  - The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is a federal program that encourages the planting of cool- or warm-season grass cover on highly erodible croplands and along stream corridors. We sought to determine whether fish community structure in coldwater streams was associated with CRP and other agricultural land use changes in southwestern Wisconsin. We compared coldwater fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores and species richness in streams located in areas of relatively high (21.3% of land area; high-CRP area) versus relatively low (12.1% of land area; low-CRP area) CRP participation. All of the streams were sampled in the 1970s before implementation of the CRP and again at the same locations after implementation, from 2000 to 2005. Pre-CRP fish communities were characterized by a relatively high diversity of eurythermal species and low coldwater IBI scores. We found significant increases in coldwater IBI scores over time in streams within the high-CRP area relative to streams within the low-CRP area. Fish populations in streams within the high-CRP area shifted from eurythermal and tolerant species before CRP implementation to stenothermal, cool- and coldwater species after implementation. Ecological responses within the high-CRP streams also included a reduction in species richness. Without intensive monitoring of watershed nutrients, the fish community changes cannot be mechanistically linked to specific land use practices. However, we demonstrate that IBI scores and species richness were correlated with phosphorus loading estimates and that predicted phosphorus reductions were greater within the high-CRP grassland area. The estimated phosphorus loading declines reflected reduced cropland areas and reduced density of dairy farms. The estimates did not capture all environmental factors, such as trends in production of hogs and cattle or streamflow regime changes associated with conservation practices. We conclude that the combination of extensive grassland management, livestock reductions, and other long-term agricultural land use changes benefited the coldwater fish communities within the high-CRP area.

AB  - We test the relationship between canopy photosynthesis and reflected near-infrared radiation from vegetation across a range of functional (photosynthetic pathway and capacity) and structural conditions (leaf area index, fraction of green and dead leaves, canopy height, reproductive stage, and leaf angle inclination), weather conditions, and years using a network of field sites from across central California. We based our analysis on direct measurements of canopy photosynthesis, with eddy covariance, and measurements of reflected near-infrared and red radiation from vegetation, with light-emitting diode sensors. And we interpreted the observed relationships between photosynthesis and reflected near-infrared radiation using simulations based on the multilayer, biophysical model, CanVeg. Measurements of reflected near-infrared radiation were highly correlated with measurements of canopy photosynthesis on half-hourly, daily, seasonal, annual, and decadal time scales across the wide range of function and structure and weather conditions. Slopes of the regression between canopy photosynthesis and reflected near-infrared radiation were greatest for the fertilized and irrigated C(4)corn crop, intermediate for the C(3)tules on nutrient-rich organic soil and nitrogen fixing alfalfa, and least for the native annual grasslands and oak savanna on nutrient-poor, mineral soils. Reflected near-infrared radiation from vegetation has several advantages over other remotely sensed vegetation indices that are used to infer canopy photosynthesis; it does not saturate at high leaf area indices, it is insensitive to the presence of dead legacy vegetation, the sensors are inexpensive, and the reflectance signal is strong. Hence, information on reflected near-infrared radiation from vegetation may have utility in monitoring carbon assimilation in carbon sequestration projects or on microsatellites orbiting Earth for precision agriculture applications.

AB  - The use of fish communities to assess environmental quality is common for streams, but a standard methodology for large rivers is as yet largely undeveloped. We developed an index to assess the condition of fish assemblages along 1,580 km of the Ohio River. Representative samples of fish assemblages were collected from 709 Ohio River reaches, including 318 "least-impacted" sites, from 1991 to 2001 by means of standardized nighttime boat-electrofishing techniques. We evaluated 55 candidate metrics based on attributes of fish assemblage structure and function to derive a multimetric index of river health. We examined the spatial (by river kilometer) and temporal variability of these metrics and assessed their responsiveness to anthropogenic disturbances, namely, effluents, turbidity, and highly embedded substrates. The resulting Ohio River Fish Index (ORFIn) comprises 13 metrics selected because they responded predictably to measures of human disturbance or reflected desirable features of the Ohio River. We retained two metrics (the number of intolerant species and the number of sucker species [family Catostomidae]) from Karr's original index of biotic integrity. Six metrics were modified from indices developed for the upper Ohio River (the number of native species; number of great-river species; number of centrarchid species; the number of deformities, eroded fins and barbels, lesions, and tumors; percent individuals as simple lithophils; and percent individuals as tolerant species). We also incorporated three trophic metrics (the percent of individuals as detritivores, invertivores, and piscivores), one metric based on catch per unit effort, and one metric based on the percent of individuals as nonindigenous fish species. The ORFIn declined significantly where anthropogenic effects on substrate and water quality were prevalent and was significantly lower in the first 500 m below point source discharges than at least-impacted sites nearby. Although additional research on the temporal stability of the metrics and index will likely enhance the reliability of the ORFIn, its incorporation into Ohio River assessments still represents an improvement over current physicochemical protocols.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important input to the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model to derive the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) for drought monitoring. Currently, LST inputs to the ALEXI model come from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, but clouds affect them. While passive microwave (e.g., AMSR-E and AMSR-2) sensors can penetrate non-rainy clouds and observe the Earth's surface, but usually with a coarse spatial resolution, how to utilize multiple instruments' advantages is an important methodology in remote sensing. In this study, we developed a new five-channel algorithm to derive LST from the microwave AMSR-E and AMSR-2 measurements and calibrate to the MODIS and GOES LST products. A machine learning method is implemented to further improve its performance. The MODIS and GOES LST products still show better performance than the AMSR-E and AMSR-2 LSTs when evaluated against the ground observations. Therefore, microwave LSTs are only used to fill the gaps due to clouds in the MODIS and GOES LST products. A gap filling method is further applied to fill the remaining gaps in the merged LSTs and downscale to the same spatial resolution as the MODIS and GOES products. With the daily integrated LST at the same spatial resolution as the MODIS and GOES products and available under nearly all sky conditions, the drought index, like the ESI, can be updated on daily basis. The initial implementation results demonstrate that the daily drought map can catch the fast changes of drought conditions and capture the signals of flash drought, and make flash drought monitoring become possible. It is expected that a drought map that is available on daily basis will benefit future drought monitoring.

AB  - The capability to simulate fababean (Vicia faba L.) production across the range of environments in which it is grown in Australia provides a tool for assessing agronomic and management options for the crop. This paper describes the building and testing of a model of fababean (cv. Fiord) development and growth, designed for use in the cropping systems simulator, APSIM. Parameters describing leaf area expansion, radiation interception, biomass accumulation and partitioning, root growth, water use, and nitrogen accumulation were sourced from the literature or developed from experiments conducted by the authors. In addition, parameters defining phenological development in response to temperature and photoperiod were derived from a comprehensive dataset of times to flowering and maturity.
   Routines for pre-flowering phenology predicted time to flowering ranging from 43 to 94 days with a root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 4.3 days. Post-flowering development could not be satisfactorily predicted using thermal time alone; analysis of the collated data suggested that the lengths of some post-flowering phases were related to photoperiod. With incorporation of a photoperiod effect on post-flowering development, time from sowing to maturity was simulated with an R(2) of 92% and an RMSD of 6.7 days.
   The model was tested over a diverse range of latitudinal and climatic conditions within Australia, using data from experiments in which sowing date, crop density, and water supply varied. Observed grain yield (n=42) varied from 500 to 5600 kg/ha. In general, observed biomass and yield patterns within a growing season were reproduced well. Simulated grain yield explained 87% of the variance in observed yields (RMSD=466 kg/ha). Apart from demonstrating the capability of the model over a wide range of growing conditions, the tests highlighted a number of areas for future improvement, including accounting for lodging, variation in harvest index under wet conditions, and accurate simulation of the response of leaf area expansion to mild levels of water deficit.

AB  - Forced convection heat transfer characteristics of a cylinder (maintained at a constant temperature) immersed in a streaming power-law fluids have been studied numerically in the two-dimensional (2-D), unsteady flow regime. The governing equations, namely, continuity, momentum and thermal energy, have been solved using a finite volume method based solver (FLUENT 6.3) over wide ranges of conditions (power law index, 0.4 <= n <= 1.8; Reynolds number, 40 <= Re <= 140; Prandtl number, 1 <= Pr <= 100). In particular, extensive numerical results elucidating the influence of Reynolds number, Prandtl number and power-law index on the isotherm patterns, local and average Nusselt numbers and their evolution with time are discussed in detail. Over the ranges of conditions considered herein, the nature of flow is fully periodic in time. The heat transfer characteristics are seen to be influenced in an intricate manner by the value of the Reynolds number (Re), Prandtl number (Pr) and the power-law index (n). Depending upon the value of the power-law index (n), though the flow transits from being steady to unsteady somewhere in the range similar to 33 < Re < 50, the fully periodic behavior is seen only beyond the critical value of the Reynolds number (Re). As expected, the average Nusselt number increases with an increase in the values of Reynolds and/or Prandtl numbers, irrespective of the value of the flow behavior index. A strong influence of the power-law index on both local and time-averaged Nusselt numbers was observed. Broadly, all else being equal, shear-thinning behavior (n < 1) promotes heat transfer whereas shear-thickening behavior (n > 1) impedes it. Furthermore, this effect is much more pronounced in shear-thinning fluids than that in shear-thickening fluids. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) (SCN) has become an increasing problem in the upper midwest. In order to develop appropriate practices to manage SCN populations it is important to understand the population dynamics of SCN under held conditions. Soybean cyst nematode population dynamics were determined in naturally infested commercial soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] fields in southern Minnesota on a monthly basis during 1991 and 1992 for an adapted susceptible (S) and a SCN Race 3 resistant (R) cultivar and three blends (25% R:75% S; 50% R:50% S; 75% R:25% S). Population dynamics differed between sites and years. In 1991, fields with similar initial cyst densities were compared. Densities of second-stage juveniles (J2) peaked in August at one site and gradually declined throughout the growing season at the other. Total cyst production was lower at the site where J2 densities declined. In 1992, fields with high and low initial egg densities were compared. SCN population densities increased when initial densities of J2 and eggs were low and decreased when initial J2 and egg densities were high. Physiological race of the nematode influenced population dynamics on resistant plants. The cyst index under field conditions for the resistant cultivar was 10 (moderately resistant) against Race 3 and 32 (moderately susceptible) against Race 1. The blends generally lowered SCN population densities, but not significantly. Final egg density and cyst production for the resistant cultivar were significantly lower than the susceptible cultivar at each site. The use of SCN resistant cultivars alone or in a 75:25% mixture with a susceptible cultivar (25%) is recommended as a SCN population management strategy to delay shifts from one race to another thus prolonging the effectiveness of resistant cultivars.

AB  - The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is becoming a serious problem on Bt cotton. It causes enormous crop loss through its direct feeding and as a vector of cotton leaf curl virus. Chemical-dependent management is harming the environment and increased insecticide resistance is often observed in the fields. Identification of most virulent strains of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) is essential to serve as an important component of an IPM program for management of B. tabaci. Compared to B. tabaci adults, the nymphal stage is reported to be more susceptible to entomopathogens, and targeting nymphs also helps vector management. We evaluated the bioefficacy of EPF and chemical pesticides against nymphs of B. tabaci on Bt cotton under polyhouse and field conditions. The bioefficacy index (BI) was considered as a mechanism to select the most effective EPF strains for field evaluation. The highest nymphal mortality under polyhouse conditions was recorded for Metarhizium anisopliae NA-01299 (86.7%), Beauveria bassiana MT-4511 (85.1%), Cordyceps javanica IT-10498 (81.1%), IT-10499 (81%), and B. bassiana NA-0409 (78.2%) relative to other EPF strains, spiromesifen (69.6%), buprofezin (62.2%) and pyriproxyfen (52.7%) at 7-days-post-spray treatment (DAS). However, among all the EPF, the highest BI was recorded in C. javanica IT-10499 (77%), IT-10495 (75.4%), Fusarium verticillioides IT-10493 (74.6%), and B. bassiana MT-4511 (73.1%). The pooled data of two-year field trials (2017-18 & 2018-19) revealed that the highest nymphal mortality was recorded for MT-4511 (85%), IT-10499 (83.2%), and pyriproxyfen 10% EC (78.6%) at 7-DAS. The BI-based selection of EPF proved to be a useful predictor of field efficacy. A sequential spray of the selected EPF would be a vital approach for resilient and sustainable integrated management of the B. tabaci nymphal population under field conditions.

AB  - Complexity is an elusive term in ecology that is often used in different ways to describe the state of an ecosystem. Ecological complexity has been linked to concepts such as ecological integrity, diversity and resilience and has been put forth as a candidate ecological orientor. In this article, the concept of complexity as a system attribute is presented and candidate measures of ecological complexity are reviewed. The measures are distinguished by their ability to characterize the spatial, temporal, structural or spatiotemporal signatures of an ecosystem. Many of these measures have been adapted from disciplines such as physics and information theory that have a long history of quantifying complexity, however more work needs to be clone to develop techniques adapted to ecological data.

AB  - The multi-indicators (chemical, biological, and physical), as well as their associated risks to human health, were assessed at the same time as an assessment of the use of sites for physical activity. The sampling was conducted in both the dry and wet seasons in 2014, between 4:30 and 7:30 pm, a period considered the "peak hours" of traffic and also the time that most people practice physical activity. Regarding the chemical indicators, the distribution of carbonyl compound levels should be influenced by the flow of vehicles, while the respirable particles are governed by the number of diesel vehicles. The cancer risk corresponding to the value recommended by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for formaldehyde was exceeded only in the dry season in one location studied. The risk of non-carcinogenic substances showed that acrolein levels at all locations and in the two periods studied might cause adverse effects to the health of the recreation site users. Exposure to respirable particles at levels corresponding to the value recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) was exceeded in all locations during the two study periods. For biological indicators, only the bacteria levels show pollution ranging from medium to high for the two sites in both periods studied. Regarding the physical indicators, the noise levels in the studied sites exceeded the standards recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and US-EPA. In most places, the thermal comfort was close to 40, which is classified as "supportable discomfort.".

AB  - Marsh bird habitats are influenced by water levels which may pose challenges for interpreting bird-based indices of wetland health. We determined how much fluctuating water levels and associated changes in emergent vegetation influence the Index of Marsh Bird Community Integrity (IMBCI) using data collected in Great Lakes coastal wetlands by participants in Bird Studies Canada's Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program. IMBCI scores for 90 wetlands in Lake Erie and 131 wetlands in Lake Ontario decreased with decreasing water levels due to decreasing number of marsh-dependent species in Lake Erie and perhaps also in Lake Ontario. The average magnitude of the decrease in scores between extremely high and low water periods for wetlands with sufficient data was 15% in Lake Erie where water dropped 0.9 m on average (n = 11 wetlands) and 18% in Lake Ontario where water dropped 0.5 m (n = 7). Scores in Lake Erie increased with increasing Typha due to increasing numbers of marsh-dependent species and decreased with increasing Phragmites due to increasing numbers of generalist species. The opposite was observed in Lake Ontario, perhaps due to denser Typha and sparser Phragmites. Scores were explained by the naturally fluctuating water levels of Lake Erie, which favored Phragmites expansion and the regulated water levels of Lake Ontario which promoted Typha expansion. Scores were influenced by fluctuating water levels and associated changes in emergent vegetation. Inter-annual water level fluctuations should be considered when interpreting any indicator of wetland health that is based on marsh-dependent bird species.

AB  - We present a methodology for a large-scale assessment of soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects on the vibrational characteristics and the seismic loading of structures in a real urban fabric by combining airborne monitoring techniques, field surveys and simple calculations in the realm of structural and geotechnical dynamics. The proposed procedure combines geometrical features of a building stock acquired from a LiDAR-based 3D city model, material and typology data of structures from in situ inspections in representative building blocks, geotechnical data from field surveys and strong ground motion data from seismic hazard and site effects analyses. The integrated data are employed to compute at a first stage the fundamental period of each building in the urban area by means of code-defined formulas for both fixed- and flexible-base foundation conditions, thus treating soil-structure interaction effects in a simplified manner. The seismic action in terms of spectral acceleration at the fundamental period of structures is then computed, following a series of 1D site-specific analyses of soil response under different seismic scenarios. Spatially distributed ratios of structural fundamental periods and spectral accelerations, corresponding to flexible-over fixed-base foundation conditions, are mapped in GIS environment as an index of SSI effects at large-scale. The methodology is implemented in the urban area of Kalochori located west of Thessaloniki in Greece. The examined case study showed that SSI may be significant even for low-amplitude motions and may lead to higher seismic forces compared to the fixed-base case, depending on the dynamic characteristics of the structures, the soil conditions and the shape of the response spectrum. The above may be of importance in microzonation and seismic vulnerability studies at urban-scale when a building-by-building assessment is not feasible and SSI effects are too important to be ignored.

AB  - This work studies the size-dependent free vibration response of functionally graded (FG) nanoplates using a layerwise theory. The proposed model supposes not only a higher-order displacement field for the core but also the first-order displacement field for the two face sheets, thereby maintaining an interlaminar displacement continuity among layers. Unlike the conventional layerwise models, the number of variables is kept fixed and does not increase for an increased number of layers. This is a very important feature compared to conventional layerwise models and facilitates significantly the engineering analyses. The material properties of the FG nanoplate are graded continuously through the thickness direction in accordance with a power-law function. The Eringen's nonlocal elasticity theory is here adopted to relax the continuum axiom required in classical continuum mechanics and hence hopeful to capture the small size effects of naturally discrete nanoplates. The equations of motion of the problem are obtained via a classical Hamilton's principle. The present layerwise model is implemented with a computationally efficient C0- continuous isoparametric serendipity elements and applied to solve a large-scale discrete numerical problem. The robustness and reliability of the developed finite element model are demonstrated by a comparative evaluation of results against predictions from literature. The comparative studies show that the proposed finite element model is: (a) free of shear locking, (b) accurate with a fast rate convergence for both thin and thick FG nanoplates, and (c) excellent in terms of numerical stability. Moreover, a detailed parametric analysis checks for the sensitivity of the vibration response of FG nanoplates to the aspect ratio, length-to-thickness ratio, nonlocal parameter, boundary conditions, power-law index, and modes shapes. Referential results are also reported, for the first time, for natural frequencies of FGM nanoplates which will serve as benchmarks for further computational investigations.

AB  - The aim of the study was to specify the direction and dynamics of changes occurring in forest soils in the area affected by Zaklady Azotowe 'Pulawy' S.A. (nitriogen plant) on the basis of the activity of soil enzymes catalysing the key processes in the conversion of organic matter. The study involved examining the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils in the monitoring plots, which consisted of Scots pine plantations mixed with birch and oak trees located within a medium forest damage zone (9, 15 and 17 km north-east from the plant) in the Pulawy Forest District (eastern Poland). The research work was carried out in the years 2009-2013. Dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, urease, and protease were determined along with selected chemical soil properties (pH and organic carbon content). The activity of studied enzymes and organic carbon content in the analysed soils significantly increased with increasing distance from the nitrogen plant. It was significantly higher inside than outside the rhizosphere. The observed biological activity of soils in the rhizosphere indicated that it formed a buffering system for environmental stressors, including those reaching the soils affected by industrial emissions. The soil of natural forest ecosystems with significantly higher organic carbon content than the remaining studied soils was characterised by the highest activity of all the enzymes observed during the monitoring period. The experimental plots were shown to have the highest activity of the analysed enzymes and the highest organic carbon content in the soil under the pine stands, and the lowest in the soil under the oak stands. The stability of the biochemical processes occurring in the selected experimental plots during the 5-year monitoring period and the clear tendency for the increasing activity of the analysed enzymes and organic carbon content over the study years indicate that the introduction of populations of pine mixed with birch and oak along the lines of the prevailing wind directions may improve the chemical and ecological state of forest soils in the area affected by the activity of the nitrogen source.

AB  - Assuming the huge progress achieved in public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS) techniques and its current research gaps, this study aims to explore differences in the perception of spatial distribution of ecosystem services supply and demand between different stakeholders through collaborative mapping. The stakeholders selected included high influence stakeholder (with a high degree of interest on the ecosystem services' stare and with an important influence into the environmental decision making process) and low influence stakeholders (with a high degree of interest on the ecosystem services' state and with a low influence in environmental management). Workshops took place in June 2013 in two regions of Andalusia; overall 29 participants were involved. Water provision, food from agriculture, livestock, erosion control, climate regulation, water purification, nature tourism, recreational hunting and tranquility were collaboratively mapped. Agriculture land-use and the protected area surface were also assessed in order to Find patterns in ecosystem services supply, meanwhile the role of urban areas was assessed for ecosystem services demand. The results show that low and high influence stakeholders have different perceptions of the spatial distribution of ecosystem services and the scale of their demand. We call for the recognition of these knowledge differences (experiential and technical) and their inclusion in decision making processes regarding landscape planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecological health in a temperate stream impacted by acid mine drainage (AMD) was evaluated by using a multimetric approach of the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) based on natural fish assemblage. Recently, this approach has been widely used in many developed countries as a tool for ecological risk assessments of water environments. We used 10 metric systems, instead of 12 metrics suggested by Barbour, M. T., Gerritsen, J., Snyder, B. D., & Stribling, J. B. (1999). Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers: Periphyton, benthic Macroinvertebrates and Fish, 2nd edn. EPA 841-B-99-002. Washington, DC: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, for a development of the regional IBI model, and used trophic guilds, habitat guilds, and richness variables for the calculation of IBI values. In the model, the attributes of four of 11 metrics were modified for the regional application. IBI values in the stream averaged 20.6 (n = 5), indicating a "poor condition" in terms of ecological health according to the modified criteria of U.S. EPA (1993). Fish Field and Laboratory Methods for Evaluating the Biological Integrity of Surface Waters. EPA 600-R-92-11 1. Environmental Monitoring systems Laboratory - Cincinnati office of Modeling, Monitoring systems, and quality assurance Office of Research Development, U.S. EPA, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45268. In particular, mean IBI values in the impacted areas of sites 2 and 3 were 13, and this health condition was categorized as "very poor condition." IBI values in the impacted sites were significantly lower than the values found in the control. Also, we found that fishes in site sites 2 and 3 were not present during the study, and morphological deformity of Rhynchocypris oxycephalus was observed in site 4, influenced directly by sites 2 and 3, indicating a chemical impact in the sites. From the results of experiments in which AMD was treated with marine shells at stagnant condition, pH increased up to 6.0 from 3.1, and Fe and Al were removed up to 99% within 6 h. In the reactor experiment considering field application, pH of effluent maintained around 7.0. In addition, concentrations of Fe, Al, and heavy metals decreased remarkably in the effluents, and bottom-opened screen between neutralizer basins showed high effectiveness in the treatment of AMD.

AB  - This paper presents results from a longitudinal, qualitative study into the adoption of environmental management systems (EMS) in three companies in the UK water & sewerage industry. Based on institutional theory and the literature on EMS, four factors related to the adoption of EMS are identified: external and internal institutional forces, environmental performance issues, and economic performance issues. While previous literature has often assumed a balance of performance and institutional factors or a preponderance of performance factors, the results of this study indicate that institutional forces are the predominant drivers. The results further indicate that environmental performance issues become less important over time, whereas institutional drivers and economic performance rationales increase in importance over time. While conforming to institutional pressures can result in improved economic performance of a company, adoption of environmental management systems mostly on the basis of institutional and economic factors has wider repercussions for the state of corporate environmental management and progress towards greater ecological sustainability of business.

AB  - Cereals are the major contributors to global food supply, accounting for more than half of the total human calorie requirements. Sustainable availability of quality cereal grains is an important step to address the high-priority issue of food security. High concentrations of heavy metals specifically lead (Pb) in the soil negatively affect biochemical and physiological processes regulating grain quality in cereals. The dietary intake of Pb more than desirable quantity via food chain is a major concern for humans, as it can predispose individuals to chronic health issues. In plant systems, high Pb concentrations can disrupt several key metabolic processes such as electron transport chain, cellular organelles integrity, membrane stability index, PSII connectivity, mineral metabolism, oxygen-evolving complex, and enzymatic activity. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has been recommended as an inexpensive strategy for remediating Pb-contaminated soils. A diverse group of Ascomycetes fungi, i.e., dark septate endophytes is successfully used for this purpose. A symbiotic relationship between endophytes and host cereal induces Pb tolerance by immobilizing Pb ions. Molecular and cellular modifications in plants under Pb-stressed environments are explained by transcription factor families such as bZIP, ERF, and GARP as a regulator. The role of metal tolerance protein (MTP), natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP), and heavy metal ATPase in decreasing Pb toxicity is well known. In the present review, we provided the contemporary synthesis of existing data regarding the effects of Pb toxicity on morpho-physiological and biochemical responses of major cereal crops. We also highlighted the mechanism/s of Pb uptake and translocation in plants, critically discussed the possible management strategies and way forward to overcome the menace of Pb toxicity in cereals.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to justify the essence of the "Internet immersion" phenomenon and to create a standardized method for its measurement.
   A comparative analysis of approaches to human behavior on the Internet environment and existing diagnostic methods has revealed a significant variety of categories and definitions used. At the same time, there is no definition that: first, characterizes the degree and quality of user's Internet activity; second, is free from negative and clinical connotations; and, third, describes a wider time range of Internet usage than the actual state of immersion.
   The authors substantiate the possibility of studying the phenomenon of the Internet immersion through the category of disposition. It consists of the readiness to use technical means and informational resources of the Internet to solve problems in various types of activities and communication. The authors identify traditional components in the structure of the Internet immersion phenomenon. These are, first of all, a cognitive component, represented by digital competence self-assessment; then, an affective component, represented by motivation and emotional and value-based attitude towards the Internet; and a behavioral component, represented by the amount of digital consumption.
   Based on this definition, it was possible to construct a compact 9-block "Index of the Internet immersion" questionnaire. Its standardization was conducted on the sample of 712 adolescents, aged from 11 to 17. Using the factor analysis, the structure of the questionnaire was identified. The first factor includes questions that relate to the time spent on the Internet and signs of dependence on it. The second factor includes questions that reveal the activity component and emotional attitude to the Internet. The third factor includes questions about experience and self-assessment of digital competence.
   The advantage of the "Index of the Internet immersion" questionnaire is a fairly high reliability for internal consistency of scales throughout the questionnaire. We also confirmed the sufficient convergent validity of the "Internet environment immersion Index" method with the "Scale of Problematic Internet Usage" by A. A. Gerasimova, A.B. Kholmogorova (adapted version of Generalized Problematic Internet Use Scale (GPIUS) by S. Caplan) and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT, K. Young), modified by V. A. Loskutova. This indicates its validity as an independent tool that does not duplicate other tools for semantically similar phenomena measurement.
   In the conditions of forced self-isolation that have developed in our country, the method of the Internet immersion diagnostics as an adequate and theoretically justified tool will allow us to study changes in the emotional state and behavior of teenagers on the Internet.

AB  - Pesticides are chemicals used to fight agricultural pests. Their use causes extensive damage to both humans and animals, resulting in diseases mainly affecting the respiratory and digestive systems. Through this study, we evaluated the pneumotoxicity caused by a deltamethrin (DM) insecticide at a dose of 0.64mg.kg-1.day-1. We also evaluated the preventive and curative effect of the medicinal plant "citrullus colocynthis. L" antagonist of this toxicity at a dose of 150mg.kg-1.day-1. We carried out the experimental application on Wister rats as an animal model of exhalation. Several experiments were carried out on the activity of enzymes and vital indicators. This study revealed a decrease in the concentration of the protein accompanied by a decrease in the means of development of the body [25 +/- 0.23]. Then, our study showed that DM has an oxidative effect, resulting in a decrease in the level of GSH [0.05 +/- 0.00] and the enzymatic activity of GPx [0.34 +/- 0.05]. In addition to an increase in the level of MDA [4.90 +/- 0.72] and the enzymatic activity of GST [0.84 +/- 0.11]. In addition, the histological study carried out on a fragment of lung of rats treated with this pesticide showed changes in the histological structure of the lungs resulting in vascular congestion, infiltration of inflammatory cells, thickening of the walls of blood vessels, as we do. Observed intra-alveolar hemorrhages and hyperplasia of the alveolar lining. On the other hand, we have confirmed the preventive effect of the citrullus colocynthis. L after treatment with this pesticide, which has an anti-oxidant activity, which can reduce the intensity of the oxidative stress resulting from deltamethrin and its effectiveness. In the treatment of lung, tissue effected by this pesticide and it is stored in its natural state.

AB  - The wood industry consumes a lot of water. Due to the reduction of water resources in the world, the treatment of this contaminated water is very essential. In this study, the removal efficiencies of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity from woodchips wastewater with the use of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) were studied at a bench scale. Woodchips wastewater samples were collected with a COD of 1300 mg L-1 and a turbidity of 93 NTU. The optimization of the SBR process was investigated by response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite design (CCD). A quadratic polynomial model was fit to the data with R-2 of 0.9919 for COD reduction, R-2 of 0.9910 for turbidity removal, and R-2 of 0.9945 for sludge volume Index (SVI), respectively. The effect of three parameters, including initial COD, mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS), and Hydraulic retention time (HRT) on the COD reduction and turbidity removal were evaluated. The initial COD (A), MLSS (B), cycle time (C), AB, AC, BC, A(2), B-2, and C-2 were considered as the affective parameters in the COD reduction. Initial COD (A), MLSS (B), A(2), B-2, C-2, AC, and BC were observed as the remarkable model terms on the turbidity removal. Also, initial COD (A), MLSS (B), cycle time (C), B-2, C-2, and BC were the significant model factors in SVI index. At optimal conditions, involving an initial COD of 1000 mg L-1, an organic loading rate (OLR) of 0.450 kg COD/m(3)d, MLSS of 3000 mg L-1, and cycle time of 24 h, we observed 94.6% of COD reduction, 98.5% turbidity removal, and 79 mL g(-1) SVI. The results also showed that the kinetic of COD reduction and turbidity removal could be represented by the pseudo-second-order model. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - To counter widespread wetland loss and deterioration due to rapid socioeconomic development, China implemented a series of wetland conservation and restoration policies that have resulted in an increase in wetland area since 2000. Although wetland loss has been contained, changes in wetland ecosystem health are poorly quantified across China. We report on China's first nationwide assessment of the spatial-temporal dynamics of wetland ecosystem health based on physical, biological, and chemical indicators from the first wetland inventory (1995-2003) to the second wetland inventory (2009-2013), and identify the potential effects of wetland ecosystem health changes to provide guidance for future wetland conservation management. We found that the wetland ecosystem health comprehensive index increased by 7.2%, indicating that China's wetland conservation and restoration policies significantly promoted an improvement in wetland ecosystem health. These improvements were concentrated in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and in the eastern and northern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Deteriorations in wetland ecosystem health were focused in southern provinces and Heilongjiang, which were mainly attributed to population increase and conversion of wetland to cropland, respectively. Although wetland protection and restoration policies have improved wetland ecosystem health without affecting agricultural production, wetland conservation did not prevent the reduction in natural wetland area and the decline in biodiversity throughout China. This analysis demonstrated that a more proactive conservation strategy is required to greatly strengthen wetland conservation management, by expanding the wetland protected area network, strictly obeying wetland ecological redlines, strengthening degraded wetland restoration, and raising population awareness of wetland protection. This study provides a proactive wetland conservation strategy, and indicates that assessment of wetland ecosystem health changes and their driving factors could contribute to a better understanding and further coordination of the relationship between wetland ecological conditions and socioeconomic development.

AB  - The Bay of Brest constitute a semi-enclosed system within which inflow from the surrounding watershed combines with domestic and industrial discharges. Sedentary organisms, such as Molluscs and Urchins, by integrating the resultant suite of impacts, are an excellent tool by which to evaluate the disturbances thus recorded by the ecosystem. Threatened by eutrophication, the pelagic system is resisting for the most part, although signs that should cause concern are appearing in certain areas, in spite of the strong tidal currents and efficient pelagic-benthic coupling. The set of tools used reveals a contrasting situation between the southern and northern basins. In the latter sector, the presence of excess organic material, PCBs, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, etc. explains the present state of general biological imbalance. This is the case, however, neither in the central part of the Bay nor in the southern basin, as shown by the finding that the biological cycle of the Scallop remains unaffected, except when catastrophic toxic plankton events occur during the larval phase.

TI  - Historical trends in salinity and substrate in central Florida Bay: A paleoecological reconstruction using modern analogue data
T2  - ESTUARIES
LA  - English
AB  - Understanding the natural spatial and temporal variability that exists within an ecosystem is a critical component of efforts to restore systems to their natural state. Analysis of benthic foraminifers and molluscs from modern monitoring sites within Florida Bay allows us to determine what environmental parameters control spatial and temporal variability of their assemblages. Faunal assemblages associated with specific environmental parameters, including salinity and substrate, serve as proxies for an interpretation of paleoecologic data. The faunal record preserved in two shallow (< 2 m) cores in central Florida Bay (Russell Bank and Bob Alien Bank) provides a record of historical trends in environmental parameters for those sites. Analysis of these two cores has revealed two distinct patterns of salinity change at these sites: 1) a long-term trend of slightly increasing average salinity; and 2) a relatively rapid change to salinity fluctuations of greater frequency and amplitude, beginning around the turn of the century and becoming most pronounced after 1940. The degree of variability in substrate types at each locality limits interpretations of substrate trends to specific sites. A common sequence of change is present in the Russell Bank and Bob Allen Bank cores: from mixed grass and bare-sediment indicators at the bottom of the cores, to bare-sediment dwellers in the center, to a dominance of vegetative-cover indicators at the top of the cores. Changes in interpreted salinity patterns around the turn of the century are consistent with the timing of the construction of the Flagler Railroad from 1905 to 1912, and the Tamiami Trail and the canal and levee systems between 1915 and 1928. Beginning around 1940, the changes in the frequency and amplitude of salinity fluctuations may be related to changes in water management practices, meteorologic events (frequent hurricanes coupled with severe droughts in 1943 and 1944), or a combination of factors. The correspondence of these changes in Florida Bay with changes in the terrestrial Everglades suggests factors affecting the entire ecosystem are responsible for the salinity and substrate patterns seen in Florida Bay.

AB  - Population managers of large ungulates often assume that approximately even numbers of male and female offspring are produced. In contrast, evolutionary theory predicts that maternal investment in polygynous mammals should depend on the relative resource status of the female in relation to sex-specific demands of the offspring (i.e., females should bias sex allocation depending on their body condition). Examination of elk (Cervus elaphus) reproductive tracts from Oregon revealed that fetal sex ratios Vary with maternal body condition (kidney fat index [KFI]). Females with low maternal body condition were more likely to produce daughters than females with high KFI levels. Adult females with high KFIs conceived earlier and produced significantly more sons than daughters in the first 2 weeks of the reproductive season than females with lower body condition. Because reproductive data from elk in Oregon support the hypothesis of adaptive sex ratios according to the Trivers and Willard hypothesis, I evaluated the effects of adaptive sex ratios on offspring production in a hypothetical elk population. Using the observed relations between body condition, pregnancy, and fetal sex ratio, I examined the effects of maternal body condition on the production of male and female offspring in a population. I used a gamma distribution to simulate different maternal body condition (KFI) distributions and estimated the resultant fetal sex ratios. These simulations indicated that equality of sex ratios in offspring is a rare occurrence and is limited to average environmental conditions. With increasing body condition in the herd, the model predicted that more sons were conceived and that fetal sex ratios increasingly deviated from unity. Fetal sex ratios from annual and regional samples in Oregon supported this result and were positively correlated with mean KFI at the population level. If females in populations at or near carrying capacity suffer from generally low body condition, intrauterine and neonatal mortality may further reduce the number of sons produced and produce a significant bias toward daughters. Thus, adaptive sex ratio adjustment in elk may have significant importance for elk population management and the production of males.

AB  - In order to establish the model for tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH) and analyze the effects of study region, vegetation types, and density on it, the Multi-level Bayesian Model was used in the study areas and analyzed the uncertainty of model parameters. Additionally, the effects of regions, vegetation types, and density on the model were quantified. The data that was used was collected from 30 sampling plots (standard 1 hectare units) in the Nature Reserves and State/National Forest in Beijing's mountainous area. The Multi-level Regression Model was used for developing these models. The Multilevel modelling technique is perfectly suited for this study because of the hierarchical structure in data and in the various indicators of the ecosystem structure and function. The results suggest that the Height-DBH Model is an excellent way in which to represent the relationship between tree height and DBH in the Beijing mountain area.

AB  - The UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounting Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) aims at regular and standardised stocktaking of the extent of ecosystems, their condition, and the services they provide to society. Recording the condition of ecosystems is one of the most complex pieces in this exercise and needs to be supported by consistent guidelines. SEEA EA defines the condition of an ecosystem as its overall quality, measured in terms of quantitative metrics describing its abiotic and biotic characteristics. One of the key challenges lies in identifying the most appropriate metrics for each ecosystem type that capture these essential characteristics. The objective of this paper is to create a well-defined framework for transparent and operative development of ecosystem condition indicators, which can be used in ecosystem accounting and ecosystem assessment studies. Starting from the SEEA EA documentation and a small targeted systematic review, we identified 12 key criteria, which we grouped according to their roles during the indicator development process. Five conceptual criteria (intrinsic relevance, instrumental relevance, sensitivity, directional meaning, and framework conformity) outline the priorities for identifying relevant characteristics of the ecosystems. Five practical criteria (validity, reliability, availability, simplicity, and compatibility) provide guidance on identifying concrete quantitative metrics for the selected characteristics. Finally, two ensemble criteria (comprehensiveness, and parsimony) ensure the completeness and complementarity of the final set of metrics. To tackle the climate and biodiversity crises, the condition of ecosystems needs to be better recognized in national economic planning. The proposed framework supports the selection of a concise set of salient and credible ecosystem condition indicators through a transparent, repeatable and scientific process. This can make the compilation of ecosystem condition accounts more accessible and more standardised on a global level, which is a key prerequisite for the success of SEEA EA. Additionally, the framework presented in this paper may be useful in other contexts where ecological, environmental, or sustainability indicators need to be identified.

AB  - A longstanding goal in coral reef ecology is to estimate the baseline states of ecological communities and the extent to which human activities have perturbed them. Often, baseline estimates rely upon observations from remote, uninhabited areas, highlighting dramatic differences in fish communities compared to populated areas. However, previous studies have focused on island-and archipelago-wide comparisons of reef communities that may mask finer-scale spatial variability. Here we describe spatial patterns of herbivorous fish biomass across fished and unfished regions of the Hawaiian Archipelago to evaluate whether accounting for environmental variability between these regions alters estimates of unfished biomass (B-unfished) and fisheries depletion. We found environmental factors were strongly associated with 4 measures of herbivorous fish community biomass (total, scraper, grazer, and browser), and failure to account for these influences on B-unfished resulted in different conclusions about herbivore depletion in Hawaii, USA. Overall, depletion estimates that controlled for environmental differences indicated that biomasses of the 4 herbivorous fish groups across much of Hawaii are near or above a commonly used sustainability reference point (0.5 x B-unfished). However, scraper and browser biomass on Oahu, the island with the highest human population density, were near or below 15% of B-unfished, highlighting the potential importance of spatial and functional group variability when assessing fishing effects on coral reefs.

AB  - An indicator for the sustainability of agro-ecosystems, based on the overproduction of entropy, is suggested. In the main research area of the Kiel Ecology Centre energetic input and output parameters characterising agriculture were assessed in 1988 and 1897. It is demonstrated how excess of entropy changes with land management. Different kinds of crops have different values for their overproduction of entropy. It is assumed that these differences are due to a varying, but in many cases an excessive, use of(organic) fertilisers. The characteristics of the crop itself play a minor role. Although the method allows only rough estimations of entropy In agro-ecosystems, it can be stated that, due to a reduction of artificial energy input, sustainability was improved, comparing with the 1988 and 1997 results. Nevertheless, all the examined crop fields are far from reaching a sustainable state from a thermodynamic point of view. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Advances in remote sensing combined with the emergence of sophisticated methods for large-scale data analytics from the field of data science provide new methods to model complex interactions in biological systems. Using a data-driven philosophy, insights from experts are used to corroborate the results generated through analytical models instead of leading the model design. Following such an approach, this study outlines the development and implementation of a whole-of-forest phenotyping system that incorporates spatial estimates of productivity across a large plantation forest. In large-scale plantation forestry, improving the productivity and consistency of future forests is an important but challenging goal due to the multiple interactions between biotic and abiotic factors, the long breeding cycle, and the high variability of growing conditions. Forest phenotypic expression is highly affected by the interaction of environmental conditions and forest management but the understanding of this complex dynamics is incomplete. In this study, we collected an extensive set of 2.7 million observations composed of 62 variables describing climate, forest management, tree genetics, and fine-scale terrain information extracted from environmental surfaces, management records, and remotely sensed data. Using three machine learning methods, we compared models of forest productivity and evaluate the gain and Shapley values for interpreting the influence of categorical variables on the power of these methods to predict forest productivity at a landscape level. The most accurate model identified that the most important drivers of productivity were, in order of importance, genetics, environmental conditions, leaf area index, topology, and soil properties, thus describing the complex interactions of the forest. This approach demonstrates that new methods in remote sensing and data science enable powerful, landscape-level understanding of forest productivity. The phenotyping method developed here can be used to identify superior and inferior genotypes and estimate a productivity index for individual site. This approach can improve tree breeding and deployment of the right genetics to the right site in order to increase the overall productivity across planted forests.

KW  - FISH SPECIES DIVERSITY

KW  - RELATIONS BETWEEN DIVERSITY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In the present paper relations were investigated between species diversity of fish communities and the values of influencing parameters (section length, distance from source, trout biomass). The possible application of species diversity in calculation of the index of biotic integrity of streams was also viewed. A total 67 streams in Bohemia were fished in 1978 to 1994. Additional data on 10 streams from south-west and south Moravia were added and evaluated (see in Libosvarsky, 1989). The relationships between the particular parameters were calculated using Microsoft Exel 5.0. The first dependence investigated is a relationship between the section length and number of fish species (Fig. 1). Correlation coefficients are either at the significance level or below this level (in the case of semilogarithmic curve). These values indicate the low effect of the section length on the number of fish species caught. However, it is possible to expect a slight increase of species diversity approaching maximum for the given, larger part of the stream, as the section length is getting longer. As expected, the number of species increases with distance from source (length of the stream), (Fig. 2). Correlation coefficients are highly significant for both types of relationships (linear and exponential). Abundant artificial population of brown trout has been kept for a long time in most of our small and medium-size streams in our country. There is not doubt that the abundant: populations of this species may result in a significant reduction of fish species diversity. The relation between relative trout biomass and number of fish species is also highly significant (Fig. 3), higher in the case of an exponential model. Hence, the trout management significantly reduces fish species diversity in streams. A decrease in the relative trout biomass from 98% to 0% will bring about an average increase in diversity from two to seven fish species. However, the increase in diversity also involves the effect of the locality (distance from source), (Fig. 4). The multidimensional correlation coefficient, taking into account both parameters (relative trout biomass and distance from source (R(2) = 0.396), is higher than both simple coefficients and indicates the expected effect. The last examined dependence is a relationship between the distance from source and total fish biomass (Fig. 5). The significant value of the correlation coefficient agrees with the known positive dependence of both parameters. Oberdorff et al. (1992) determined significant correlation between the number of fish species and the length of the river (distance from source), and between the number of species and catchment area at 50 localities of 29 small streams in Brittany (France). Total density of fish here has been decreasing with the stream size. In another paper Oberdorff et al. (1993) summarised the results of studies of fish diversity in larger rivers in the Seine watershed. The expected trend of an increase in species number with the stream size was confirmed, as well as attainment of given maximum and subsequent decrease of diversity in the largest rivers. Worse water quality in large rivers is a factor responsible for this pattern. In our country Vostradovsky et al. (1994) showed that the number of fish species in a large river (Label had hardly changed in the last 90 years (22 fish species at the beginning of the century, 24 species in 1991). The dominance of some species (roach, bleak, bream), however, has changed a lot to the detriment of other (dace, east european bream, asp).
   The number of fish species at a given locality is one of the important parameter for estimation of the index of biotic integrity (Karr, 1981), and it is scored, similarly like other parameters by five, three or one point. Always it should be taken into consideration that the parameter in question attains various values at different distances from source, for different relative trout biomass etc. One of the procedure how to respect that dynamic is to use plus minus 99% confidence level of regression coefficients. Furthemore three points can be assign to the field bordered by the confidence lines, five points to the area above and one point to the area below these lines.

AB  - Emulsions are typically formed in a mixture of immiscible liquids. However, emulsion particles are also found upon mixing miscible liquids. In this paper, we suggest that emulsion particles are formed by ethanol mixed into toluene, as detected via dynamic light-scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, the addition of ethanol into a homogeneous fullerene solution (C-70/toluene) also forms emulsion particles. The emulsion particles could provide a space in which crystallization of C-70 occurs via anti-solvent crystallization (ASC). The size change of the emulsion particles through coalescence and shrinkage processes, which depend on the amount of ethanol, explains the change of crystallization environment until a supersaturation state is reached. It is believed to be the previously undiscovered key indicator of the ASC mechanism prior to nucleation.

AB  - Longitudinal connectivity in hydromorphological quality assessments of rivers. The ICF index: A river connectivity index and its application to Catalan rivers
   The Water Framework Directive urges assessment of river continuity as an input for the evaluation of hydromorphological quality. The existence of transverse obstacles in river beds has serious ecological consequences because it blocks the natural flow of water, sediments and biota, and this is considered one of the major causes of declines in many continental fish species.
   The index of river connectivity (ICF, from the Catalan name Index de Connectivitat Fluvial) evaluates obstacle effects on fish movement alone and does not take into account other elements affected by the obstacles. However, it can be used as a complementary element in hydromorphological condition assessments. The index is based on comparison of obstacle and fish pass (if any) characteristics with the capabilities of the fishes potentially present in the considered river section to overcome the obstacle. In this study, we present a new version of the ICF improved from its earlier version that was tested by different consultants and research centres for several obstacles from 2006 to 2009. The new version of the ICF is divided into three blocks that encompass assessment of (1) the obstacle and (2) the fish pass (if any) as well as (3) the estimation of certain modulators. Finally, the ICF classifies connectivity into five levels from very good to had depending on the degree of permeability for different fish groups. This new version of the ICF has been tested for 101 transverse obstacles in rivers in Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula) both with and without fish passes, obtaining representation of the five expected quality levels (from very good to bad), and it is considered coherent with the real permeability of the obstacles. Its ease of application compared to in situ measurements of fish movements and the detailed information recorded by the index make it a very useful tool for the diagnosis of the longitudinal connectivity of rivers and for guiding measures for hydromorphological quality improvement.

AB  - A complete characterization of the different physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) is necessary for the evaluation of their impact on health and environment. Among these properties, the surface characterization of the nanomaterial is the least developed and in many cases limited to the measurement of surface composition and zetapotential. The biological surface adsorption index approach (BSAI) for characterization of surface adsorption properties of NPs has recently been introduced (Xia et al. Nat Nanotechnol 5:671-675, 2010; Xia et al. ACS Nano 5(11):9074-9081, 2011). The BSAI approach offers in principle the possibility to characterize the different interaction forces exerted between a NP's surface and an organic-and by extension biological-entity. The present work further develops the BSAI approach and optimizes a solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME/GC-MS) method which, as an outcome, gives a better-defined quantification of the adsorption properties on NPs. We investigated the various aspects of the SPME/GC-MS method, including kinetics of adsorption of probe compounds on SPME fiber, kinetic of adsorption of probe compounds on NP's surface, and optimization of NP's concentration. The optimized conditions were then tested on 33 probe compounds and on Au NPs (15 nm) and SiO2 NPs (50 nm). The procedure allowed the identification of three compounds adsorbed by silica NPs and nine compounds by Au NPs, with equilibrium times which varied between 30 min and 12 h. Adsorption coefficients of 4.66 +/- 0.23 and 4.44 +/- 0.26 were calculated for 1-methylnaphtalene and biphenyl, compared to literature values of 4.89 and 5.18, respectively. The results demonstrated that the detailed optimization of the SPME/GC-MS method under various conditions is a critical factor and a prerequisite to the application of the BSAI approach as a tool to characterize surface adsorption properties of NPs and therefore to draw any further conclusions on their potential impact on health.

AB  - In Europe, implementation of sustainable fisheries management has been reinforced in the latest common fisheries policy, and presently marine fish stocks are mostly managed through assessment of their exploitation and ecological status compared to reference points such as Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). However, MSY and its associated fishing mortality rate F-MSY are sensitive to both stock characteristics and environment conditions. In parallel, climate change impacts are increasingly affecting fish stocks directly and indirectly but might also change the exploitation reference points and the associated level of catch. Here we explored the variability of MSY reference points under climate change by using a multi-species model applied to the Eastern English Channel, a highly exploited semi-continental sea. The spatial individual-based OSMOSE explicitly represents the entire fish life cycle of 14 species interacting through size-based opportunistic predation. The model was first parameterized and run to fit the historical situation (2000-2009) and then used to assess the ecosystem state for the 2050-2059 period, using two contrasting climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). For each condition, a monospecific MSY estimation routine was performed by varying species fishing mortality independently and allowed estimation of reference points for each species. The F-MSY estimated with OSMOSE were mostly in accordance with available values derived from stock assessment and used for fishing advice. Evolution of reference points with climate change was compared across species and highlighted that overexploited cold-water species are likely to have both MSY and F-MSY declining with climate warming. Considering all species together, MSY under RCP scenarios was expected to be higher than historical MSY for half of them, with no clear link with species temperature preferences, exploitation status or trophic level, but in relation with expected change of species biomass under climate change. By contrast, for 80% of cases F-MSY projections showed consistent decreasing pattern as climate conditions changed from historical to RCP scenarios in the Eastern English Channel. This result constitutes a risk for fisheries management, and anticipation of climate change impacts on fish community would require targeting a smaller fishing mortality than F-MSY to ensure sustainable exploitation of marine stocks.

AB  - Extending the application of integrated environmental and economic accounts from the national to the local level of government serves several purposes. They can be used not only as an instrument for communicating on the state of the environment and reporting the results of policies, but also as an operational tool - for setting the objectives and designing policies - if made available to the local authorities who have responsibility over the administration of natural resources, land use and conservation policies. The aim of the paper is to test the feasibility of applying hybrid flow accounts at the intermediate and local government levels. As an illustration, NAMEA for air emissions and wastes is applied to a Region, a Province and a Municipality, thus covering the three nested levels of local government in Italy. The study identifies the main issues raised by multi-scale environmental accounting and provides an applied discussion of feasible solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cu-Mn co-doped ZnSe quantum dots were eco-friendly synthesized at different synthesis conditions using water-based microwave-activated (MWIR) method. Energy band gaps E-gap(DASF) were determined using high-precision derivation of absorption spectrum fitting (DASF) method; the obtained results show that E-gap(DASF) values are within the range of 3.49-3.77 eV. Depending on the synthesis conditions, a decreasing trend of energy gap was observed with the increasing of MWIR time and ambient temperature. Morphologies and structural characterizations were done by XRD, EDX, FESEM, map and TEM, which revealed formation of ZnSe nanoparticles with mean crystallite size of similar to 2-5 nm. Also, Urbach energies were estimated, which their very small values in compare with E-gap imply to the sharp band edges and so their good crystallinity nature. Moreover, refractive index, dielectric constant and nonlinear optical susceptibility of each sample were determined; results imply that these nanoparticles have a high potential in optoelectronic applications. Also, structural characteristics such as dislocation density, lattice strain and size of NCs were evaluated upon the Scherrer, Williamson-Hall and Williamson-Smallman methods. The results of structural features obtained from these approaches are highly inter-correlated and show same trends with the variation of synthesis conditions. Results show that the size of QDs is varied tunable by changing the MWIR time, ambient temperature and Mn dopant percentage and the as-synthesized ZnSe QDs and doped QDs have similar cubic zinc blend structure. Also, TEM result reveals that ZnSe nanoparticles are spherical in shape with an average grain size of about 5 nm. Upon the different performed opto-structural criteria, sample with Mn = 4% has the best crystallinity as good candidate in optical and mechanical applications. There were anomalies in different properties at Mn = 1.5 and 2% attributed to their higher density of lattice imperfections and surface trap centers related to how Mn ions incorporated to the ZnSe host lattice.

AB  - Pig breeding programs worldwide continue to focus on both productivity and robustness. This selection emphasis has to be accompanied by provision of better-quality environments to pigs to improve performance and to enhance health and welfare of pigs. Definition of broader breeding objectives that include robustness traits in addition to production traits is the first step in the development of selection strategies for productivity and robustness. An approach has been presented which facilitates extension of breeding objectives. Post-weaning survival, maternal genetic effects for growth as an indicator of health status and sow mature weight are examples of robustness traits. Further, breeding objectives should be defined for commercial environments and selection indexes should account for genotype by environment interactions (GxE). Average performances of groups of pigs have been used to quantify the additive effects of multiple environmental factors on performance of pigs. For growth, GxE existed when environments differed by 60 g/day between groups of pigs. This environmental variation was observed even on well managed farms. Selection for improved health of pigs should focus on disease resistance to indirectly reduce pathogen loads on farms and on disease resilience to improve the ability of pigs to cope with infection challenges. Traits defining disease resilience may be based on performance and immune measures, disease incidence or survival rates of pigs. Residual feed intake is a trait that quantifies feed efficiency. The responses of divergent selection lines for residual feed intake to various environmental challenges were often similar or even favourable for the more efficient, low residual feed intake line. These somewhat unexpected results highlight the need to gain a better understanding of the metabolic differences between more or less productive pigs. These physiological differences lead to interactions between the genetic potential of pigs for productivity and robustness and the prevalence of specific environmental conditions.

AB  - Biomass size spectra of pelagic fish were modeled to describe community structure, estimate potential fish production, and delineate trophic relationships in Chesapeake Bay. Spectra were constructed from midwater trawl collections each year in April, June-August, and October 1995-2000. The size spectra were bimodal: the first spectral dome corresponded to small zooplanktivorous fish, primarily bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli; the second dome consisted of larger fish from several feeding guilds that are supported by multiple prey-predator linkages. Annual production estimates of pelagic fish, derived from a mean production to biomass ratio, varied nearly three-fold, ranging from 162 x 109 kcal (125 x 103 tons) in 1996 to 457 x 109 kcal (352 x 103 tons) in 2000. Seasonally, the biomass level and mean individual sizes of fish in the first dome increased from April to October, while the biomass level of the second dome was relatively stable. Regionally, biomass levels in the second dome were higher than biomasses in the first dome for the upper and lower Bay, but were minimal in the middle Bay where seasonal and episodic hypoxia occurs. To test a benthic-pelagic coupling hypothesis that could explain the higher biomass in the second domes for the lower and upper Bay, a cyclic size-spectrum model was fit that included only species in the zooplanktivorous-piscivorous fish guilds. The mean, normalized slope equaled -1, indicating that zooplanktivorous fish may support piscivore production, but that a benthic-pelagic linkage is required to fully support fish production in the second dome. Interannual variability in slopes and intercepts of modeled size spectra was related to salinity, recruitment level of bay anchovy, and the primary axis of a correspondence analysis (salinity effect) on fish community structure. The spectral slope and intercept of normalized spectra were lowest in 1996, a near-record wet year. Results suggest that fish size spectra can be developed as useful indicators of ecosystem state and response to perturbations, especially if prey-predator relationships are explicitly represented.

AB  - The creeks are strongly influenced by their riparian vegetation, and the deforestation affect the aquatic community. The effects of deforestation on taxonomic and functional diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage in four Colombian Andean creeks were evaluated. The study included 12 sites, seven of them with arboreal coverage at their margins in forested areas undisturbed by deforestation (reference stations) and the other five without tree cover in deforested areas (altered stations). Four field samplings were carried out between June 2011 and February 2012, and samples of benthic macroinvertebrates were collected using the D-net method with 500 mu m mesh and manual collection, and different physicochemical variables were measured in situ. The Shannon-Wienner (II') and Simpson's index (D) were calculated. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to each environmental variable, and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) to establish differences in environmental variables, taxonomic and functional diversity between references and altered stations were applied. 8 370 macroinvertebrate individuals corresponding to 80 taxa were collected in the study, with 6 758 individuals and 75 taxa in references stations and 1 612 individuals and 50 taxa in altered stations. The reference stations had higher values of diversity and the taxa that made major contributions to the variance between reference and altered stations were Thraulodes. Anacroneuria and Rhagovelia, which were associated with the highest values of Index of Andean riparian vegetation Quality (QBR-And), fluvial habitat index (IHF), Biological Monitoring Working Party Colombia BMWP/Col, EPT index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) and temperature in reference stations, whereas Leptonema, Baetodes and Mayobaetis were associated with higher pH and elevation above sea level in altered stations. The main functional feeding groups (FFG) at the reference stations were collectors-gatherers/scrapers CG / SC (27.2 %), scrapers SC (25.4 %) and predators PR (24.4 %), and for altered stations were collectors-filterers CF (27.5 %), collectors-gatherers/scrapers CG / SC (17.4 %) and scrapers SC (15.7 %). The most abundant life habits were clingers Cg (50.5 %), taxa with three or more habits (28.7 %) and skaters Sk (16.1 %), in the reference stations, and clingers Cg (68.1 %), taxa with three or more habits (13.7 %) and burrowers Bu (5.2 %) in the altered stations. The knowledge of the variables that determine the taxonomic and functional structure of the macroinvertebrate assemblages, and how they respond to impacts such as deforestation, can help to determine actions of protection or restoration of the environmental and ecological conditions of the Andean streams and the riparian habitats.

AB  - As a typical industrial city in northeastern China, the environmental conditions of the soil in Changchun City face high ecological risks. In the present study, in order to more fully understand the characteristics of the soil mercury content and its related health risks in the main urban areas of Changchun City, the pollution degrees were evaluated using the data of land accumulation indexes (I-geo), potential ecological risk indexes (Er), and health risk assessment methods. The mercury content (TSM) levels in the urban soil, along with the atmospheric mercury content (TGM) levels, were analyzed. The results showed that the mean value of the mercury content in the soil in Changchun City was 0.0569 +/- 0.103 mg/kg, and the concentration range was between 0.0052 and 1.3240 mg/kg. It was found that the mercury content levels in nearly 70% of the soil samples exceeded the background value of soil (0.040 mg/kg). In addition, the atmospheric mercury concentration at 0 cm was determined to be directly related to soil mercury content (P = 0.000532). In addition, the atmospheric mercury content of 0 cm was observed to be positively correlated with the distribution of the atmospheric mercury content at 100 cm (P = 0.000524). The mercury content levels in the soil were found to vary from different directions, with the mercury content found to be the highest in the southeastern section of the city. However, there were no significant differences in the mercury content of any direction. The I-geo showed that 25.0% of the sample points were polluted. The unsanitary areas were mainly concentrated in the southwestern and southeastern sections of the city. The mercury content levels in the soil of Changchun City ranged from pollution-free to moderate pollution levels overall. The Er indicated that the potential ecological risk level was high in the northwestern and southeastern sections of Changchun City. However, the soil mercury levels in Changchun City presented a low level of ecological risk overall. The average values of the non-carcinogenic risks (HQ) and the total non-carcinogenic risk assessment indexes (HI) in all directions within Changchun City were determined to be far less than 1. Therefore, it was concluded that the soil mercury levels were not potentially harmful to human health.

AB  - The Mangxiang Formation black shales are the most important hydrocarbon source rocks in the Wuyu Basin. Trace and rare earth element (REEs) of the black shales from the Wuyu Basin were studied in order to understand their depositional environments and palaeoclimate. Thirty one black shale samples from the Wuyu Basin were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and X-ray fluorescence. The black shales are characterized by moderate SiO2 (52.55-58.73%) contents and medium K2O/Na2O (2.21-4.83) ratio values but relatively high MgO+Fe2O3 (5.8-6.91%) and Al2O3 (15.1-17.5%) contents. The Chemical Weathering Index of Alternation (CIA) ranges from 57 to 70, together with medium Th/U (2.66-4.97) ratio values, reflecting a weak to moderate degree of chemical weathering of the source area. The palaeoredox condition of black shale was slightly oxic (or dysoxic) during black shale deposition as evidenced by slightly Ce anomalies (0.92-0.99) and Mn enrichment (EF = 1.6). The moderate palaeosalinity values (9.32 parts per thousand-17.75 parts per thousand), together with medium B/Ga (3.90-5.57) ratio values, indicate a brackish water environment. The palaeoclimate index Sigma(Fe + Mn + Cr + Ni + V+ Co)/Sigma(Ca + Mg + Sr + Ba + K+ Na) ranges from 0.28 to 0.50 and low Sr/Ba (0.15-1.22) ratio values, indicating a semiarid to semimoist climatic condition during the sedimentation of the black shale. The high omega(La)(N)/omega(Yb)(N) ratio values (1.02-1.09) indicate a fast sedimentary rate during black shale deposition. In this study, a preservation model of the Mangxiang Formation black shale was established. The model indicates that excellent preservation may be the major controlling factor for the accumulation of organic matter. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In present investigation, a field experiment was undertaken to find out the effects of nitrate (Mg (NO3.)(2) and KNO3) seed hardening (a kind of seed priming) treatment on some biochemical and physiological parameters i. e. chlorophyll, nitrogen, protein and proline contents, nitrate reductase (NR) and super oxide dismutase (SOD) activities and on yield attributes like harvest index (H. I.), biological yield, grain yield and test weight of wheat (Trticum aestivum L.) varieties (HUW-234 and HUW-468) sown in different dates i. e. 30th Nov., 15th Dec. and 30th Dec., representing timely sown (D-1), late sown (D-2) and very late sown (D-3) of its cropping seasons respectively. Plants raised from nitrate hardened seeds showed increments in the chlorophyll, nitrogen, protein and proline contents, NR and SOD activities in each date of observation (OD) in both the varieties of wheat. This trend was noted to be maintained in each date of sowing. Peak values for nitrogen, protein, enzyme NR and chlorophyll content observed on 50 and 75 DAS respectively. In between the salts of nitrate Mg (NO3)(2) hardened set performed better in comparison to KNO3 treated set in improving H.I., grain yield, biological yield and the test weight but the plants raised from non-hardened (control) seeds always showed poor performance. Nitrate treated sets exhibited an improvement for all the above mentioned parameters even in late and very late sown conditions of wheat in comparison to non-hardened control set. Thus on the basis of results it can be recommended that Mg (NO3)(2) is the most suitable salt to be used in enhancing the performance of wheat varieties i. e. HUW-234 and HUW-468 sown in time as well as in late or very late of its cropping season

AB  - Background: The ecological state of surface waters is typically assessed by a multi-aspect approach based on a determination of its chemical and physical parameters, by hydromorphology and the use of indicator organisms such as benthic diatoms. By assigning ecological indicator values, it is possible to create diatom indices which serve as the basic tool in assessing the ecological status of surface waters. These ecological indicator values are set according to classification systems, such as the Van Dam, Mertens & Sinkeldam (1994) system, which classifies species of diatoms according to seven different ecological factors. However, recent studies on the autecology of diatoms have shown the need to verify and establish new ecological indicator values. To this end, aquatic ecosystems are good environments to observe the range of tolerance of benthic diatoms to environmental conditions due to their unique physical and chemical parameters. The aim of the present study was to propose the establishment of new, or altered, ecological indicator values, according to the Van Dam, Mertens & Sinkeldam (1994) classification, of species of diatoms characteristic of three post-mining aquatic ecosystems.
   Methods: In total, 36 species were identified that were characteristic of three waterbodies: a salt aquatic complex (water outflow, a drainage ditch and a pond), mined iron ore reservoirs and a mined lignite reservoir. Their ecological indicator values were specified using OMNIDIA software, and the environmental conditions prevailing in the studied ecosystems were determined. Of the 36 characteristic species, 16 lacking at least one assigned ecological indicator value were analyzed further. The analysis identified three groups of selected characteristic species which showed a correlation, or lack of such, to the tested physical and chemical parameters.
   Results: Based on this multistage study of the autecology of characteristic diatoms, comprising an analysis of environmental conditions, literature analysis and reference ecological indicator values of other species, it is proposed that 32 ecological indicator values be established or adjusted for 16 species, and that Planothidium frequentissimum be excluded from water quality assessments.

AB  - Nematode populations were studied in parallel with successional stages of forest dynamics (clearing, growth, mature and senescence phases) in a nature reserve within the state forest of Fontainebleau (La Tillaie, France). Soil conditions were identical in all habitats (acid mull). A heterogeneous nematode fauna was found, resulting from the natural forest dynamics: vertical distribution of animals, horizontal distribution according to the nature and density of the plant cover, and different trophic groups. We also demonstrated the characteristics of the disruption zone of the ecosystem (clearing) and the subsequent succession, depending on where the clearing occurred. Similarly, changes in trophic group emphasized the continuity in time from clearing to the senescence phase.

AB  - Bonito, in Mato Grosso do Sul State, is an important destination for ecotourism in Brazil and the main challenge of sustainable ecotourism here has been to accommodate and adjust the increase of tourism without compromising the ecological integrity of the local ecosystems. In this study we aimed to assess the environmental impact of ecotourism on the fish fauna of Sucuri River in Bonito by integrating ecological, behaviour and physiological criteria and using the fish species Crenicichla lepidota and Moenkhausia bonita as indicators. Two distinct sites were defined to collect data: (1) affected daily by ecotourism (Tourism) and (2) undisturbed (No Tourism). The "stationary point count" method was performed to assess variations in ecological parameters and "ad libitum" and focal animal methods were used to collect behaviour data. The cortisol response of M. bonita to a stress protocol was measured from holding-water. Results showed a significantly increase in species richness, density and diversity at the Tourism site. Nevertheless, behaviour patterns indicated a higher stress at the Tourism site for both species as well higher cortisol levels for M. bonita. In opposition to the ecological measures, the behaviour and physiological ones may be interpreted as an early sign of negative impact caused by ecotourism, prior to changes at community level.

AB  - Using a locomotor conditioning preparation, we examined whether manipulating time between exposure to distinct environmental cues and nicotine administration affected conditioned responding. Rats that received nicotine (0.42 mg/kg base) immediately before placement in an environment for 30 min on eight separate occasions displayed hyperactivity relative to controls in a subsequent injection/drug-free test. This conditioned hyperactivity was weaker if nicotine was administered 15 min before environment exposure. Conditioning was not evidenced when nicotine was administered 15 min after placement or upon removal from the environment. In a follow-up experiment, rats received 45 min in the environment: nicotine was administered 15 min after placement. This group showed conditioning that was localized to the last two-thirds of a 45 min test indicating that a 15 min delay did not prevent conditioning given 30 min of environment/nicotine overlap. This apparent timing of conditioned responding was not due to increasing environment exposure to 45 min. Further, a state-dependent environmental familiarization account of locomotor hyperactivity during testing was eliminated by the finding that rats displayed temporally specific increases in activity on the test day despite the fact that the context was previously experienced without drug for 15 min on eight consecutive days.

AB  - Anthropogenic chemicals and their potential for adverse biological effects raise concern for aquatic ecosystem health in protected areas. During 2013-15, surface waters of four Midwestern United States national parks were sampled and analyzed for wastewater indicators, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and pesticides. More chemicals and higher concentrations were detected at the two parks with greater urban influences (Mississippi National River and Recreation Area and Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore) than at the two more remote parks (Apostle Islands National Lakeshore and Isle Royale National Park). Atrazine (10-15 ng/L) and N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (16-120 ng/L) were the only chemicals detected in inland lakes of a remote island national park (Isle Royale National Park). Bisphenol A and organophosphate flame retardants were commonly detected at the other sampled parks. Gabapentin and simazine had the highest observed concentrations (>1000 ng/L) in three and two samples, respectively. At the two parks with urban influences, metolachlor and simazine concentrations were similar to those reported for other major urban rivers in the United States. Environmental concentrations of detected chemicals were often orders of magnitude less than standards or reference values with three exceptions: (1) hydrochlorothiazide exceeded a human health-based screening value in seven samples, (2) estrone exceeded a predicted critical environmental concentration for fish pharmacological effects in one sample, and (3) simazine was approaching the 4000 ng/L Maximum Contaminant Level in one sample even though this concentration is not expected to reflect peak pesticide use. Although few environmental concentrations were approaching or exceeded standards or reference values, concentrations were often in ranges reported to elicit effects in aquatic biota. Data from this study will assist in establishing a baseline for chemicals of concern in Midwestern national parks and highlight the need to better understand the sources, pathways, and potential adverse effects to aquatic systems in national parks.

AB  - Introduction In 2003, the Japan International Cooperation Agency carried out a development feasibility study of Klaipeda Seaport (Lithuania). The focus in this study was the evaluation of environmental impacts of the port expansion because it is located in an ecologically sensitive area. While the Japanese researchers focused on the environmental impact analysis, they did not provide unambiguous conclusions. The problems remained unresolved and required further, more detailed consideration and deeper analysis.
   Purpose Environmental sustainability in seaports is an issue of timely importance in many countries given the rapid increase in port-to-port traffic and harbor capacity. This paper explores the situation in Klaipeda Seaport (Lithuania) which is the northernmost ice-free port on the Eastern coast of the Baltic Sea and its challenges in terms of environmental aspects and current pollution situation. This port plays an important role in the economic development of the region and in creating a sustainable society, i.e., a society that continues to develop economically without increasing its impact on our living environment and where the possible reduction of its current impact can be huge due to the fact that the seaport is a place where transport and logistics intersect and constitute large-scale industrial estates. Increasingly, they also turn towards sustainability.
   Methods Society faces the need for radical change because of increasing technological progress and increasing environmental impact. Environmental and public issues must be addressed by a systemic approach to find harmony among all the subsystems. Therefore, the authors of the article performed an assessment of the deep-water port of Klaipeda sustainable development opportunities tackling the following tasks: (1) Assessing Klaipeda port and the projected deep-water port of the current environment state; (2) Assessing the impact of the water quality of Klaipeda port, depending on the intensity of activity; (3) Assessing the projected impact of the deep-water port on the environment.
   Results and conclusions The results of the performed research allowed: (a) to reveal strengths and weaknesses of Klaipeda port development and the potential conflicts of interest among different stakeholders, (b) to identify the set of problem solutions seeking sustainable Klaipeda port development; (c) to develop the set of sustainability indicators to monitor the efficiency of the development.

AB  - The climate-vegetation coupling exerts a strong control on terrestrial carbon budgets and will affect the future evolution of global climate under continued anthropogenic forcing. Nonetheless, the effects of climatic conditions on such coupling at specific times in the growing season remain poorly understood. We quantify the climate-vegetation coupling in Europe over 1982-2014 at multiple spatial and temporal scales, by decomposing sub-seasonal anomalies of vegetation greenness using a grid-wise definition of the growing season. We base our analysis on long-term vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index), growing conditions (including 2m temperature, downwards surface solar radiation, and root-zone soil moisture), and multiple teleconnection indices that reflect the large-scale climatic conditions over Europe. We find that the large-scale climate-vegetation coupling during the first two months of the growing season largely determines the full-year coupling. The North Atlantic Oscillation and Scandinavian Pattern phases one-to-two months before the start of the growing season are the dominant and contrasting drivers of the early growing season climate-vegetation coupling over large parts of boreal and temperate Europe. The East Atlantic Pattern several months in advance of the growing season exerts a strong control on the temperate belt and the Mediterranean region. The strong role of early growing season anomalies in vegetative activity within the growing season emphasizes the importance of a grid-wise definition of the growing season when studying the large-scale climate-vegetation coupling in Europe.
   Plain Language Summary Climate and terrestrial ecosystems interact and affect the global climate. Such a climate-vegetation relationship can be effectively quantified by using satellites to measure how leafy and active the vegetation is, and numerical indices reflecting large-scale climate patterns over a given region. Previous studies generally focused on changes in mean vegetation indices over the full growing season, which is usually defined by a fixed range of astronomical months for large geographical regions. This overlooks the fact that growing seasons differ in space and vegetation responds differently to the climate in different growing season periods. In this study, we explore how vegetation and climate interact within a growing season, here defined specifically for the local conditions. We find that there are strong relationships between the large-scale climate patterns and vegetation indices during the first two months of the growing season. Our findings highlight the important role of the vegetation activity during the early growing season for the year-to-year vegetation changes in Europe. Hence, for a better understanding of the climate-vegetation relationships, it is necessary to consider the spatial differences in the growing season, in particular for large geographical regions.

AB  - Over 50% of streams in the Chesapeake Bay watershed have been rated as poor or very poor based on the index of biological integrity. The Choptank River estuary, a Bay tributary on the eastern shore, is one such waterway, where corn and soybean production in upland areas of the watershed contribute significant loads of nutrients and sediment to streams. We adopted a novel approach utilizing the relationship between the concentration of nitrate-N and the stable, water-soluble herbicide degradation product MESA (2-12-ethyl-N-(1methoxypropan-2-y1)-6-methylanilino1-2-oxoethanesulfonic acid) to distinguish between dilution and denitrification effects on the stream concentration of nitrate-N in agricultural subwatersheds. The ratio of mean nitrate-N concentration/(mean MESA concentration * 1000) for 15 subwatersheds was examined as a function of percent cropland on hydric soil. This inverse relationship (R-2 = 0.65, p <0.001) takes into consideration not only dilution and denitrification of nitrate-N, but also the stream sampling bias of the croplands caused by extensive drainage ditch networks. MESA was also used to track nitrate-N concentrations within the estuary of the Choptank River. The relationship between nitrate-N and MESA concentrations in samples collected over three years was linear (0.95 +/- 0.99) for all eight sampling dates except one where R-2 = 0.90. This very strong correlation indicates that nitrate-N was conserved in much of the Choptank River estuary, that dilution alone is responsible for the changes in nitrate-N and MESA concentrations, and more-importantly nitrate-N loads are not reduced in the estuary prior to entering the Chesapeake Bay. Thus, a critical need exists to minimize nutrient export from agricultural production fields and to identify specific conservation practices to address the hydrologic conditions within each subwatershed. In well drained areas, removal of residual N within the cropland is most critical, and practices such as cover crops which sequester the residual N should be strongly encouraged. In poorly drained areas where denitrification can occur, wetland restoration and controlled drained structures that minimize ditch flow should be used to maximize denitrification.

AB  - In the European Water Framework Directive, zooplankton was not included as a Biological Quality Element despite its important place in the aquatic trophic web. In the present study on zooplankton abundances and biomasses, we used several metrics to test their ability to detect differences among trophic statuses and ecological potential levels, and collected a large sum of data in more than 60 reservoirs at Ebro watershed, on more than 300 sampling occasions over 10 years. Our results indicate that most zooplankton metrics are correlated to environmental variables that determine reservoirs' trophic states, especially chlorophyll a and total phosphorus. The metrics with better sensitivity to differentiate trophic states and ecological potential levels were ZOO (total zooplankton), LZOO (large zooplankton), CLAD (cladocerans), and ZOO:CHLA (zooplankton:chlorophyll a ratio). Microcrustacean metrics such as DAPHN (Daphnia), COP (copepods), CYCLO (cyclopoids), and CALA (calanoids) were good at differentiating between high and low water quality in trophic status (oligotrophic-eutrophic) and ecological potential (good or superior-moderate). Thus, zooplankton can be used as a valuable tool to determine water quality; we believe that zooplankton should be considered a Biological Quality Element within Water Framework Directive monitoring programs for inland waters.

AB  - The article presents generalized data on the variability of reproductive parameters of leguminous plants (Fabaceae Lind., 1836), growing in the gradient of habitat transformation in Kazan. The range of variability of potential productivity indicators, the actual productivity of six main kinds of leguminous plants are shown. The features of variability of seeds failure at different stages of development are given. It was shown, that the greatest rate of mortality at the early stages of development (seed bud) was characteristic for populations, growing under conditions of intense anthropogenic press. Failure at later stages of development (underdeveloped seeds) was more typical for populations, growing in less transformed habitats. On the basis of long-term data, it was shown, that there was the common pattern of decreasing the actual fecundity rate with increasing the gradient of life environment urbanization. It was concluded, that monitoring of the reproductive parameters of leguminous plants should be used to indicate the state of the environment under the conditions of large city.

AB  - Currently, wetland stability is under threat due to the joint effects of global climate change and human activity, especially in lakes. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the health status of wetland ecosystems such as lakes, identify the variables causing the wetland degradation and work to protect the wetlands from the identified variables in the future. Based on fourteen high-resolution autumn remote sensing images from 1989-2013, the classification characteristics and spatial distribution patterns of wetland landscapes in Poyang Lake were studied through quantitative interpretation technology. An established health assessment index system named the EHCI (Ecological Health Comprehensive Index) was used to assess the health status of Poyang Lake. Additionally, the relationship between water regime and health status of wetland landscape distribution of Poyang Lake were investigated by multivariate statistical analysis. The results demonstrated: (1) The total area of three first level (or six second level) types of wetland landscapes showed a stable status, which was long-term maintaining at about 3026 km(2) from 1989-2013. (2) The water area shows a downward trend, while the areas of vegetation and land-water transition zone show upward trends. (3) The proposed EHCI of the Poyang Lake wetland presented a downward trend. According to the EHCI results from 1989-2013, the health status of Poyang Lake wetland was healthy for two years, unhealthy for four years and sub-healthy for eight years. (4) The water level fluctuation greatly affected the EHCI, and the effect became greater as the water level increased. These results contribute to the understanding of specific effects of hydrological process on the health status of the Poyang Lake wetland. In addition they provide a scientific reference for the maintenance of stable ecosystem functions of the seasonal freshwater lake.

AB  - Coastal waters provide a wide range of ecosystem services (ES), but are under intensive human use, face fast degradation and are subject to increasing pressures and changes in near future. As consequence, European Union (EU) water policies try to protect, restore and manage coastal and marine systems in a sustainable way. The most important EU directive in this respect is the Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC). Objective is to reach a "good status" in EU waters, following a stepwise and guided process. Our major objective is to test how an ecosystem service assessment can support WFD implementation in practice. We use the Marine Ecosystem Service Assessment Tool (MESAT) that utilizes spatial definitions, reference conditions and the good status according to the WFD as well as data and information gained during the implementation process. The data-based tool allows comparative analyses between different ecological states and an evaluation of relative changes in ES provision. We apply MESAT to two contrasting systems in the German Baltic Sea region, the rural Schlei and the urban/industrialized Warnow Estuary. These databased assessments show how the ES provision has changed between the historic, pre-industrial state around 1880 (reference conditions with high ecological status), the situation around 1960 (good ecological status), and today. The analysis separates the estuaries into water bodies. A complementary expert-based ES assessment compares the situation today with a future scenario "Warnow 2040" assuming a good ecological status as consequence of a successful WFD implementation. Strengths and weaknesses of the approaches and their utilization in the WFD are discussed. ES assessments can be regarded as suitable to support public relation activities and to increase the acceptance of measures. Further, they are promising tools in participation and stakeholder processes within the planning of measures. However an ES assessment not only supports the WFD implementation, but the WFD provides a frame for ES assessments larger scale assessments in seascapes, increases the acceptance of the ES approach and the readiness of stakeholders to get involved.

AB  - Existing methods that apply the planetary boundaiy for the nitrogen cycle in life cycle assessment are spatially generic and use an indicator with limited environmental relevance. Here, we develop a spatially resolved method that can quantify the impact of nitrogen emissions to air, soil, freshwater or coastal water on "safe operating space" (SOS) for natural soil, freshwater and coastal water. The method can be used to identify potential "planetary boundary hotspots" in the life cycle of products and to inform appropriate interventions. The method is based on a coupling of existing environmental models and the identification of threshold and reference values in natural soil, freshwater and coastal water.
   The method is demonstrated for a case study on nitrogen emissions from open-field tomato production in 27 farming areas based on data for 199 farms in the year 2014. Nitrogen emissions were modelled from farm-level data on fertilizer application, fuel consumption and dimate- and soil conditions. Two sharing principles, "status quo" and "gross value added", were tested for the assignment of SOS to 1 t of tomatoes.
   The coupling of models and identification of threshold and reference values resulted in spatially resolved characterization factors applicable to any nitrogen emission and estimations of SOS for each environmental compartment. In the case study, tomato production was found to range from not transgressing to transgressing its assigned SOS in each of the 27 farming areas, depending on the receiving compartment and sharing principle. A high nitrogen use efficiency scenario had the potential to reverse transgressions of assigned SOS for up to three farming locations.
   Despite of several sources of uncertainty, the developed method may be used in decision-support by stakeholders, ranging from individual producers to global governance institutions. To avoid sub-optimization, it should be applied with methods covering the other planetary boundaries. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The results of studying long-term dynamics of the Darwin State Nature Biosphere Reserve forests happened to be in changed environmental conditions due to the influence of the Rybinsk reservoir are presented. Multi-year reservoir influence has significantly changed the environment of coastal areas, which resulted in necessity of studying the state of coastal forests. Dynamics studies of the forests were based on the principles of dynamic typology tested by I.S. Melekhov under study of early stages of anthropogenic forest life. The data we have obtained for mature and old growth forests bring in the significant changes to a concept of forest type stability at a stage of mature forest stand or formed type of forest. The studied forests do not remain their uniformity even throughout a single generation. The study object was waterlogging berry green moss pine forest growing in the indirect reservoir influence zone. Detailed description and analysis of various components of the studied forest type have been carried out for the purposes of studying the direction and speed of growth and development processes. The main attention was paid to the changes of forest live cover as an indicator of soil and hydrological conditions, forest stand, undergrowth and understorey. Conclusions on the direction and speed of changes in soils, their hydrological regime, the phytocenosis were drawn on the basis of data analysis obtained for the 70-year period on dynamics of different components of waterlogging berry green moss pine forest at the initial stage. It is essential in terms of dynamic typology to consider the studied forest type as a stage of relatively accelerated formation of blueberry green moss sphagnum pine forest at the middle waterlogging stage with a well-defined tendency to replacement of pine with spruce in new generation. These conclusions confirm the principles of I.S. Melekhov's dynamic typology and have a significant meaning for forest science and practice, as well as carrying out the monitoring researches in the reserve.

AB  - The rapid pace of urban development triggers complex problems mostly related to urban environment pollution, and shortcomings of city's improvement. The modern city is characterized by the highest man-made pressure on the natural environment, the main problems being overcrowding, lack of open-access green areas, as well as the decrease of vegetation areas, fact that does not create comfortable living conditions for urban residents. At present, remote sensing methods are some of the priority tools used in vegetation state assessment, particularly, the calculation of vegetation index (NDVI). But often, obtaining the necessary information is limited only to the analysis of satellite data, without geobotanical field surveys, which considerably increase the reliability of the detected results. In addition, the definition of dependencies when using an integrated approach of different man-affected surfaces with a different type of overgrowth within the city remains insufficiently studied. The purpose of this study is to assess the ecological condition of the green area (parks and squares) in Aktobe city. A comprehensive processing of satellite images including the calculation of NDVI index, mapping of green areas and data statistical analysis, was carried out. We learned that the average value of NDVI for green spaces in Aktobe ranges from 0,11 mu m to 0,47 mu m, which allows for the categorization of planted areas by levels of photosynthetic activity, from "unsatisfactory" to "good", yet, with 59% of them in an unsatisfactory condition. This means that the city is underdeveloped in terms of modern landscape and infrastructure. The obtained results make it possible to assess the current situation, determine the dynamics of urban green spaces and optimize spatial planning measures for green space management.

AB  - Limitations on photosynthesis, characterized by leaf CO2 exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and thylakoid structure, were studied under environmental conditions simulating culture in vitro.  These were simulated by growing Phaseolus vulgaris plants in nutrient solution under high relative humidity of air (> 90%), and CO2 concentrations (c(a)) that decreased with the development of photosynthetic activities during plant ontogeny (1200 to 300 mg m-3).  The ontogeny of such model plants was more rapid, primary leaves reached photosynthetic maturity 2 to 3 d earlier and their life span was 7 to 14 d shorter than in control plants.  Their photosynthetic activity in situ was limited, after reaching ''photosynthetic maturity'', similarly to plants grown in vitro.  When measured under optimal conditions, however, 50 to 70% higher net photosynthetic rate (P(N)) were found in leaves of different ages as compared with plants grown under c(a) of 700 mg m-3 and a lower air humidity (30 - 35%).  This increase in P(N) was associated with a high conductance for CO2 transfer by adaxial and abaxial epidermes.  In model plants, the dark respiration rate (R(D)) was almost twice that in the control, while the photorespiration rates were similar to controls; CO2 compensation concentration was about 50% of that in controls.  The ratios P(N)/R(D) were similar in control and in model plants.  Chlorophyll a+b content in leaves of the model plants was lower than that in the control plants.  Grana extent increased with plant age in the model plants while it decreased in the control ones.  In both the stomal and granal membranes of the chloroplasts in model plants, a marked accumulation of carotenoids occurred independent of age.  The ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence, F(v)/F(m), did not differ in the model and the control plants.  In the control plants, photochemical quenching (qp) slightly increased with plant age and was not affected by CO2 concentration present during measurement.  In the model plants, qp increased with elevated CO2 concentration in young plants and decreased in saturating CO2 concentrations in older plants.  Nonphotochemical quenching (q(NP)) was lower in the model plants and increased under CO2 saturating conditions.  Vitality index, Rfd, was markedly lower in the model plants than in the control ones and a decline was found in saturating CO2 concentration.

AB  - Optimal foraging theory states that natural selection makes foragers efficient food harvesters and maximizing a colony's energy intake. This study presumed that the ciliates foraging trajectories follow optimal foraging theory, verified the presumption and discover specific rules and patterns hidden in the ciliate's trajectories data using methodologies of statistical, cluster analyses, and decision tree analysis. This study examined the foraging behaviors of ciliates by video recordings and quantitative analyses of movement trajectories under four nourishment conditions (low, medium, high, and highest concentrations). Similar biological studies adopt statistical analyses to certain locomotion indices to determine the responses of plankton to various aquatic environments. In addition to statistical analyses, cluster analysis was used in this study to confirm the observations of the statistical analyses. The statistical analysis and cluster analysis results in this study revealed two distinct groups of trajectories or behaviors, which matched the optimal foraging theory. Decision tree analysis was then applied to acquire objective information regarding foraging behaviors, and further detailed the foraging behaviors with explicit classification rules using locomotion indices. The production rules can play an alternative role to assess the sustainability of an aquatic environment in terms of algae concentration.

AB  - As the world burden of environmental contamination increases, it is of the utmost importance to develop streamlined approaches to environmental risk assessment in order to prioritize mitigation measures. Whole-cell biosensors or bioreporters and speciation modeling have both become of increasing interest to determine the bioavailability of pollutants, as bioavailability is increasingly in use as an indicator of risk. Herein, we examine whether bioreporter results are able to reflect expectations based on chemical reactivity and speciation modeling, with the hope to extend the research into a wider framework of risk assessment. We study a specific test case concerning the bioavailability of lead (Pb) in aqueous environments containing Pb-complexing ligands. Ligands studied include ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), meso-2,3 dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), leucine, methionine, cysteine, glutathione, and humic acid (HA), and we also performed experiments using natural water samples from Lake Tai (Taihu), the third largest lake in China. We find that EDTA, DMSA, cysteine, glutathione, and HA amendment significantly reduced Pb bioavailability with increasing ligand concentration according to a log-sigmoid trend. Increasing dissolved organic carbon in Taihu water also had the same effect, whereas leucine and methionine had no notable effect on bioavailability at the concentrations tested. We find that bioreporter results are in accord with the reduction of aqueous Pb2+ that we expect from the relative complexation affinities of the different ligands tested. For EDTA and HA, for which reasonably accurate ionization and complexation constants are known, speciation modeling is in agreement with bioreporter response to within the level of uncertainty recognised as reasonable by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for speciation-based risk assessment applications. These findings represent a first step toward using bioreporter technology to streamline the biological confirmation or validation of speciation modeling for use in environmental risk assessment.

AB  - The weir construction in larger rivers has displayed harmful impacts due to unpredicted modifications in hydrology and microhabitats. This study illustrated the impacts of three massive weirs installed in the mainstream Geum River, South Korea. We used the modified multimetric index of biotic integrity (mmIBI) and water pollution index (mmWPI) to understand the imapcts of weir installations on riverine water chemistry and fish assemblages. The results divulged seasonal and spatial heterogeneities by indicating the gradual degradation of water quality. Phosphorus and sediments displayed an excessive influence of seasonal rainfall patterns. The nutrients (N, P) showed week relationships at weir (GW: R-2 = 0.21, SW: R-2 = 0.12, BW: R-2 = 0.25), but stronger links in the upstream river (R-2 = 0.74) sites. The mmWPI revealed the weir sites and riverine zones into 'fair to very poor' water quality status, while mmIBI specified the sites in 'fair to poor' ecological health. Overall, 60 fish species sampled as 64,637 individuals were observed, indicating 81.24% of individuals at the weir sites. Squalidus japonicus coreanus (18.47% RA) and Hemibarbus labeo (9.25% RA) were relatively the most abundant fish species in this investigation. The total number of fish species and individuals gradually declined along the river gradient. The principal component analysis (PCA) grouped the dominant factors by distinct riverine zones, with a percent cumulative variance of 81.80%. The tolerant and omnivorous fish species were established in aggregations in downstream, with increased insectivorous species. In conclusion, the impacts of weir installation were assiduously manifested and indicted an exceedingly deteriorating water chemistry that could have caused a decline in sensitive species, favored the tolerant species, and overall reduced the habitat quality suitable as natural breeding and feeding grounds. Furthermore, the declining fish assemblages and their distribution, perturbed microhabitat conditions, and inclusively deteriorating ecological health status were linked to the weir imprints.

AB  - Biological diversity conservation within natural reserves has been prioritized, but conservation efforts outside protected areas (where most human activities take place) have been very little considered. In this scenario, an alternative agricultural practice that may reduce the impacts of fragmentation in outer landscapes is a perforation process, which involves conservation in agricultural fields surrounded by continuous forests. Such practices enhance the positive impact of ecological services on fields. In this study we analyzed the biological diversity state in perforation fields and their surrounding forests. The analysis was done using dung beetles as biological indicators. A nested pattern in dung beetles distribution was found, which ordered the surrounding continuous forest sites as the ones with the highest species richness, followed by the perforation fields, and placed the fragmentation practice fields (continuous agricultural fields surrounding forest patches) with the lowest one. Indicator species for perforation fields and surrounding continuous forests were chosen. In general, perforation practice fields differed in composition, based upon functional groups richness and identity; it also contained a higher species richness than the fragmentation practice. Agricultural practices that enhance biological diversity conservation such as perforation, should be recommended and considered in natural resource management by local communities in order to take advantage of ecological services that otherwise may be gradually lost.

AB  - Considerations involved in developing a suite of indicators to monitor regional environmental health, similar in conception to management use of 'leading economic indicators', are described. Linkages between human activities and well being and the state of the environment are considered essential to the evaluation of general environmental health. Biogeochemical and socioeconomic indicators are mutually affected by environmental degradation and examples of both categories of indicators are described. Desirable properties in indicators of environmental health vary with their specific management use. Different indicators are called for when collecting data to assess the adequacy of the environment, monitor trends over time, provide early warning of environmental degradation, or diagnose the cause of an existing problem. Tradeoffs between desirable characteristics, costs, and quality of information are inevitable when choosing indicators for management use. Decisions about what information to collect for which purpose can be made more rationally when available indicators are characterized and matched to management goals.

AB  - A data set of room temperature magnetic parameters for several iron oxides and sulphides was compiled from the available literature. The aim was to propose the most effective methods for assessing mineralogy, concentration and domain state within environmental magnetic studies. Establishing the magnetic mineralogy is essential for a correct interpretation of concentration and grain-size indicative parameters. Hematite and in particular goethite are recognised by their high (remanent) coercivities. The ratio of saturation remanent magnetisation to susceptibility is suited for assessing mineralogy; for low coercivity minerals, high values of the ratio are indicative of pyrrhotite. Greigite and maghemite both have intermediate ratios, while very low values suggest the presence of (titano)magnetite. From the concentration-dependent parameters mass specific susceptibility, saturation remanent magnetisation and susceptibility of anhysteretic remanent magnetisation, susceptibility displayed the least grain-size dependence. Therefore, it is perhaps the best indicator of concentration, under the proviso of uniform mineralogy and when paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions are taken into consideration. All minerals showed a decrease in coercivity and remanence ratios with increasing grain size for sizes larger than one micrometer. In contrast, the coercivity of goethite showed an increase with grain size. Assessment of domain state was complicated by very small and large grains displaying similar magnetic properties.

AB  - There are inherent social, environmental, and economic trade-offs in agricultural systems, which by definition have been altered from their natural state by humans for food and fibre production. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impacts of agriculture, and with the increasing influence of social media, agribusinesses and industries can be held accountable for their actions in the public domain. Thus, environmental sustainability reporting is increasingly being viewed as a cost of doing business in agriculture. There are a number of approaches used to measure agroecosystem health (AEH) around the world, but they are generally designed to make comparisons at coarse spatial scales (i.e. nations) or report on specific management actions implemented at the local scale (i.e. farm, catchment, or sub-region). Here we present a simple, yet scientifically robust assessment framework that can be used to benchmark and monitor the specific impacts of agricultural management practices on the environment. The general principles are drawn from environmental monitoring and experiences gained in environmental assessments that are not necessarily agriculturally focussed. However, many commonly used environmental indicators are not suitable for AEH assessment because they do not explicitly link environmental outcomes to management actions; or they fail to separate specific agricultural impacts from broader cumulative impacts resulting from other industries or land uses. We recommend using a combination of diagnostic, outcome-based indicators, in addition to practice- and product-based measures to communicate efforts to improve agroecosystem health outcomes. The framework presented here enables assessments at local scales, but can be aggregated or disaggregated to report at finer or coarser scales. This flexibility ensures that the assessment is relevant to the proponent and stakeholders, while also providing a way to make comparisons between producers, industries, or regions as part of an adaptive monitoring and assessment framework. This also opens the door for industry-based AEH monitoring program to provide, or make use of information from government-funded environmental monitoring programs, with benefits to both.

AB  - Ireland has experienced high economic growth rates in the last decade of the 20th century. This paper examines how Ireland's economic growth has affected environmental pressure by calculating a time series of Ireland's ecological footprint (EF) from 1983 to 2001. Special attention is paid to the category energy. The results show that the EF increased with a factor of 1.5 during the time period, of which the doubled energy EF made up the biggest part. The main contribution to the total increase in the EF were emissions of fossil fuels, particularly oil consumed by traffic and electricity generation. Increase was particularly high between 1993 and 1995, due to a strong rise in the embodied energy footprint. This is caused by a shift in the type of net imported products. While in the 1980s import figures for minerals were high, in the 1990s import figures were highest for products with higher embodied energies such as chemicals, fertilizers, iron and steel, electric machinery, and road vehicles. Comparison of the Irish EF with the bioproductive capacity of Ireland shows that in between 1993 and 1995 a state of ecological overshoot is reached which is only increasing from then on. It is concluded that the growing economy has intensified human's pressure on the Irish environment by its enlarged demand for energy. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

When the climate change indicators are very visible in the region, many-sided concerns upshot thereby, especially encircling the species composition change, biodiversity loss, frequent environmental stresses, food security, landslides, snowstorms, agro-biodiversity, livelihood and human health. Other than the general footprints, climate change negatively impacts the overall performance of the plants either directly or indirectly by changing the intensity and frequency of abiotic stress factors. As diverse plant species growing in higher altitudes of the region are open to very unfavourable and harsh conditions, especially low temperature, these provide insights into different adaptive mechanisms for abiotic stress tolerance and can be dissected for the same. From time to time, efforts have been made to develop stress resilient crops or climate smart agriculture. A holistic approach comprising the fields of agricultural biotechnology, socio-cultural integrity and crop ecology is going to provide an excellent insight into climate change mitigation strategies and plant abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms in the delicate ecosystem. Moreover, to finely strategize the conservation laws and policies and also for bio prospecting activities, a comprehensive knowledge on abiotic stresses associated with climate change and the counter responses of Himalayan flora is critical.

AB  - Our main objective is to set out and apply a SEEA-based methodology to reflect the true value of forest resources in India's national and state accounts. We establish that a "topdown" approach using available national databases is both feasible and desirable from a policy perspective. In this paper, we address four components of value creation in forests: timber production, carbon storage, fuelwood usage, and the harvesting of non-timber forest products. The results of our analysis suggest that prevailing measures of national income in India underestimate the contribution of forests to income. The income accounts of the Northeastern states in particular are significantly understated by these traditional (GDP/GSDP) measures. We are also able to identify some states which performed poorly in the context of our sustainability framework, reflecting natural capital losses due to degradation and deforestation. Our results highlight the need to integrate natural resource accounting into the national accounting framework in order to generate appropriate signals for sustainable forest management and for the conservation of forest resources which are widely used by the poor in India, as well as being significant stores of national wealth.

AB  - In diverse ecosystems, organisms cluster together in such a manner that the frequency distribution of cluster sizes is a power law function. Spatially explicit computational models of ecosystems suggest that a loss of such power law clustering may indicate a loss of ecosystem resilience; the empirical evidence in support for this hypothesis has been mixed. On the other hand, a well-known dynamical feature of systems with reduced resilience is the slower recovery from perturbations, a phenomenon known as critical slowing down (CSD). Here, we examine the relationship between spatial clustering and CSD to better understand the use of cluster size distributions as indicators of ecosystem resilience. Local positive feedback is an important driver of spatial clustering, while also affecting the dynamics of the ecosystem: Studies have demonstrated that positive feedback promotes abrupt regime shifts. Here, we analyse a spatial model of ecosystem transitions that enables us to disentangle the roles of local positive feedback and environmental stress on spatial patterns and ecosystem resilience. We demonstrate that, depending on the strength of positive feedback, power law clustering can occur at any distance from the critical threshold of ecosystem collapse. In fact, we find that for systems with strong positive feedback, which are more likely to exhibit abrupt transitions, there may be no loss of power law clustering prior to critical thresholds. Our analyses show that cluster size distributions are unrelated to the phenomenon of CSD and that loss of power law clustering is not a generic indicator of ecosystem resilience. Further, due to CSD, a power law feature does occur near critical thresholds but in a different quantity; specifically, a power law decay of spatial covariance of ecosystem state. Our work highlights the importance of links between local positive feedback, emergent spatial properties and how they may be used to interpret ecosystem resilience.

AB  - The selective collection and recycling of municipal solid waste are presented as stages of an integrated program of solid waste management to minimize the environmental impact of the treatment and final disposal of solid waste. Therefore, this program aims to save natural resources, such as energy and raw materials, in the manufacture of new products and to conserve areas for sites, such as to minimize the use of existing landfill sites, and to minimize the need for new waste treatment sites. A university is composed of educational professionals aware of their societal responsibilities, and, therefore, they play a fundamental role in the management of the university's solid waste. This study presents the design and implementation of a Permanent Selective Collection Program (PSCP) at the Federal University of Itajuba (Universidade Federal de Itajuba, UNIFEI), Itajuba-MG, Brazil. The material requirements for initiating the PSCP have been identified, and an action plan for continuous program improvement, which is initially based on the collection of performance indicator data for the PSCP campus, has been developed. Finally, the data from the PSCP performance indicators and software from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Landfill Gas Generation Model (LandGEM) and the Waste Reduction Model (WARM), were used to evaluate the impact of implementing PSCP in terms of energy and the generation of greenhouse gases (GHG). The results were promising, showing that there has been an improvement, since the inception of PSCP in 2006, in separating materials for selective collection, even though paper (41.00 wt%), plastic (6.00 wt%) and organic matter (26.00 wt%) are still highly generated wastes. The WARM simulations for a scenario in which 90% of the waste is sent for recycling resulted in an economy of -7 tCO(2) or -74.91 GJ (on an energy basis). The LandGEM (USEPA) simulations estimated 1424.60 kWh of energy in the peak production year. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A holistic stochastic dynamic model was developed by focusing on the interactions between conceptually isolated key-components, such as local passerine guilds and changes in habitat conditions, in Mediterranean agroecosystems of the "Terra Quente Transmontana region" (north-eastern Portugal). The ecological integrity of the typical patchwork of this region, with respect to land use, can be partly assessed by the observation of the occurrence of passerine guilds. These important indicators and state variables are the underlying database of our model. This model aimed the prediction of the ecological changes which can be expected when olive orchards are being intensified. The model proposed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure (stepwise multiple regression analysis) performed to discriminate the significant relationships between guild richness and environmental variables. Since this statistical analysis is static, the dataset recorded from the field included true gradients of habitat changes. The model parameters were estimated from the results of the stochastic treatment and from regional data regarding tendencies within the use of land. A period of 50 years was considered. The final model provided some basis to analyse the responses of passerine guilds to the environmental scenarios that will characterize the new agroecosystems of the re-ion. The model simulations were incorporated into a Geographical Information System (GIS) approach. The results of the simulation revealed a structural drift within the different guild richness in response to the expected gradient of habitat changes. The possible local extinction of several species within the less well-represented guilds, such as the steppe passerine species, may be associated with a predictable reduction in ecological integrity of the typical agroecosystems. Therefore, a new structure of the passerine communities indicates that future agroecosystems will diverge from the initial or actual ecological state. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Permanent preservation areas contribute to the recovery of impacted environments and Formicidae is a potentially bioindicator group, used to describe the structural complexity of habitats. In this context, the study aimed to characterize the diversity of ant assemblages that occur in sites with different soil use history in the APP of Foz do Chapeco HPP reservoir, as well as to evaluate the similarity of ant assemblages according to the sampled sites. Sampling was carried out in January 2017 at five sites, three in Santa Catarina state and two in Rio Grande do Sul state. Pitfall, entomological umbrella, sardine bait, glucose bait and manual collection were used. Assemblies were characterized and compared through richness, abundance, diversity of Shannon-Weaver (H'), Equitability (J') and estimated richness (Chao 1). A total of 101 species were sampled. The average of the estimates indicated that richness may be 86.7% greater than that sampled, while the diversity parameters indicated differences between the assemblies. Diversity indices showed divergence of 39.7% between the more and less diverse assemblies. The richness observed in this study reiterates the potential of the use of ants as bioindicators of the state of environmental conservation, adds important information on the richness and occurrence of ants for the region and presents, above all, an inventory of the species of ants present in an area of APP in a regeneration process that can serve as parameter for subsequent evaluations.

AB  - The massive epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa, followed in recent months by two outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, underline the importance of this severe disease. Because Ebola virus (EBOV) must be manipulated under biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment, the discovery and development of virus-specific therapies have been hampered. Recently, a transient transfection-based transcription- and replication competent virus-like particle (trVLP) system was described, enabling modeling of the entire EBOV life cycle under BSL2 conditions. Using this system, we optimized the condition for bulk co-transfection of multiple plasmids, developed a luciferase reporter-based assay in 384-well microtiter plates, and performed a high throughput screening (HTS) campaign of an 8,354-compound collection consisting of U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) -approved drugs, bioactives, kinase inhibitors, and natural products in duplicates. The HTS achieved a good signal-to-background ratio with a low percent coefficient of variation resulting in Z' = 0.7, and data points were reproducible with R-2 = 0.89, indicative of a robust assay. After applying stringent hit selection criteria of >= 70% EBOV trVLP inhibition and >= 70% cell viability, 381 hits were selected targeting early, entry, and replication steps and 49 hits targeting late, maturation, and secretion steps in the viral life cycle. Of the total 430 hits, 220 were confirmed by dose-response analysis in the primary HTS assay. They were subsequently triaged by time-of-addition assays, then clustered and ranked according to their chemical structures, biological functions, therapeutic index, and maximum inhibition. Several novel drugs have been identified to very efficiently inhibit EBOV. Interestingly, most showed pharmacological activity in treatments for central nervous system-related diseases. We developed and screened an HTS assay using the novel EBOV trVLP system. Newly identified inhibitors are useful tools to study the poorly understood EBOV life cycle. In addition, they also provide opportunities to either repurpose FDA-approved drugs or develop novel viral interventions to combat EVD.

AB  - This dataset presents the macrobenthic species occurrence frequency in four coastal intertidal reefs environment of Paraiba state Brazil. The species were classified in bioindicators groups based in morpho-anatomical, physiological and ecological characteristics. In the dry and wet season in each reef, the sampling units were randomly positioned and photographed inside a circular area with a 10 m radius. Thirty points were plotted over photos to quantify the percentage of species occurrence frequency. Taxons hard to identify by photo were grouped in a unique category. Currently, macrobenthic species are used as bioindicators of the local state of conservation by managing agencies. The population ecology monitoring of macrobenthic species with bioindicator potential is useful to recognize seasonal environmental patterns or local anthropic impactful. The research article on these data [1] will be published in the journal Ocean and Coastal Management for some interpretive insights.

AB  - The article is devoted to the comparative analysis of the use of environmental taxes and the introduction of environmental innovations in terms of impact on the parameters of revenues and expenditures of the state budget. The study includes 10 countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovak Republic). The analysis period covers 2010-2019. Systematization of scientific research proves the importance of using different tools to ensure sustainable development and greening of the national economy. The main purpose of the study is to determine a more effective form of interaction between government and business in the process of transforming the national economy in the direction of more environmentally friendly products and technologies by economic and mathematical modeling of environmental taxes and eco-innovation impact of budget revenues and expenditures. The calculations consist on the several stages: 1) determining the list of relevant control variables using correlation analysis, which eliminates the problem of multicollinearity; 2) determination of the model specification (fixed or random effects) using the Hausman test; 3) identification of the generalizing effects of the impact of environmental taxation and the eco-innovation index on the indicators of budget revenues and expenditures using a generalized least squares panel regression model with random effects; 4) study of the impact of the main components of environmental taxes and components of the eco-innovation index on the parameters of the state budget using panel regression modelling; 5) determination of short-term and long-term effects of the impact of environmental taxes and eco-innovations on the parameters of budget revenues and expenditures bt auto-regression distributive lag modelling. Stata 12/SE software tools were used for calculations. The study indicates the need to transform approaches to the implementation of state environmental policy. Thus, it has been proven that government incentives for the introduction of environmental innovations in the economy can be more effective than increasing the burden of environmental taxes.

AB  - A N-15 tracing study was carried out to investigate the potential gross nitrogen (N) dynamics in thirteen forest soils in Eastern China ranging from temperate to tropical zones (five coniferous forests, six deciduous broad-leaf forests, one temperate mixed forest, one evergreen broad-leaf forests ecosystems), and to identify the major controlling factors on N cycling in these forest ecosystems. The soil pH ranged from 4.3 to 7.9 and soil organic carbon (SOC) ranged from 6.6 g kg(-1) to 83.0 g kg(-1). The potential gross N transformation rates were quantified by N-15 tracing studies where either the ammonium or nitrate pools were N-15 labeled in parallel treatments. Gross mineralization rates ranged from 0.915 mu g N g(-1) soil day(-1) to 2.718 mu g N g(-1) soil day(-1) in the studied forest soils. The average contribution of labile organic-N (M (Nlab) ) to total gross mineralization (M (Nrec) +M (Nlab) ) was 86% (58% to 99%), indicating that turnover of labile organic N plays a dominant role in the studied forest ecosystems. The gross mineralization rates in coniferous forest soils were significantly lower (ranging between 0.915 and 1.228 mu g N g(-1) soil day(-1)) compared to broad-leaf forest soils (ranging from 1.621 to 2.718 mu g N g(-1) soil day(-1)) (p < 0.01). Thus, the dominant vegetation may play an important role in regulating soil N mineralization. Nitrate production (nitrification) occurred via two pathways, oxidation of NH (4) (+) and organic N the forest soils. Correlations with soil pH indicated that this is a key factor controlling the oxidation of NH (4) (+) and organic N in theses forest ecosystems. NH (4) (+) oxidation decreased with a decline in pH while organic N oxidation increased. The climatic conditions (e.g. moisture status) at the various sites governed the NO (3) (-) -N consumption processes (dissimilatory NO (3) (-) reduction to NH (4) (+) (DNRA) or immobilization of NO (3) (-) ). Total NO (3) (-) consumption and the proportion of total NO (3) (-) consumption to total NO (3) (-) production decreased with an increase in the drought index of ecosystems, showing that strong interactions appear to exist between climatic condition (e.g. the drought index), N mineralization and the rate of DNRA. Interactions between vegetation, climatic conditions govern internal N cycling in these forests soils.

AB  - The sustainable usage of groundwater is facing a rapid decline in quantity and quality due to demographic and industrial expansion. In India, among several residential-industrial hubs, Ghaziabad is one of the suburban districts and industrial town of Uttar Pradesh, largely dependent upon groundwater for its water needs. The present study was carried out to assess the groundwater in terms of qualitative, geochemical and to identify corrosion-scaling potential during the pre- and post-monsoon seasons of 2017. Majority of the samples showed the exceeding levels of EC, TDS, TH, Cl, Na, and K, inferring the seasonal variability. Geochemical characterization indicated the origin of the groundwater from the rock-water interface of the underlying aquifers and hydrochemical types of water facies: Ca-Mg-HCO3 > Na K-HCO3 > Na K-Cl-SO4 were found predominant. Based on the classification of groundwater, most of the samples indicated Na+-HCO3 and shallow meteoric type of nature. Schoeller's index of base exchange also showed the chloro-alkaline disequilibrium with indirect base exchange hardened water. Subsequently, to predict the corrosive-scaling behaviors of the groundwater; five water stability indices were applied namely; Langelier saturation index (LSI), Ryznar stability index (RSI), Puckorius scaling index (PSI), Larson-Skold index (LS) and Aggressive index (AI). The results illustrated that the bulk of the samples exhibited scaling trend as per LSI, LS, and AI, alike RSI and PSI that registered slight corrosive properties of the groundwater. Spatial-temporal mapping of the indices also reflected the temporary scaling potential. Statistically, the interrelationships among the parameters and indices were evaluated using Spearman's correlation which confirmed the scaling effects through strong-significant associations among cationanion complexes that promote temporary scaling. Therefore, estimation of quality levels and influences in the chemical integrity helps to underline the causative effects and ensure the sustainable consumption of the groundwater in various purposes through prior quality monitoring and applied preventive measures.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity impacts stream ecosystems, resulting in a loss of diversity and ecosystem function; however, little is known about the response of aquatic microbial communities to changes in land use. Here, microbial communities were characterized in 82 headwater streams across a gradient of urban and agricultural land uses using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and compared to a rich data set of physicochemical variables and traditional benthic invertebrate indicators. Microbial diversity and community structures differed among watersheds with high agricultural, urban, and forested land uses, and community structure differed in streams classified as being in good, fair, poor, and very poor condition using benthic invertebrate indicators. Microbial community similarity decayed with geodesic distance across the study region but not with environmental distance. Stream community respiration rates ranged from 21.7 to 1,570 mg O-2 m(-2) day(-1) and 31.9 to 3,670 mg O-2 m(-2) day(-1) for water column and sediments, respectively, and correlated with nutrients associated with anthropogenic influence and microbial community structure. Nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations ranged from 0.22 to 4.41 mu g N2O liter(-1); N2O concentration was negatively correlated with forested land use and was positively correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations. Our findings suggest that stream microbial communities are impacted by watershed land use and can potentially be used to assess ecosystem health.
   IMPORTANCE Stream ecosystems are frequently impacted by changes in watershed land use, resulting in altered hydrology, increased pollutant and nutrient loads, and habitat degradation. Macroinvertebrates and fish are strongly affected by changes in stream conditions and are commonly used in biotic indices to assess ecosystem health. Similarly, microbes respond to environmental stressors, and changes in community composition alter key ecosystem processes. The response of microbes to habitat degradation and their role in global biogeochemical cycles provide an opportunity to use microbes as a monitoring tool. Here, we identify stream microbes that respond to watershed urbanization and agricultural development and demonstrate that microbial diversity and community structure can be used to assess stream conditions and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Body size is related to an extensive number of species traits and ecological processes and has therefore been suggested as an effective metric to assess community changes and ecosystem's state. However, the applicability of body size as an ecological indicator in benthic environments has been hindered by the poor knowledge of the factors influencing the size spectra of organisms. By applying biological trait analysis (BTA) and generalized linear models to a species dataset collected in the German Wadden Sea (53A degrees 41'14'' N, 7A degrees 14'19'' E) between 1999 and 2012, we show that the size structure of the macrobenthic community changes predictably along environmental gradients. Specifically, body size increases with increasing current-induced shear stress and sediment organic matter content. In addition, the presence of oyster-mussel reefs in one of the sampling stations enhanced the survival of species belonging to the smallest size categories in habitats with high hydrodynamic energy. This was probably due to the local sheltering effects, which together with biodeposition also increased organic matter in the sediment, likely favoring large deposit feeders as well. Our results suggest that body size can be a useful trait for estimating effects of anthropogenic stressors, such as organic enrichment or alteration of hydrodynamic regime and could therefore be effectively included in current monitoring programs of intertidal macrobenthic communities.

AB  - Although advanced materials (AdMs) are beneficial in many applications, questions remain as to whether they are more or less sustainable than the conventional materials that they may replace. Currently, there is no available tool to provide clarity to these questions. Traditional approaches for evaluating the sustainability of a chemical or material are usually not standardized, and as a result, the metrics used in sustainability measurements are subjective and often vary from assessor to assessor. Additionally, sustainability characterizations resulting from these approaches are typically presented qualitatively and are often vaguely drawn, making it difficult to confidently and transparently conclude that 1 material is more sustainable than another. This paper aims to address these gaps by enabling stakeholders involved in the production, use, or governance of AdMs to assess the sustainability of AdMs in a consistent, objective, and quantitative way using a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA)-based model. The model proposed herein adapts a triple-bottom-line (TBL) framework from the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) and incorporates criteria weights identified through a stakeholder values assessment conducted by surveying AdM practitioners. Results from the stakeholder values assessment show that the perceived importance of the economic component of the TBL varies the most across stakeholders, and that practitioners providing responses from the perspective of a nongovernmental environmental advocacy group or a regulator of AdMs such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency were more likely to score and weigh economic indicators lower and environmental indicators higher compared to when responding from a business owner perspective. The resulting MCDA-based model allows stakeholders to assess the sustainability of an AdM or AdM-enabled product and compare it to product alternatives, predict how other stakeholders might score a product by identifying the extent to which components of the TBL are valued by other stakeholders, and identify which subcriteria contribute most to an improvement in a product's sustainability score.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges of nature conservation is to identify and locate networks of protected areas, which will preserve the biodiversity. The paper aims to show the ornithological value of the Sobibor Forests (E Poland) and to emphasize the fact that the network of Important Bird Areas (IBA) and Special Protection Areas within Natura 2000 (SPA) may require additions. The study was conducted in the period of 2008-2016, mainly ion forested areas occupying 256 km(2). The Sobibor Forests are characterized by a large diversity) of habitats, but are mainly covered by Scots pine Pinus sylvestris. High diversity of wetlands and marshlands make the Sobibor Forest unique within the country. Three methodologies were used to estimate population size of chosen species: sampling, census and random observations. 31 species from Annex I of the Birds Directive plus 25 species of SPEC or non-SPECE category were 'observed which allows to consider this area as one of the most valuable for avifauna in Poland. Six breeding species classify the Sobibor Forests as the IBA and SPA. These species include Black Stork Ciconia nigra (8-13 breeding pairs), Common Crane Grus grus (80-120 breeding pairs), Grey Great Owl Strix nebulosa (0-7 breeding pairs i.e. 50-100% of Polish breeding population), Eagle Owl Bubo bubo (6 breeding pairs), White-backed Woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos (40-70 breeding pairs) and Grey-headed Woodpecker Picus canus (20-40 breeding pairs). Six other species show potential for qualification, but not enough data has been collected yet. The list of this specie includes: Short-toed Snake Eagle Circaetus gallicus, Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago Stock Dove Columba oenas, European Nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus, Collared Flycatcher Ficedula albicollis and Bluethroat Luscinia svecica. The Sobibor Forests occupy a small area compared to other IBA forests. However, the number of breeding species classifies the surveyed area as 7th among other IBAs. Moreover all eligible species may be considered as a bioindicators of the natural state of the forest. This is proof of the high natural value of this area.

AB  - Food consumption, growth and the ability to withstand starvation were studied in two species of predominantly piscivorous predatory lionfishes from the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea: Dendrochirus brachypterus a small-bodied species, 35-40 g body weight, and Pterois volitans, 1.10-1.20 kg body weight. In experimental conditions, the biomass consumed by D. brachypterus was 0.8-1.1 g day(-1) in juveniles of 10-20 g body weight and 3.0-5.0 g day(-1) in adults of 35-40 g. P. volitans consumed 5.5-13.5 g day(-1) as juveniles, and 14.6 g day(-1) when adults of 300-500 g body weight. The growth trajectories of both species are parallel until they attain 20-25 g body weight. From this point on, growth in the maturing D. brachypterus nears asymptotic, while Pterois continue their exponential increase up to 70-80 g body weight. With age, the efficiency of food conversion, indexed by the condition (K) factor, is low (from 0.46 in young fish to 0.22 in adults), as most of their food energy is channeled towards maintenance. In nature, larger Pterois of 300-400 g body weight, consume about 8.5 g day(-1), amounting to 3.10 kg yr(-1); for 80 fish inhabiting a 1 km long reef, this totals approximately 228.48 kg yr(-1). Starvation experiments in these fishes produced a clear correlation between their initial weight and their ability to withstand prolonged fasting: D. brachypterus lost 12-33 % body weight within 7 weeks, and the larger Pterois lost only 5-16% within 3 months. I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of early maturation as well as small size versus large size, and delayed maturation in these two closely-related predatory fishes. Experiments with naive adult lionfish showed that their selection of prey species is a learned process, vital to survival during growth in the prey-fishes' rich habitat of coral reefs.

AB  - The existence of regime shifts and alternative stable states in ecosystems is well known and has very large effects on their structure and dynamics. Since shifts between alternative stable states have significant implications for the ecosystems conservation, their prevention should be an aim of primary interest, and for this reason a particular attention has been paid to their study. Regarding marine ecosystems, rocky intertidal habitats, in particular, represent an ideal system for the study of alternative stable states because of their characteristics: they exhibit strong environmental gradients, are easy to manipulate, and most of the inhabiting species grow rapidly. Given the socio-ecological importance and the vulnerability of intertidal rocky systems to multiple pressures, a specific review on these habitats is valuable for a better understanding of the functioning mechanisms of regime shifts. In this review, we examine the different approaches, both experimental and modeling, used to explore regime shifts and alternative states within rocky intertidal habitats. We also analyse the development and use in intertidal systems of new metrics able to signal in advance an approaching transition. Lastly, we discuss the existing knowledge gaps and highlight the management weaknesses of the study of regime shifts in the framework of ecosystem conservation.

AB  - The occurrence and spatial distribution of 22 congener phthalate esters (PAEs) in the Lanzhou section of the Yellow River were investigated using water and sediment samples collected from 12 stations along the river in August 2016 to March 2017. PAEs were determined by liquid-liquid extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The average concentrations of PAE in the water samples during the dry and wet periods were 3236.0 ng/L and 2300.0 ng/L, and the average dry and wet periods of the PAEs in the sediments were 4238.9 ng/g and 3959.9 ng/g, respectively. PAEs were detected in all sampling sites. The six PAEs controlled by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), namely dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP), and butyl benzyl phthalate(BBP), were detected. DMP, DEP, DBP, and DEHP accounted for more than 70% of all PAEs. In view of time distribution, PAEs concentration in the water samples of the dry season were greater than those of the wet season, but the sediments did not differ remarkably across the different periods. As for spatial distribution, the PAEs initially exhibited low concentrations in the upper reaches, high concentrations in the middle part, and low concentrations in the downstream; a health risk assessment of the six PAEs controlled by the U.S. EPA was carried out according to priority. Results showed that the carcinogenic risk value was less than 10(-6), and the values of the non-carcinogenic compound risk index were less than 1, indicating the absence of carcinogenic damage to organisms or humans.

LA  - English
AB  - Earth observing satellites represent some of the most valued components of the international Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), both part of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). In the United States, such satellites are a cornerstone of the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), required to carry out advanced coastal and ocean research, and to implement and sustain sensible resource management policies based on science. Satellite imagery and satellite-derived data are required for mapping vital coastal and marine resources, improving maritime domain awareness, and to better understand the complexities of land, ocean, atmosphere, ice, biological, and social interactions. These data are critical to the strategic planning of in situ observing components and are critical to improving forecasting and numerical modeling. Specifically, there are several stakeholder communities that require periodic, frequent, and sustained synoptic observations. Of particular importance are indicators of ecosystem structure (habitat and species inventories), ecosystem states (health and change) and observations about physical and biogeochemical variables to support the operational and research communities, and industry sectors including mining, fisheries, and transportation. IOOS requires a strategy to coordinate the human capacity, and fund, advance, and maintain the infrastructure that provides improved remote sensing observations and support for the nation and the globe. A partnership between the private, government, and education sectors will enhance remote sensing support and product development for critical coastal and deep-water regions based on infrared, ocean color, and microwave satellite sensors. These partnerships need to include international research, government, and industry sectors in order to facilitate open data access, understanding of calibration and algorithm strategies, and fill gaps in coverage. Such partnerships will define the types of observations required to sustain vibrant coastal economies and to improve the health of our marine and coastal ecosystems. They are required to plan, fund, launch and operate the types of satellite sensors needed in the very near future to maintain continuity of observations.

AB  - Humid tropical forest soils are characterized by low and fluctuating redox, conditions which are thought to inhibit organic matter degradation by microbes. However, evidence suggests that soil microbial communities are adapted to the redox conditions in these ecosystems. In this study we tested the hypothesis that soil oxygen (02) availability as an index of redox conditions structures patterns in litter decomposition and associated microbial community dynamics over space and time in humid tropical forests. We conducted a two year decomposition experiment on a common litter substrate in four sites along an elevational gradient with well described climate and redox dynamics. Microbial community sequencing, potential enzyme activities, and litter chemistry measurements were made on litter and soil to determine the relationship between soil and litter communities and biogeochemistry. Decomposition was slowest in the upper elevation site, which was the wettest and had the lowest average soil 02 availability. However, soil hydrolytic and litter phenol oxidase activities were greatest at this site. Small subunit ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced with universal primers for bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, yielding 40,850 unique taxa after quality filtering and clustering. Across all sites, microbial succession was observed as increasing litter richness, converging bacterial community profiles, and diverging fungal community profiles. Initial decomposers (1-4 weeks) included many r-selected bacteria, including Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridia, Bacteroidetes. We also found evidence of anaerobic fungi such as Cryptococcus, as well as the plant-associated Phialocephala and Phyllachora species, suggesting that anaerobic and plant-associated fungi are prevalent later in decomposition in soils with low and fluctuating redox conditions. Because of the striking similarities between sites in functional potential despite differences in wet tropical soil decomposing communities and litter chemistry, we suggest that future climate-driven disruptions to redox fluctuations could significantly alter the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle in tropical forests.

AB  - In the present study, the impacts of starvation and re-feeding on growth, immune response, and intestinal microbiota in Nile tilapia were evaluated. During starvation, the growth performance parameters including body weight (BW), feed conversion ratio (FCR), viscerosomatic index (VSI), and condition factor (CF) significantly decreased while increased after re-fed (p < 0.05). The activities of the digestive enzymes including lipase, amylase, and protease in the intestinal mucus significantly decreased in the starved group while increased after re-fed. After 14 days of starvation, the activities of non-specific immunological parameters including lysozyme (LZM), alkaline phosphate (ALP), and acid phosphate (ACP), and antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the liver were significantly increased. Also, the mRNA levels of inflammatory-related genes (interleukin -1beta IL-1 beta, interleukin -6 IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor TNF-alpha) in spleen were significantly up-regulated. The liver suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) mRNA expression level was significantly increased after 7 days and then decreased after 21 days of starvation which is seen to be responsible for the down-regulation of growth hormone (GH) signaling in the liver. In the liver, the mRNA expression levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling -2 (SOCS-2) increased while mRNA expression levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1) were significantly increased after 7 days and decreased after 21 days of starvation. Moreover, starvation influences the abundance and diversity of the intestinal microbiota of Nile tilapia. Also, the functional pathways of the intestinal microbiota were induced by starvation including energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and lipid metabolism. These data will provide a better understanding of growth, immunity, and adaptability to environmental changes to Nile tilapia.

AB  - Water is increasingly becoming a valuable resource, constituting one of the central themes of environmental, economic and social discussions. The Sinos River, located in southern Brazil, is the main river from the Sinos River Basin, representing a source of drinking water supply for a highly populated region. Considering its size and importance, it becomes necessary to conduct a study to follow up the water quality of this river, which is considered by some experts as one of the most polluted rivers in Brazil. As for this study, its great importance lies in the historical analysis of indicators. In this sense, we sought to develop aspects related to the management of water resources by performing a historical analysis of the Water Quality Index (WQI) of the Sinos River, using statistical methods. With regard to the methodological procedures, it should be pointed out that this study performs a time analysis of monitoring data on parameters related to a punctual measurement that is variable in time, using statistical tools. The data used refer to analyses of the water quality of the Sinos River (WQI) from the State Environmental Protection Agency Henrique Luiz Roessler (Fundacao Estadual de Protecao Ambiental Henrique Luiz Roessler, FEPAM) covering the period between 2000 and 2008, as well as to a theoretical analysis focusing on the management of water resources. The study of WQI and its parameters by statistical analysis has shown to be effective, ensuring its effectiveness as a tool for the management of water resources. The descriptive analysis of the WQI and its parameters showed that the water quality of the Sinos River is concerning low, which reaffirms that it is one of the most polluted rivers in Brazil. It should be highlighted that there was an overall difficulty in obtaining data with the appropriate periodicity, as well as a long complete series, which limited the conduction of statistical studies such as the present one.

AB  - There is a substantial amount of carbon stored in the permafrost soils of boreal forest ecosystems, where it is currently protected from decomposition. The surface organic horizons insulate the deeper soil from variations in atmospheric temperature. The removal of these insulating horizons through consumption by fire increases the vulnerability of permafrost to thaw, and the carbon stored in permafrost to decomposition. In this study we ask how warming and fire regime may influence spatial and temporal changes in active layer and carbon dynamics across a boreal forest landscape in interior Alaska. To address this question, we (1) developed and tested a predictive model of the effect of fire severity on soil organic horizons that depends on landscape-level conditions and (2) used this model to evaluate the long-term consequences of warming and changes in fire regime on active layer and soil carbon dynamics of black spruce forests across interior Alaska. The predictive model of fire severity, designed from the analysis of field observations, reproduces the effect of local topography (landform category, the slope angle and aspect and flow accumulation), weather conditions (drought index, soil moisture) and fire characteristics (day of year and size of the fire) on the reduction of the organic layer caused by fire. The integration of the fire severity model into an ecosystem process-based model allowed us to document the relative importance and interactions among local topography, fire regime and climate warming on active layer and soil carbon dynamics. Lowlands were more resistant to severe fires and climate warming, showing smaller increases in active layer thickness and soil carbon loss compared to drier flat uplands and slopes. In simulations that included the effects of both warming and fire at the regional scale, fire was primarily responsible for a reduction in organic layer thickness of 0.06 m on average by 2100 that led to an increase in active layer thickness of 1.1 m on average by 2100. The combination of warming and fire led to a simulated cumulative loss of 9.6 kgC m 2 on average by 2100. Our analysis suggests that ecosystem carbon storage in boreal forests in interior Alaska is particularly vulnerable, primarily due to the combustion of organic layer thickness in fire and the related increase in active layer thickness that exposes previously protected permafrost soil carbon to decomposition.

Eggs exposed at 100 ng/L hatched sooner, the larvae were longer, and survival of juvenile fish from hatch to study termination was greater than all other treatments, though fewer hatched at this treatment. Sex ratios were skewed (>80% female phenotype) at 100 ng/L EE2, and some gonadal male fish displayed female secondary sex characteristics. Condition factor, gonadosomatic index (GSI), and liver somatic index (LSI) were found to decrease in both sexes between 52 and 61 weeks post-hatch. Female fish had increased hepatic vitellogenin (VTG) at 52 weeks post-hatch. When exposed to 1, 10 and 100 ng/L EE2, female fish had a higher proportion of vitellogenic follicles in the ovarian tissue. Males exposed at 100 ng/L may have had disruption at some endpoints (GSI, VTG) that is masked due to reduced sample size compared to other treatments. Fish exposed to concentrations of EE2 at or below 10 ng/L showed inconsistent effects on development and reproductive potential. This study indicates the potential for population-level effects at the high range of environmental EE2 at concentrations equivalent to those at which consistent effects in fecundity in the adult mummichog reproductive test have been measured. This work demonstrates that chronic EE2 exposure causes developmental effects at concentrations similar to those which cause effects in the shorter-term adult mummichog reproductive test. Effects are at higher concentrations than have been noted for freshwater model species. Whether this is because of species sensitivity or due to differences between freshwater and saltwater availability of EE2 or its uptake requires further study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this work is to investigate the ecological-and-economic aspect of certain factors to ensure the balanced use of forest lands; develop proposals for the formation of the basis for the development of sustainable forestry.
   Methodology / approach. We used the following methods: dialectical method of cognition for the analysis of scientific works of scientists concerning problems of balanced use of lands of forestry purpose; method of analogies (transfer of patterns of development of one process with certain amendments to another process or territory); statistical (based on quantitative indicators that allow drawing conclusions about the pace of the process); comparative analysis (comparison of indicators of forest resources and their use for Ukraine and Poland); correlation analysis (identification of factors on which the forecast significantly depends; clarification of relationships, their relationship with the predicted phenomenon under the influence of certain factors), graphical, abstract-logical (theoretical generalizations and formulation of conclusions). The information base of the study is the data of the Global Assessment of Forest Resources of FAO 2020, the data of the Monitoring of Land Relations in Ukraine, the reporting of the State Forest Agency of Ukraine, the data of the Forest Stewardship Council (R). Based on the annual reports of the State Forestry Agency of Ukraine, some indicators of the report of 288 state forestries for 2018-2020 are consolidated in terms of 24 regional departments of forestry and hunting.
   Results. In the dynamics for 2018-2020, changes in the volume of forest resources, forest reserves, biomass, and carbon density were studied; the indicators of forest resources and their use for Ukraine and Poland are compared. The volumes of forest certification by regions of Ukraine are estimated. The relationships between capital investments in forestry production and the price of sold wood, the volume of net income of state forestry, the amount of profit, the degree of depreciation of fixed assets; between the tax burden on state forestries and financial stability was studied. Based on the assessment of the relationships and changes in individual indicators, the need to update the fixed assets of forest enterprises through the improvement of the investment instrument is justified. The results of this study are a summary of evidence on the environmental and economic aspects of the impact of certain factors on the sustainable use of forest lands, which in turn forms the scientific basis for achieving the goals of state environmental policy of Ukraine.
   Originality / scientific novelty. The studied interdependencies between the statistical characteristics of individual indicators of forestry land use made it possible to identify factors to ensure balanced use of forestry lands. It is substantiated that reforestation, forest certification, renewal of fixed assets of forestry enterprises through the improvement of the investment instrument, optimization of the tax burden of forestry activities are favorable factors to ensure the balance of forestry land use. It is proved that the excessive tax burden is a deterrent to the balanced use of forest lands. It is proposed to alleviate the tax burden on forestry activities by reducing the rate of deduction of net income of state forestry enterprises, eliminating the problem of double taxation of the forest fund, which under limited budget funding will allow state forestries to accumulate their own financial resources to ensure sustainable land use.
   Practical value / implications. The main results of the study can be used to: (I) structure the factors of sustainable use of forest lands; (II) defining the goals of sustainable development when developing the strategy of forestry enterprises; (III) analysis of the achievement of sustainable development goals at the national level, defined by the Basic Principles (strategy) of the state environmental policy of Ukraine for the period up to 2030. The results of the study can be used both at the level of forest management entities, as well as at the regional and national levels, to make management decisions on the implementation of measures that ensure the balanced use of forest land. Also, the causal links between indicators that arise from the response of indicators to certain factors open up new opportunities for forest management planning. These results can provide important information for the protection and use of forest resources in all regions of Ukraine.

AB  - The present study investigated the reproductive biology of Sciades herzbergii in the Paraiba do Norte River Estuary, Brazil. We aimed to characterize the reproduction of the species with respect to sex ratio, spawning season, condition factor and length at first maturity. Specimens were captured between August 2009 and July 2010 in a stretch of the main channel of the estuary. In the laboratory, they were measured, weighed and macroscopically classified with regard to sex and gonad development stage, and their gonads were weighted. The monthly distribution of the sexes and their respective stages of maturation were determined. The gonadosomatic index (GSI), condition factor (K) and the length at first maturity were calculated for males and females. The sex ratio was determined monthly and throughout the entire study period and the chi-square test was used to evaluate if the sex ratio differed from 1:1. The Pearson's correlation test was used to determine the correlation between GSI and K values. A total of 260 individuals were captured. It was impossible to determine the sex of 32 individuals, possibly due to their young age. The sex ratio did not differ throughout the overall study period, but significant differences were found in December and May, with a predominance of females, and in March, when males predominated. Spawning activities were concentrated between December and March, as determined by the greater incidence of mature females and higher GSI values. The spawning of the S. herzbergii population is characterized as staggered due to its long duration. For females, K values were not significantly correlated with the GSI, but the decrease in K values in the spawning period indicates that energy is being spent in reproduction. With regard to males, the distribution of developmental stages did not follow the same clear pattern as that seen with females. However, the GSI indicated a greater investment in gonads in October, with a decrease up to July (end of the data acquisition period). For males, K values exhibited a positive correlation with GSI, with a gradual decrease beginning in February up to July, indicating energy that energy was being consumed, which was certainly related to the mouth brooding of eggs and neonates. Mean length at first maturity was 212 mm for females and 240 mm for males. Sciades herzbergii completes its lifecycle in the estuary and exhibits post-spawning parental care. This species is abundant in the estuary studied and information on the reproductive biology of this resident is necessary to the management of the estuarine environment.

AB  - In many coastal regions, activities of multiple users present a growing strain on the ecological state of the area. The necessity of using integrative system approaches to understand and solve coastal problems has become obvious in the last decades. Integrated management strategies for social-ecological systems (SESs) call for the development of SES indicators that help (i) to identify and link the states and processes of social, economic and ecological subsystems and (ii) to balance different stakeholder objectives over the long-term within natural limits. Here we use a system dynamics modeling approach called group model building (GMB) as a diagnostic participative tool for understanding the determinants of characteristic SES issues in the Dutch Wadden Sea region and exploring salient SES indicators for management. We used GMB in two separate workshops for two distinct cases: sustainable mussel fisheries and tourism development. Follow-up online questionnaires elicited relevant variables for deriving SES indicators. In both modeling cases participants identified and connected the variables that expressed fundamental SES dynamics driving each issue. In the mussel fisheries model the central part of the structure was the interaction between the model variables 'extent of mussel habitat with high natural value', 'mussel cultivation efficiency', and 'market supply'. In the tourism model a key driving force for explaining tourist development was the reciprocal relation between the model variables 'natural value', 'experience value', and 'number of tourists'. Application of GMB revealed SES issue complexity and explicitly identified key linkages and potential SES indicators for policy and management in the Dutch Wadden Sea area. As a tool for stakeholder involvement in integrated coastal management the approach enables the joint building of system understanding and the exchange of individual perspectives. Participants agreed with the jointly created models and highly appreciated the way the structured approach facilitated communication and learning about complex and contested issues.

AB  - Bio-evaluating of surface waters is not a new approach but is becoming more important since the application of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The present study was designed to evaluate the limno-ecological conditions of rivers in the West Mediterranean basin of Turkey using diatom metrics and multivariate approaches according to the WFD requirements. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to assess the relationships of diatom species and environmental variables from 17 stations of 12 rivers sampled in two seasons. The CCA indicated that nitrite, chloride, electrical conductivity (EC), sulfate, temperature, and total phosphorus (TP) are the most explanatory factors on the distribution of the diatom species. Karasu River had the most deteriorated ecosystem, distinctly revealed by the CCA. Nutrient enrichment and high EC, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and temperature values were noticed in this ecosystem. Karasu River was also characterized by pollution tolerant diatom species (e.g., Nitzschia inconspicua, Nitzschia pusilla, Halamphora normanii, and Rhoicosphenia abbreviata). Trophic index Turkey (TIT), eutrophication and/or pollution index-diatom (EPI-D), and trophic index (TI) showed poor ecological conditions in Karasu and Hamzabey rivers when a moderate environment quality in Dalaman River (at R6 station) and a good ecological state in Kocadere River. A high ecological status was found in Dalaman (at R5 station) concerning the results of TIT and TI, while a good condition was recorded based on EPI-D. This ecosystem was also associated with pollution-sensitive diatom taxa (Achnanthidium minutissimum, Cymbella excisa, Meridion circulare, and Gomphonema olivaceum). Results of CCA were corroborated with the bio-assessment of sampling stations based on diatom metrics. TIT, TI, and EPI-D had different indices' scores, but they showed significantly positive correlations with logTP. Spearman correlation coefficient value of TIT strengthens the suitability of it for the bio-assessment of the rivers in the West Mediterranean basin of Turkey.

AB  - A central theme in the field of ecology is understanding how environmental variables influence a species' distribution. In the last 20 years, there has been particular attention given to understanding adaptive physiological traits that allow some species to persist in urban environments. However, there is no clear consensus on how urbanization influences physiology, and it is unclear whether physiological differences in urban birds are directly linked to adverse outcomes or are representative of urban birds adaptively responding to novel environmental variables. Moreover, though low-density suburban development is the fastest advancing form of urbanization, most studies have focused on animals inhabiting high intensity urban habitats. In this study, we measured a suite of physiological variables that reflect condition and immune function in male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) from rural and suburban habitats. Specifically, we measured hematological indices [packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)], circulating glutathione (total, reduced, and oxidized), oxidative damage (d-ROM concentration), antioxidant capacity, and components of the innate immune system [bacteria killing ability (BKA), white blood cell counts]. We also measured whole-animal indices of health, including body condition (scaled mass index length) and furcular fat. Song sparrows inhabiting suburban environments exhibited lower hemoglobin and MCHC, but higher body condition and furcular fat scores. Additionally, suburban birds had higher heterophil counts and lower lymphocyte counts, but there were no differences in heterophil:lymphocyte ratio or BKA between suburban and rural birds. PCV, glutathione concentrations, and oxidative damage did not differ between suburban and rural sparrows. Overall, suburban birds did not exhibit physiological responses suggestive of adverse outcomes. Rather, there is some evidence that sparrows from rural and suburban habitats exhibit phenotypic differences in energy storage and metabolic demand, which may be related to behavioral differences previously observed in sparrows from these populations. Furthermore, this study highlights the need for measuring multiple markers of physiology across different types of urban development to accurately assess the effects of urbanization on wildlife.

AB  - We analyzed data from 1138 wetland sites across the conterminous United States (US) as part of the 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA) to investigate the response of indicators of wetland quality to indicators of human disturbance at regional and continental scales. The strength and nature of these relationships in wetlands have rarely been examined over large regions, due to the paucity of large-scale datasets. Wetland response indicators were a multimetric index of vegetation condition (VMMI), percent relative cover of alien plant species, soil lead and phosphorus, and water column total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Site-level disturbance indices were generated from field observations of disturbance types within a circular 140-m radius area around the sample point. Summary indices were calculated representing disturbances for ditching, damming, filling/erosion, hardening, vegetation replacement, and vegetation removal. Landscape-level disturbance associated with agricultural and urban land cover, roads, and human population were based on GIS data layers quantified in 200, 500, and 1000-m circular buffers around each sample point. Among these three buffer sizes, the landscape disturbance indicators were highly correlated and had similar relationships with the response indictors. Consequently, only the 1000-m buffer data were used for subsequent analyses. Disturbance-response models built using only landscape- or only site-level disturbance variables generally explained a small portion of the variance in the response variables (R-2<0.2), whereas models using both types of disturbance data were better at predicting wetland responses. The VMMI was the response variable with the strongest relationship to the disturbances assessed in the NWCA (national model R-2=0.251). National multiple regression models for the soil and water chemistry and percent alien cover responses to disturbance indices were not significant. The generally low percentage of significant models and the wide variation in predictor variables suggests that stressor-response relationships vary considerably across the diversity of wetland types and landscape settings found across the conterminous US. Logistic regression modeling was more informative, resulting in significant national and regional models predicting site presence/absence of alien species and/or the concentration of lead in wetland soils above background.

AB  - Temporal and spatial variation in dung beetles abundances is a pattern observed in many tropical forests. The present study evaluated the seasonal patterns of dung beetles in a range of increasingly disturbed ecosystems of the state of Para, northern Brazil, to identify valuable disturbance indicators. The areas included native forest, agriculture, pasture for extensive livestock grazing and secondary forests. Fieldwork was carried out encompassing the complete range of environmental conditions encountered during the year. In total, 13,649 individuals were captured within 23 genera and 99 species but with pronounced differences among ecosystems and seasons. The obtained results seem to demonstrate that dung beetles can be used to help identify ecosystems under very complex and variable environmental conditions. The ecological drift observed also demonstrates the possibility of using dung beetles as ecological indicators of disturbance in Amazonia.

AB  - We described the pattern of mean site index and the associated variation in site index of western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn. ex D. Don.) in relation to categorical variables of soil moisture and nutrients as identified by the field-procedures of the biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification Additionally, we compared the sire index of western redcedar to that of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.). We sampled 105 plots from stands having western redcedar as the major tree species. The plots were distributed within each of two climates, a drier and a wetter cool mesothermal climate in south coastal British Columbia. Sixty-three plots had both western redcedar and western hemlock available for comparisons. Heights and ages were measured on five dominant trees on a 0.04 ha plot, and the height at a base age of 50 years was calculated to give site index. The highest western redcedar site index occurred on sites identified as having no moisture deficit or excess and high nitrogen availability. Site index decreased on sites identified by field procedures as being outside this optimum moisture and nutrient condition. The mean site index was significantly greater in the drier cool mesothermal climate than the wetter cool mesothermal climate on sites identified as having similar soil moisture and nutrient conditions. Climate appears to have a large effect on site index, therefore, on similar soil conditions the site index of western redcedar may be higher in the southern portion of its range in the United States; and lower in north coastal B.C. and southeastern Alaska. On sites where both western redcedar and western hemlock were sampled, the site index of western redcedar was consistently lower. Based on a northward trend, we may predict that in southeastern Alaska the site index values may be larger for western redcedar compared to western hemlock, while in Washington and Oregon there may be an even greater site index of western hemlock over western redcedar than reported here.

AB  - Psychological stress is thought to undermine host resistance to infection through neuro endocrine-mediated changes in immune competence. Associations between stress and infection have been modest in magnitude, however, suggesting individual variability in stress response. We therefore studied environmental stressors, psychobiologic reactivity to stress, and respiratory illness incidence in two studies of 236 preschool children. In Study 1, 137 3- to 5-year-old children from four childcare centers underwent a laboratory-based assessment of cardiovascular reactivity (changes in heart rate and mean arterial pressure) during a series of developmentally challenging tasks. Environmental stress was evaluated with two measures of stressors in the childcare setting. The incidence of respiratory illnesses was ascertained over 6 months using weekly respiratory tract examinations by a nurse. In Study 2, 99 5-year-old children were assessed for immune reactivity (changes in CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cell numbers, lymphocyte mitogenesis, and antibody response to pneumococcal vaccine) during the normative stressor of entering school. Blood for immune measures was sampled 1 week before and after kindergarten entry. Environmental stress was indexed with parent reports of family stressors, and a 12-week respiratory illness incidence was measured with biweekly, parent-completed symptom checklists. The two studies produced remarkably similar findings. Although environmental stress was not independently associated with respiratory illnesses in either study, the incidence of illness was related to an interaction between childcare stress and mean arterial pressure reactivity (beta = .35, p < .05) in Study 1 and to an interaction between stressful life events and CD19+ reactivity (beta = .51, p < .05) in Study 2. In both studies, reactive children sustained higher illness rates under high-stress conditions, but lower rates in low-stress conditions, compared with less reactive peers. Stress was associated with increased rates of illnesses, but only among psychobiologically reactive children. Less reactive children experienced no escalation in illness incidence under stressful conditions, suggesting that only a subset of individuals may be susceptible to the health-altering effects of stressors and adversity.

AB  - Children of parents with bipolar disorder (bipolar offspring) represent a rich cohort for study with potential for illumination of prodromal forms of bipolar disorder. Due to their high-risk nature, bipolar offspring may present phenomenological, temperamental, and biological clues to early presentations of bipolar disorder. This article reviews the evidence for establishing bipolar offspring as a high-risk cohort, the studies which point to possible prodromal states in bipolar offspring, biological findings in bipolar offspring which may be indicators of even higher risk for bipolar disorder, initial attempts at early intervention in prodromal pediatric bipolar disorder, and implications for future research.

AB  - In recent years, levels of particulate matter (PM) air pollution in China have been relatively high, exceeding China's Class II standards in many cities and impacting public health. This analysis takes Chinese health impact functions and underlying health incidence, applies 2010-2012 modeled and monitored PM air quality data, and estimates avoided cases of mortality and morbidity in Shanghai, assuming achievement of China's Class II air quality standards.
   In Shanghai, the estimated avoided all cause mortality due to PM10, ranged from 13 to 55 cases per day and from 300 to 800 cases per year. The estimated avoided impact on hospital admissions due to PM10, ranged from 230 cases to 580 cases per day and from 5400 to 7900 per year. The estimated avoided impact on all cause mortality due to PM2.5 ranged from 6 to 26 cases per day and from 39 to 1400 per year. The estimated impact on all cause mortality of a year exposure to an annual or monthly mean PM2.5 concentration ranged from 180 to 3500 per year. In Shanghai, the avoided cases of all cause mortality had an estimated monetary value ranging from 170 million yuan (1 US dollar = 4.2 yuan Purchasing Power Parity) to 1200 million yuan. Avoided hospital admissions had an estimated value from 20 to 43 million yuan. Avoided emergency department visits had an estimated value from 5.6 million to 15 million yuan. Avoided outpatient visits had an estimated value from 21 million to 31 million yuan. In this analysis, available data were adequate to estimate avoided health impacts and assign monetary value. Sufficient supporting documentation was available to construct and format data sets for use in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's health and environmental assessment model, known as the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program - Community Edition ("BenMAP-CE").

AB  - Understanding environmental driver-response relationships is critical to the implementation of effective ecosystembased management. Ecosystems are often influenced by multiple drivers that operate on different timescales and may be nonstationary. In turn, contrasting views of ecosystem state and structure could arise depending on the temporal perspective of analysis. Further, assessment of multiple ecosystem components (e.g., biological indicators) may serve to identify different key drivers and connections. To explore how the timescale of analysis and data richness can influence the identification of driver-response relationships within a large, dynamic ecosystem, this study analyzed long-term (1969-2018) data from Lake Erie (USA-Canada). Data were compiled on multiple biological, physical, chemical, and socioeconomic components of the ecosystem to quantify trends and identify potential key drivers during multiple time intervals (20 to 50 years duration), using zooplankton, bird, and fish community metrics as indicators of ecosystem change. Concurrent temporal shifts of many variables occurred during the 1980s, but asynchronous dynamics were evident among indicator taxa. The strengths and rank orders of predictive drivers shifted among intervals and were sometimes taxon-specific. Drivers related to nutrient loading and lake trophic status were consistently strong predictors of temporal patterns for all indicators; however, within the longer intervals, measures of agricultural land use were the strongest predictors, whereas within shorter intervals, the stronger predictors were measures of tributary or in-lake nutrient concentrations. Physical drivers also tended to increase in predictive ability within shorter intervals. The results highlight how the time interval examined can filter influences of lower-frequency, slower drivers and higher-frequency, faster drivers. Understanding ecosystem change in support of ecosystem-based management requires consideration of both the temporal perspective of analysis and the chosen indicators, as both can influence which drivers are identified as most predictive of ecosystem trends at that timescale.

AB  - This paper analyses the impact of corruption on environmental sustainability in all 16 countries in the Southern region of Africa from 2010-2017. The paper uses two proxies of corruption: the Corruption Index and Corruption Ranking. Using two econometric methods, namely, the Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) Granger causality test and the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) techniques this study found largely congruent results on both causation and relationships, respectively. Firstly, the two indicators of corruption harmoniously show that corruption Granger causes the existing state of environmental sustainability in Southern African economies, and vice-versa. Moreover, in the short-run corruption was also found to worsen environmental sustainability for both regression models deployed using the two corruption indicators. In the long-term, the two measures of corruption conflicted with their findings. In this regard, though the relationship is contradicting in the long-run the corruption negative (becoming bad) effect of corruption ranking surpasses the corruption positive (becoming clean) effect of corruption index by nearly three times. This show how detrimental corruptible actions are to the natural environment. Overall, this paper consent to global reports explaining how Southern African environments are gradually deteriorating by putting corruption as one central practice causing extensive damage.

AB  - Need to Assess the Skill of Ecosystem Models
   Accelerated changes to global ecosystems call for holistic and integrated analyses of past, present and future states under various pressures to adequately understand current and projected future system states. Ecosystem models can inform management of human activities in a complex and changing environment, but are these models reliable? Ensuring that models are reliable for addressing management questions requires evaluating their skill in representing real-world processes and dynamics. Skill has been evaluated for just a limited set of some biophysical models. A range of skill assessment methods have been reviewed but skill assessment of full marine ecosystem models has not yet been attempted.
   Northeast US Atlantis Marine Ecosystem Model
   We assessed the skill of the Northeast U.S. (NEUS) Atlantis marine ecosystem model by comparing 10-year model forecasts with observed data. Model forecast performance was compared to that obtained from a 40-year hindcast. Multiple metrics (average absolute error, root mean squared error, modeling efficiency, and Spearman rank correlation), and a suite of time-series (species biomass, fisheries landings, and ecosystem indicators) were used to adequately measure model skill. Overall, the NEUS model performed above average and thus better than expected for the key species that had been the focus of the model tuning. Model forecast skill was comparable to the hindcast skill, showing that model performance does not degenerate in a 10-year forecast mode, an important characteristic for an end-to-end ecosystem model to be useful for strategic management purposes.
   Skill Assessment Is Both Possible and Advisable
   We identify best-practice approaches for end-to-end ecosystem model skill assessment that would improve both operational use of other ecosystem models and future model development. We show that it is possible to not only assess the skill of a complicated marine ecosystem model, but that it is necessary do so to instill confidence in model results and encourage their use for strategic management. Our methods are applicable to any type of predictive model, and should be considered for use in fields outside ecology (e.g. economics, climate change, and risk assessment).

AB  - This paper reviews New Zealand's National Rivers Water Quality Network (NRWQN), which is now in its third decade of monitoring. The NRWQN is noteworthy for being operationally stable throughout its history, and the resulting consistency is increasingly valuable for detecting water quality trends and for "anchoring" temporary special purpose monitoring campaigns. The NRWQN was carefully designed following considerable effort to learn from monitoring experiences elsewhere. Monthly visits are made to 77 sites (all near hydrometric stations) on 35 river systems that cumulatively drain about one half of the national landscape. "Core" (routinely measured) variables are: conductivity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, visual clarity, turbidity, colored dissolved organic matter, fecal indicator bacteria, and different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus (italics indicate field measurements). Associated benthic biological monitoring comprises monthly visual assessment of periphyton and annual sampling for macro-invertebrates. We overview the conception, design, initiation, and operational history of the NRWQN, and highlight the diverse applications of its datasets including numerous scientific applications, national-scale modeling of material fluxes, and state-of-environment reporting and practical water management at both regional and national scale. The qualified success of the NRWQN can probably be attributed to careful (and parsimonious) design and consistent operation.

AB  - Most major cities worldwide are affected Urban Heat Islands - a condition of relatively higher temperatures being observed in one area compared to another that can be caused by a decrease in greenspace. One of the major reasons attributed to this increase in the warming of urban landscapes is the decrease in green space. This concept has received a lot of attention due to the destruction of vegetation for urban development and has prompted long-term spatial-temporal studies of Urban Heat Islands to understanding local climates. The objective of this study is to use Landsat data to examine the temporal intensification of UHIs and their variability from 1984-2016 for the cities of Chicago and Minneapolis-St. Paul. Landsat L4-5 TM), L7 ETM+), OLI and TIRS from 1984 to 2016 was used to examine land surface temperature (LST). Firstly, we converted the digital number (DN) to spectral radiance (L) and to temperature in Kelvin and from kelvin to Celsius and a conversion from Radiance to Top of the Atmosphere Reflectance and estimation of land surface emissivity. Finally, LST was estimated and Urban Heat Island retrieval and anomalies computed to help examine inconsistencies in our data. Our analysis showed year-to-year fluctuations in surface temperature, intensification of UHIs for both metro areas. Using a defined deductive index to identify environmentally critical areas, estimates of UHIs based on LST showed that both metropolitan areas are UHIs with LST > mu + 0.5 x delta. Higher intensification values were observed in 1988 and 2010 for Chicago and 1984, 1999 and 2016 for Minneapolis-St. Paul from analysis. While both areas have the similar climatic conditions, our analysis show differences in UHIs intensification as observed in their urban growth patterns. Chicago experiences a higher UHI intensity compared to Minneapolis-St. Paul and this could be explained by higher number of tall buildings than Minneapolis-St. Paul.

AB  - NEOM is an under-development transnational city and economic zone spread over an area of 26,500 km(2) along the northern Red Sea coast of the Kingdom Saudi Arabia, bordering Jordan and Egypt. This study analyzes the meteorological parameters and air pollution dispersion over the NEOM region, based on observations and air quality dispersion modeling. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used to simulate the fate of air pollutants. To drive HYSPLIT, high-resolution (660 m) meteorological data were generated by downscaling the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecasting System analysis using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The air pollutant emission factors (AP-42) emission inventory, from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, was used to initialize HYSPLIT. A continuous three-year dataset simulated by WRF-HYSPLIT was then analyzed to understand the spatial and temporal distributions of air pollutant concentrations in the NEOM region.
   Strong land and sea breezes, resulting from differential heating, dominate the diurnal dispersion and distribution of pollutants in the NEOM region. The spatial distributions of the concentrations of different pollutants, which show maximum concentrations in the spring and winter because of lower boundary layer heights. The predicted maximum concentrations of NOx (similar to 40 mu g/m(3)), SO2 (similar to 25 mu g/m(3)), CO (similar to 10 mu g/m(3)), VOC (similar to 0.05 mu g/m(3)), and PM (similar to 4 mu g/m(3)) remain well within the national air quality standards recommended by the Saudi General Authority for Meteorology and Environment Protection and the Royal Commission. The estimated emissions analyzed by the model do not include background emissions (such as dust and vehicle pollution), as they are not available over this region, but only major industrial sources. Our analysis provides the information needed to understand the state of the air quality in the NEOM region, providing a fundamental contribution to the environmental impact assessment and planning in the region.

AB  - Maryland's Green Infrastructure (GI) is a network of large, intact natural areas (hubs), interconnected by linear swaths of riparian or upland vegetation (corridors). The GI serves significant ecological functions and provides the bulk of the state's natural support system. This study examined whether the GI as mapped does, in fact, identify Maryland's most ecologically valuable forested lands, using forest interior dwelling birds (hereafter called "forest birds") as bio-indicators. We conducted bird point counts within forest both inside and outside of hubs on Maryland's Eastern Shore. We also collected a wide variety of habitat data. We found that both the condition of a forest and its surrounding landscape influenced the bird communities. On average, forest bird richness was significantly higher within hubs; furthermore, almost all sites with at least five forest bird species present were in hubs. Forest bird richness and abundance were highest in undisturbed, mature broadleaf forest with wetlands and streams nearby. We detected a significant relationship between forest bird richness and the ecological score of a finer-scale landscape assessment, focused on "cells" of about 0.1 ha in size. This field study also validated the Rapid Field Assessment (RFA) protocol developed in 2001 to assess, on the ground, the relative condition of individual sites or properties within the GI. Forest bird richness and abundance were positively correlated with the RFA community scores. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining regional biological diversity by retaining large blocks of forest, especially mature forest containing streams and wetlands.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are typical toxic organic pollutants that can accumulate in sediments and may be toxic to aquatic organisms. In the present study, the contamination level, composition pattern, and sources of sixteen PAHs listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency were investigated in surface sediments and a sediment core from Daihai Lake, which is located in a typical semiarid area of Inner Mongolia, China, and the ecological risk of these PAHs was assessed. The results show that the total concentration of PAHs in the surface sediments ranged from 204.6 to 344.5 ng/g with an average value of 287.2 ng/g and that compared with other aquatic systems, the level of PAHs in the sediments from Daihai Lake was low. However, a general upward trend was observed for the concentrations of PAHs in the sediment core, which might be related to the increase in human activities in the area. Moreover, the PAH concentrations were significantly positively correlated with the total organic carbon (TOC) content in the sediments, and it is thus inferred that TOC regulates the distribution of PAHs in Daihai Lake. Three-ring and four-ring PAHs were found to be predominant in all the sediment samples, and phenanthrene (Phe) was the most abundant compound. According to the composition of PAHs and the anthracene (Ant)/(Ant+Phe) or fluoranthene (Flt)/(Flt+pyrene (Pyr)) ratios, the PAHs in Daihai Lake mainly originated from the combustion of domestic coal, grass, and wood, and petroleum cannot be ignored as a source considering the growth of industry. Risk assessment based on a comparison of PAH concentrations and the effect range low (ERL) and effect range median (ERM) values demonstrated that acenaphthene (Ace) at 11 sites and fluorene (Flu) at 7 sites had occasional adverse biological effects.

AB  - The use of microbial source tracking (MST) marker genes has grown in recent years due to the need to attribute point and non-point fecal contamination to specific sources. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is a modeling approach used to estimate health risks from exposure to feces-contaminated water and associated pathogens. A combination of these approaches [quantitative MST (qMST) and QMRA] can provide additional pathogen-related information for prioritizing and addressing health risks, compared to reliance on conventional fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). To inform expansion of this approach, a review of published qMST-QMRA studies was conducted to summarize the state of the science and to identify research needs. The reviewed studies primarily aimed to identify what levels of MST marker genes in hypothetical recreational waterbodies would exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) risk benchmarks for primary contact recreators. The QMRA models calculated relationships between MST marker gene(s) and reference pathogens based on published data in the literature. The development of a robust, accurate relationship was identified as an urgent research gap for qMST-QMRA. This metric requires additional knowledge to quantify the relationship between MST marker genes and the degree of variability in decay of pathogens as a dynamic function of environmental conditions and combinations of fecal sources at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Improved characterization of host shedding rates of host-associated microorganisms (i.e., MST marker genes), as well as fate and transport of these microorganisms and their nucleic acids, would facilitate expansion of this approach to other exposure pathways. Incorporation of information regarding the recovery efficiency, and host-specificity of MST marker genes into QMRA model parameters, and the sensitivity analysis, would greatly improve risk management and site-specific water monitoring criteria.

AB  - The pace of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change in the Great Lakes, particularly in urban and suburban areas, far exceeds that predicted by population growth alone. Thus, quantification of LULC and change through time may be a key factor in understanding the near-shore ecology of this system. The work described in this paper is part of a larger effort called the Great Lakes Environmental Indicators Project (GLEI), whose goal was to develop and refine environmental state indicators for the U.S. near-shore zone of the Great Lakes. Here we describe methodologies for using existing Landsat-based LULC maps to assemble consistent LULC data for the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes basin for 1992 and 2001, as well as summarizing salient LULC results. Between 1992 and 2001, 2.5% (798,755 ha) of the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes watershed experienced change. Transitions due to new construction included a 33.5% (158,858 ha) increase in low-intensity development and a 7.5% (140,240 ha) increase in road area. Agricultural and forest land each experienced similar to 2.3% (259,244 ha and 322,463 ha, respectively) decrease in area. Despite the large and enduring agricultural losses observed (2.23% of 1992 agricultural area), the rate of agricultural land decrease between 1992 and 2001 was less than that reported by the EPA (-9.8%) for the previous similar to 10-year period. Areas of new development were largely concentrated near coastal areas of the Great Lakes. Over 38% (6,014 ha) of wetland losses to development between 1992 and 2001 occurred within 10 km of a coastal area, and most of that area was within the nearest 1 kilometer. Clearly, these land use change data will be especially useful as quantifiable indicators of landscape change over time and aid in future land use planning decisions for protection of the integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem.

AB  - The size and functional capacity of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and associated organs vary in response to environmental cues. The GI tract and associated organs are also very metabolically active in animals. Hence, animals may reduce the size and function of their GI tract to conserve energy when deprived of food. The main aims of this study were to investigate how Silurus meridionalis regulates the function and structure of its GI tract and associated organs during starvation. Starvation induced a decrease in both maintenance metabolism (MO2rest, decreased by approximately 50%) and respiratory frequency (indicated by double side gill activity and notated as f(R), decreased by 29%). Lipase, trypsin and aminopeptidase-A showed a similar reduction in mass-specific activities during starvation, but pepsin and a-amylase did not. The starvation of experimental fish resulted in a significant reduction in body weight, the wet mass of the liver and the digestive-somatic system, the hepato-somatic index and the condition factor whereas the wet masses of the GI tract, pancreas, gall bladder and the relative intestinal length did not vary significantly during starvation. The reduction in liver wet mass was the main reason for the decrease in the wet mass of digestive-somatic system in this species. Only the mucosal area of the PI was affected significantly by starvation, decreasing by 34% at the end of the experiment. S. meridionalis displayed a decreasing intestinal mucosal area towards the distal intestine, and this gradient was not affected by starvation. The morphology and structure of both the GI tract and the liver were greatly down-regulated, as indicated by decreases in liver cell size, the mucosal thickness of the stomach and intestine, the density of goblet cells and microvilli surface area (MVSA), implying that food deprivation greatly impaired the digestive and absorptive functions of the GI tract in S. meridionalis. When deprived of food, S. meridionalis can endure harsh periods of starvation and adaptively down-regulate the function and structure of the digestive tract with physiological and biochemical strategies.

AB  - This study investigated the use of enzymes and histology as potential biomarkers in Sand and Blood Rivers in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Physico-chemical parameters were analyzed at sites S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 of the Sand River and sites B1 and B2 of the Blood River. Sites S1 and B1 were selected as the reference sites and located upstream of the Polokwane and Seshego wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) effluent discharge points, respectively. Water quality parameters assessed were water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, ammonia, nitrogen, phosphorus, and pH. Sites downstream the WWTPs recorded elevated levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and ammonia. DO, ammonia, nitrogen, and phosphorus were above the targeted water quality range (TWQR) for aquatic ecosystems. The Canadian council of ministers of the environment water quality index (CCME WQI) showed that the reference sites had good water condition while sites downstream (S2, B2, S3, and S4) had poor water condition. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme activity in the brain of Clarias gariepinus from sites downstream was lower than those from sites upstream of the effluent discharge points. The liver of Clarias gariepinus from sites downstream showed higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity compared to fish caught at the reference sites. Furthermore, Clarias gariepinus from sites downstream showed a number of histological alterations in gills and liver than fish from upstream. Histological alterations observed in gills included fusion of the secondary lamellae, hyperplasia of the interlamellar, epithelial lifting of secondary lamellae, and hyperplasia of the secondary lamellae. In the liver, histological alterations observed included melanomacrophage centers (MMCs), macrovesicular steatosis, sinusoid congested with kupffer cells, nuclei pleomorphism, and vacuolation. The gill and liver indices were significantly lower at the reference sites compared to sites downstream. Evidently, AChE, LDH, and gill and liver histology can be used as early warning signs of aquatic degradation in rivers that are recipients of poorly treated sewage effluent.

AB  - Over the past few years, a growing number of scholars have explored environmental deterioration and its connection to various indicators acting as proxies for growth and globalisation. Taking this into view, the current study examines the globalisation-environment nexus, using 66 major countries and administrative regions of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as case studies for 2000-2015. For this analysis, six biophysical resource usages were used within the safe operating space of the planetary boundary concept as proxies for the environmental state, along with the four main and five sub-indices of the Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF) globalisation index. Pearson's correlation, hierarchical clustering, redundancy analysis, linear regression, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) forecasting, etc. were used to infer existing trends, the interactions between the environment and globalisation, a projected future, and coupling with safe operating space aspects. The findings reveal the long-run asymmetric relationship of variables. Surpassing safe operating limits to achieve globalisation is the most prominent outcome. Economic, trade, and financial globalisation are more crucially related to biophysical resource usage. Nitrogen use and material footprint act as strong drivers for various indices of globalisation. At least 40% of countries are above the global average resource usage and 50% have crossed all of the safe operating limits. At the present rate, nearly 51% of countries might cross all their safe operating spaces in 2030. In a race to achieve more globalisation (0.95), more than 30% of countries might cross 5 of the 6 planetary boundaries. Land system change, the biogeochemical cycle, and climate change are impending as the most important domains to be focused on regarding globalisation. Based on the findings, it can be recommended that governments and policymakers devote more attention to reframing and redesigning globalisation to be more environment friendly to achieve long-term sustainable development goals.

AB  - In Finland, a recent ecological classification of surface waters showed that the rivers and coastal waters need attention to improve their ecological state. We combined eco-hydrological and empirical models to study chlorophyll-a concentration as an indicator of eutrophication in a small agricultural river. We used a modified story-and-simulation method to build three storylines for possible changes in future land use due to climate change and political change. The main objective in the first storyline is to stimulate economic activity but also to promote the sustainable and efficient use of resources. The second storyline is based on the high awareness but poor regulation of environmental protection, and the third is to survive as individual countries instead of being part of a unified Europe. We assumed trade of agricultural products to increase to countries outside Europe. We found that chlorophyll-a concentration in the river depended on total phosphorus concentration. In addition, there was a positive synergistic interaction between total phosphorus and water temperature. In future storylines, chlorophyll-a concentration increased due to land use and climate change. Climate change mainly had an indirect influence via increasing nutrient losses from intensified agriculture. We found that well-designed agri-environmental measures had the potential to decrease nutrient loading from fields, as long as the predicted increase in temperature remained under 2 degrees C. However, we were not able to achieve the nutrient reduction stated in current water protection targets. In addition, the ecological status of the river deteriorated. The influence of temperature on chlorophyll-a growth indicates that novel measures for shading rivers to decrease water temperature may be needed in the future. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The carbon footprint (CF), the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted during a product's lifecycle, was evaluated as an indicator of the wider environmental impacts of meat production using existing life cycle assessments of different types of meat (pork, chicken and beef). The CF generally acts as an indicator of acidification and eutrophication potential, since more efficient use of nitrogen leads to less eutrophying and acidifying substances being released to the environment and to lower GHG emissions in nitrous oxide form. GHG mitigation strategies based on more efficient use of feed can therefore also lead to decreased acidification and eutrophication potential. Decreased GHG emissions due to increased productivity mean less land is required for feed production, so CF can act as a proxy for land use. For the impact category primary energy use, apparent conflicts with CF were identified. Pasture-based beef production can be either very energy-efficient or energy-demanding, but both forms produce high CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation. For monogastric animal production, CF can function as an indicator of primary energy use, as both energy use and GHG emissions originate mainly from feed production. It is unclear how the biodiversity impact category correlates to CF. More intensive production can allow more land to be left in its natural state, but can involve increased use of pesticides and fertilisers and monocropping locally, threatening biodiversity. Using CF as an indicator of the environmental impact of meat can generate conflicts with other environmental categories in some cases. However, the risk of damaging other environmental areas when acting on CF must be weighed against the risk of further neglecting to act on global warming by failing to exploit the current market momentum of carbon footprinting.

AB  - Biodiversity indicators are essential for monitoring the impacts of pressures on the state of nature, determining the effectiveness of policy responses, and tracking progress towards biodiversity targets and sustainable development goals. Indicators based on trends in the abundance of birds are widely used for these purposes in Europe and have been identified as priorities for development elsewhere. To facilitate this we established bird population monitoring schemes in three African countries, based on citizen science approaches used in Europe, aiming to monitor population trends in common and widespread species. We recorded > 500 bird species from c. 450 2-km transects in Botswana, > 750 species from c. 120 transects in Uganda, and > 630 species from c. 90 transects in Kenya. Provisional Wild Bird Indices indicate a strong increase in bird populations in Botswana and a small decrease in Uganda. We also provide comparisons between trends of habitat generalists and specialists, of birds within and outside protected areas, and between Afro-Palearctic migrants and resident birds. Challenges encountered included recruiting, training and retaining volunteer surveyors, and securing long-term funding. However, we show that with technical support and modest investment (c. USD 30,000 per scheme per year), meaningful biodiversity indicators can be generated and used in African countries. Sustained resourcing for the existing schemes, and replication elsewhere, would be a cost-effective way to improve our understanding of biodiversity trends globally, and measure progress towards environmental goals.

AB  - Fires that burn through forests cause changes in wood anatomy and growth that can be used to reconstruct fire histories. Fire is important in Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl. (coast redwood) forests, but fire histories are limited due to difficulties crossdating annual rings of this species. Here we investigated three fires (1985, 1999, 2008) in two old-growth forests (Montgomery Woods State Natural Reserve and Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve, California, USA) to quantify these responses via crossdated increment cores from lower trunks of 53 trees, including 10 that were climbed and cored at 10 m height intervals. Redwoods frequently responded to fire by producing anomalous growth during the fire year; 100 of 240 lower trunk cores recorded at least one anatomical indicator (i.e., intra-annual density fluctuation, faint latewood, resin, or scar). Following fire, radial growth decreased by 29% to 43% compared to the fire year. After accounting for climatic influences, radial growth was 27% to 32% lower than expected in the post-fire year and declined to as low as 46% after three years. Growth suppression persisted for up to seven years after fire, followed by up to 40% higher than expected radial growth. Several of the climbed trees expressed disruption of incremental growth along the height gradient following fire. The 1985 event consistently generated stronger growth and anatomical responses than the 1999 and 2008 events, and showed a co-occurrence between faint latewood during the fire year and subsequent narrow or missing rings. We used post-fire low growth relative to drought combined with anatomical indicators to detect past fires, identifying five additional events at Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve dating back to 1634. Although other disturbances could have initiated these responses, our detection method enhances current capabilities for the spatiotemporal resolution of redwood fire histories via non-scar indicators on increment cores from living redwoods.

AB  - Human activity has an inevitable impact on the environment and this is generally negative. It is undeniable that society is increasingly aware of the state of the surrounding environment, since it forms the basis for all human activity. There has therefore been a proliferation of environmental impact assessment (EIA) tools which enable this impact on the environment to be measured. The EIA process involves an enormous amount of quantitative and qualitative information which traditional EIA methods are unable to handle properly. This article presents a new fuzzy EIA model which perfectly incorporates both qualitative and quantitative information, using in its formulation the fuzzy set theory proposed by Zadeh. We also present AIEIA, an ingenious software program which implements this fuzzy methodology by providing an efficient tool for the prevention of environmental impacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban development is a well-known stressor for stream ecosystems, presenting a challenge to managers tasked with mitigating its effects. For the past 20 y, streamflow, water quality, geomorphology, and benthic communities were monitored in 5 watersheds in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. This study presents a synthesis of multiple studies of monitoring efforts in the study area and new analysis of more recent monitoring data to document the primary lessons learned from monitoring. The monitored watersheds include a forested control, an urban control with centralized stormwater management, and 3 suburban treatment watersheds featuring low-impact development and a high density of infiltration-focused stormwater facilities distributed across the watershed. Treatment watersheds were monitored before development, during construction, and after development. Monitoring was initiated to inform adaptive management of stormwater and impervious cover limits within the study area, with a focus on the impacts of distributed stormwater management. Results from our synthesis indicate that distributed stormwater management is advantageous compared with centralized stormwater management in numerous ways. Hydrologic benefits were greater with distributed stormwater infrastructure, demonstrating the ability to mitigate runoff volumes and peak flows and, for small storms, replicate predevelopment conditions. Baseflow temporarily increased during the construction phase in the treatment watersheds. Water-quality benefits were mixed, with declines in baseflow nitrate concentrations but limited changes to nitrate export and increases in specific conductance after development. Substantial topographic changes occurred during construction in the treatment watersheds, including changes within the riparian zone, despite riparian buffer protections. Ecological monitoring indicated that even though index of biotic integrity scores rebounded in some cases, sensitive benthic macroinvertebrate families did not fully recover in the treatment watersheds. Lessons learned from this synthesis highlight the importance of tracking multiple indicators of stream health and considering past land use and that more stormwater facilities distributed across the watershed is beneficial but cannot mitigate the effects of all urban stressors on aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - The Lefkada-Preveza coastal zone, NW Greece, is characterised by an active barrier system and related extensive beachrock sequences. Besides the gradual coastal processes of longshore drift and spit evolution, the presence of active tectonics and the occurrence of tsunamis have been documented in previous studies and are part of the coastal geomorphological system. In this paper, we present the results of detailed multiproxy sedimentological and geomorphological investigations carried out along the northern part of the barrier system and in back-beach positions. Our findings suggest that extreme wave events contributed to coastal and environmental changes and involved temporary breakdown of the barrier system. Sedimentary findings suggest that one generation of event deposits may be related to the 365 AD Crete earthquake and associated tsunami. According to our results, the Lefkada coastal system formed by the interaction of both long-term, gradual and sudden, impulsive littoral geomorphodynamics. Extreme wave events are assumed to have played a significant role in the evolution of the present coastline, acting as recurrent impulsive disturbances of the coastal system. Subsequently, the onset of long-term gradual coastal processes, such as longshore drift, re-established a state of natural coastal balance by re-arranging the coastal sediments.

AB  - Performance assessment in holistic approaches such as integrated natural resource management has to deal with a complex set of interacting and self-organizing natural and human systems and agents, all pursuing their own "interests" while also contributing to the development of the total system. Performance indicators must therefore reflect the viability of essential component systems as well as their contributions to the viability and performance of other component systems and the total system under study. A systems-based derivation of a comprehensive set of performance indicators first requires the identification of essential component systems, their mutual (often hierarchical or reciprocal) relationships, and their contributions to the performance of other component systems and the total system. The second step consists of identifying the indicators that represent the viability states of the component systems and the contributions of these component systems to the performance of the total system. The search for performance indicators is guided by the realization that essential interests (orientations or orientors) of systems and actors are shaped by both their characteristic functions and the fundamental and general properties of their system environments (e.g., normal environmental state, scarcity of resources, variety, variability, change, other coexisting systems). To be viable, a system must devote an essential minimum amount of attention to satisfying the "basic orientors" that respond to the properties of its environment. This fact can be used to define comprehensive and system-specific sets of performance indicators that reflect all important concerns. Often, qualitative indicators and the study of qualitative systems are sufficient for reliable performance assessments. However, this approach can also be formalized for quantitative computer-assisted assessment. Examples are presented of indicator sets for the sustainable development of regions, including the computer-based, time-dependent assessment of system performance using time-series data. Because of its systems-theoretical foundation, this approach avoids the problems of incompleteness and double-counting common in ad hoc methods of indicator selection.

AB  - Environmental footprints are of importance for identifying the linkages between human and natural systems. This paper defines a framework for an environmental footprint family that is based on nine major biophysical processes and is linked to the planetary boundaries. Bibliometrics was used to analyze the volume, journals, categories, countries, keywords, priority issues and research prospects of each of the individual footprints. Results show that the total amount of footprint research has been increasing with the United States and China being the regions of highest research intensity based on total publications and frequency of cooperation. Subject category and keyword co-occurrence analyses showed that environmental footprints are widely used as an assessment methodology in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals concerning resource use and pollutant emissions. The most common research topics were energy and supply chain-related carbon footprints, agricultural-related greenhouse gas emissions abatement, volumetric and impact-oriented water footprints, and infrastructure related environmental footprints. Further research is needed to better align impact-oriented footprints that include regional differentiation with the planetary-scale boundaries. In addition, the earth system is complex and many of the planetary boundaries are inter-related and feedbacks need further definition and quantification. These findings provide an overview of the current state of environmental footprint research which can give direction to future studies.

AB  - Fish are subject to constantly changing environmental conditions and food availability, factors that may impact their response to endocrine disruptors (EDs). This may, in part, explain outcome discrepancies between field studies and laboratory exposures to EDs. This study assessed whether standard laboratory conditions for fish exposures adequately represent effects of ED exposure at two environmentally realistic temperatures. The impact of temperature and food availability on male fathead minnow response to estrone (E1) exposure was studied in two experiments (3 x 2 x 2 factorial design) with three E1 concentrations (range 0-135 ng/L); two temperatures (18 degrees C and 26 degrees C, the latter the prescribed laboratory temperature), and two feeding treatments (full fed vs. 25% of full fed) in a 21-day flow-through system. Morphometric endpoints [including body condition factor, somatic index of gonad (GSI) and liver (HSI), and secondary sex characteristics (SSC)], blood parameters [hematocrit (HCT), blood glucose, cortisol, and vitellogenin (VTG) concentrations], and histology of liver and testis were determined on day 22. High E1 consistently increased VTG, though interactions among E1, temperature and/or food on liver weight, HSI, and HCT were inconsistent between experiments. High temperature impacted the greatest number of parameters, independent of E1 treatment. Three sex-linked parameters were lower at high temperature (testis weight, GSI and VTG), and in Exp. 2SSC and gonad maturity rating were lower. At 26 degrees C, in Exp. 1 HSI and HCT decreased, and in Exp. 2 length, body and liver weight, and body condition factor were lower. Food restriction decreased GSI in Exp. 1, and blood glucose and liver weight in Exp. 2. At 26 degrees C several parameters were altered independent of E1 exposure, including three out of four measurements of sperm differentiation. Concordance between laboratory and field investigations of the biological effects of EDs may improve if environmentally-relevant exposure conditions, especially temperature, are employed.

AB  - Urbanization and agricultural practices can lead to alterations in stream habitat quality. However, there have been few attempts to understand if these alterations influence the health and condition of fish, or their ability to respond to multiple stressors. This study examines a sentinel fish in streams adjacent to different types of land-use practices and how they respond to an experimental stressor. Creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) from replicate agricultural, urban, and reference streams were subjected to an experimental manipulation of cortisol, the primary stress hormone in fish. A single intraperitoneal injection raised circulating plasma cortisol for similar to 3 days, mimicking the physiological effects of a prolonged stressor. We compared the survival, health, and condition of cortisol-treated, sham-treated, and control fish across the different land-use types. While marginally non-significant (P = 0.06), cortisol-treated fish displayed an similar to 50% increase in mortality in streams adjacent to agricultural areas. We did not observe differences in blood glucose, condition factor, splenic index, and gonadosomatic index, or parasite burden among the treatment groups or relative to land-use type. However, within the agricultural watersheds, the hepatosomatic index value of fish receiving a sham treatment was similar to 20% greater than fish in the control treatment, a significant result that appears to be spurious given that a similar effects was not observed in other land-use types. Overall, these results suggest that in the wild, there are apparently compensatory mechanisms that enable creek chub to persist despite being exposed to a significant challenge with little evidence that the outcome is modulated by variation in habitat quality, at least among the three types of sites (i.e., urban, agricultural, and reference) studied here. Nonetheless, we encourage additional field-based studies with larger sample sizes or better recapture rates to improve statistical power and provide more clarity on how variation in habitat quality influences how fish respond to other challenges.

AB  - Tree-related microhabitats (hereafter TreMs) are structures occurring on trees, such as rot holes, cavities, large nests, mould, fruiting bodies and mycelia of decomposer fungi. TreMs have been widely recognized as important substrates and structures useful for biodiversity conservation in forest ecosystems, and they can be used as indicators for describing and monitoring forest naturalness. However, most studies on the occurrence of TreMs have been mainly done in forest ecosystems of Central Europe, while less research has been conducted in Mediterranean mountain forests. In this study, we investigated the diversity and abundance of 23 types of TreMs on living trees and on deadwood in seven Mediterranean mountains unmanaged forests located in the Apennines (Italy). The abundance of TreMs was evaluated by counting the number of TreMs per tree, while the diversity of TreMs was evaluated by means of the Shannon-Wiener index. We focused on the relationships between diversity and abundance of TreMs, and tree size ( e.g., diameter, height, volume), and the time since the last harvest. Among the investigated stands, 2612 living trees, 457 standing dead trees and snags, and 1247 lying deadwood pieces were analysed. For living trees, a generalized linear mixed model was applied to test the effect of several variables on the abundance of TreMs per tree. Diameter at breast height (DBH) of tree stems influenced the abundance and diversity of TreMs. The time since the last harvest also significantly affected the probability that TreMs could be formed in a long-term perspective. The interaction of the predictors "DBH2" and "Years since the last harvest" generated a better model than the one in which the two variables were kept separate. Indeed, these two factors together would better represent the transition of a previously managed forest to a more natural state over time. This study might provide useful information to land managers committed to forestry practices towards sustainable management and biodiversity conservation, especially referring to survey and inventory of forests of high nature value.

AB  - We quantified the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on the structure and biodiversity of boreal forests on acidic soils and created a statistically supported rational set of indicators to monitor the stand onaturalnesso. For that, we surveyed various traits of tree layer, understory, herb layer, forest floor and several widely accepted biodiversity epiphytic indicators in 252 old-aged boreal stands in Estonia, mostly dominated by Scots pine or Norway spruce. Multifactorial general linear model analyses showed that many forest characteristics and potential indicators were confounded by the gradient of soil productivity (reflected by the forest site type), local biogeographic gradients and also by stand age. Considering confounding effects, boreal forests in a near-natural state have more large-diameter trees (diameter at breast height 40 cm) and larger variety of diameter classes, higher proportion of spruce or deciduous trees, a larger amount of coarse woody debris in various stages, a more closed tree canopy and denser understory than managed mature forests. By increasing light availability above the field layer, forest management indirectly increases the coverage of herbs and lichens on the forest floor but reduces the alpha- and beta-diversity of herbs and the proportion of graminoids. Human disturbances reduce the relative incidence of many commonly accepted biodiversity indicators such as indicator lichens, woodpeckers, wood-dwelling insects or fungi on trees. The test for the predictive power of characteristics reacting on disturbance revealed that only a fraction of them appeared to be included in a diagnostic easy-to-apply set of indicators to assess the nature quality of boreal forest: the amount of dead wood, the proportion of deciduous trees, the presence of specially shaped trees and woodpeckers and, as an indicator of disturbances, the forest herb Melampyrum pratensis. Many of these indicators have already been implemented in practice.

The study was conducted in the following areas: 1) an analysis of the preconditions for transforming the system of social and labour relations in companies associated with crisis phenomena in their economy, 2) assessment of the factors that shape social and labour relations in companies with crisis economies, 3) a study of employee response to crisis situations based on the selected parameters, 4) implementation of a strategy for managing employee behaviour in a crisis economy. The mechanism of management of social and labour relations in the company, which is universal from the point of view of the basic problems and various functional characteristics, has been developed. The mechanism allows to identify crisis processes for regulating social and labour relations based on a system of interrelated indicators and to assess the existing disparities in social and labour relations. It is substantiated that the relations in the corporate whole together with other factors form the social-psychological climate of the working environment, the state of which largely determines the effectiveness of the enterprise. Practical recommendations have been given as for propensity of employees to conflict behaviour, social-psychological climate and emotional pressure on employees in team within the company.

AB  - There is a contaminant gradient in Lake Mead National Recreation Area (LMNRA) that is partly driven by municipal and industrial runoff and wastewater inputs via Las Vegas Wash (LVW). Adult male common carp (Cyprinus carpio; 10 fish/site) were collected from LVW, Las Vegas Bay (receiving LVW flow), Overton Arm (OA, upstream reference), and Willow Beach (WB, downstream) in March 2008. Discriminant function analysis was used to describe differences in metal concentrations and biological condition of fish collected from the four study sites, and canonical correlation analysis was used to evaluate the association between metal and biological traits. Metal concentrations were determined in whole-body extracts. Of 63 metals screened, those initially used in the statistical analysis were Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Fe, Hg, Pb, Se, Zn. Biological variables analyzed included total length (TL), Fulton's condition factor, gonadosomatic index (CSI), hematocrit (Hct), and plasma estradiol-17 beta and 11-ketotestosterone (11kt) concentrations. Analysis of metal composition and biological condition both yielded strong discrimination of fish by site (respective canonical model, p<0.0001). Compared to OA, pairwise Mahalanobis distances between group means were WB<LVB<LVW for metal concentrations and LVB<WB<LVW for biological traits. Respective primary drivers for these separations were Ag, As, Ba, Hg, Pb, Se and Zn; and TL, GSI, 11kt, and Hct. Canonical correlation analysis using the latter variable sets showed they are significantly associated (p<0.0003); with As, Ba. Hg, and Zn, and TL, 11kt, and Hct being the primary contributors to the association. In conclusion, male carp collected along a contaminant gradient in LMNRA have distinct, collection site-dependent metal and morpho-physiological profiles that are significantly associated with each other. These associations suggest that fish health and reproductive condition (as measured by the biological variables evaluated in this study) are influenced by levels of certain metals in the Lake Mead environment.

AB  - Baselines are one of the most ubiquitous, yet unrecognized, components of contemporary environmental regulation. Usually understood as the 'natural' or 'historical' state of a species population, ecosystem, or climatic zone, baselines become reified through regulatory processes, management schemes, and consultant reports that attempt to assess and/or mitigate the effects of environmental change. Though the natural sciences have long recognized the existence of a 'shifting baseline syndrome', the environmental social sciences and humanities have thus far paid scant attention to the concrete baselining practices that assemble data, technologies, and affect to produce ecological benchmarks for regulatory science, policy, and law. This special issue will serve as a gateway forum for inquiry about baselines in the environmental social sciences, environmental humanities, and science and technology studies. Drawing on case studies, the essays present baselining as an uneven process shaped by tensions between nostalgia and novelty, between democracy and expertise, and between the agencies of human and non-human actors operating at multiple geographic and temporal scales. Besides producing theoretically informed and empirically rich case studies, the authors suggest alternative pathways for conceptualizing and utilizing baselines in the Anthropocene.

AB  - To estimate the gross CO2 flux (F-CO2) of deciduous coniferous forest from canopy spectral reflectance, we introduced spectral vegetation indices (VIs) into a light use efficiency (LUE) model of mature Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi) forest. We measured the eddy covariance CO2 flux and spectral reflectance of larch canopy at half-hourly intervals during one growing season, and investigated the relationships between the parameters of the LUE model (FAPAR, epsilon) and 3 types of VIs (NDVI, PRI, EVI) in both clear sky and cloudy conditions.
   FAPAR (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) had a positive linear relationship with both NDVI (non-nalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), and the sky condition had little effect on the relationships. The relative RMSE (root mean square error) of the APAR (absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) based on the incoming PAR and estimated FAPAR from a linear function of NDVI was less than 10.5%, irrespective of sky condition.
   Half-hourly values of epsilon (conversion efficiency of absorbed energy) showed both seasonal variation related to leaf phenology and short-term variation related to light intensity due to varied sun position and sky condition. Both EVI and PRI (photochemical reflectance index) were significantly correlated with epsilon, EVI showed a positive linear relationship with epsilon as a result of their similar seasonal variation. However, since EVI did not detect short-term variation of epsilon, their relationship differed among sky conditions. On the other hand, although PRI could trace the shortterm variation of epsilon in green needles, the relationship became non-linear due to drastic reduction of PRI in the senescent needles.
   EVI/(PRI/PRImin), a combined index based on a 6-day moving minimum value of PRI (PRImin), showed a linear relationship with half-hourly values of epsilon throughout the seasons irrespective of sky condition. This index allow us to estimate epsilon in all sky conditions with a smaller error (rRMSE = 35.2%) than using EVI or PRI alone (38.7%-48.7%). Consequently, this combined index-derived epsilon and NDVI-based FAPAR gave a low estimation error of F-CO2, (rRMSE = 36.4%, RMSE = 8.3 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Although there are still various issues to resolve, including adaptive limit and combination of vegetation index type, we conclude that the combination of PRI and EVI increased the accuracy of estimation Of CO2 uptake in deciduous forest even though sky conditions varied.

AB  - Incomplete understanding of the contributions of dispersants and engineered nanoparticles/materials (ENM) agglomeration state to biological outcomes presents an obstacle for toxicological studies. Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is often regarded as the primary indicator of ENM bioactivity and toxicity, it remains unclear whether ENM produce ROS or whether ROS is an outcome of ENM-induced cell injury. Phagolysosomal disruption and cathepsin B release also promote bioactivity through inflammasome activation. Therefore, specific particle parameters, i.e. preexposure dispersion status and particle surface area, of two ENM (NiO and CeO2) were used to evaluate the role of ROS generation and cathepsin B release during ENM-induced toxicity. Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 0, 20, 40, or 80 mg of poorly or well-dispersed NiO-NP or CeO2-NP in four types of dispersion media. At 1- and 7-day postexposure, lung lavage fluid was collected to assess inflammation, cytotoxicity, and inflammasome activation. Results showed that preexposure dispersion status correlated with postexposure pulmonary bioactivity. The differences in bioactivity of NiO-NP and CeO2-NP are likely due to NiO-NP facilitating the release of cathepsin B and in turn inflammasome activation generating proinflammatory cytokines. Further, both metal oxides acted as free radical scavengers. Depending on the pH, CeO2-NP acted as a free radical scavenger in an acidic environment (an environment mimicking the lysosome) while the NiO-NP acted as a scavenger in a physiological pH (an environment that mimics the cytosol of the cell). Therefore, results from this study suggest that ENM-induced ROS is not likely a mechanism of inflammasome activation.

AB  - The silver catfish, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus (Lacepede: 1803) is a highly valued food-fish included among the dominant commercial catches exploited in major rivers of Africa. To provide useful biological data for management, samples were collected monthly between January (2005) and December (2007) in three zones: 1: Upper Cross River (grassland), II: Middle Cross River (mixed forest and grassland), and III: Lower Cross River (rainforest)] along 200 km length of the Cross River, Nigeria. Data from 1248 specimens were processed using: allometric coefficient (b), gonado-somatic index, Fulton's condition factor and diversity indices. Male dominance was observed in all populations; C. nigrodigitatus reached maturity at 11.5cm (male) and 16.7cm (female) total length. Gonado-somatic index was higher for females with a peak in the early rains. The breeding period was between April and August with mean fecundity ranging between 4522 +/- 1924 eggs and 20321 +/- 5543 eggs. This was directly related to total length and weight by the regression models: F = 2365.88 + 560.22 log L and F = 5025.81 + 56.34 log W respectively. Exponential equations for length-weight relationships were Wt=-1.997 Lt(2.206) (Zone I), W =-2.831 Lt(3.040) (Zone II) and Wt=-2.245 Lt(2.995) (Zone III). The mean allometric coefficient (b) showed significant departure from cubic value (negative allometry) for Zone I while Zones II and III showed no difference, indicating isometry. Dominant items in the diet were fish and fish parts constituting 21.6% with Food Richness and Gut Repletion Index of 18 and 100% respectively, in all zones. Diet Breadth of 0.802 (Zone I), 0.922 (Zone II) and 0.910 (Zone III) indicate a high trophic flexibility that enables switching from one diet to another according to availability. Mean condition factor for males varied from 0.718 +/- 0.117 minimum in Zone I to 0.996 +/- 0.062 maximum in Zone III. Forest inland wetlands (Zone II and III) of Cross River provided better condition for C. nigrodigitatus. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (4): 1785-1799. Epub 2008 December 12.

AB  - Behavioral thermoregulation is an efficient mechanism to buffer the physiological effects of climate change. Thermal ecology studies have traditionally tested how thermal constraints shape thermoregulatory behaviors without accounting for the potential major effects of landscape structure and water availability. Thus, we lack a general understanding of the multifactorial determinants of thermoregulatory behaviors in natural populations. In this study, we quantified the relative contribution of elevation, thermal gradient, moisture gradient, and landscape structure in explaining geographic variation in thermoregulation strategies of a terrestrial ectotherm species. We measured field-active body temperature, thermal preferences, and operative environmental temperatures to calculate thermoregulation indices, including thermal quality of the habitat and thermoregulation efficiency for a very large sample of common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) from 21 populations over 3 yr across the Massif Central mountain range in France. We used an information-theoretic approach to compare eight a priori thermo-hydroregulation hypotheses predicting how behavioral thermoregulation should respond to environmental conditions. Environmental characteristics exerted little influence on thermal preference with the exception that females from habitats with permanent access to water had lower thermal preferences. Field body temperatures and accuracy of thermoregulation were best predicted by the interaction between air temperature and a moisture index. In mesic environments, field body temperature and thermoregulation accuracy increased with air temperature, but they decreased in drier habitats. Thermoregulation efficiency (difference between thermoregulation inaccuracy and the thermal quality of the habitat) was maximized in cooler and more humid environments and was mostly influenced by the thermal quality of the habitat. Our study highlights complex patterns of variation in thermoregulation strategies, which are mostly explained by the interaction between temperature and water availability, independent of the elevation gradient or thermal heterogeneity. Although changes in landscape structure were expected to be the main driver of extinction rate of temperate zone ectotherms with ongoing global change, we conclude that changes in water availability coupled with rising temperatures might have a drastic impact on the population dynamics of some ectotherm species.

AB  - Species identification of many rotifers is very difficult due to e.g. body contraction in the preserved material. In the case of bdelloids, it is even more problematic as they can only be determined when alive. Therefore, a necessity for developing a method of using the class Bdelloidea for environmental analyses arose, so I examined them as a whole group. This is an approach that reduces extensive, time-consuming and particularly difficult taxonomic identification of certain species. The occurrence of bdelloids against various rotifer community indices in a mosaic of habitats of 220 small water bodies in an agricultural landscape was subjected to both abiotic and biotic factors so as to measure the extent of their reaction and the possibility of their usage in the assessment of environmental conditions. Despite their preference for forest ponds, bdelloids were also a very common and abundant element of field aquatic ecosystems. Due to their specific sensitivity bdelloids serve as a valuable ecological indicator which can be used for environmental assessment of habitat quality in small water bodies in the agricultural landscape and also for monitoring appropriate conservation actions for ponds. Bdelloids are typically macrophyte-associated organisms, selectively choosing Phragmites stands, a transitional area between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Their response to the environment was similar to the littoral fraction and rotifer diversity indices, which were found to be in opposition to the eutrophic community associated with the open water area in large-surfaced fish ponds. Moreover, the increase in bdelloids in ponds of low human impact supports their potential for the diagnosis of natural ponds of low transformation level. Their preference towards ponds with an increasing layer of nymphaeids and pleustophytes also supports their role in diagnosing good quality waters as floating-leaved macrophytes are known to improve water quality. It is recommended that bdelloids as a group can be used for the determination of the level of heterogeneity (connected with macrophyte occurrence) and the level of shade (generated by macrophyte cover) as well as the water quality state of small water bodies.

AB  - Sustainability assessment is increasingly being viewed as an important tool to aid in the shift towards sustainable urban ecosystems. An urban ecosystem is a dynamic system and requires regular monitoring and assessment through a set of relevant indicators. An indicator is a parameter which provides information about the state of the environment by producing a quantitative value. Indicator-based sustainability assessment needs to be considered on all spatial scales to provide efficient information of urban ecosystem sustainability. The detailed data is necessary to assess environmental change in urban ecosystems at local scale and easily transfer this information to the national and global scales. This paper proposes a set of key micro-level urban ecosystem indicators for monitoring the sustainability of residential developments. The proposed indicator framework measures the sustainability performance of urban ecosystem in 3 main categories including: natural environment, built environment, and socio-economic environment which are made up of 9 sub-categories, consisting of 23 indicators. This paper also describes theoretical foundations for the selection of each indicator with reference to the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Resource-based cities (RBCs) have become the region with strong land use change (LUC) due to the land destruction resulted from the exploitation of resources. Meanwhile, with the development of urbanization and industrialization, serious ecological environment problems generally exist in this area. Analyzing the relationship between land use and ecological vulnerability (EV) has become an important research topic for the sustainable development of the ecological environment in RBCs. In this study, a typical RBC, Datong city in Shanxi province of China, was selected to conduct the EV evaluation using the genetic projection pursuit model and analyze land use pattern change from 2000 to 2018. Moreover, the relationships between LUC and EV were discussed from two aspects: the EV of land use types and the correlation between LUC and EV. From 2000 to 2018, the land use of Datong city has changed significantly, mainly due to the decrease of cultivated land and grass land, as well as the increase of forest land, construction land, and mining land. The EV of Datong was relatively high in the west and relatively low in the east, and the quality of ecological environment was gradually improved. The ecological vulnerability synthetic index (EVSI) was different among land use types, of which the EVSI of mining land and forest land was particularly prominent. EV was affected by many factors, among which LUC was clear. The increase of mining land, construction land, unused land and forest land area can increase the EV of Datong city, while the increase of cultivated land, grass land and water body area can reduce the EV. Local governments should adopt different management measures to reduce regional EV, including reclaiming the abandoned construction land and mining land, limiting the scope of coal mining area, carrying out the ecological agricultural construction, focusing on the soil and water conditions of forest land, implementing ecological protection planning and focusing on controlling severely vulnerable areas.

AB  - The recent rapid decline in Arctic sea ice cover has increased the need to improve the accuracy of the sea ice component in climate models and to provide detailed long-term sea ice concentration records, which are only available via proxy data. Recently, the highly branched isoprenoid IP25, identified in marine sediments underlying seasonal sea ice, has emerged as a potential sea ice specific proxy for past sea ice cover. We tested the reliability of this biomarker as a sea ice proxy against observational sea ice data (sea ice concentrations from the global HadISST1 database) and against a more established sea ice proxy (sea ice diatom abundance in sediments) in the South-West (SW) Labrador Sea. Furthermore, our study location at the southern margin of Arctic sea ice drift provided a new environmental setting in which to further test the novel PIP25 index. Our two study sites are located North-East (NE) and South-East (SE) of Newfoundland where box cores covering the last ca 100-150 years were collected. IP25 concentrations are nearly an order of magnitude higher and sea ice diatoms more abundant in sediments from NE of Newfoundland, where sea ice prevails 2-4 months per year compared to the sediments SE of Newfoundland, where conditions are generally ice-free year round. The IP25 fluxes NE of Newfoundland agree well with multi-decadal North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) trends in the study area, which in previous studies have been shown to affect the climatic and sea ice conditions in the region. When assessed against observational sea ice data, IP25 appears to be a more sensitive indicator of sea ice variability in this setting compared to sea ice diatoms and proved to be a robust and reliable proxy for reconstructing low-frequency variability in past sea ice concentrations. The PIP25 index results clearly differ from the observed sea ice data underlining that caution needs to be exercised when using the index in different environmental settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The deciduous semi-woody shrub Perovskia atriplicifolia Benth. (Lamiaceae) is native in the rocky areas of Pakistan, Afganistan, Iran, and Tibet and it is mainly known for the culinary, flavoring and ornamental qualities. The essential oils have pharmacological effects based on the antimicrobial and antimutagenic activity of their constituents. The plant is also cultivated in Europe and recently it was experimentally introduced in Romania, in order to exploit its medicinal valences (based on aerosol properties), the potential as remediative plant and its decorative traits. In this context, a deeper knowledge of the morphology and phytochemical profile of this newly cultivated plant in Romania becomes necessary, knowing that, besides the genetic factors, the environmental conditions and the geographical variation are factors highly influencing the plant morphological and biochemical phenotype. The objective of this approach is, therefore, to analyze some morphological traits and the distribution rate of the volatile oil producing secretory trichomes on the surface of the aerial vegetative organs (stems and leaves) and reproductive organs (flowers) and to establish the chemical phenotype by analyzing the composition of the volatile oils produced by these organs in anthesis stage. The micromorphological investigations have been carried out using a surface electron microscopy, at a TESCAN VEGA II SBH microscope. The volatile oils extraction was conducted using a Clevenger hydrodistillation system, and the component separation was performed by gas chromatography, with a 6890 Agilent GC/MS. The volatile compound identification was made using the NIST spectral bank and Kovats indexes. In our biological material, grown in the pedoclimatic conditions of Moldova region, the secretory trichomes are multicellular structures, with a specific conformation, in relation to the analyzed plant part. The pattern of volatile oils is variable and the number of constituents depends on the investigated organ. The main compounds of the volatile oil from P. atriplicifolia are the monoteipenes which confer to this plant the role in improving of air quality.

AB  - The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 sensors (AMSR) have provided multifrequency microwave measurements of the global terrestrial water cycle since 2002. A new AMSR surface wetness index (ASWI) was developed by analyzing the near-surface atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), surface volumetric soil moisture (VSM), and land surface fractional open water (FW) time series from an established AMSR Land Parameter Data Record (LPDR). The ASWI allows for multicomponent and independent satellite assessments of near-surface drought conditions by exploiting the weighted anomalies of VPD, VSM, and FW. Comparisons between ASWI and more traditional drought metrics, including the Palmer moisture anomaly index (PDSI-Z) and the U.S. Drought Monitor, showed generally consistent classifications of drought severity for three major droughts over the Contiguous United States since 2002. The AWSI showed moderate (0.3 <= R <= 0.7 for 56% of area) to strong (R > 0.7 for 29% of area) correlations with the PDSI-Z during the summer months (June-August) from 2002 to 2017. ASWI and PDSI-Z differences were attributed to AMSR retrieval uncertainties and the different aspects of drought represented by the indices. Comparisons between ASWI and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment drought severity index (GRACE-DSI) showed strong correspondence (R = 0.61) in regions where possible long-term total water storage changes occurred. The sole reliance of the ASWI on satellite microwave remote sensing and continuing AMSR2 operations enables effective global monitoring of drought conditions while providing new information on the atmosphere, soil, and surface water components of drought.
   Plain Language Summary Extreme hydrologic events affect the economy, environment, and society. The anomalies of the water cycle components are associated with drought events. Considering the capability of multifrequency microwave remote sensing in observing multiple water cycle components, this study developed a new surface wetness index by analyzing near-surface atmospheric vapor pressure deficit, volumetric soil moisture, and land surface water inundation time series from an established satellite data record. The new index showed consistent assessment of major drought events relative to traditional drought monitors while providing enhanced information on the water cycle components of drought. A combined analysis of the index with satellite total water storage measurements provides complementary information on the different aspects of droughts, including relatively dynamic surface water changes and slower evolving groundwater conditions. The index enables independent and continuous satellite assessment of global drought conditions.

AB  - Wetlands, tidal flats, seaweed beds, and coral reefs are valuable not only as habitats for many species, but also as places where people interact with the sea. Unfortunately, these areas have declined in recent years, so environmental improvement projects to conserve and restore them are being carried out across the world. In this study, we propose a method for quantifying ecosystem services, that is, useful for the proper maintenance and management of artificial tidal flats, a type of environmental improvement project. With this method, a conceptual model of the relationship between each service and related environmental factors in natural and social systems was created, and the relationships between services and environmental factors were clarified. The state of the environmental factors affecting each service was quantified, and the state of those factors was reflected in the evaluation value of the service. As a result, the method can identify which environmental factors need to be improved and if the goal is to increase the value of the targeted tidal flat. The method demonstrates an effective approach in environmental conservation for the restoration and preservation of coastal areas.

AB  - Degradation of lake conditions could result from many stressors generated by human disturbance. Accurately defining lake ecological condition by multimetric index (MMI) method is of great importance for tracking source of stressors and lake management. For algal assessment, seldom have structural and functional attributes of soft-bodied planktonic algae metrics, one important dimension of biological condition, been used to develop MMI in conjunction with diatom metrics. Another thing is that some researchers found MMI method does not perform well in mid- and high-disturbed lakes. To test the aforementioned questions, we used data sets of the 2007 National Lake Assessment project of the USEPA to develop MMIs with and without using soft-bodied planktonic algae metrics for plains and lowlands area (PLNLOW, high disturbed region of the US) and across the conterminous US. Compared to site groups modeled by single diatom assemblages, we found integrating soft-bodied planktonic algaemetric (especially blue-green algaemetric) into developing MMIs can significantly improve performance of MMI in PLNLOW region. The separation powers of MMIs of five level III ecoregions, developed by incorporating blue-green algae metric, are consistently higher than those developed by single diatom assemblages (p-value = 0.029). However, when blue-green algaemetric was applied to develop MMI along with diatommetrics in the national scale assessment, performances of MMIs are similar to that developed by diatom metrics (0.14 < p-value < 0.86). Different performance of MMIs developed by integrating blue-green algae metric at different spatial scales indicated the usefulness of blue-green algae metric in ecological assessment in mid- and high-disturbed lakes and a tiered approach for using diatom and blue-green algae metric in ecological assessment. We suggest using blue-green algae metric in combined with diatom metric to develop MMI when lakes are mid- and high-disturbed, while a routine diato massessment would be enough forminimally disturbed sites.

AB  - Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f. is a highly important and extensively cultivated medicinal plant and that is also extensively used in the cosmetic industry. It has been frequently reported to suffer from Alternaria leaf spot disease in various parts of the world. Various fungicides used to combat this disease, have deleterious effects on the environment and on pharmacologically important constituents of Aloe vera. To avoid the harmful effects of fungicides an ecofriendly approach has been adopted here. A weekly survey was conducted during 2013-2015 in and around North 24 Parganas (West Bengal) to obtain the percentage of disease index (PDI). For biological control of the disease, screening of the antagonistic efficacy of biocontrol agents was carried out through the in vitro dual-culture-plate method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the mechanism. The in vitro effects of fungicides on the radial growth of the pathogen were evaluated through the poison food method and were compared with potent antagonistic fungi. Field application of potent antagonistic fungi was conducted through the dip-and-spray method. The results showed that, the PDI peaked during the hot and humid conditions of May to September (76.57%-98.57%) but decreased during the winter, December-January (35.71-46.66%). Trichoderma asperellum exerted the greatest inhibition of the radial growth of A. brassicae acting through non volatile (70.39%) and volatile metabolites (72.17%). A SEM study confirmed the hyperparasitic nature of T. asperellum through hyphal coiling- T. asperellum was similar to 2% blitox-50 (73.92%) and better than 2% bavistin (59.77%) (in vitro). In agricultural field trials (2013-15), Trichoderma application restricted the disease to the smallest area (PDI 24.00-29.33%) in comparison to untreated plots (73.33%). In conclusion, saplings treated with the dip method (10(8) spores / mL) and sprayed 4 times with a spore suspension of biocontrol agents such as T. asperellum, T. viride and T. harzianum, standardized at a rate of 2.5 L /plot (36 sq ft) (10(8) spores/mL) are suggested for the ecofriendly management of this epidemic leaf spot disease of Aloe vera in agricultural fields.

AB  - Cities are the engine of economic development and human wellbeing, but their dynamics needs to be supported by the convergence of large flows of material and energy resources. Assessing a city resource metabolism becomes increasingly crucial, not only concerning the relation with the environment as a source or a sink, but also concerning the internal dynamics of resource exchange among city components and sectors. We applied Emergy Accounting (EMA) and Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) methods to develop and validate indicators of urban environmental sustainability, using as case studies five urban systems of different size in Italy. CED allowed an assessment of the commercial energy consumption required on local and global scales to support the city life and economy. Airborne emissions related to direct and indirect energy consumption were also assessed. EMA was used to quantify the environmental support required for the urban metabolism, in terms of resource generation and ecosystem services supply. Combining these three aspects, a new metric is discussed and developed to estimate the environmental impact of cities, with reference to their resource use, in order to implement comprehensive indicators and suggest resource use criteria at urban level. A city's support area to buffer upstream and downstream environmental loading is also calculated. Relative and absolute sustainability concepts are introduced and discussed, showing how far the investigated cities are from a resource-based environmentally sustainable state. Finally, practices are suggested as an exit strategy from the present intensive fossil powered economy towards a higher level of environmental sustainability and wellbeing.

AB  - This study investigated interactions between eco-hydromorphological state, riparian vegetation cover, water temperature and fish community composition in lowland rivers in Ireland. Physical habitat modification of study sites corresponded with degraded eco-hydromorphological state (degree of ecological and physical modification) and reduced thermal buffering capacity (greater temperature fluctuation and increased frequency of extreme temperature events). This impact was reflected in the fish community, with a shift from a brown trout-dominated (Salmo trutta L.) fish assemblage to predominance of the more thermally plastic minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus (L.), and stone loach, Barbatula barbatula (L.). Eco-hydromorphological state may be a central factor affecting the ability of temperate rivers to resist temperature change in a warming climate and to maintain suitable conditions for salmonids and other cold-water biota. Strategies aimed at climate change proofing of temperate rivers should focus on preserving or re-establishing the eco-hydromorphological processes that create habitat complexity and buffer stream temperature.

AB  - Non-invasive measures of stress are crucial for captive and conservation management programs. The adrenal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) has recently been adopted as a stress marker, but there is little investigation of its relationship to glucocorticoids (GC), well-known indicators of stress. This study examined the influence of age, reproductive state and environment on GC and DHEAS levels in orangutans, to test whether the GC/DHEAS ratio can provide an index of stress response in primates. We measured fecal GC (fGC) and fecal DHEAS (fDHEAS) concentrations in 7 captive orangutans from zoological parks in Japan and 22 wild orangutans from Danum Valley Conservation Area, Malaysia. We found that in a stressful condition (transportation), fDHEAS levels increased 2 days after the fGC response, which occurred 1 day after the stressor. One pregnant female had elevated levels of both hormones, and a higher fGC/fDHEAS ratio than baseline. Females in the first year of lactation had fGC levels and the fGC/fDHEAS ratio significantly higher than both baseline and females in the second and subsequent years of lactation. There was no effect of age on fGC levels, but the fGC/fDHEAS ratio was higher in infants than adults and adolescents. fDHEAS concentrations were lower in infants than juveniles, adolescents and adults, a phenomenon known as adrenarche, shared with humans and other great apes. We suggest that changes in DHEAS during orangutan life history are associated with changes in the dynamics of maintaining homeostasis that vary with age and reproductive state. The GC/DHEAS ratio index is useful to evaluate age-related abilities of responding to stressful challenges.

AB  - This study investigates the implementation of environmental management accounting in translating environmental management strategy into organizational performance. Further, the study identifies the influence of institutional pressures on environmental management strategy and environmental management accounting to provide a better description of the impact of the institutional environment on corporate environmental practices. The data were collected from 144 business entities in Sri Lanka using a web-based survey and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. We found statistically significant evidence to state that the environmental management strategy is positively associated with the environmental and economic performance of organizations, whereas environmental management accounting mediates this relationship. Further, a firm's institutional environment positively affects both environmental management strategies and environmental management accounting. This study emphasizes that the organizational information systems such as environmental management accounting are useful in providing information on environmental costs and monitoring environmental and financial performance when implementing environmental management strategies in the pursuit of corporate sustainable development.

AB  - Trophic indicators to measure the impact of fishing on an exploited ecosystem.-There is currently a global call for more use of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) to provide a holistic view of ecosystem fisheries interactions. Trophic indicators could therefore be used to support the implementation of an EAFM by providing information on the state of the ecosystem. In this paper we propose a set of indicators such as the marine trophic index (MTI), the fishing in balance (FiB), the cut marine trophic index ((MTI)-M-cut) and the pelagic/demersal index (P/D) to assess the dynamics and the trophic changes in the Black Sea large marine ecosytem from 1970 to 2005. Our analysis shows a heavily exploited ecosystem where overfishing and anthropogenic eutrophication are probably responsible. The decline of the MTI, (MTI)-M-cut and FiB together with the rising trend of the P/D index could be interpreted as a fishing down marine food web process with a strong decrease in abundance of high trophic level species and a considerable increase of low trophic level species.

AB  - An experiment was carried out in 2007 to investigate the effects of different irrigation regimes, and chickpea cultivars on chickpea production in the Agricultural Research Station, College of Agriculture, Islamic Azad University, Kermanshah Branch, Iran. The experimental design was split-plot with three replications. Supplemental irrigation at three levels, that is, control treatment (without irrigation) (I-0), one time irrigation at 50% flowering stage (I-1) and one time irrigation at pod-filling stage(I-2), was allocated to main plots and the varieties ILC-482 (V-1), Hashem (V-2) and Arman (V-3) were allotted to sub plots. A significant difference was observed between irrigation treatments in terms of grain yield, plant height, number of axillary branches, distance to the first pod from soil surface, number of grain per plant, number of pod per plant, biological yield, harvest index and 100-grain weight. Such differences were also observed between testing varieties in terms of all traits rather than 100-grain weight. Grain yield was significantly higher for Arman than that of Hashem which was significantly higher than that of ILC-482. Of course, there was no significant difference between Hashem and ILC-482 in terms of grain yield. Arman had the highest values of the number of grain per plant and the highest pod per plant pertained to Arman and Hashem, respectively. High rate of grain yield in irrigation treatment at pod-filling stage was associated with yield components, especially with the number of pod per plant and 100-grain weight. Grain yield was positively correlated with number of pod per plant (r = 0.654**), number of grain per plant (r = 0.902**) and 100-grain weight (r = 0.707**). This research showed that pod-filling is the most sensitive stage to drought stress, and under water limitation conditions, we can considerably increase grain yield at this stage by one time irrigation, especially for Arman cultivar.

TI  - An analysis of yield variation among long-duration pigeonpea genotypes in relation to season, irrigation and plant population
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
KW  - WATER-USE
AB  - The response of eight long-duration pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp.] genotypes to irrigation was studied at Gwalior in Central India during the 1990-91, 1991-92 and 1992-93 growing seasons on an Inceptisol. The crop was grown at two spacings as it was expected that crop density could interact with the crop's ability to extract soil moisture. The irrigation treatment received furrow irrigation four times during the 1990-91 and 1992-93 seasons and twice during the 1991-92 season. Grain yields of all genotypes were 11% higher when planted at higher density than at low density. There was a differential variation in yield and harvest index among genotypes due to season but not due to spacing and irrigation suggesting the validity of the present approach of testing genotypes under optimum conditions. Grain yield declined by 21% from the 1990 to 1992 season. The decline was > 1 t/ha in some cultivars (ICPL 366, GW3), and between 0.5 and 1.0 t/ha in others (NP [WR] 15, ICP 87143 and ICPL 84072). In others (Bahar, ICP 9174, ICP 8860) the yield fluctuation was < 0.5 t/ha. The genotypes' mean yields were as high as 2.7 t/ha for ICPL 87143, ICPL 84072 and ICPL 366. There was a significant reduction in both grain yield (16%), and also above-ground plant dry mass (18 %) due to soil moisture limitation in the unirrigated treatment. Both the above-ground plant dry mass and grain yields were significantly more at high plant density than at lower plant density especially with irrigation. The genotypes were found to differ in their response to production environment (irrigation, spacing and to the undefined differences of the 3 years). Genotypic variation in yield within a production environment was found to vary in relation to changes in harvest index and across environment (irrigation, seasons) due to variation in total dry matter production. A lack of negative relationship between the total dry matter and harvest index suggests the possibility of optimizing both for obtaining higher yield from long-duration genotypes.

AB  - There is a critical need for integrated system health management (ISHM) approaches to asset maintenance. Ideally, ISHM methodologies would track the system usage and the associated loads, monitor the system degradation and materials state, monitor relevant environmental parameters and their effects on system degradation, detect insipient system damage, diagnose failure mode, predict future system performance, and recommend maintenance actions. Even though there has been considerable progress in many subareas of ISHM over the past years, there is still ample room for future improvements in all technological aspects affecting ISHM. In fact, progress in ISHM has not been uniform. Some subsystems have experienced a far greater degree of development than others. For example, engine and machinery health monitoring and diagnostics, due to its criticality, has evolved at a faster pace than structural health monitoring. This article will review some of the aspects that need to be addressed in order to make structural health monitoring (SHM) of military systems a reality in the near future.

AB  - Sardinella spp. are the main species fished in Mauritanian waters. Logbook data (1991-2009) were used to standardise CPUE. This clearly revealed that the abundance of sardinella peaked in the warm season (July-September) which is the main, if not the only significant spawning season for round sardinella.
   This study does not directly confirm or falsify the common belief that the adults migrate from the Senegalese EEZ up to north of the 21 degrees N latitude, but it presents a variety of new hypotheses. If a single transboundary stock exists, part of its individuals, or a sub-stock, is probably more sedentary and remains in the permanent upwelling area located in northern Mauritania and southern Morocco.
   Between years, changes in abundance index are dominated by a decrease from 1996 to 2006, depending on the months taken into account, and especially whether or not the warm (spawning) season is considered. For a given month, the spatial distribution of sardinella shows limited differences between years. In the southernmost latitudes of the Mauritanian EEZ the seasonal pattern, which is dominated by high catch rates during the warm season, is much stronger after the year 2001, and then tended to increase year after year.
   Changes in species distribution and abundance during the twenty-year study period are difficult to relate to environmental dynamics. However, an inversion of the upwelling trend was observed in 2001, matching a change in the seasonality of sardinella catches, although the causality between the two phenomena could not be established. The increase in the abundance index of sardinella in the last five years, particularly during most of the core fishing season (July-September) might be due to favourable oceanographic conditions (higher upwelling index) and/or changes in the fishing strategies or efficiency. Before annual indices of abundance can be used in the future, it will be necessary to better understand possible changes in catchability during the warm/spawning season. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

   The white mullet Mugil curema is one of the main species that exploits the artisanal fishery on the Mexican Pacific coast. Addressing the reproductive aspects of species by fishing area will reduce bias in evaluating the status of their populations. The objective of the present study was to describe the reproductive cycle and estimate some biological parameters of the white mullet in two fishing sites on the coast of Baja California Sur. Monthly, samples from the catch were obtained in Bahia de La Paz (BLP) and Bahia Magdalena (BM), during 2010-2013. Gonadal maturation process was histologically analyzed and the reproductive cycle was described. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), condition factor (CF), hepatosomatic index (HSI), the weight-length relationship and average length of sexual maturity (L50%) were estimated. The size of the fish varied between 244 and 455 mm in total length (LT). Females were more abundant (> 70%), large and heavy than males at both fishing sites. A reproductive pattern was identified with two annual peaks in BLP (March-June and October-November) and one in BM (April-August). A similar pattern of GSI, CF and HSI by sex was identified at both sites. The white mullet showed negative growth allometry, features of total spawning, synchronous gonadal development by groups and an L50% higher in females than males. It is recommended to readjust the closure period by fishing site and based on the L50% be cautious in the mesh size of the fishing nets.

AB  - State governments in the United States have adopted a number of policies to encourage the production of electricity from "green" energy sources. While these state-level policies have been shown to stimulate green electricity development, the rate at which such policies have been adopted by the states differs significantly. This paper examines the potential influence of a state's particular social, political, and economic interests on its propensity to adopt green electricity policies. We use an empirical model that combines various social, political and economic indicators as explanatory variables of a state's likelihood to adopt four specific green electricity policies: renewable portfolio standards, net metering rules, public benefits funds, and generation disclosure rules. Using binary logistics regressions, the results suggest that social interests, measured by the level of income, the level of education, and the degree of participation in environmental lobbying groups, are positively linked to the adoption of green electricity policies. Similarly, political interests as measured by the pro-environment voting by states' representatives in the U.S. Congress, also play a positive role in the adoption of such policies.

AB  - Indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) are used to assess ecosystem health of streams and rivers. Streams and rivers with high IBI scores should support abundant and healthy populations of recreationally important sport fishes. However, the fundamental assumption that IBI scores and sport fish populations are associated needs to be examined. To verify this assumption, we tested associations between IBI scores and relative abundance of all sport fishes targeted by anglers, with emphasis on relative abundance of four size groups of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu at 54 stream and river reaches in 2012 and 2013. We also tested for associations with smallmouth bass body condition and growth. A total of 13,708 fishes representing 85 species were captured including 11 sport fish species that included 571 smallmouth bass. We found that the maximum potential relative abundance of sport fishes and smallmouth bass size classes, as well as body condition of bass between 180 and 279 mm, could be predicted by IBI scores. We did not observe significant relationships with body condition of other bass size classes or with growth. Whereas abundance patterns were variable at reaches with higher IBI scores, abundance of larger, quality-sized sport fishes were more limited at reaches with IBI scores <30 that were classified as having poor biotic integrity. Maximum potential body condition was predicted to exceed 95, a condition value indicative of healthy fish, at IBI scores exceeding 50, reflective of reaches being classified as either fair, good, or excellent. These results confirm that management activities that enhance or maintain biotic integrity also support high-quality habitat for sport fish. While our findings support using IBIs as an indicator of the fishable goal specified in the United States Clean Water Act, managers should recognize that other factors not necessarily represented by the index can also limit sport fish populations.

AB  - The main goal of the Spanish National Hydrological Plan is the implementation of an inter-basin water transfer of a maximum of 1050 hm(3)/year from the lower Ebro River to the north and south Mediterranean coast. The plan also includes an additional list of public works of about 100 new dams and the infrastructure for new irrigation areas, as well as water treatment plants and river canalizations, etc. Taking into accout that the planned Ebro transfer would take 50 m(3)/s during 8 months, and that river flow is mostly in the interval of 150-250 m(3)/s during this period, the abstraction would repesent between one-third and one-fifth of the Ebro flow. This plan, if implemented, would have a strong negative environmental impact on the fluvial ecosystem, as well as on the estuarine and marine ecosystems, but these impacts have not been properly considered in the environmental assessment. This paper principally deals with the environmental effects of the water transfer on the area that supplies the water, downstream from the diversion point. The impact of an inter-basin water transfer on the mouth area is based on three aspects: (1) there is an increase in salinity in the delta and estuary; (2) there is a decrease in the biological productivity, mostly due to the decrease Of nutrient inputs, and there are also changes in the species distribution; and (3) the river carries less sediment, which affects the geomorphology of the system. The possible effects of lower water quality and changes in the fluvial system have also to be considered. The sustainability of deltas can only be guaranteed with the allocation of an appropriate flow regime, which must include not only a liquid flow, but also a solid flow (sediment), given that deltas and coastal systems need sediment inputs (and nutrients) from the river to maintain their structure and dynamics. The classical methods of determining environmental flows in rivers are neither designed nor adequate for the objective of maintaining the deltas and estuaries in a good ecological state. The determination and implementation of an environmental flow regime not only for the river but also for the coastal and marine systems represent a new challenge for scientists and managers.

LA  - Russian
AB  - To assess the impact on the ecosystem of various factors, bioindication is widely used - a method of assessing the quality of the natural environment with account for the state of biota. At the same time, two problems remain relevant: on the one hand, this is the problem of adequate selection of biological indicators of the ecosystem state with the greatest bioindicative potential, and on the other, the problem of establishing the numerical boundaries of the norm (separating the norm and deviation from the norm) for indicators. To study the bioindication potential of hydrobiological and biophysical indicators, a laboratory algocenosis was created, consisting of representatives of various classes of microalgae and cyanobacteria: Anabaena variabilis, Pleurochloris magna, Ankistrodesmus falcatus, and Stichococcus bacillaris. Salts of copper, zinc, and diuron where used as effective toxicants. An analysis of the experimental data was performed by the method of local ecological norms (LEN). The method is based on a computer analysis of the interrelated distribution of biological and physic-chemical characteristics, i.e., on the search for such boundaries of the factor and indicator norms, for which suitable values of the indicator correspond to the acceptable values of the factor, and the unacceptable values of the factor - to the unsuitable values of the indicator. The paper analyzes data on 27 bioindicators: various fluorescence indicators, spectral characteristics; numbers and average volumes of cells of each type; parameters of the rank distribution of the numbers of species in the sample; evenness indices; non-parametric indices of species diversity; phytoplankton saprobity index. The boundaries of each indicator norm were calculated, the factors which significantly influence it were revealed and the boundaries of those factors norm were determined. The confidence of the factor contribution to the degree of indicator's unsuitability was estimated. Bioindicators were compared with each other by the average strength of the connection with the factors. The significant factors were found and their geometric mean values were calculated.

AB  - While green criminologists note that environmental crimes are taken less seriously than street crimes by law enforcement and the criminal justice system, the diffuse structure of the environmental regulatory regime in the United States and lack of governmental databases makes empirical assessment of environmental crimes and enforcement efforts particularly difficult. This article builds on a need in the green criminological literature to empirically assess the distribution and prosecution of environmental crimes in the United States, by focusing on the underserved area of the U.S. states. Using content analysis of 972 federal environmental crime prosecutions 2001-2011, this article explores the nature and geography of these crimes and subsequent prosecutions within and across the U.S. states. Our findings show a wide distribution of crimes and prosecutions occurring across the states, with Clean Air and Clean Water violations being particularly prevalent. We also find a weak trend between prosecutions and both the amount of pollution and number of environmental groups per state, but the small number of cases and limitations of the data make drawing firm conclusions difficult. These findings show an increased need to build databases to understand the prevalence of environmental crimes and the prosecution of those offenses in the U.S. states.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the complexities implied by the implementation of the Colombian land restitution policy, as an example of the way in which the state works in its day-to-day practice. The document highlights the role played by the bureaucracy of "land" in the management of the so-called post-conflict setting. It is constructive in showing the multiscale nature of the state, whose operation cannot be understood outside the various levels and scales that compose it. This conception is very well exemplified by the typology of the bureaucracies to which it resorts in order to explain the different meanings of notions, such as "conflict," "land" or "victim," for the public officials according to the position they fill in the institutional architecture of restitution. By analyzing the research findings, the author reveals that it is emotional, rather than material, benefits that condense the state's role in the Colombian post-conflict period.

TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG shows antioxidative properties in vascular endothelial cell culture
T2  - MILCHWISSENSCHAFT-MILK SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - In vitro screening has shown that some bacteria have antioxidative properties. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103), a widely used probiotic in the dairy industry, prevents peroxidation of lipids, and also has superoxide anion and peroxyl radical scavenging properties. The vascular endothelial cell is capable of producing mediators and modulators of the vascular tone. The synthesis and degradation of substances, e.g. prostacyclin, nitric oxide and cyclic GMP, are dependent on the redox state of the environment.
   The aim of present study was to investigate the antioxidative properties of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in cultured rat cardiac endothelial cells using the following indicators: an increase in prostacyclin (6-keto-PGF(1 alpha)) and cyclic GMP production, and a decrease in nitrite/nitrate (NOx) formation. Ascorbic acid was used as a reference antioxidative substance and SIN-1 (linsidomine) as a standard stimulant (NO-donor).
   The results show that Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG had, in two out of the three variables measured, effects which can be due to its antioxidative properties. The practical relevance of the findings remains uncertain.

AB  - In recent decades, dams worldwide are increasingly being constructed in a row along a single river or basin, thus forming reservoir cascades, and in turn producing cumulative ecological effects along these reservoir cascades. Use of multimetric indices (MMI) based on fish assemblages to assess the ecological health status of rivers and lakes have also been developed extensively. However, there are no studies using MMI for identifying the cumulative effects of reservoir cascades. The aim of this study was to develop a new fish-based index of biotic integrity (F-IBI) that can effectively identify the cumulative effects of reservoir cascades on fish assemblages in two important habitats (the free-flowing reach between reservoirs and the transition zone in the reservoir). Fish assemblages from 14 sites were sampled along the cascade reservoirs in the upper Yangtze River, China. First, through screening for redundancy, precision, and responsiveness of the candidate metrics, a new F-IBI based on ecological trait information of fish species composition was developed to estimate the ecological status of all sites. F-IBI scores exhibited an obviously downward trend from upstream to downstream in a reservoir cascade, and the transition zones in the reservoir displayed significantly lower F-IBI scores than the free-flowing reaches between reservoirs. Secondly, using random forest models, it was shown that the F-IBI can effectively identify the cumulative effects of the reservoir cascades on fish assemblages. Furthermore, we also demonstrated metric-specific responses to different stressors, particularly the multiple reservoir cascades, which showed: 1) endemic fish species, as well as rheophilic, zoobenthivore and phytobenthivore fish species, are easily affected by reservoir cascades, and 2) the longitudinal position of cascade reservoirs and the proximity of the downstream reservoir and upstream dam have very important effects on fish species composition. It was suggested that targeted fish conservation with the integration of habitat and biotic information should be given more attention in the free-flowing reaches between reservoirs.

AB  - If organisms move beyond the boundaries of local sampling units, regional metacommunity dynamics could undermine the ability of bioassessment studies to characterize local environmental quality. We tested the prediction that fish dispersal influences local fish community structure and bioassessment metrics as a function of site position within stream networks. We evaluated fish community data from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Regional Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program in West Virginia, USA, to compare the influences of stream network position, ecoregion, basin, and stream size on local fish community composition. We assigned sites to 1 of 3 stream network positions: 1) main channels (MC, n = 12) encompassed streams with upstream catchment areas >200 km(2), 2) mainstem tributaries (MT, n = 43) flowed into MC-sized confluences within 15 fluvial km, 3) headwater tributaries (HT, n = 31) lacked such riverine confluences within 15 fluvial km. MT and HT sites had similar upstream catchment sizes and landuse gradients, but species richness was greater in MT sites than HT sites, whereas MT and MC sites were not different in this regard. Three bioassessment metrics were greater in MT sites than HT sites (intolerant species richness, cyprinid species richness, benthic species richness), but a multimetric index of biotic integrity did not differ among stream network positions. Ordinations revealed that fish community composition was organized primarily by zoogeographic basin (Monongahela River basin, New River basin, Ohio River basin), ecoregion (Central Appalachian Plateau, Western Appalachian Plateau, Ridge and Valley), and stream size. Riverine specialists were more abundant in MT than HT sites and were more abundant in basins connected to the Ohio River than in basins isolated from the Ohio River by a large waterfall (New River). Our results suggest that contemporary dispersal among streams influences fish community composition over small spatial scales (10(1) km), historical dispersal constrained by zoogeographic barriers influences community structure over larger areas (10(2) km), and contemporary dispersal by fishes influences certain metrics commonly used in bioassessment programs.

AB  - Ecosystem-based management of fisheries aims to allow sustainable use of fished stocks while keeping impacts upon ecosystems within safe ecological limits. Both the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets promote these aims. We evaluate implementation of ecosystem-based management in six case-study fisheries in which potential indirect impacts upon bird or mammal predators of fished stocks are well publicized and well studied. In particular, we consider the components needed to enable management strategies to respond to information from predator monitoring. Although such information is available in all case-studies, only one has a reference point defining safe ecological limits for predators and none has a method to adjust fishing activities in response to estimates of the state of the predator population. Reference points for predators have been developed outside the fisheries management context, but adoption by fisheries managers is hindered a lack of clarity about management objectives and uncertainty about how fishing affects predator dynamics. This also hinders the development of adjustment methods because these generally require information on the state of ecosystem variables relative to reference points. Nonetheless, most of the case-studies include precautionary measures to limit impacts on predators. These measures are not used tactically and therefore risk excessive restrictions on sustainable use. Adoption of predator reference points to inform tactical adjustment of precautionary measures would be an appropriate next step towards ecosystem-based management.

AB  - The debate over the influence of heterozygosity and homozygosity on developmental stability is ongoing, and rarely is an animal model found that represents these two genetic states in naturally occurring populations. Rivulus marmoratus (Pisces: Aplocheilidae), a small cyprinodontid fish indigenous to mangrove marshes of the western tropical Atlantic coast, may be an appropriate model. This species is well known as the only self-fertilizing hermaphroditic vertebrate, and populations normally consist of genetically diverse groups of homozygous clones. However, male fish are known from a few populations, and outcrossing has been documented from one area (Belize in Central America) where heterozygosity is the norm. Are there differences in developmental stability, as represented by fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and physical variability, between naturally occurring homozygous and heterozygous populations? Thirty-one meristic and morphometric characters in 180 fish from 10 populations were examined to determine physical variability. In addition, FA and the presence of physical anomalies were analyzed. Belize fish (heterozygous) were compared with eight other (homozygous) populations. To control for possible environmental effects, offspring of two populations (Belize and Florida) were reared at 25 degreesC and similarly analyzed. The FA analyses and variability comparisons revealed no differences between heterozygous and homozygous populations, and the same was true for fish reared at a constant temperature. However, some populations (e.g., Brazil) were more variable than others. These results indicate that coadapted gene complexes may be more important than heterozygosity in canalizing developmental stability in this animal.

AB  - In the present study, we aimed to assess the adverse effects of zearalenone (ZEA) at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.5, 1, 5 and 10gl(-1)) on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis associated reproductive function using zebrafish model. ZEA was exposed to female zebrafish for 21days to assess growth indices such as condition factor, hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index and caspase 3 activity. Further, expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and CYP19a1b genes in the brain, ER and vitellogenin (Vtg) genes in the liver and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor, luteinizing hormone receptor, ER, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD), 17-HSD and CYP19a1 genes in the ovary were also investigated. Our results showed that there were no significant changes in the condition factor and hepatosomatic index, whereas a significant (P<.05) reduction in the gonadosomatic index, increase in caspase 3 activities and Vtg expression was observed at higher concentration. However, no significant changes were observed at lower treatment levels. Further, we also observed significant (P<.05) upregulation in ER, Vtg, luteinizing hormone receptor, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, 3-HSD, 17-HSD, CYP19a1 and CYP19a1b genes in treatment groups with higher levels of ZEA. Moreover, in histopathological examination, we observed oocyte atresia and oocyte membrane detachment in ovaries at the highest concentration. In conclusion, the present study revealed the negative impact of ZEA on zebrafish reproductive system by involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis-associated reproductive function.
   The aim of the present study was to evaluate the adverse effects of Zearalenone on reproductive functions of adult female zebrafish. Zearalenone affects the gonad functions in female zebrafish by changing growth indices and histology of ovary. Moreover, zearalenone alters the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis by varying the expressions of steroidogenic hormone encoding genes, consequently affects the reproductive system of zebrafish. Hence, zearalenone could pose threat to aquatic organisms by impairing reproductive physiology.

AB  - 1. Climate change impacts have been observed on individual species and species subsets; however, it remains to be seen whether there are systematic, coherent assemblage-wide responses to climate change that could be used as a representative indicator of changing biological state.
   2. European shelf seas are warming faster than the adjacent land masses and faster than the global average. We explore the year-by-year distributional response of North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fishes to temperature change over the 25 years from 1980 to 2004. The centres of latitudinal and depth distributions of 28 fishes were estimated from species-abundance-location data collected on an annual fish monitoring survey.
   3. Individual species responses were aggregated into 19 assemblages reflecting physiology (thermal preference and range), ecology (body size and abundance-occupancy patterns), biogeography (northern, southern and presence of range boundaries), and susceptibility to human impact (fishery target, bycatch and non-target species).
   4. North Sea winter bottom temperature has increased by 1.6 degrees C over 25 years, with a 1 degrees C increase in 1988-1989 alone. During this period, the whole demersal fish assemblage deepened by similar to 3.6 m decade(-1) and the deepening was coherent for most assemblages.
   5. The latitudinal response to warming was heterogeneous, and reflects (i) a northward shift in the mean latitude of abundant, widespread thermal specialists, and (ii) the southward shift of relatively small, abundant southerly species with limited occupancy and a northern range boundary in the North Sea.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The deepening of North Sea bottom-dwelling fishes in response to climate change is the marine analogue of the upward movement of terrestrial species to higher altitudes. The assemblage-level depth responses, and both latitudinal responses, covary with temperature and environmental variability in a manner diagnostic of a climate change impact. The deepening of the demersal fish assemblage in response to temperature could be used as a biotic indicator of the effects of climate change in the North Sea and other semi-enclosed seas.

AB  - Between 1995 and 2008, the European Union and the United States raised environmental standards and concurrently experienced important reductions in emissions from manufacturing despite a rise in output. Levinson (Am Econ Rev 99(5):2177-2192, 2009) finds that the offshoring of polluting industries to countries with lower environmental standards played only small role in the cleanup of US manufacturing, which was largely due to improvements in production technique. But there is no evidence of whether US patterns hold in other developed economies. I provide the first analysis of the pollution intensity of EU production and imports to examine which forces drove the EU cleanup. I find that concerns about the effect of pollution offshoring were unfounded in the European Union, not because the effect was small like in the United States, but because the patterns of specialization of EU production and imports were exactly opposite to what pollution offshoring would predict. Starting in the early 2000s, EU manufacturing increasingly produced more pollution-intensive goods while imports became progressively less pollution-intensive, especially from low-income countries. There are two notable exceptions: primary aluminum and electrometallurgical products, except steel, which do provide evidence of offshoring from the EU to lower income countries. The "brown" specialization of EU production is difficult to explain, but about a quarter can be matched by increased demand for EU exports of polluting goods. However, similar to the US cleanup, changes in production and imports were overwhelmed by improvements in production technique, which were the main drivers of the cleanup of manufacturing.

AB  - Metals are known to have deleterious effects on aquatic ecosystems, so monitoring the bioaccumulation of these pollutants is important for the assessment of potential impacts. The aim of the study was therefore to determine the degree to which aquatic biota in selected rivers of the world renowned Kruger National Park (KNP) are exposed to metals entering from the catchments outside the KNP and to determine how these metal levels reflect what is occurring within the environment. Many of these rivers have never previously been assessed and those which have, have not been assessed within the past two decades. Tigerfish (Hydrocynus vittatus) is an economically important apex predator and was selected as the bioindicator for this study. Fish were sampled from the KNP sections of the Luvuvhu, Letaba and Olifants Rivers during the high and low flow periods from 2009 to 2011. The analysis of various metals from the aforementioned systems revealed spatial and temporal related variation in metal level patterns of the chosen bioindicator, with concentrations in fish from the Olifants River > Letaba River > Luvuvhu River and 2009 > 2010 > 2011. Although there were differences between rivers, metal concentrations were comparable and indicate that all of the studied KNP rivers, even those considered to be in a natural state are affected to some degree by anthropogenic activities. However, concentrations found during this study were much lower than previous studies in the area, as well as contaminated sites across the world, but were higher than concentrations in fish from contaminated sites in the Vaal River, South Africa. Bioaccumulated metals showed no correlation to metals in the water column, but some were correlated to sediment metal concentrations and the contamination and bioavailability of these metals within the sediments. This is of concern when managing the water resources of the conservation area since the contaminants enter the park from outside the borders and pose potential risks to the mandated conservation of aquatic biota within the KNP.

AB  - The anthropogenic impact on ecosystems around developed oil fields has caused environmental issues that affect all habitats of living organisms. The sorption method is considered the most efficient and environmentally acceptable for the removal of petroleum substances from the soil. The advantages of polymeric sorbents are the ability to remove various contaminants to almost any residual concentration, absence of secondary contaminants, and sorption process controllability. The enzymatic activity of soil is an indicator of its ecological state and it can be used to assess the degree of contamination, the intensity of exposure, and efficiency of remediation. The enzymic analysis is performed by studying the activity levels of enzymes in different biochemical processes in soil. This can give more reliable information on changes in the state of the soil. In this research, the bioecological diagnostics of oil-contaminated soil was carried out by studying oxidative enzyme (catalase) and hydrolytic enzymes (urease, protease, and invertase) before and after application of sorbents. Based on a comparison of data obtained in study of enzyme and cellulolytic activity of the soil with a change in the total microbial count, morphological and biological properties of soil microorganisms and hematological, biochemical changes in biological models with regard to application rates of sorbent, it was revealed a correlation between the indices of biological activity of the soil, quantitative and specific composition of microorganisms. Chemical reactions occurring in the soil, associated with metabolism, decomposition, and synthesis of organic substances, migration of chemical compounds, mobilization of nutrients, are carried out with the help of enzymes. High sensitivity, accuracy, relative simplicity and easy operation of methods for determining the activity of soil enzymes allowed them to be used in studies in assessing the intensity and direction of biochemical processes that are essential for soil life and fertility. The activity of soil served an integral indicator of the environmental impact.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the effect of a marathon running at a hot environmental temperature on the baseline skin temperature (Tsk) of the posterior day and to analyze the relationship between Tsk response and muscle damage markers variation. The Tsk, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase of 16 marathon runners were assessed four times before (15 days and 45 min) and after (24 h and 6 days) a marathon in a hot environment (thermal stress index = 28.3 +/- 3.3 degrees C and humidity similar to 81%). The Tsk of thirteen different body regions of both right and left lower limbs were analyzed. Higher values after the marathon were observed than 45 min before in creatine kinase (174.3 +/- 136.4 UI/L < 1159.7 +/- 699.7 UI/L, p < 0.01 and large effect size) and lactate dehydrogenase (362.6 +/- 99.9 UI/L < 438 +/- 115.5 UI/L, p = 0.02 and moderate effect size). Generally, Tsk was higher the day after the marathon than at the other three moments (e.g., rectus femoris region, 6 days before vs. the day after, 95% confidence interval of the difference (0.3, 1.6 degrees C), p = 0.04 and large effect size). No relationship or correlation was observed between the variation of Tsk and muscle damage markers (p > 0.05). In conclusion, performing a marathon in a hot environmental condition results in a higher Tsk the day after the marathon. This increase in Tsk could be because of the heat generated by the marathon and its subsequent physiological processes (e.g., increase in endothelial nitric oxide, glycogen resynthesis, or increase of systemic hormones), which would be reflected in the Tsk due to the peripheral vasodilation promoted by the hot environment. However, among these processes, muscle damage does not seem to be of great importance due to the lack of an observed relationship between Tsk and muscle damage markers.

AB  - 1. While fish-based Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) have been developed for a wide array of lotic systems, equivalent tools have seldom been adapted to the monitoring and assessment of lakes. Major difficulties arise in such work: (i) collecting data that allow statistically robust analyses, (ii) choosing the relevant variables to describe the biotic, environmental and anthropogenic data sets and (iii) assessing the relative importance of the latter two in explaining the former. The aim of the present paper is to produce Such an assessment for the fish communities of the lakes of north-east USA.
   2. Fish surveys, environmental features and catchment-scale descriptors of human stresses (agricultural and urban land-uses) were collected for 112 natural lakes.
   3. Fish metrics, i.e. species richness and percentages of species belonging to reproductive, trophic, and tolerance guilds, were regressed against anthropogenic variables, then against anthropogenic variables and the natural environmental conditions.
   4. It was shown that failing to control for the natural environmental conditions in the IBI construction led to selecting metrics (percentage of intolerant species and percentage of omnivorous species) that did not display response to stresses when the environment was controlled for. Moreover, controlling for natural variability of the metrics allowed identifying the impact of agricultural land-use on the percentage of diadromous species.
   5. Fish communities appear valuable for the bioassessment of lakes. Appropriate statistical methods have proved that the natural variability in the bioassessment tools could be accounted for, thereby allowing assessments at the scale of multiple basins and ecoregions. This opens new perspectives for the development of IBIs for lentic systems in lake-poor regions, such as Southern Europe, and therefore represents a significant contribution to the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive.

TI  - Ecosystem-Based Assessment Indices of Restoration for Daya Bay near a Nuclear Power Plant in South China

KW  - HABITAT
AB  - China has adopted nuclear power generation as one of the strategic energy sources to resolve the dilemma between its ever-growing energy demand and the associated environmental issues. To achieve the latter, a systematic assessment of the state of the ecosystem near nuclear power plants and its restoration via ongoing recovery actions would be highly desirable and much needed. Current assessment methods are mostly based on the individual components of the ecosystem and the methods are therefore not integrated. In this paper, we report a set of system-based assessment indices to study the restoration of Daya Bay in Guangdong, China where a nuclear power plant has been in operation for 15 years. The results show that decades of intensive exploitation by the various coastal activities have pushed Daya Bay's ecosystem away from its baseline and its structure and functions are impaired; ecosystem restoration does not make up for the weakening of the ecological carrying capacity due to anthropogenic sea-use, nonetheless, the potential for recovery still exists. The case study suggests that the system-based indices can provide integrated information for ecosystem restoration assessment and management.

AB  - According to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), states have to provide indicators in order to assess the performance of their initiatives for halting the loss of biodiversity. Sixteen headline indicators have been identified for monitoring the CBD targets. Of these indicators only one, "Trends in the abundance and distribution of selected species," is a direct headline indicator of "non-exploited" biodiversity. In France, the implementation of this indicator is completely dependent on data collected by volunteers. Since this investment of volunteer time is equivalent to savings in administrative costs, we attempt in this paper to assign it a monetary value. This enables us to estimate how much the French administration saves thanks to volunteer efforts and how much public funding would have to be invested if volunteers were no longer willing to participate in these biodiversity monitoring schemes. We estimate this amount to be between 678,523 and 4,415,251 euros per year, depending on the scenario selected. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Telomere shortening is a well-known hallmark of both cellular senescence and organismal aging. An accelerated rate of telomere attrition is also a common feature of age-related diseases. Therefore, telomere length (TL) has been recognized for a long time as one of the best biomarkers of aging. Recent research findings, however, indicate that TL per se can only allow a rough estimate of aging rate and can hardly be regarded as a clinically important risk marker for age-related pathologies and mortality. Evidence is obtained that other indicators such as certain immune parameters, indices of epigenetic age, etc., could be stronger predictors of the health status and the risk of chronic disease. However, despite these issues and limitations, TL remains to be very informative marker in accessing the biological age when used along with other markers such as indices of homeostatic dysregulation, frailty index, epigenetic clock, etc. This review article is aimed at describing the current state of the art in the field and at discussing recent research findings and divergent viewpoints regarding the usefulness of leukocyte TL for estimating the human biological age.

AB  - A growing number of jurisdictions are passing ambitious clean energy policies. Yet few studies have accounted for natural and agricultural land impacts of low-carbon pathways and how environmental siting constraints affect electricity costs and technology choices. To address this gap, we developed an integrated land-energy planning framework to examine the land use trade-offs of renewable energy development required to achieve ambitious clean energy goals, using the state of California as a case study. Using high-resolution ecological and agricultural datasets for 11 Western U.S. states, we modeled environmentally-constrained onshore wind, solar photovoltaic, and geothermal potential and used an electricity capacity expansion model to build generation portfolios for 2050. Here we show that California can meet its targets, but the technology mix, spatial build-out, and system costs are sensitive to land protections and availability of out-of-state renewable resources. Results suggest that failure to consider land availability in energy planning could increase uncertainties, environmental impacts, and risks in meeting subnational climate targets.

AB  - Global ecosystems have shifted from historical conditions, but it is unclear from what baselines change should be assessed. Scientists and managers have increasingly accepted the impossibility of returning ecosystems to a "pristine" state; however, historical conditions remain the cornerstone for restoration and management. We explore the rationale behind the application of historical baselines to ecosystem management and propose Anthropocene baselines as a concept to provide an improved basis for the management of human-dominated ecosystems. The Anthropocene baselines concept emphasizes the conservation value of the remnants of historical ecosystems but confronts the reality that many ecosystems cannot-or will not-be restored to historical ranges of variability. In order to prevent further unwanted changes to biodiversity and ecosystem services, we suggest that the management of human-dominated ecosystems must move beyond historical constraints toward new points of reference dictated by social-ecological sustainability.

AB  - Valencian wetlands include 65 % of the region's priority habitats and most are protected areas. Waterfowl populations are used as indicators of the state of these environments. We calculated the linear population trend by species, per wetland, of five Ardeidae and Plegadis falcinellus (Threskiornitidae) species using data from the annual census between 1984-2015 for 11 selected wetlands. We constructed a matrix with 42 habitat and meteorological variables, and evaluated the relation between these variables and population trends by a Correspondence Analysis. We found an increasing trend for most species. The populations of the L'Albufera de Valencia Natural Park (NP) differed significantly from the rest. Ardea cinerea, E. garzetta, B. ibis and A. ralloides would be associated with large areas, and also with swamps and rice fields, while A. purpurea and P. falcinellus would be related to environments characterised by rainfall and the level of protection in the area. Rice fields and water management have been important for establishing breeding colonies.

AB  - Aim. To study the theoretical foundations of the state's ecological security as a structural element of the system of ensuring the states's economic security. To analyze its basic indicators within the framework of theoretical economic science. To determine the main trends in the dynamics of the main indicators of environmental safety in the economic sphere.
   Material and Methods. The study was conducted using such theoretical research methods as analysis, deduction and the method of extrapolation in statistical analysis.
   Results. The authors propose to consider environmental safety as an integral part of economic security. in our opinion, it is important to prevent such negative trends as a further reduction in investments in fixed assets aimed at environmental protection, an unjustified increase in the coefficient of environmental protection costs, a decrease in the investment attractiveness of environmental projects, and an increase in environmental crime, in the context of the aggravation of the global financial crisis, the imposition of foreign economic sanctions on our country and the deployment of new waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. The actions of negative factors and risks in the field of ensuring environmental safety can become a negative condition in restraining the socio-economic development of the state and economic security.
   Conclusion. The improvement of state regulation of the sphere of environmental safety will provide an opportunity to improve the environmental situation in the long term and will create prerequisites for sustainahle socio-economic development of the state.

AB  - The Republic of Kazakhstan, located in Central Asia, has experienced many years of environmental degradation, largely as a result of the poor management of its significant natural resources. In this survey, data relating to different environmental factors are critically analysed in order to understand the state of the environment. It was found that: warming trends are seen in sensitive areas (e.g. the steppe and near glaciers); drying trends are seen where there is already water stress (e.g. the Aral Sea); air quality has been declining recently (following improvements on the decadal timescale) in major urban centres, particularly Almaty; water quality appears to be improving in some areas (e.g. important lakes in the Aktobe and Zhambyl regions); and levels of exposure to radioactivity are below internationally recommended levels (where data have been found). More generally, there is an issue with data availability and quality, which requires attention if Kazakhstan is going to make the best use of its increasing investment in environmental actions. Current policies are reviewed and recommendations are made for future interventions.

AB  - Based on the environmental health assessment framework of the United State Environmental Protection Agency, a quantitative health risk assessment of arsenic in contaminated drinking water in a city in the northwest of Iran has been carried out. In the exposure assessment step, arsenic concentrations in drinking water were determined during four seasons. In addition, the water ingestion rate for different age groups in this region was determined. The concentration of arsenic in 163 collected samples from different locations during four seasons ranged from 0 to 99g L-1. Furthermore, a high percentage of the samples manifested higher levels than the permissible limit of 10g L-1. The total daily water intake rates of four age groups 1 to <2 (group 1), 2 to <6 (group 2), 6 to <16 (group 3), and 16years (group 4) were estimated as 0.86, 1.49, 2.00, and 2.33L day(-1), respectively. Calculating the lifetime average daily dose of arsenic indicated that adults (group 4) had the highest and children (group 1) had the lowest daily intake of arsenic in their entire life. The results of risk characteristic showed that the order of excess lifetime cancer risk via arsenic exposure in the four groups was 4 > 3 > 2 > 1. The estimated risks for all age groups were higher than the acceptable range (1E-6 to 1E-4). The hazard quotient values for all of the classified groups were lower than the recommended limit values (<1), but it cannot be concluded that potential non-carcinogenicity risks are non-existent since the possible exposure to arsenic via food and skin may also pose the risk.

AB  - The study of peculiarities specific for the spatial organization of communities of living organisms allows to develop principles of the rational and effective use of the biosphere natural resources and optimal adaptation of mankind to the natural environment. The aim of the research was to study communities of the soil mesofauna as an integral indicator of the state of soils under conditions of applying the traditional farming technology, to carry out the quantitative accounting of the soil mesofauna, and assessment of morphometric parameters of sunflower plants in places of selecting soil and zoological samples, to determine the species composition and abundance, as well as to analyze the ecological structure of the soil mesofauna community. Rheophilous species predominate on black steam, and mesophilic species predominate under sunflower. This can be explained by the fact that in the periodic cultivation of black steam, the evaporation from the soil surface is much higher. Ultra-mega-coenotrophs are dominant on black steam, and megacoenotrophs are dominant under sunflower. Since both demonstration trails are laid on one field, but have strategically been divided into a plot under black steam and a plot under sunflower, one can assume a different degree of saturation of the soil solution, as during the growth the crop being cultivated uses soil nutrients. Among topomorphs of soil animals, exactly soil animals are dominant, which is characteristic for both demonstration trails being studied. In the composition of trophomorphs of soil animals, phytophages are dominant in soil of the test demonstration trail on black steam, and in soil of the test demonstration trail, where sunflower was cultivated, phyto- and saprophages predominate in equal proportions. As a result of the correlation analysis, statistically reliable dependences are obtained:-numbers of soil animals in soil of the demonstration trail on black steam-on the distance from forest belt areas (-0.23) and length and width of sunflower leaves-on the distance from forest belt areas (0.53 and 0.53 respectively). The species composition, abundance and distribution in space of soil invertebrates are an informative indicator, which reflects the ecological state of soils, intensity in development of soil horizons as well as intensity of processes occurring in them.

AB  - The Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) has been performing standardized fish stock assessments in Flanders, Belgium. This Flemish Fish Monitoring Network aims to assess fish populations in public waters at regular time intervals in both inland waters and estuaries. This monitoring was set up in support of the Water Framework Directive, the Habitat Directive, the Eel Regulation, the Red List of fishes, fish stock management, biodiversity research, and to assess the colonization and spreading of non-native fish species. The collected data are consolidated in the Fish Information System or VIS. From VIS, the occurrence data are now published at the INBO IPT as two datasets: 'VIS - Fishes in inland waters in Flanders, Belgium' and 'VIS - Fishes in estuarine waters in Flanders, Belgium'. Together these datasets represent a complete overview of the distribution and abundance of fish species pertaining in Flanders from late 1992 to the end of 2012. This data paper discusses both datasets together, as both have a similar methodology and structure. The inland waters dataset contains over 350,000 fish observations, sampled between 1992 and 2012 from over 2,000 locations in inland rivers, streams, canals, and enclosed waters in Flanders. The dataset includes 64 fish species, as well as a number of non-target species (mainly crustaceans). The estuarine waters dataset contains over 44,000 fish observations, sampled between 1995 and 2012 from almost 50 locations in the estuaries of the rivers Yser and Scheldt ("Zeeschelde"), including two sampling sites in the Netherlands. The dataset includes 69 fish species and a number of non-target crustacean species. To foster broad and collaborative use, the data are dedicated to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver and reference the INBO norms for data use.

AB  - The implementation of the ecosystem approach means there is a need to monitor an increased range of environmental conditions and ecological components in the marine environment. Many existing monitoring surveys have successfully added tasks or components to an existing monitoring programme while maintaining consistency of time series. This approach is not practical when the immediate data need for a wide range of ecosystem components requires substantial changes to the programme or when collections of different ecological components have conflicting requirements. We propose a more integrated approach aimed at not only assessing change, but simultaneously delivering evidence of the underlying reasons for observed changes. Using principles developed from observational and modelling efforts in the Barents Sea and the wider literature, we distil the essential characteristics an integrated monitoring programme must exhibit. We demonstrate how such an integrated programme can offer substantial operational efficiencies compared to a coordinated approach. Integrated monitoring based on ecosystem processes has significant advantages over the coordinated approach that uses ecosystem states independently and focuses on maximizing precision of each indicator. While integration is needed to address current policy requirements, changes to monitoring risk time-series consistency. However, we explain how such risks can be minimized while at the same time establishing a framework that allows the incorporation of important information from other less flexible data sources to be used in the assessment.Policy implications. Process-based integrated monitoring is essential for the ecosystem approach. The focus on ecosystem processes provides the essential elements for future proof efficient management: (i) It provides both unbiased status estimates for reporting requirements and describes the causes of state change. (ii) It minimizes risks to historic time series while coping with changing ecological conditions. (iii) It quantifies ecosystem processes and provides the means to test hypotheses on how different processes interact. (iv) It uses all available information efficiently when used in conjunction with integrated assessments. (v) It is effective due to its adaptability to meet future policy demands and ecosystem requirements while using data in the most efficient manner given these demands.

AB  - Intermittent wastewater loading, a characteristic of aquaculture operations, undermines the usefulness of treatment wetlands designed using the steady state assumption. Being biological systems, the treatment variability of such wetlands must also be addressed during the design phase. A simulation-optimization model suitable for modeling intermittent pollutant releases and identifying optimal area and wastewater loading patterns for aquaculture operations is integrated with a decision-analytic framework to determine wetland area and release pattern under uncertainty and risk. Wetland area and release patterns corresponding to different decision making priorities were obtained by applying the minimax, maximax, Hurwicz and minimax regret criteria. The developed methodology provides a convenient framework for aquaculture operators and wetland design engineers to consider trade-off between the wetland size (an indicator of construction and opportunity costs) and wastewater loadings (an indicator of operation costs) during the design process. The results can also be used to characterize the risk-attitudes of the aquaculture operators and identify the worth of additional studies (i.e., pilot tests) given their risk-preferences.

AB  - Asphalt pavement is a multi-layer continuous structure with an interlayer bonding condition that can greatly influence its bearing capacity and must be monitored over the whole service length. Hence, proper maintenance and rehabilitation measures are taken and better feedback can be made for the design. Nevertheless, asphalt pavement interlayer bonding condition plays a hidden role and is difficult to quantify unless applying damage discovery techniques like drilling core process. The original structure is destroyed by the damage detection approaches, the results also suffer from low coverage rate and high dispersion, therefore, actual engineering demands are not satisfied. Here, some recent methods are briefly presented based on asphalt pavement interlayer bonding condition non-destructive diagnosis and their restrictions are discussed. Moreover. a new technique is provided with the merits of utilizing only mechanical simulation and overall superficial distresses condition evaluation index with high accuracy. This simulation procedure adopts bridging principles to build a connection between asphalt pavement superficial distresses and asphalt pavement micro mechanic parameters. It uses a structure behavior equation capable of identifying four typical deterioration modes and has specific physical meaning parameters to predict asphalt pavement overall superficial distresses. The established model allows the asphalt pavement interlayer bonding acting as a hypothetical input variable. The known input variables include easily obtainable design parameters of the asphalt pavement structure, historical superficial distresses, surface deflection, traffic load, and environmental factors, however, the output is the predicted asphalt pavement overall superficial distresses condition. The asphalt pavement interlayer bonding condition is defined by contrasting the theoretical asphalt pavement overall superficial distresses conditions between its complete bonding condition and discontinuous bonding condition to a certain degree. Examples in parts of the Jingha highway show that great discrepancies exist between theoretical asphalt pavement overall superficial distress in the condition of complete interlayer bonding and actual asphalt pavement overall superficial distress. The actual asphalt pavement sections in overall superficial conditions are deteriorated much faster than normal ones. By setting the asphalt pavement interlayer bonding continuations as 75% and 90% for K315-K316 section and K316-K317 section, respectively, the revised and predicted overall superficial distresses of the theoretical asphalt pavement are consistent with the real ones. The hypothetical values are then chosen as the diagnosed quantitative asphalt pavement interlayer bonding continuations and are proven to be correct through drilling core sample results. The analyses in other sections show that middle traffic volume asphalt pavement structure is quite weak when its interlayer bonding continuation is 70%, and under this value, its bearing capacity is almost equivalent to the situation when its interlayer bonding continuation is 0%; when its interlayer bonding continuation is 85% or more, its bearing capacity is almost equivalent to the situation where its interlayer bonding continuation is 100%. This proposed non-destructive diagnosis method for asphalt pavement interlayer bonding condition is effective and shows good application prospects in road engineering.

AB  - Multimetric indices (MMIs) have been successfully used to assess ecological conditions in freshwater ecosystems worldwide, and provide an important management tool especially in countries where biological indicators are fostered by environmental regulations. Nonetheless, for the neotropics, the few published papers are limited to small local scales and lack standardized sampling protocols. To fill the gaps left by previous studies, we propose a stream MMI that reflects anthropogenic impacts by using macroinvertebrate assemblage metrics from a data set of 190 sites collected from four hydrologic units in the Parana and Sao Francisco River Basins, southeastern Brazil. Sites were selected through use of a probabilistic survey design allowing us to infer ecological condition to the total of 9432 kilometers of wadeable streams in the target population in the four hydrologic units. We used a filtering process to determine the least- and most-disturbed sites based on their water quality, physical habitat structure, and land use. To develop the MMI, we followed a stepwise procedure to screen our initial set of biological metrics for influence of natural variation, responsiveness and discriminance to disturbances, sampling variability, and redundancy. The final MMI is the sum of 7 scaled assemblage metrics describing different aspects of macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics: Ephemeroptera richness, % Gastropoda individuals, Shannon Wiener diversity index, % sensitive taxa richness, % scraper individuals, temporarily attached taxa richness, and gill respiration taxa richness. The MMI clearly distinguished the least-disturbed sites from the most-disturbed sites and showed a significant negative response to anthropogenic stressors. Of the total length of wadeable streams in the study area, 38%, 35%, and 27% were classified by the MMI as being in good, fair, and poor condition, respectively. By reducing the subjectivity of site selection, rigorously selecting the set of reference sites, and following a standardized metric screening method, we developed a robust MMI to assess and monitor ecological condition in neotropical savanna streams. This improved MMI provides an effective ecological tool to guide decision makers and managers in developing and implementing improved, cost-effective environmental policies, regulations, and monitoring of those systems.

AB  - This study is the first that presents the rudd's (Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus, 1758)) endohelminth species and structure of helminth communities from Maritsa River, Bulgaria. During 2018, 13 specimens of Scardinius erythrophthalmus were collected and examined with standard techniques for parasites from Maritsa River. Helminth parasites were recorded in all 13rudd specimens (100%) from Maritsa River. Three species of parasites were identified: one cestode species (Ligula intestinalis (Linnaeus, 1758)), one acantocephalan species (Pomphorhynchus laevis (Muller, 1776)) and one nematode species (Rhabdochona denudat. (Dujardin, 1845, Raillet, 1916). The analysis of the dominant structure of the found parasite species is presented to the component level. All established parasite species are core for the component community of Scardinius erythrophthalmus from Maritsa River. The infracommunities data was used to be fixed principal biotic indices. Bioindicator significance of established parasite species was discussed for ecological evaluation of the state of the studied freshwater ecosystem.

AB  - Excessive biomass development of benthic algae is often considered undesirable, but understanding the causes is confounded by complex interactions among driving factors. Pristine rivers allow a benchmark where human interference should be limited to climate change. In this study a time series comprising >20 years of annual benthic algae surveys from two pristine, soft water, boreal stream sites is used to determine whether year-to-year variations in benthic algal assemblages and cover were related to climate (temperature, precipitation, North Atlantic Oscillation) or hydrological regime. Total benthic algal cover ranged from 6 to 100% at Atna (the outflow of the Atna River from Lake Atnasjo), and from 3 to 50% at the headwater stream Li. Climate and hydrological regime explained 18-74% of the variability in benthic algal assemblages and cover. Generally, more variance was explained at Li than at Atna, possibly because (i) aquatic bryophytes blurred nutrient-mediated effects of climate and hydrology at Atna, and (ii) the upstream lake buffered hydrological variation. Temperature was more important for explaining benthic algal assemblages and cover at Atna, while hydrology was more important at Li. Climate and hydrological regime had no major impact on benthic algal taxon richness. High temperatures were associated with high benthic algal cover, particularly at Atna, while high suspended particle concentrations were associated with reduced benthic algal cover at Li, possibly due to scouring. Cover of the cyanobacterium Phormidium sp. increased at Li with increasing temperature, and decreased with prolonged periods of high discharge. Current predictions of climate change would lead to a "greener" Atna (increased cover of benthic algae), while Li would become more "bluegreen" (more Phormidium sp. but less filamentous green algae). It would also lead to a slightly more "eutrophic" algal assemblage at Atna (as indicated by the PIT-index for ecological status assessment), while a possible drift of the PIT-index is less clear at Li. The differences between Atna and Li likely reflect differences among river types, and it seems possible to make some generalizations: climate will likely affect benthic algae in lake outlets primarily via temperature, while headwater streams will primarily be affected via altered hydrology and particle concentrations.

AB  - A nearly perpendicular shock with a thickness on the order of electron inertial lengths has been reported recently by Newbury and Russell (Geophys. Res. Lett., vol. 23, pp. 781-784, 1996) based on the study of ISEE-1 and -2 crossings of Earth's bow shock. This paper examines the structure of nonlinear solitons and shocks propagating exactly perpendicular to the magnetic field based on the two-fluid model. It is shown that the characteristics of the solutions are distinct for three parameter regimes of the upstream plasma beta, beta(1), and magnetosonic number, M-ms1. Magnetosonic solitons and purely resistive subcritical shocks with or without downstream magnetosonic wavetrains exist only for low beta(1) and M-ms1. For subcritical shocks with intermediate beta(1) and M-ms1, steady solutions exist only for resistivity greater than certain critical values. For subcritical shocks with smaller resistivity and for supercritical shocks thigh beta(1) and M-ms1), resistivity alone is insufficient to yield shock transitions. Including viscosity in the model calculations however leads to solutions of unstable upstream and downstream states. This chaotic nature may account for the highly turbulent structure of the observed thin shock.

AB  - Quality seed, water, labour scarcity, rising cost of cultivation, diminishing farm profits and indecisive weather conditions are major challenges faced by the farmers under intensive tillage based conventional rice-wheat production system of eastern Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP). To address these challenges from last few years, conservation agriculture (CA) based crop management practices are being developed, demonstrated and promoted in the region. The field experiments were carried out during the winter (rabi) season of 2012-13 and 2013-14 at Indian Institute of Seed Science, Kushmaur, Mau, Uttar Pradesh to evaluate the effect of different tillage practices and genotypes on yield attributes, seed yield, seed quality, and economics of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Experiment was laid out in split-plot design consisting of 3 tillage systems, viz. Zero tillage (ZT), conventional tillage (CT) and raised beds (RB) as main-plots and 6 genotypes (KRL 213, HD 2733, PBW 550, HD 2967, KRL 210 and DBW 39) as sub-plots treatments and replicated thrice. Results revealed that among the tillage methods, the highest mean seed and biological yield (4.82 and 10.36 tonnes/ha) were found under ZT followed by CT (4.68 and 10.25 tonnes/ha) and least in RB (3.34 and 7.61 tonnes/ha), respectively. Among the genotypes, HD 2967 showed significantly higher mean seed and biological yield (4.72 and 10.28 tonnes/ha) over KRL 210 (3.76 and 8.92 tonnes/ha), PBW 550 (4.10 and 8.95 tonnes/ha) and HD 2733 (4.24 and 9.48 tonnes/ha), respectively. However, genotypes KRL 213 (4.46 and 9.88 tonnes/ha) and DBW 39 (4.42 and 9.42 tonnes/ha) were found on par with HD 2967. The highest tillers/m(2) as well as effective tillers/m2 was recorded under ZT system with HD 2967 genotype. However, the highest seeds/spike, spike length and test weight were found under RB system with genotype HD 2967. There were no significant differences between the tillage systems concerning seed quality parameters, viz. germination %, seedling length, seedling dry weight, vigour index I and II. Moreover, the genotype HD 2967 showed significant difference among all seed quality parameters except germination (%) which was on par with HD 2733, KRL 213 and PBW 550. The maximum mean net returns was recorded under ZT ((sic)75 500/ha) followed by CT ((sic)65 600/ha) and RB ((sic)41 100/ha). The total net gain in income due to adoption of ZT system was (sic)17 300 and (sic)39 400/ha as compared to CT and RB, respectively.

AB  - Environmental pollution is a worldwide concern, especially pollution of water bodies. To measure the level of pollution, environmental legislation uses parameters as indicators of quality. Effluents from wash stations and mechanical workshops have a high polluting power due to the amount of oil coming from automobile parts and motors. Gravimetry is the official method for Rio Grande do Sul, according to the State Foundation for Environmental Protection Henrique Luiz Roessler (Fepam). However, a method requires relatively more time and more steps than in a spectrophotometric analysis. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop a spectrophotometric methodology for the analysis of oils and greases. The samples from mechanical workshops and washing stations were collected by a laboratory accredited by the Ministry of Agriculture, Farming and Supply (MAPA) and Metrology institute (Inmetro) from a city located in Rio Grande do Sul. The samples were submitted to analysis by the official method and the results were compared to the proposed method. The results showed that the recovery tests were within the accepted range and showed to be linear. In this way, it presents a positive perspective to be used as an alternative method with less analysis time.

AB  - Eco-efficiency links economic efficiency with environmental efficiency. The main purpose of the concept is to identify and implement activities to enable production that is both economically more efficient and cleaner. This means that parameters with a high indicative value have to be used.
   Since both the environmental and the economic performance of industries must be described concurrently, environmental intensity appears to be a good indicator of eco-efficiency. Environmental intensity is environmental impact per unit of economic performance. In this paper, the environmental impact of industry classes is derived from emission data, released by the European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER), and then aggregated and assessed using Eco-Indicator 99, a single-score life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method. The calculated ratio is thus an accurate description of the environmental-economic state of industry classes. The main advantage of this approach is the underlying consistent statistical framework, that permits, on a disaggregated level, economic data to be correlated with ecological data and to be frequently updated.
   This single indicator facilitates a comparison of environmental intensity of different industry classes. The paper shows that it is possible to deduce a disaggregated eco-efficiency indicator, which is exemplified using German data, however could be analysed for different European countries.

AB  - With respect to acidic, cyanide-laced tailings, the data about in situ toxicity and biological activity in highly polluted environment are often lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the microbial characteristics, composition of oribatid mite species, and level of genotoxic impact on plants in the area of inactive tailings pond (Horna Ves, Kremnica region). Sampling of the tailings, soils and selected plant species was carried out in spring of 2012. Trace element analysis (inductively coupled plasma emission and mass spectrometry) showed that concentration of Pb, Zn, and Cu in the tailings is approximately in thousands of ppm (mg kg(-1)). Amount of lead exceeded 16,000 mg kg(-1), which is perceived as the biggest threat with respect to possible toxicity. The risk is accentuated by extremely acidic pH of the tailings material which approached 2. In such conditions great mobility of (divalent) heavy metal cations is expected. The total cyanide concentration in the tailings was 472 mg kg(-1). Results of performed tests and measurements suggest that microbial activity at the tailings site (and its close environment) is hampered markedly. In the sludge material we detected low abundance of soil bacteria (2.08 x 10(4) CFU) and predominance of slowly growing K-strategists. On the other hand, the content of microbial C in the sludge sample was not too low, considering its extreme acidity and high amount of risk elements. In the same sample, just one mite species, Oppiella (O.) uliginosa (Willmann 1919), was identified. Also in case of the dam site the abundance of mites was considerably lower in comparison to reference sample. Values of Oribatida abundance were in positive correlation with values of microbial biomass carbon. Results of the pollen grain abortivity test, applied in situ on chosen plant species, indicated substantial presence of genotoxicity in the environment. Total induction index of tailings pond reached 3.59(+/- 2.4) which expresses also total load of locality, comparing to natural biotope. In case of the technogenic sediment, the value was more than three times higher.

AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse the key historical milestones of the development of environmental organisations in the post-Soviet states based on the example of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, which influenced the modern dynamics of the development of environmentalism. The sources for the study are statistical data from the official websites of the bodies of authority (Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation), results of sociological surveys of the Russian Public Opinion Research Center and the Higher School of Economics, data presented on the official websites of environmental organisations in Russia and Ukraine. The use of historical, systematic and institutional approaches allowed identifying the causes of emergence, the main problems and features of environmental organisations' development. The main reason for environmental organisations' emergence in the Russian Federation and in Ukraine was the environmental disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, which contributed to the development of environmentalism and at the same time showed its extremely weak positions in terms of creating political parties and participating in policy- making. Among the range of problems, the author of the study focuses on the lack of funding sources and difficulties in the interaction with representatives of various levels of government. Particular attention is paid to the specific features of Russian and Ukrainian environmental movements. Similar features of their environmentalism include the insufficiently effective model of interaction between national and regional organisations, the already formed environmental consciousness of the population. At the same time, the point of difference between the ecological organisations of Russia and Ukraine is different models of interaction with the authorities. In the Russian Federation, a model of active state intervention in the legislative process has been developed. This is reflected in the limited impact of environmentalists on decision-making and the strict control of the state through the regulatory and legal acts on the issues of environmental organisations' accountability and funding. Ukraine has developed a moderate model of state intervention in the legislative process: the state actively supports environmentalists' initiatives and the establishment of new public organisations. Summing up, the author notes that the identified similarities and difference between the environmentalists of Russia and Ukraine, however, do not have a significant impact on the importance of reducing environmental threats and the importance of solving environmental problems. It is necessary to continue work on improving the regulatory framework, to promote the expansion of opportunities for public activists to influence political decision-making, to form mechanisms for civic participation to involve the population at large in solving environmental problems.

AB  - This study analyzes the somatic condition of southern Iberian barbel Luciobarbus sclateri (Gunther, 1868) in the Guadiamar River (SW Iberian Peninsula). This river was seriously affected by a toxic spill of about 4 million cubic meters of acidic water and 2 million cubic meters of mud rich in heavy metals. Once the spill removal works concluded, sites affected and unaffected by the accident were sampled to study its effects on the fish fauna. The ecological variables registered were related to water quality, physical state of reaches, ecological quality, resources exploited by fish, and potential intra-specific interactions. From an initial 15 ecological variables, seasonal water flow and pH explained most of the variation in barbel condition. This study shows that the Guadiamar River, 56 months after the accident, is still undergoing a recovery process where, beyond ecological variables, proximity to the affected area is the most influential factor for fish condition.

AB  - The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive requires the development of suitable indicators for regular reporting on the environmental state and achievement of a good environmental status of EU's marine waters by 2020. The development of indicators for determining seafloor integrity and its possible disturbance by human activities have so far largely ignored the geological properties of seafloor. This paper presents a study of Vuosaari and Uusikaupunki-D offshore dumping sites in Finland, the northern Baltic Sea. Full coverage multibeam bathymetry and relative backscatter data, and a number of sediment cores were collected over the sites. The areas covered by dumped dredge spoil stand out in the multibeam images because of their irregular surface and elevated backscatter. The short gravity cores were studied for lithology, and in 1-cm slices for Cs-137 activity, organic content, and grain size distribution. The dumped material is represented in the cores by the gravelly mud lithofacies with massive texture and angular coarse particles. The dumped material is coarser, less sorted and has higher kurtosis compared to natural sediment due to the admixing of blasted rock during the dredging activities, and limited sorting during fall through the water column upon dumping. Dispersed dredge spoil, which was suspended in the water column during the dumping activities or reworked from the dumped material mounds and redistributed along the seafloor soon thereafter, was deposited over a wide area as a thin layer that is not necessarily readily identifiable by visual inspection in the cores. Cesium activity helped distinguish the dumped material from the Cs-137-enriched natural sediments deposited after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Considering that the dumped material at many of the coring sites in the Vuosaari dumping area is covered by natural sediment, it probably is largely stable. In contrast, dumped material at the shallower Uusikaupunki-D site has slumped down to an adjacent channel and is likely being redistributed by nearbottom currents. Based on the findings of the study, a protocol for the assessment of the geological integrity of seafloor, its anthropogenic change due to dumping, and its potential recovery is proposed, as required by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

AB  - The swimming crab Liocarcinus puber (Crustacea Brachyrhyncha) was exposed for 2 weeks to CrCl3 (chromium occurs principally in the trivalent state in the natural environment), The gills, digestive gland and muscle were examined by several analytical techniques for cellular and subcellular localization of chromium, The techniques applied were secondary ion mass spectrometry (ion microscopy and ion microprobe analysis) associated with photon microscopy and X-ray spectrometry (electron microprobe analysis) together with transmission electron microscopy, The digestive gland was found to be free of chromium, whereas chromium was adsorbed onto the gill exoskeleton. The muscle was the only tissue with intracellular electron-dense precipitates with no surrounding membrane, The metal was detected in the heterophagic vacuoles of amoebocytes where it was associated with phosphorus and trapped in an unsoluble form, Mechanisms of chromium cellular and subcellular metabolism were compared between crabs and other aquatic organisms, L. puber does not appear to be a suitable bioindicator of chromium pollution because of molting and its low chromium bioaccumulation capability.

AB  - Fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages often provide insight on ecological conditions for guiding management actions. Unfortunately, land use and management legacies can constrain the structure of biotic communities such that they fail to reflect habitat quality. The purpose of this study was to describe patterns in fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage structure, and evaluate relationships between biota and habitat characteristics in the Chariton River system of south-central Iowa, a system likely influenced by various potential management legacies (e.g., dams, chemical removal of fishes). We sampled fishes, benthic macroinvertebrates, and physical habitat from a total of 38 stream reaches in the Chariton River watershed during 2002-2005. Fish and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were dominated by generalist species tolerant of poor habitat quality; assemblages failed to show any apparent patterns with regard to stream size or longitudinal location within the watershed. Metrics used to summarize fish assemblages and populations [e.g., presence-absence, relative abundance, Index of Biotic Integrity for fish (IBIF)] were not related to habitat characteristics, except that catch rates of piscivores were positively related to the depth and the amount of large wood. In contrast, family richness of benthic macroinvertebrates, richness of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera taxa, and IBI values for benthic macroinvertebrates (IBIBM) were positively correlated with the amount of overhanging vegetation and inversely related to the percentage of fine substrate. A long history of habitat alteration by row-crop agriculture and management legacies associated with reservoir construction has likely resulted in a fish assemblage dominated by tolerant species. Intolerant and sensitive fish species have not recolonized streams due to downstream movement barriers (i.e., dams). In contrast, aquatic insect assemblages reflected aquatic habitat, particularly the amount of overhanging vegetation and fine sediment. This research illustrates the importance of using multiple taxa for biological assessments and the need to consider management legacies when investigating responses to management and conservation actions.

CP  - 3rd Symposium on the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program
AB  - The U.S. EPA has prepared a State of the Region Report for Mid-Atlantic Estuaries to increase knowledge of environmental condition for improved environmental management. Sources of information included the National Estuary Programs, the Chesapeake Bay Program, the state monitoring programs in Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, Federal programs such as National Status & Trends, National Shellfish Register, National Wetlands Inventory, the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program, and other primary literature sources. The state of the estuarine environment was summarized using indicators for water and sediment quality, habitat change, condition of living resources, and aesthetic quality. Each indicator was briefly discussed relative to its importance in understanding estuarine condition. Wherever possible, data from multiple programs were used to depict condition. Finally, an overall evaluation of estuarine condition in the region was determined. The usefulness of monitoring programs that collect consistent information with a well-defined sampling design cannot be overemphasized.

AB  - The River Piedra in the Monasterio de Piedra Natural Park (NE Spain) is a modern tufa-depositing river that encompasses various depositional environments that are inhabited by different cyanobacterial populations. Molecular (16S rDNA) and morphological analyses of the cyanobacteria from different fades showed that Phormidium incrustatum dominates in the fast-flowing water areas where the mean depositional rate is 1.6 cm/year. Stromatolites in these areas are formed of palisades of hollow calcite tubes (inner diameter of 6.0-7.5 mu m, walls 2-12 mu m thick) that formed through calcite encrustation around the filaments followed by decay of the trichomes. In contrast, in slow-flowing water areas with lower depositional rates (mean depositional rate of 0.3 cm/year), Phormidium aerugineo-caeruleum is the dominant species. In these areas, randomly oriented calcite tubes (inner diameter of 5-6 mu m, walls 3-8 mu m thick) formed by calcite encrustation, are found in thin and uneven laminae and as scattered tubes in the loose lime mud and sand-sized carbonate sediment. Although this species did not build laminated deposits, it gave cohesiveness to the loose sediment. In the stepped and low waterfalls, with intermediate deposition rates (mean depositional rate of 0.9 cm/year), both species of Phormidium are found in association with spongy moss and algal boundstones, which is consistent with the variable flow conditions in this setting.
   The calcite encrustations on the cyanobacteria from different environments exhibit irregular patterns that may be linked to changes in the calcite saturation index. The physicochemical conditions associated with extracellular polymeric substances may be more significant to CaCO3 precipitation in microbial mats in slow-flowing water conditions than in fast-flowing water conditions. These results show that flow conditions may influence the distribution of different cyanobacteria that, in turn, leads to the development of different sedimentary facies and structures in fluvial carbonate systems.

AB  - The aims of this paper are to describe the state of the environmental knowledge of the terrestrial National Parks (NPs) in Italy and to assess their conservation status and their efficacy to deal with the pressures of land changes. We collected and analysed data regarding land units, vegetation series, old-growth forests, Important Plant Areas (IPAs) and changes in landscape conservation status, to provide a systemic overview of the condition of the NPs and to verify their effectiveness against pressures and impacts induced by human activities. Moreover, NPs were organised according to the ecoregional setting for a multi-scale interpretation of biodiversity baselines and indicators. The results highlight the essential role of NP system for biodiversity conservation in Italy. The long-term protection regime proved to be particularly effective as a means of conserving ageing forest communities, threatened vascular plants and contrasting threats posed by human-induced changes. However, this work points out the need for more detailed scientific data for a comprehensive assessment of the representativeness and effectiveness of the NP system.

AB  - The paper presents a study about the influence of two saprophage groups (Isopoda, Diplopoda) on leaf litter decomposition under different levels of humidification and chemical stress. Because of their worldwide distribution, we focused on the common pillbug Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille, 1804) (Isopoda, Armadillidiidae), and the common millipede species Rossiulus kessleri (Lohmander, 1927) (Julida, Julidae). The function of environment creation by the given saprophages, as destructors of dead plant matter, supporting such ecosystem services as soil fertility improvement and nutrients' turnover, is highlighted. To conduct the experiment, the animals were collected manually and using pitfall trapping. In order to bring the experimental conditions closer to the natural, the individuals were not sexed. The maximum consumption of leaf litter by woodlice was recorded in the conditions with adequate moisture (0.5 mL of distilled water per box) and amounted to 2.52 mg/10 individuals per day, which exceeds its consumption with low and increased moisture, respectively, by 1.82 and 1.24 times. As for the effect of interaction, the consumption of maple litter with optimal moisture (4.77 mg/10 individuals per day) was the greatest. The largest absolute difference between broad-leaved tree species in the average weight of leaf litter consumed by woodlice was between maple leaf litter and oak leaf litter, the minimum - between robinia leaf litter and oak leaf litter. According to the results of the obtained data (Diplopoda), it can be stated that there is a statistically significant effect of chemical stress and discrepancy of the average zinc content in the object of study (in Diplopoda and their faecal pellets). We found that the diet provided did not affect the distribution of zinc in Diplopoda under conditions of chemical stress. According to the results of pairwise comparisons, we determined that the zinc content in the Diplopoda clearly differs for control and almost every concentration of zinc sulfate solution - 0.03 and 0.15 g/L, the samples of which do not form a homogeneous group. The species composition, abundance and distribution in space of soil invertebrates are informative indicators which reflect the ecological state of soils, intensity in development of soil horizons as well as intensity of processes occurring in them.

AB  - Species composition of benthic macroalgal cover and the changes therein are indicators of the trophic state of aquatic ecosystems. On the other hand, mapping and knowledge of water depth in shallow water areas, not accessible by hydrographical ships, is important for several reasons. This study assessed the suitability of high spatial resolution multispectral and medium spatial resolution hyperspectral data for mapping water depth and benthic macroalgal cover in shallow coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. Results of this study indicate that use of multispectral satellite data with high spatial resolution is preferable to using hyperspectral medium resolution data in mapping benthic macroalgal cover in areas where the spatial heterogeneity is very high. In case of a single image and availability of in situ data, multispectral high spatial resolution (2.4 in) satellite QuickBird can provide more detailed information about benthic cover than was assumed based on the shape of reflectance spectra of different bottom types and spectral resolution of the sensor. Depth maps of shallow (less than 3 metres) waters proved to be reliable except in turbid water areas with no bottom visibility.

AB  - The preparation and high-throughput sequencing of cDNA libraries from samples of small RNA is a powerful tool to quantify known small RNAs (such as microRNAs) and to discover novel RNA species. Interest in identifying the small RNA repertoire present in tissues and in biofluids has grown substantially with the findings that small RNAs can serve as indicators of biological conditions and disease states. Here we describe a novel and straightforward method to clone cDNA libraries from small quantities of input RNA. This method permits the generation of cDNA libraries from sub-picogram quantities of RNA robustly, efficiently and reproducibly. We demonstrate that the method provides a significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous cloning methods while maintaining reproducible identification of diverse small RNA species. This method should have widespread applications in a variety of contexts, including biomarker discovery from scarce samples of human tissue or body fluids.

AB  - The paper presents a methodical approach to analysing the efficiency of regulatory policy levers. The authors of the article have conducted analyses of the integrated index of socio-economic development and the indicators of financial credit and monetary levers. The regression models that reflect the nature of the relations between regulatory policy levers and the integrated indicator of socio-economic development of the country have been developed, namely, the dependence of the integrated index of socio-economic development on the financial-credit and monetary levers of Ukraine in the period between 2009 and 2016. The results of the research have proved that the cumulative impact of levers creates conditions for the environment in which the state must take measures in order to ensure effective implementation of its regulatory policy.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to investigate the potential use of biological and ecological traits of macroinvertebrates as indicator systems of quality conditions in freshwater ecosystems. To provide a framework for the trait analysis, a data base was developed; it stored biological information about 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa. Twenty-two variables describing biological and ecological traits were resolved into a number of simple attributes. A fuzzy coding procedure was used to describe the link between taxa and variables. Three strategies, using simple descriptive statistics or multivariate ordination techniques, were examined in their abilities to demonstrate some of the characteristics of the environment and to bring out clear information on the rate of changes in habitats. We used the Loire River, France, as a specific example. Like faunal analyses, trait analyses showed that a major change occurred in the community in the upper reaches of the river, but transition zones that were not detected with faunal data alone, were discriminated. They corresponded to differences in combinations of biological and ecological traits of communities and were linked to tributary influences (e.g. the Allier-Loire confluence) or anthropogenic disturbances: dams (Grangent, Villerest) or urban zones (Le Puy, Tours). We concluded that the species trait approach had the potential to evaluate the actual state of ecosystems, to discriminate among different types of human impact, and to develop monitoring tools considering the functional diversity of communities.

AB  - This paper proposes the ratio between the entropy produced and the exergy stored by the biological component of an ecosystem (which may be called the specific entropy production or the specific dissipation of a community) as a tool for understanding the evolution of ecological systems. Specific dissipation, which may be taken as representing a renewed version of Odum's Schrodinger ratio, is here proposed as an indicator of ecosystems maturity as well as an ecological orientor whose minimisation is expected throughout ecosystem development. After having presented an empirical method for estimating the specific dissipation in lake ecosystems, it has been applied to the characterization of the development state of the communities of a set of shallow lakes which lye from oligotrophic to hyper-eutrophic conditions. The adequacy of the proposed indicator has been tested and discussed along two different ecological series: the seasonal progression of phytoplankton and the trophic gradient. The results confirm that the ratio is an appropriate indicator of ecosystem maturity and support the hypothesis that its minimisation is one of the primary "goals" of ecosystem development.

AB  - Ecosystem health assessment is an important method for obtaining information on ecosystem conditions, and it plays a vital role in preserving and enhancing ecosystem health status. In addition, it provides useful information and knowledge for urban agglomeration development decision makers. However, ecological phenomena often vary considerably from one observation to the next, which makes it difficult to distinguish different status of the ecosystem health. In this study, hidden Markov model (HMM) was employed to simulate the internal-external correlations of ecosystem status through establishing the relationships between internal ecological health level and combination state of external observation. Based on the statistics and land use data in 2001, 2007 and 2013, the Vigor-Organization-Resilience (VOR) framework was employed to identify the ecosystem health in Shanghai-Hangzhou Bay Metropolitan (SHBM), in which the ecosystem health state was considered as a hidden state that could be estimated according to the conditions of vigor, organization and resilience. In addition, two parameter learning cases including mathematical statistics and extensible sequence method were employed to solve the iterative convergence problem of parameters in short-time series of ecosystem health simulation. Results show that HMM not only provides a comparable descriptive ability to that of the VOR model, but also can monitor ecosystem health at the optimal grid scale in SHBM. The combination of HMM and VOR greatly expands the spatiotemporal characteristics and provides a new research approach for the study of ecosystem health assessment of urban agglomerations.

AB  - (Periphytic diatoms in a Brazilian eutrophic system (Irai reservoir, Parana state)). This floristic survey contributed to our knowledge of periphytic diatoms in a eutrophic reservoir in Parana state, and provided a basis for future works using diatoms as bioindicators of trophic water conditions. Samples were collected quarterly, over a year, by removing the biofilm attached to Polygonum sp. stems and to glass slides. The slides were placed in wooden frames and remained submersed for 30 days to colonize. The taxonomic study resulted in 11 new taxonomic records for Parana state among the 96 identified diatoms. The highest species diversity was found in the macrophyte samples. Achnanthidium minutissimum was dominant in most samples analyzed and considered tolerant of the eutrophic conditions in Irai reservoir. Fragilaria rumpens, Fragilaria vaucheriae var. capitellata and Gomphonema gracile were abundant. Ecological information on the species was obtained from the literature; 35% of the species were characteristic of aquatic systems in an advanced state of eutrophication, 18% of mesotrophic environments and 19% were classified as tolerant and indifferent to the trophic state of the environment.

AB  - 1. A sediment core from the shallow, hypertrophic Lake Sobygaard (mean depth similar to 1 m; [TP] 310 mug P L-1) was analysed for subfossil remains to reconstruct chironomid community changes in relation to the succession and disappearance of aquatic macrophytes.
   2. Species composition in the 1.10 m core indicates a succession from a 'naturally' eutrophic state to a hypertrophic state during recent centuries. Radiometric dating (Pb-210) Of the uppermost 20 cm of the sediment core (similar to 1932-93) indicates that sediment accumulation rate had doubled in recent decades.
   3. Changes in chironomid assemblages were in close agreement with changes in both diatoms and macrophyte remains in the same core. Distinct changes in chironomid communities reflect the eutrophication process and macrophyte succession through Chara, Ceratophyllum and Potamogeton dominance to the present state, with complete loss of submerged vegetation and dominance by phytoplankton.
   4. The co-occurrence and relationship between aquatic macrophyte diversity and recent subfossil chironomid assemblages were assessed from an additional 25 Danish lakes. There was good agreement between the macrophyte and chironomid-based lake groupings. Overall, a significant difference (P < 0.001) was found in chironomid assemblages among lakes in different macrophyte classes. In a pair-wise comparison, the poorly buffered mesotrophic lakes and the alkaline eutrophic lakes had significantly different chironomid assemblages.
   5. Chironomid taxa commonly reported to be associated with macrophytes (Cricotopus, Endochironomus and Glyptotendipes) were shown also to be indicators of highly productive lakes lacking abundant submerged vegetation.

AB  - Forest landscape restoration (FLR) is gaining ground as a novel, holistic approach to sustainable environmental management across developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, 30 countries have joined the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative to advance FLR goals. Although conceptually compelling, and despite efforts articulating initial implementation guidelines, divergent discourses and interpretations confound FLR translation into practice. We propose a characterization of FLR in practice using insights from political ecology; principles of ecological restoration and landscape sustainability science; and the philosophy, principles, and objectives of the FLR paradigm. Our qualitative analysis further draws on secondary data and insights from participant observation during FLR-related workshops. We build and organize the FLR characterization around answers to ten questions: why restoration; what purpose; for what desired outcomes; where (location and land uses); what spatial extent and scale(s); who; which techniques; how (approach/strategy); when and how long; and how much to achieve. We then assess early FLR strategic priorities for interventions across nine African countries and analyze five selected actual projects to illustrate use of the proposed FLR characterization framework. The illustrative characterization of both planned interventions and actual projects does not reflect all the proposed characteristics of FLR in practice. Missing features include the initial biophysical condition, the desired target ecosystem state, and evaluation dimensions, and ill-articulated aspects include cross-sectoral integrations. We contend that any significant differences between FLR conceptualization, including its principles, and the practical manifestations can undermine coherence, the value that the FLR approach adds, and its wider adoption. The proposed characterization of FLR in practice contributes to scholarly attempts to realign FLR conceptual philosophy, principles, and rhetoric to its practical manifestations in different contexts, and can inform future design of FLR undertakings for more inclusive landscape governance.

AB  - Overfishing, bycatch, and habitat loss and alteration during the late 19th century to the end of the 20th century caused significant declines in Atlantic Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus stock abundances along the Atlantic coast. To prevent further stock reductions, a coastwide harvest moratorium was implemented in 1998. With fishery-dependent data unavailable to inform stock management, fishery-independent surveys contribute vital information for monitoring population trends by providing data for evaluating the effectiveness of the moratorium and for informing recovery planning. In 2004, a standardized monitoring survey was developed to assess trends in the relative abundance of juvenile Atlantic Sturgeon in the Hudson River, New York. The multimesh anchored gill-net survey randomly sampled locations in soft, deep depositional areas of Haverstraw Bay from late February through early May. Predicted length-at-age relationships were used to infer annual age structure and to examine the relationships between age and annual catch rates. Generalized additive regression modeling was used to describe the relationships between the environmental variables and catch rates and to standardize the abundance index to account for variability in environmental conditions over time. Atlantic Sturgeon catch rates generally increased with increasing water temperature and salinity, and the standardized abundance index (accounting for environmental variability) was highly correlated with the nominal abundance index. In the 16 years of annual monitoring, there has been a significant increase in the relative abundance of juvenile Atlantic Sturgeon. The average catch rate in recent years (2012-2019) is more than twice that observed during the first 8 years (2004-2011) of the survey, as the effects of the moratorium are expected to be delayed due to the long maturation period of Atlantic Sturgeon. These trends suggest that juvenile Atlantic Sturgeon in the Hudson River may be recovering in response to the moratorium and demonstrate the need for long-term fisheries-independent monitoring to document abundance trends in slow-maturing, long-lived species.

AB  - Our interpretation of pollen and ostracode successions from four basins in south-central Illinois provides a new synthesis of palaeovegetation, palaeohydrology, and palaeoclimate for the period from the late Illinois Episode (about 130,000 years ago) to near the end of the Wisconsin Episode (about 25,000 years ago). Correlations of pollen biozones between Raymond, Pittsburg, and Bald Knob basins are the basis for identifying the late Illinois glacial, Sangamon interglacial, Wisconsin glacial, and Hudson interglacial episodes. Glacial episodes were identified primarily by the presence of Picea pollen and the ostracode Limnocythere friabilis, whereas interglacial episodes were identified by Quercus pollen and by the ostracodes Candona caudata and Heterocypris punctata. Within interglacial and glacial episodes, pollen and ostracode assemblages varied with changes in moisture balance. Local palaeohydrology was assessed primarily on the basis of environmental tolerance indices of ostracodes and the stable isotope (C,O) stratigraphy of ostracodal calcite. Regional moisture balance was assessed from multivariate analyses of the pollen successions. Three climatic regimes occurred during the Sangamon Episode. (1) One regime was characterised by precipitation exceeding evaporation that promoted basin overflow. This climate was inferred from the high percentages (generally >80%) of deciduous-forest pollen. Peaks in the abundance of Liquidambar and Fagus pollen indicate that winters may have been slightly warmer, and effective moisture slightly greater, than at present. (2) The second climatic regime was continental, similar to the present climate of Illinois in which precipitation is equal to or just less than evaporation. This climate is inferred from abundant Ambrosia pollen (40 to 60%) and abundant nektic (swimming) ostracode valves which suggest a shallow lake. These conditions probably developed in association with a 'heat-low' over the interior of North America during marine oxygen isotope stages 5e and 5c, Associated with the transition between the first two climates are fossils of the subtropical ostracode Heterocypris punctata and the giant tortoise Geochelone crassiscutata that suggest short periods in winter when polar low-pressure systems did not extend into Illinois as they do today. (3) The third climatic regime occur-red during the transition from the Sangamon interglacial episode to the Wisconsin glacial episode. A severely continental climate is indicated by the heat-tolerant ostracode Pelocypris tuberculatum, variable delta(18)O values of ostracode valves, and high environmental tolerance index values for the ostracode assemblages. The weedy Chenopodiaceae and Amaranthaceae families grew on exposed mudflats, The tree pollen associated with this type of climate included low percentages of Picea and Liquidambar, an assemblage that has no modem analogue, We suggest that this transitional climatic regime was associated with the large-scale changes in the climate system during marine oxygen isotope stage 4.

AB  - Macrobenthic communities in Chesapeake Bay, USA, have been intensively monitored since 1985. In 1996, the monitoring was expanded to include summertime stratified random sampling to produce unbiased estimators of community metrics that could be used to assess system wide trends in benthic habitat quality. From 1996 to 1998, two index approaches to assessing benthic habitat quality were used in the Virginia portion of Chesapeake Bay. One method relied on grab samples for calculation of the benthic index of biotic integrity (BIBI) based on macrobenthic community composition data. The other method used sediment profile camera images for calculation of the organism-sediment index (OSI) from image-derived data. On an annual basis, the mean for each of the indices were similar from year to year, indicating that the properties or processes that regulate benthic habitat quality were likely similar from 1996 to 1998. There were significant differences in the correspondence of the macrofaunal-based and image-based indices to classify a particular station as having stressed or good habitat quality. While the overall relationship between the scoring of each index for a station was significantly positive (1.4 odds ratio), when the BIBI indicated poor conditions existed at a station, the OSI tended to indicate good habitat quality at the station. This pattern was consistent with the hypothesis that benthic habitat quality (measured by the OSI) would improve before biotic integrity (measured by the BIBI). A high BIBI with low OSI, representing the opposite hypothesis, would be unlikely and rarely occurred. The formulation of macrofaunal-based BIBI and image-based OSI emphasized different aspects of the benthos-habitat relationship. The BIBI was community structure-oriented with an emphasis on species identity and richness. The OSI was process-oriented in that the images recorded the end products of biological and physical processes that structure the benthos. Indices such as BIBI and OSI that integrate structural and functional aspects of benthos hold promise as measures of benthic habitat quality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - Stream bioassessment studies usually use a single taxonomic group, most commonly fish or macroinvertebrates. However, differences in the life histories, habitat preferences, and physiological and behavioral traits of each assemblage may cause differences in their responses to environmental degradation. These factors can lead to discrepancies in overall assessments of ecological integrity. The Onondaga Lake Watershed (NY) has had a diverse history of pollution from multiple impacts, and the lake and several subsites are listed as USEPA Superfund sites. The response of fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages to environmental variables in the Onondaga Lake Watershed was assessed at 17 stream reaches in 2007, 2010, and 2011 using assemblage-specific metrics and indices of biotic integrity. Land use and substrate composition variables were significantly correlated (p < 0.05, r > vertical bar 0.3 vertical bar) with the first two macroinvertebrate PCA axes and were related to a downstream gradient of increased habitat degradation for the major tributaries. Water chemistry variables, canopy cover, and stream width were significantly correlated (p < 0.05, r > vertical bar 0.3 vertical bar) with the first two fish PCA axes. PCA axes for fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages were not significantly correlated, suggesting that the major environmental variables affecting fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages differed. Pearson correlations between the macroinvertebrate Biological Assessment Profile (BAP) and the fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), and the macroinvertebrate Percent Model Affinity (PMA) and IBI were not significantly correlated. The macroinvertebrate metrics Percent Model Affinity (PMA) and BAP were positively and significantly correlated with Visual Habitat Assessment (VHA) scores, and the fish IBI was not significantly correlated with the VHA, further illustrating differences of fish and macroinvertebrates in their response to environmental variables. Results suggest that the use of multiple assemblages may be warranted for future assessments of stream quality and the development of effective monitoring programs in the Onondaga Lake Watershed.

AB  - Energy-efficient transformations of national economies constitutes a mechanism that will facilitate the creation of an effective national social reproduction system. This paper investigates the national economic structure of Ukraine to determine the level of eco-destructive impacts caused by human and industrial activities at the following four levels: low, average, high and critical. Environmental risk assessment was the methodology adopted for evaluating the impacts of different kinds of economic activities in Ukraine. Three indicators used for determining the impact of eco-destructive activities are environmental costs, environmental cost intensity, and environmental risk. Using Sumy States as a case study, the investigation evaluated relevant ecological and economic indicators and determined the average annual environmental costs of production in Ukraine.

AB  - The free-flowing Clinch and Powell watershed in Virginia, USA, harbors a high number of endemic mussel and fish species but they are declining or going extinct at an alarming rate. To prioritize resource management strategies with respect to these fauna, a geographical information system was developed and various statistical approaches were used to relate human land uses with available fish, macroinvertebrate, and native mussel assemblage data. Both the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) family-level index, and the fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) were lowest in a subwatershed with the greatest coal mining activity (analysis of variance [ANOVA], p < 0,05). Limited analyses in two other sub watersheds suggested that urban and agricultural land uses within a specified riparian corridor were more related to mussel species richness and fish IBI than land uses in entire catchments. Based on land uses within a riparian corridor of 200 in X 2 kin for each biological site in the watershed, fish IBI was inversely related to percent cropland and urban area and positively related to pasture area (stepwise multiple regression, R-2 = 0.55, p < 0.05). Sites less than 2 km downstream of urban areas, 'major highways, or coal mine activities had a significantly lower mean IBI value than those more than 2 km away (ANOVA, p < .05). Land use effects included poorer instream cover and higher substrate embeddedness (t test, p < 0.05). Weaker land use relationships were observed for EPT and mussel species richness. Episodic spills of toxic materials, originating from transportation corridors, mines, and industrial facilities, also have resulted in local extirpations of native species, particularly mussels. The number of co-occurring human activities was directly related to stream elevation in the Clinch River, with more human land uses in headwater areas. Approximately 60% of known U.S. Fish and Wildlife mussel concentration sites in the watershed are located within 2 km of at least two land use sources identified as potentially stressful in our analyses. Our results indicate that a number of land uses and stressors are probably responsible for the decline in native species. However, protection of naturally vegetated riparian corridors may help mitigate some of these effects.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii has been described in several marine mammals around the world including numerous species of cetaceans, yet infection and transmission mechanisms in the marine environment are not clearly defined. The Israel Marine Mammal Research and Assistance Center has been collating a database of all marine mammal stranding events along the country's national coastlines since 1993. In this study, we describe the molecular detection and characterisation of T. gondii in three common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) including one case of coinfection with herpesvirus. The animals were found stranded on the Mediterranean coast of Israel in May and November 2013. In one of the three cases, the dolphin was found alive and admitted to intensive care. To our knowledge, this is the first report of T. gondii infection of marine mammals in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. As this parasite acts as an indicator for marine pollution and marine mammal health, we believe these findings add important information regarding the state of the environment in this region.

AB  - The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires that European Union Member States achieve "Good Environmental Status" (GES) in respect of 11 Descriptors of the marine environment by 2020. Of those, Descriptor 4, which focuses on marine food webs, is perhaps the most challenging to implement since the identification of simple indicators able to assess the health of highly dynamic and complex interactions is difficult. Here, we present the proposed food web criteria/indicators and analyse their theoretical background and applicability in order to highlight both the current knowledge gaps and the difficulties associated with the assessment of GES. We conclude that the existing suite of indicators gives variable focus to the three important food web properties: structure, functioning and dynamics, and more emphasis should be given to the latter two and the general principles that relate these three properties. The development of food web indicators should be directed towards more integrative and process-based indicators with an emphasis on their responsiveness to multiple anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - The World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List Index (RLI) is used to measure global trends in the status of biodiversity. We examined bow the index might be used to measure the trend in the status of indigenous breeding birds in British Columbia between 1992 and 2006 We followed the RLI method described by Butchart et al. (2004, 2007) as closely as possible. Because IUCV Red List assessments at the regional level are not available in British Columbia, we used NatureServe S (subnational) ranking data. We calculated three index trend lines. The first two of these allowed us to compare an index based on our original data to one based on data that had been retrospectively corrected, the latter produced a smooth, flat line. A third trend line, based on the corrected data but excluding species new to province since 194 7, produced a gently sloping downward trend. Ongoing immigration of bird species in and out of British Columbia added to the complexity of interpreting our regional RLI-type index, especially because our S-rank data did not incorporate transboundary "rescue" effects. Because the RLI is scaled so that the maximum value is based on a state in which all species are simultaneously ranked as least concern, it may exaggerate the highest potential status of intrinsically vulnerable species. A simpler, more intuitive graphic allows reporting that is less dependent on context. We believe the RLI approach holds useful innovation for an indicator of change in biodiversity within jurisdictional boundaries.

AB  - Despite the well-known thermodynamic traits of ecosystem functioning, their description by means of conventional physics should be regarded as incomplete, even if we take into account the most recent advancements in this field. The analytical difficulties in this field have been especially complex to get a reliable modeling of species diversity per plot (Hp) by endowing this indicator with a fully clear theoretical meaning. This article contributes to resolve such difficulties starting from (a) the previous proposal of an ecological state equation, and (b) the preceding empirical finding of an ecological equivalent of Planck's constant at the evolutionary scale. So, in the first instance, this article proposes an equation for density distributions of H-p values (EDH) based on a simple transformation of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for molecular velocity values (M-BDv). Our results indicate that the above-mentioned equation allows an appropriate fit between expected and observed distributions. Besides, the transformation from M-BDv to EDH establishes connections between species diversity and other indicators that are consistent with well-known ecological principles. This article, in the second instance, uses ED(H)s from a wide spectrum of surveys as an analytical framework to explore the nature and meaning of stationary trophic information waves (STIWs) whose stationary nature depends on the biomass-dispersal trade-off in function of Hp values (B-DTO-H) that characterizes the most of the explored surveys. B-DTO-H makes these surveys behave as ecological cavity resonators (ECR) by trapping functional oscillations that bounce back and forth between the two opposite edges of the ECR: from r-strategy (at low biomass and diversity, and high dispersal) to K-strategy, and vice versa. STIWs were obtained by using the spline-adjusted values from the arithmetical difference between standardized values of species richness (S) and evenness (J') in function of H-p values (i.e., a 2D scalar space H-p, S-J'). Twice the distance on the abscissas (2 Delta H-p) between successive extreme values on the ordinates (whatever a maximum or a minimum) along the above-mentioned spline adjustment was taken as the value of ecological wavelength (lambda(e)). lambda(e) was assessed in order to obtain the value of the ecological equivalent of Planck's constant (h(e)(ec)) at the intra-survey scale that was calculated as: h(e)(ec) = lambda(e) x m(e) x I-e; where m(e): individual biomass, and I-e: an ad-hoc indicator of dispersal activity. Our main result is that the observed value of h(e)(ec)'s mantissa is statistically equivalent to the mantissa of the physical Planck's constant (h= 6.62606957E-34J s) in all of the discontinuous (i.e., with interspersed categories in which n = 0) statistical density distributions of H-p values per survey. This means that h(e)(ec) = 6.626069574E phi J(e)/individual, where phi = -x(i) ,..., -3, -2, -1, 0,+1, +2, +3, ... , x(i) depending on the type of taxocenosis explored. That is to say, h(e)(ec) indicates the minimum amount of energy exchange allowed between two individuals.
   The exploration of the analytical meaning of this result in the final sections of the article explains why quantum mechanics (QM) is a useful tool in order to explain several key questions in evolutionary biology and ecology, as for example: the physical limit of adaptive radiation; the balance between competitive exclusion and functional redundancy to promote species coexistence by avoiding the negative effects of competitive exclusion; the apparent holes in the fossil record; the progression of body size along a wide spectrum of taxa as a general evolutionary trend; the non-continuous nature of net energy flow at the ecosystem level; the way in which the energy level is stabilized under stationary ecological conditions; the reasons of the higher sensitivity of high diversity ecosystems under environmental impact despite their higher stability under natural conditions; the tangible expression of complex concept as ecological inertia and elasticity; as well as the increased risk from pushing the biosphere until a rupture limit because of the potential discrete behavior of ecological resilience in the large scale due to the quantum nature of ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The third edition of the European Pharmacopoeia (effective from January 1(st), 1997) states that biological indicators are to be stored at specified temperatures and that an expiry date is to be set. In addition to that, biological indicators shall consist of a specified spore population with a certain resistance (D-value) against the sterilizing agent. For radiation sterilization the use of spores of Bacillus pumilus (e.g. ATCC 27142) is recommended. The number of viable spores per indicator should exceed 10(7) and the D-value should be 1.9 kGy and above. The use of biological indicators for routine monitoring of sterilization by ionizing radiation is in most cases not applicable and the use of biological indicators for routine monitoring of sterilization is mainly justifiable for gaseous sterilization procedures.
   To test deteriorating effects of prolonged storage times at various temperatures on biological indicators, indicators for monitoring gamma irradiation are suited best, as in contrast to steam- (time and temperature) and gas-sterilization process (time, temperature, relative humidity and gas concentration), only one parameter (adsorbed dose) for gamma-sterilization success has to be monitored. In the present investigation it could be demonstrated that storage of biological indicators for longer than the stated expiry date does neither affect the viability of these spores nor their resistance against the sterilizing agent. Compared to biological indicators which were not expired biological indicators used for more than one years after the expiry date led to comparable results.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture seeks to create an economically viable, socially supportive, and environmentally sound farming system. However, there is limited empirical research on measuring agricultural sustainability, its components, and spatial distribution. Drawing data from the 2012 Census of Agriculture, a confirmatory factor analysis helps identify a three-factor structure of sustainable farming across counties in the United States: the environmental sustainability component refers to practices that reduce environmental degradation; the economic dimension highlights the efficiency of agricultural production; and the social component identifies practices which tend to promote economic viability and social support for communities. A cluster analysis on factor score indexes further indicates that the typology of sustainable agriculture includes: a majority of counties in the high environment & low economy and moderate intensity categories are widespread in this country; a low environment & high economy group is concentrated in the Northern Great Plains and in Iowa and Illinois; a few counties in the extremely low environment & extremely high economy cluster are located along the Lower Mississippi Valley, and dispersed throughout the Midwest, California, and Florida; and a small number of counties in the high social group are primarily concentrated in the New England, along the Pacific Coast, and around the Northern Great Lakes. In general, an agroecosystem framework that focuses on the interplay between social and ecological process of the agricultural system provides insights at the systems level and explicitly interprets the core attributes of sustainable agriculture, both in definition and measurement.

AB  - Biological assessments that use the reference condition approach are based on the concept of comparing a site's observed biology to sites where disturbance is minimal or absent. However, in many regions of the world, such areas are scarce or nonexistent. In this study, an alternative approach proposed by Chessman and Royal for bioassessment without reference areas based on environmental filters was tested in Brazil. This approach assumes that key environmental features act in the selection of potential colonists, from a regional pool of taxa, based on the ecological traits (tolerances) possessed by each taxon. We developed the approach by: 1) determining the regional pool, based on a large Atlantic Forest biome database; 2) selecting environmental filters (elevation, original vegetation and soil type); and 3) including information on the tolerance and preferences of aquatic insects to these filters. With this information we were able to determine the expected taxon under natural conditions and compare with observed taxon, developing a predictive index (Observed/Expected). Although the model was intended to predict the fauna in regions without reference sites, we included reference areas to test the model responsiveness, precision and sensitivity. Our results indicated that the index was able to discriminate impairment classes (F=56.9; p<0,001), it has high precision due to low standard deviation across reference sites values (SD=0.098) and high sensitivity due the correlation with environmental variables that are sensitive to human alteration (r=0.74, p<0.01). Also, it was strongly correlated with multimetric indices developed for multiple watersheds in the state, showing agreement between the methods in relation to ecological quality classification. Even though the predictive index had performed well in our study, we make some considerations that may help to improve its sensitivity of similar methods that are being tested using the environmental filters approach.

AB  - Participatory management is a working method of paramount importance based on the principles of knowledge sharing and accountability for addressing the sustainable management of the fishery sector. To approach this multidimensional problem we applied two Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the Non-Structural Fuzzy Decision Support System (NSFDSS), which were applied incorporating uncertainty to generate probabilistic rankings. The NSFDSS technique was applied for the first time to address a fishery problem. Two surveys were carried out among Mediterranean Advisory Council (MEDAC) stakeholders with different backgrounds. By the two surveys we: (i) made an AHP test for exploring stakeholders' perception of the objectives and indicators used in the monitoring of the stocks, ecosystem, and fisheries, and (ii) introduced the NSFDSS technique, gathering feedback on stakeholders' preferences on management options for improving fishery sustainability (e.g., reducing discards, improving ecosystem state, and economic yield in the long term). In the AHP the respondents were asked to evaluate the importance of one objective against another according to a scale of semantic scores from 1 to 5, whereas a simpler scoring scale, with only three possible options, was used in the NSFDSS. The two MCDA methods were proven to be useful to elicit stakeholders' view on the potential effects of key issues on economic and environmental fishery sustainability. The results showed stakeholders' awareness of the fact that the reproductive potential should be secured by checking mortality and/or fishing intensity. Consistently, among the ecological indicators that are tracking the fisheries policy objectives, a higher rank was attributed to "mean size of the spawners," while cost efficiency was considered to be essential for improving profits. Regarding the economic indicators, stakeholders gave higher priority to "revenue" in comparison to 'production (catches)," which is a sign of awareness that increasing fish production does not necessarily turn into increased revenue. Among the different management strategies, "fleet withdrawal" (scraping) was considered as the worst option, while the "combination of measures" was considered to be the best alternative for achieving a sustainable fishery in the long term.

AB  - The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)(1) and the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan(2) (NCP) mandate protection of public health, we(fare, and the environment at Superfund hazardous waste sites. The NCP requires lead: response agenciesto integrate baseline risk assessments into the remedial process that "assess threats to the environment." EPA policy statements(3) direct regional offices to perform thorough, consistent ecological risk assessments, and stress the importance of coordination and technical consultation with the natural resource trustees.
   As a Federal natural trustee, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) role and responsibilities within the CERCLA process also are defined and mandated by Federal law. NOAA is responsible for identifying sites in the coastal zone that may affect natural resources, evaluating injury to trust resources, and providing technical advice on assessments and remedial and restoration alternatives. Statutes require lead cleanup agencies and trustee agencies to notify and coordinate with each other during CERCLA response. Over the past ten years, NOAA has gained valuable experience and technical expertise in environmental assessments and in evaluating contaminated aquatic environments. NOAA fulfills its responsibilities through an effective network of Coastal Resource Coordinators (CRCs) who can rapidly respond to local technical requirements and priorities, and coordinate effectively with technical and trustee representatives. In addition to CRCs, an interdisciplinary support group provides technical expertise in the scientific disciplines required to respond to the needs of regional activities. NOAA provides CRCs to coastal EPA regional offices for technical support, and to act as liaisons with Federal and state natural resource trustee agencies. The CRCs help EPA and other lead response agencies identify and assess risks to coastal resources from hazardous waste sites and to develop cost-effective strategies to minimize those risks.
   Notification of trustees of potential natural resource injuries and coordination of subsequent investigations helps Federal and stare trustees to carry out their responsibilities effectively. Trustees' early involvement in the scoping of ecological risk assessments ensures that assessments and the entire remedial process adequately evaluate the risk to trust resources. Coordination throughout the process makes if easier to develop cost-effective and protective remedies that enhance the recovery of natural resources. Examples of NOAA's successful coordination and cooperative ecological risk assessments will be presented in briefcase studies for both EPA and Department of Defense (DOD) lead sites.

AB  - Drought stress is the most important production constraint in maize (Zea mays L.), especially in rainfed agriculture. To improve productivity of rainfed maize, the development of hybrids with tolerance to drought stress is an important objective in maize breeding programs. The present study was undertaken to identify maize hybrids that perform better under drought stress and drought-free conditions by using various selection indices. These selection indices were calculated on the basis of yield (t ha(-1)) performance of hybrids measured under drought stress and optimum environments. A set of 38 cultivars was evaluated at 10 environments (representing five each of drought stress and optimum growing conditions). The average reduction in grain yield due to drought stress was 52%. Effects of genotype, environment and their interaction were significant sources of variation in detemaining grain yield, respectively explaining 5.0-7.4%, 55.0-60.2% and 12.0-15.0% of total variation in yield under drought-stress and drought-free conditions. Of eight select ion indices considered for study, three indices such as harmonic mean, geometric mean, and stress tolerance index were identified as suitable for selection of genotypes capable of performing well both under drought-stress and drought-free environments. Drought response index and drought resistance index were found useful in identifying hybrids that performed better under drought stress. Stress susceptibility index was negatively correlated with yield measured under drought stress. Stress susceptibility index could be used as selection index hut only in combination with yield performance data under water-deficit conditions in order to identify drought-tolerant hybrids with reasonable productivity. Test weight, shelling percentage, days to maturity, and ear girth were found to be useful traits for improving yield performance across diverse environments. Cultivation of identified drought-tolerant hybrids would be useful to enhance maize productivity in drought-stress environments.

AB  - A key component of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is explicit consideration of trade-offs. Ecosystem models can be used to quantify trade-offs and focus discussion around objectives. Given large structural uncertainties inherent in ecosystem models, however, comparative approaches are recommended to identify results that are robust to model formulation. We developed ecosystem models of the continental shelf and slope of New South Wales, Australia, using two ecosystem modelling frameworks, Atlantis and Ecopath with Ecosim. The models were calibrated to emulate large-scale changes in ecosystem structure between 1976 and 1996, as predicted by data from fishefy-independent trawl surveys. Calibrated models were projected forward under a range of "optimal" fishing efforts designed to achieve economic, conservation or biodiversity objectives. While there were large differences in model predictions for individual species, the models gave very similar qualitative results when ranking fishing policies and describing trade-offs. Our results illustrate the importance of identifying fishery objectives before build-up of fleet capacity, and the need to consider trade-offs when simultaneously stating multiple ecosystem-level goals. Our finding that structurally-distinct ecosystem models can provide consistent qualitative advice highlights the capacity of ecosystem models for informing strategic management questions, even in the presence of considerable uncertainty in ecosystem-level processes.

AB  - Fully realizing the enormous potential of stem cells requires developing efficient bioprocesses and optimizations founded in mechanobiological considerations. Here, we emphasize the importance of mechanotransduction as one of the governing principles of stem cell bioprocesses, underscoring the need to further explore the behavioral mechanisms involved in sensing mechanical cues and coordinating transcriptional responses. We identify the sources of intrinsic, extrinsic, and external noise in bioprocesses requiring further study, and discuss the criteria and indicators that may be used to assess and predict cell-to-cell variability resulting from environmental fluctuations. Specifically, we propose a conceptual framework to explain the impact of mechanical forces within the cellular environment, identify key cell state determinants in bioprocesses, and discuss downstream implementation challenges.

AB  - This research focuses on the study of alpine ponds using an integrative approach (water chemistry, hydrological properties and communities' dynamics). Exploring the relations between abiotic factors and the planktonic communities, this work shows the inadequacy of current ecological quality assessment methods for lentic habitats in extreme environments and gives insights into future conservation concerns.
   Serra da Estrela is Portugal's mainland highest mountain, with distinctive geological, climatic and geomorphological characteristics which play a key role on surface and groundwater resources. These mountains have the largest set of glacial ponds of Portugal and are scarcely studied. Besides, there are concerns of possible impacts of the use of salts in road de-icing on ponds' biotic communities. This research intends to characterize the hydrology of five Mediterranean alpine ponds and assess their planktonic communities. The biotic index proposed by the Water Framework Directive for lentic systems was used to check its applicability to these systems. Sampling was conducted monthly from June to November 2015 alongside with hydrological characterization. Water parameters and nutrients' content were quantified. Phytoplankton and macrozooplankton were identified. Ponds' water level is controlled by precipitation (input) and evaporation, infiltration and streamflow (output). Ponds were in good ecological quality. However, the current ecological assessment tools proposed by the WFD for lentic systems do not fit alpine ponds, showing a gap in the current methods. Salts used for road de-icing did not impact the communities and the ecological state of ponds. Phytoplankton was dominated by Cyanobacteria, Dinophyceae and Bacillariophyceae; Cyclopoida was the most abundant zooplanktonic group. For macrozooplankton, RDA shows association between cladocerans and phosphorus content. Phosphorus changes promoted shifts in zooplankton, what may be of major concern from a conservation point of view, once alpine ponds and its species are still mostly unknown. Efforts should be done to develop tools to classify aquatic ecosystems from harsh environments.

AB  - For normal life, many different substances are needed, among which vitamins play an important role. Everyone knows that the word "vitamin" comes from the Latin "vita" - life. This name is not accidental at all [1].
   Vitamins are low molecular weight organic compounds, very small amounts of which are required for the implementation of various metabolic processes in the body. Most vitamins are indispensable because are not synthesized in the human body. In their natural state, they can be found in very small quantities in all foods of organic origin [1,2].
   Insufficient intake of vitamins from food is a global problem, and not seasonal, as it is mistakenly believed. For a number of reasons, a modern person cannot get them in the right amount with food. Inadequate nutrition, physical inactivity lead to metabolic disorders in the body and increase the risk of developing serious diseases [3,4,5,6].
   One of the main problems faced by drug manufacturers is sometimes a short shelf life. In order to preserve the pharmacological properties of drugs, they add preservatives to them or place them in a vacuum package. To date, the most effective way to solve this problem is to use a modified atmosphere with nitrogen.
   The stability of solutions of easily oxidizable substances increases significantly if they are filled in an inert gas environment, for example, carbon dioxide, nitrogen or argon. This filling allows you to remove oxygen, this oxidizing agent that destroys unstable substances. The following factors influence the reduction of shelf life:
   oxidative processes,
   development of molds,
   reproduction of microorganisms.
   All oxidative processes in the packaging of a medicinal product occur under the influence of oxygen. As a result of this reaction, medications deteriorate. With the help of a pure nitrogen environment, it is possible to reduce the O-2 content to a minimum level [7].

AB  - Background: Acquiring greater understanding of the factors causing changes in vegetation structure-particularly with the potential to cause regime shifts - is important in adaptively managed conservation areas. Large trees (>= 5 m in height) play an important ecosystem function, and are associated with a stable ecological state in the African savanna. There is concern that large tree densities are declining in a number of protected areas, including the Kruger National Park, South Africa. In this paper the results of a field study designed to monitor change in a savanna system are presented and discussed.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Developing the first phase of a monitoring protocol to measure the change in tree species composition, density and size distribution, whilst also identifying factors driving change. A central issue is the discrete spatial distribution of large trees in the landscape, making point sampling approaches relatively ineffective. Accordingly, fourteen 10 m wide transects were aligned perpendicular to large rivers (3.0-6.6 km in length) and eight transects were located at fixed-point photographic locations (1.0-1.6 km in length). Using accumulation curves, we established that the majority of tree species were sampled within 3 km. Furthermore, the key ecological drivers (e. g. fire, herbivory, drought and disease) which influence large tree use and impact were also recorded within 3 km.
   Conclusions/Significance: The technique presented provides an effective method for monitoring changes in large tree abundance, size distribution and use by the main ecological drivers across the savanna landscape. However, the monitoring of rare tree species would require individual marking approaches due to their low densities and specific habitat requirements. Repeat sampling intervals would vary depending on the factor of concern and proposed management mitigation. Once a monitoring protocol has been identified and evaluated, the next stage is to integrate that protocol into a decision-making system, which highlights potential leading indicators of change. Frequent monitoring would be required to establish the rate and direction of change. This approach may be useful in generating monitoring protocols for other dynamic systems.

AB  - This paper describes the trend of utilizing oil palm residue, i.e. the empty fruit bunches (EFB) left after extraction of the palm oil, using a case study of Malaysia, which is one of the world's major palm oil producers, and discusses the environmental performance of recycling technologies being developed in Malaysia for fuel, fiber, and fertilizer. Seven technologies are analyzed: ethanol production, methane recovery, briquette production, biofuel for combined heat and power (CHP) plants, composting, medium density fiberboard (MDF) production, and pulp and paper production. The life cycle assessment (LCA) method is used to discuss the environmental impacts of these technologies for adding value to this biomass. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to determine the land use effects for the various technologies utilizing EFB and to estimate the energy generation potential of raw EFB in CHP plants and methane production. Among the technologies for energy production, CHP plants have the best performance if the electricity generated is connected to the national grid, with superior benefits in the majority of impact categories compared to briquette, methane, and ethanol production. Overall, we find that methane recovery and composting are more environmentally friendly than other technologies, as measured by reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Pulp and paper, and MDF production are favorable technologies for land use impacts; however, they have intense primary energy requirements, chemical use in the processes, and emissions from their waste treatment systems. Our results provide information for decision makers when planning for sustainable use of oil palm biomass. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stable (i.e. non-radioactive) carbon-isotope composition (delta C-13) in fuels has been extensively used as an indicator of the processes leading to the generation of their parent crude-oil. With the example of those used in Paris (France), this preliminary study isotopically characterizes fuels and combustibles, as well as the isotopic relations existing with their combustion by-products, i.e. gases (CO2) and particles (bulk carbon). Results show that delta C-13 in fuels is clearly related to their physical state, with natural gas being strongly depleted in C-13 while coal yields the highest delta C-13, and liquid fuels display intermediate values. This relation is also valid for combustion gases, although delta C-13 values of combustion particles form a homogeneous range within which no clear distinction is observed. Combustion processes are accompanied by carbon-isotope fractionation (noted Delta C-13) resulting from the combustion being incomplete. Carbon-isotope fractionation is strictly negative (Delta C-13 = -1.3%) during the formation of combustion gases, but generally positive in particle formation even if values close to zero are observed. Using simple mixing equations for describing the closed system formed by fuel, CO2 and carbonaceous particles, we discuss the carbon budget for spark-ignition (unleaded gasoline) and diesel engines. Stable carbon isotopes corroborate the already-proved superior efficiency of diesel combustion mode compared with spark ignition, as carbon is preferentially transformed into CO2.

AB  - The research was carried out at the Russian Research Institute of Fruit Crop Breeding (VNIISPK). Physiological methods of diagnostics of drought resistance and winter hardiness in red currant varieties and selected forms of Ribes vulgare Lam. (Jonkheer Van Tets, Roza, Vika), Ribes petreum Wulf (Hollandische Rote, Natalie, 1518-37-14) and Ribes multiflorum Kit. (Dana, 1426-21-80) of different genetic, ecological and geographical origin were used. Drought resistance and winter hardiness of red currants were determined in the Central region of Russia during the dormancy and vegetation periods. The prospects of using indicators of water regime in the assessment of plant state to adverse environmental factors were confirmed. The weather resistance is determined by the content of the bound water and water-retaining capacity in the plants. According to the water regime indications a high level of winter hardiness and drought resistance was revealed in the progeny of Ribes petreum Wulf. and Ribes multiflorum Kit. The representatives of Ribes vulgare Lam. showed weak adaptability to abiotic factors.

AB  - Ecosystem-based management (EBM) requires more extensive information than single-species management. Active underwater acoustic methods provide a means of collecting a wealth of ecosystem information with high space-time resolution. Worldwide fisheries institutes and agencies are carrying out regular acoustic surveys covering many marine shelf ecosystems, but these data are underutilized. In addition, more and more acoustic data collected by vessels of opportunity are becoming available. To encourage their use for EBM, we provide a brief introduction to acoustic and complementary data collection methods in the water column, and review current and potential contributions to monitoring population abundance and biomass, spatial distributions, and predator-prey relationships. Further development of acoustics-derived indicators is needed. We review and propose indicators for assessing and monitoring zooplankton, population dynamics of fish and other nekton, and changes in diversity and food-web functioning. Acoustic methods have the potential to make a strong contribution to EBM. Evaluation of new indicators and suitable reference points in different ecosystems are the current challenges.

AB  - River restoration aims to re-establish the ecological integrity of a river ecosystem. However, restoration measures are nowadays mainly a reactive, site-by-site activity, driven by a single driver (e.g. fisheries, flood protection) rather than based on strategic planning. This study presents an integrated search strategy to identify stream systems where present environmental (e.g. natural flow, sufficient bed load material) and socio-economic (e.g. public attitude) template conditions favour the eco-morphological restoration of floodplains and their biocoenosis. This 'pre-screening' process reveals where the greatest benefits (judged according to ecological and socio-economic criteria) are to be expected and thus justify further specific and detailed investigations. It helps to set priorities and thus avoid inefficiency. The search strategy presented in this study is designed to perform a pre-screening process at national level. It is based particularly on spatially explicit information and is balanced between accuracy and costs. A hierarchical filter process combines the facilities of GIS with multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to generate restoration suitability maps. The filter process is based on a list of criteria and indicators that capture the ecological key factors that drive floodplain restoration (hydrology, bed load, connectivity, biodiversity, water quality), as well as crucial socio-economic aspects (e.g. flood protection, public attitude) that need to be taken into account when planning for floodplain restoration. Inevitable limitations, arising from the transfer from theory into practice, are accepted, as the search strategy is dedicated to practical application. A modified Delphi process survey of nine river ecology experts was used to assess the appropriateness of each indicator and to estimate the single indicator suitability function. We used ModelBuilder 1.0a (an ArcView extension) to integrate different data layers into a single Ecological Restoration Suitability Index (ERSI) layer. The practical application of the integrative search strategy for floodplain restoration is illustrated through a case study from the Rhone-Thur Project in Switzerland. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Context The Australian cotton industry has committed to (1) understanding the biodiversity value of remnant native vegetation on cotton farms, (2) funding independent, evidence-based assessments of the industry's sustainability and environmental performance, and (3) investing in research that reports against recognised sustainability indicators.
   Aims The present study reports the results of an industry-wide survey to benchmark bird diversity in native vegetation on cotton farms spanning a 1260-km north-south subcontinental gradient from Central Queensland (Qld) to Southern New South Wales (NSW).
   Methods Between September and November 2014, birds were sampled twice on separate days in 2-ha quadrats (20 min per census) in eight remnant vegetation types as well as in native revegetation at 197 sites on 60 cotton farms spread across the principal cotton-growing zones (Central Qld, Border Rivers, Macquarie and Southern NSW) in inland eastern Australia.
   Key results We recorded 185 bird species in remnant and planted native vegetation on cotton farms. Species richness of bird communities declined from north to south. Bird community composition was similar in the three southern zones, differing somewhat in the north. The most frequent species were large (>60 g), readily detected landbirds common in agricultural districts, but 26 of the 53 extant species of conservation concern in the study region were also recorded, including 16 species of declining woodland birds. Bird composition, abundance, richness and diversity differed among the nine native vegetation types, with maximal and minimal bird abundance and diversity metrics recorded in river red gum-dominated riparian vegetation and grassland respectively.
   Conclusions Each remnant vegetation community had a generally distinct bird assemblage, indicating that all vegetation types contribute to regional biodiversity in cotton-growing zones in inland eastern Australia. Appropriate on-farm management of all remnant and planted native vegetation will assist regional biodiversity conservation.
   Implications For the Australian cotton industry to meet its stated environmental responsibilities, growers should be encouraged to prioritise the conservation management of remnant, riparian and planted native vegetation on cotton farms and the monitoring of bird species as an indicator of regional biodiversity response.

AB  - The response of zooplankton assemblages to variations in the water quality of four man-made lakes, caused by eutrophication and siltation, was investigated by means of canonical correspondence analysis. Monte Carlo simulations using the CCA eigenvalues as test statistics revealed that changes in zooplankton species composition along the environmental gradients of trophic state and abiogenic turbidity were highly significant. Brachionus calyciflorus, Thermocyclops sp. and Argyrodiaptomus sp. were good indicators of eutrophic conditions, whereas B. dolabratus, Keratella tropica and Hexarthra mira were good indicators of high turbidity due to suspended sediments. Overall, our results showed that changes in the water quality of man-made lakes in a tropical semi-arid region have significant effects on the structure of zooplankton assemblages that can potentially affect the functioning of these ecosystems.

AB  - The Peruvian Central Andes is a highly important area for potato production. Assessing the potato yield gap and the potential yield is an essential step towards sustainable crop intensification. Fifty-eight smallholder potato farmer's plots in total were monitored at field level during the 2005-2008 and 2010-2015 rainy cropping seasons. All the main crop management inputs were registered. Three field experiments (on-farm trials) established during the 2014-2017 rainy cropping seasons were used to calibrate (2014-2016) and validate (2016-2017) the SUBSTOR-potato model under potential conditions. Potential potato yield (Y-p) was estimated for each individual field pilot plot (in kg ha(-1)) based on the calibrated and validated crop model. Yield gaps (Y-g) were calculated as the difference between Yp and farmers' actual yield (Y-a). A classification tree-based model predicting the potato gap quantiles was used to elucidate the main biophysical and crop management components inducing Y-g.
   Performance of the SUBSTOR-potato model showed a close agreement of simulated crop biomass, tuber yield, and N-uptake (i.e. N-demand) with the measured data under potential conditions. Redefined index of agreement were 0.84 and 0.80 while the associated mean square error were 2232 and 916 kg tuber dry weight (DW) ha(-1) for the calibration and validation, respectively. The mean farmers' actual DW yield was 7118 kg ha(-1), however, a high variability due to heterogeneous biophysical conditions and crop management was found (from 710 to 18,885 kg DW ha-1). The potato Y-g ranged from 0.1 to 95.8% of the potential yield ((x) over bar = 42.1%, (x) over tilde = 46.0%, a = 28.14% and CV = 0.67), hence there is an important difference that needs to be reduced. The classification tree analysis showed that inorganic N is the main yield explaining factor. While large yield gaps (Fourth quantile) are induced by low Inorganic N ( < 88 kg ha(-1)) and scarce Human Labour energy ( < 4196 MJ ha(-1)), small yield gap (First quantile) is mainly attributed to high N-inputs ( >= 139 kg ha(-1) inorganic and >= 154 kg ha(-1) organic). Third and Second quantiles (mid potato yield gaps) were characterized by more intricate nutrient input use, being difficult to classify; the Third quantile was partially explained by Inorganic N ( < 139 kg ha(-1)), while part of the Second quantile by Extractable soil phosphorus ( < 7.3 mg kg(-1)) and Inorganic N ( < 139 kg ha(-1)). This classification can be helpful to diagnose the main site-specific crop management and biophysical recommendations towards closing the potato yield gap.
   The analysis suggests that there is opportunity to enhance potato actual yields in the study zone. More rational amount of inputs together with best management practices might improve potato productivities. However, sustainable potato intensification should be complemented with the expected quantification of environmental burdens under the local socio-economic constraints.

AB  - 1. Offspring sex ratio may be an unpredictable component of life history that might select for behavioural plasticity in parental care. If the parents do not have such plasticity and the two sexes of offspring differ in size, individuals in a brood or litter biased towards the larger sex offspring may suffer from food shortage. Sibling sex ratio could also affect the young through asymmetric sex-related sibling competition.
   2. We created single-sex broods of sexually size-dimorphic Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus L.) with mixed-sex control broods in order to test whether parents have behavioural plasticity to respond to the sex ratio of their brood and whether smaller male chicks suffer from reduced health status because their larger female siblings outrival them in sibling competition. The experiment was conducted during two years (2000 and 2001) that differed in the abundance of voles, the main natural prey of kestrels.
   3. No obvious effects of the brood sex ratio manipulation on parental effort were detected, as there were no differences in prey delivery rate, biomass of prey brought to the nest, body mass or heterophile/lymphocyte ratio of the parents.
   4. Female chicks in all-female broods had lower haematocrit levels than those in mixed-sex broods in a year of low vole abundance. As haematocrit is an index of nutritional condition and health state, this result indicates that in the year of low vole abundance the female chicks in all-female broods fledged in poorer condition than those in mixed-sex broods.
   5. These results indicate that when the parents do not alter their level of parental effort in response to the sex ratio of their brood, the young in a brood biased towards the larger sex offspring can be reared successfully when food is abundant, while they may suffer under food shortage situations.
   6. Kestrel chicks of both sexes had low haematocrit levels and T cell-mediated immune responses in the year of low vole abundance. This result indicates that poor health state at fledging may provide a causal link for low recruitment of kestrels hatched in years of low vole abundance.

AB  - The Clean Water Act expressed its goals in terms of restoring and preserving the physical, chemical and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. Integrity hats been defined as the ability of the water body's ecological system to support and maintain a balanced integrated, adaptive community of organisms comparable to that of a natural biota of the region. Several indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) have been developed to measure quantitatively the biotic composition and. hence. the integrity. Integrity can be impaired by discharges of pollutants from point and nonpoint sources and by other pollution-related to watershed/landscape and channel stresses. including channel and riparian zone modifications and habitat impairment. Various models that link the stressors to the biotic assessment endpoints, i.e_ the IBIs. have been presented and discussed. Simple models that link IBIS directly to single or multiple surrogate stressors such as percent imperviousness acre inadequate because they may not represent a true cause-effect proximate relationship. Furthermore. some surrogate landscape parameters are irreversible and the relationships cannot be used for development of plans for restoration of the water body integrity.
   A concept of a layered hierarchical model that will link the watershed, landscape and stream morphology pollution stressors to the biotic assessment endpoints (IBIS) is described. The key groups of structural components of the model are: IBIS and their metrics in the top layer, chemical water and sediment risks and a habitat quality index in the layer below, in-stream concentrations in water and sediments and channel/habitat impairment parameters in the third layer, and watershed/landscaper pollution generating stressors. land use change rates, and hydrology in the lowest layer of stressors. A modified and expanded Maximum Species Richness concept is developed and used to reveal quantitatively the functional relationships between the top two layers of the structural components and parameters of the model.

AB  - The concept of naturalness was developed to assess to what degree landscapes represent a natural state. Protected areas are often regarded as the remnants of untouched landscapes although many landscapes commonly perceived as pristine have a long history of human impact. Here, we introduced a historical perspective into the concept of naturalness and the analysis of the effectiveness of protected areas by analyzing historical trajectories in land-cover and forest communities for the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on Michigan's Upper Peninsula (USA). Distribution of land-cover and forest community types was reconstructed for pre-settlement time (around 1850), the height of agricultural expansion (1928), and modern conditions (2000). Naturalness of the landscape was assessed by analyzing similarity between pre-settlement and current conditions and by assessing landscape continuity (1850-1928-2000). We compared changes in the strictly protected park core zone with those in the inland buffer zone with ongoing sustainable logging, and a not protected area adjacent to the park. Forest was the dominant land-cover type over the entire study period. We detected a gradient in land-cover continuity from the core zone (81 % continuity) to the inland buffer zone (74 %) and the area outside the park (66 %). Northern hardwood was the dominating forest type in all time points with high continuity (76 %). In contrast, pine forests show a more dynamic pattern with more than 50 % of the initial forests switching to non-forest or early succession forest types by 1928. More than half of the study area was considered as "natural virgin" (no changes in land-cover and forest community type) with a higher portion within the park than in the adjacent area. In contrast, areas with low naturalness are more abundant outside the park. Our study demonstrates the value of integrating historical information into naturalness assessments and the results provide useful information for future park management. More broadly speaking, our study advances research on the effectiveness of protected areas, by going beyond simple measures of averted deforestation, and introducing approaches to directly measure naturalness.

AB  - Due to rapid urbanization, industrialization and population growth, wetland area in China has shrunk rapidly and many wetland ecosystems have been reported to degrade during recent decades. Wetland health assessment could raise the public awareness of the wetland condition and guide policy makers to make reasonable and sustainable policies or strategies to protect and restore wetland ecosystems. This study assessed the health levels of wetland ecosystem at the Hangzhou Bay, China using the pressure-state-response (PSR) model through synthesizing remote sensing and statistical data. Ten ecological and social-economic indicators were selected to build the wetland health assessment system. Weights of these indicators and PSR model components as well as the normalized wetland health score were assigned and calculated based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. We analyzed the spatio-temporal changes in wetland ecosystem health status during the past 20 years (1990-2010) from the perspectives of ecosystem pressure, state and response. The results showed that the overall wetland health score was in a fair health level, but displayed large spatial variability in 2010. The wetland health score declined from good health level to fair health level from 1990 to 2000, then restored slightly from 2000 to 2010. Overall, wetland health levels showed a decline from 1990 to 2010 for most administrative units. The temporal change patterns in wetland ecosystem health varied significantly among administrative units. Our results could help to clarify the administrative responsibilities and obligations and provide scientific guides not only for wetland protection but also for restoration and city development planning at the Hangzhou Bay area.

Fish were sampled from three sites along a contaminant gradient In 2009, body length and mass, condition factor, gonadosomatic index, and hematocrit were measured in males and females; liver and gonad tissue were collected from males for histological analyses; and organ composites were analyzed for contaminant content in males. In 2010, additional data were collected for males and females, including external fish condition assessment, histopathologies of spleen, kidney and gill and, for males, liver contaminant content. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that biological traits in males, but not females, differed among sites in 2009 and 2010. Discriminant function analysis indicated that site-related differences among male populations were relatively small in 2009, but in 2010, when more variables were analyzed, males differed among sites in regards to kidney, spleen, and liver histopathologies and gill parasites. Kidney tubular hyperplasia, liver and spleen macrophage aggregations, and gill parasites were generally more severe in the downstream sites compared to the reference location. The contaminant content of male livers was also generally higher downstream, and the legacy pesticide hexachlorobenzene and flame retardants BDE-47 and BDE-154 were the primary drivers for site discrimination. However, bivariate correlations between biological variables and liver contaminants retained in the discriminant models failed to reveal associations between the two variable sets. In conclusion, whereas certain non-reproductive biological traits and liver contaminant contents of male Largescale Sucker differed according to an upstream-downstream gradient in the lower Columbia River, results from this study did not reveal the specific environmental factors responsible for the differences in health status among fish populations.

AB  - Dispersal evolves as an adaptive mechanism to optimize individual fitness across the landscape. Specifically, dispersal represents a mechanism to escape fitness costs resulting from changes in environmental conditions. Decades of empirical work suggest that individuals use local habitat cues to make movement decisions, but theory predicts that dispersal can also evolve as a fixed trait, independent of local conditions, in environments characterized by a history of stochastic spatiotemporal variation. Until now, however, both conditional and fixed models of dispersal evolution have primarily been evaluated using emigration data (stay vs. leave), and not dispersal distances: a more comprehensive measure of dispersal. Our goal was to test whether conditional or fixed models of dispersal evolution predict variation in dispersal distance in the stream salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus. We quantified variation in habitat conditions using measures of salamander performance from 4 yr of spatially explicit, capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data across three headwater streams in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in central New Hampshire, USA. We used body condition as an index of local habitat quality that individuals may use to make dispersal decisions, and survival probability estimated from multistate CMR models as an index of mortality risk resulting from the long-term history of environmental variation. We found that dispersal distances increased with declining survival probability, indicating that salamanders disperse further in risky environments. Dispersal distances were unrelated to spatial variation in body condition, suggesting that salamanders do not base dispersal distance decisions on local habitat quality. Our study provides the first empirical support for fixed models of dispersal evolution, which predict that dispersal evolves in response to a history of spatiotemporal environmental variation, rather than as a conditional response to current habitat conditions. More broadly, this study underscores the value of assessing alternative scales of environmental variation to gain a more complete and balanced understanding of dispersal evolution.

AB  - The ability to classify the biological condition of unsurveyed streams accurately would be an asset to the conservation and management of streams. We compared the ability of 5 modeling methods (classification and regression trees, conditional inference trees, random forests [RF], conditional random forests [cRF], and ordinal logistic regression) to predict stream biological condition (very poor, poor, fair, or good) based on benthic macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity data taken from the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Predictor variables included land use and land cover (e.g., impervious surface, row-crop agriculture, and population density) and landscape measures (annual precipitation and watershed area). We included 1561 sites on small nontidal streams in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. We used 1248 sites (80%) as a training data set to build models and 313 sites (20%) as an independent evaluation data set. RF and cRF models most accurately predicted observed integrity scores in the evaluation data set, but we selected the cRF as the best model because of weaknesses in the RF model (e.g., biased variable selection). Percent impervious surface was the most important variable in the cRF model, and the probability that a site was in very poor or poor biological condition increased rapidly as % impervious cover increased up to 20%. When applied to predict stream biological conditions in all 7908 small nontidal stream reaches in the study area, the cRF model predicted that 33.8% were in fair, 29.9% in good, 22.7% in poor, and 13.6% in very poor biological condition. Our analyses can be used to manage and conserve freshwater and estuarine resources of Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Model predictions for unsurveyed streams can help target field studies to identify high-quality streams deserving of conservation and impaired streams in need of restoration.

AB  - This paper assesses the potential agri-environmental impacts on the United States of liberalizing world agricultural trade. We examine how the elimination of all agricultural policy distortions in all trading countries might influence agricultural production decisions and subsequently affect environmental quality in the United States. The estimated changes in U.S. agricultural production under the ambitious assumption of full agricultural trade liberalization are well within the bounds of average annual variation for agricultural commodity production (Fig. 2). In this context, our results suggest that, for the United States as a whole, environmental impacts stemming from such hypothesized trade shocks would also fall within the average annual variation. This generalization aside, we note that the estimated changes in commodity production and subsequent environmental impacts are not uniform across the landscape, with increases in agricultural production and the environmental indicators in some regions or sectors and decreases in others.

AB  - Monitoring the health of ecosystems is imperative to achieve sustainability. In this, ecological indicators have a crucial and evolving role to play. Although indicators are vital to monitoring the state and trends of ecosystems and the consequences of anthropogenic pressures, they may not lead to necessary action unless they are coupled with identification and monitoring of drivers. This will provide a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of policy responses, thus providing information that is actionable by policy makers and the public. We argue that expanding the role of indicators will render them far more effective as a resource for combating ecosystem degradation. Using the Baltic Sea as an example we analyse the nature of this challenge and provide concrete solutions to problems hindering the effectiveness of ecological indicator use in restoring health to large-scale ecosystems.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has long required both avian sub-acute dietary and acute oral studies to inform risk assessments for pesticides. Recently, the USEPA collaborated with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to determine whether the results of the acute oral avian toxicity test or the sub-acute dietary toxicity test consistently generated the greatest risk predictions in USEPA tier 1 assessments for pesticides first registered between 1998 and 2017. Their study concluded that in 99% of the cases, risk conclusions were driven by the acute oral study (OPPTS 850.2100, OCSPP 850.2100, or similar) because using these data results in higher risk quotients than sub-acute dietary data. Shortly after publishing these results, the USEPA released a formal memorandum providing guidance for waiving the sub-acute dietary study for most pesticides. The USEPA will, however, retain the option to require sub-acute dietary studies for pesticides with certain chemical properties. However, as the avian sub-acute dietary study has an exposure regimen that is often more representative of how birds are exposed to pesticides under actual use conditions than does the acute oral study (i.e., as part of a dietary item eaten over the course of a day and not a bolus dose), this study can provide useful context for risk assessment on a case-by-case basis. Decision criteria are needed to determine a path forward that both minimizes vertebrate animal testing and positions the avian sub-acute dietary data as an option for risk refinement. Decision criteria are proposed here with recommendations for refining the design of avian sub-acute dietary studies to ensure that the data generated are optimized to support a science-based acute avian risk assessment, supported by a case study demonstrating when and how sub-acute dietary studies may be used in a higher-tier risk assessment.

AB  - Objectives: This study examines the relationship, and relevance of the effect between the duration of the cases of temporary sick leave, as an indicator of absenteeism, and several characteristics (sociodemographic, labor, organizational and the environment) of workers covered by the Social Security System in Spain.
   Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 598,988 processes, between 15 and 365 days. The relationships between length of absence, and several characteristics such as demographic, sociodemographic, occupational, organizational and environment characteristics were determined (using P values). The mean duration for each of the features is described, and the size effect is calculated to estimate the importance of the relationships found.
   Results: There were significant relationships between the duration of temporary sick leave and several demographic characteristics (gender, age, nationality and length of service), occupational (wages, type of contract), organizational (economic sector, activity and size company), the environmental (region, state) characteristics. The age also showed a significant size effect (r(xy) = .134), especially after age 44.
   Conclusions: Only age had a significance effect on the duration of work absence, although there was also a relationship with the rest of the demographic, occupational and work environment characteristics. There was also evidence of a cross-effects between the variables, which could cause errors in interpreting the results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB  - Assessment scientists and managers depend on social values to identify the goals that will be used to guide environmental assessments. These goals are commonly identified by examining the vested interests of the various social groups that are stakeholders in a region. However, knowledge about what people value represents only part of the information needed to identify comprehensive assessment goals for environmental systems that include both economic and ecological components and processes. All parties also need to understand what is valuable to ecosystems because that determines the ecological patterns and processes that prevail in the long run. The competition among alternate system designs for available energy determines the viability of the choices that people make for their environment. Ecosystems that prevail in competition use the process of self-organization to create system designs that maximize the use of ever-changing sources of available energy. The efficacy of ecosystem designs can be evaluated using the maximum empower principle, which states that ecosystems evolve toward designs that maximize empower (emergy use per unit time). Emergy is an accounting quantity that normalizes the different kinds of energy developed in a system so that they may be compared. The counter-intuitive and sometimes controversial results that come from emergy analyses are illustrated by examining three environmental problems on the interface between ecology and economics. A process for identifying and using social and ecosystem values to guide environmental assessments is proposed using a conceptual energy systems model that shows how these processes might interact within a region. The probability of realizing a given change in system empower production is suggested as a decision criterion that can be used by managers to evaluate the efficacy of alternatives.

AB  - Fish diets are important indicators of ecosystem change. This aspect of the ichthyofauna of the coast of the Argentine Islands has been insufficiently studied in comparison with other regions. This article presents the results of comparison of dietary and somatic parameters of the dominant species Notothenia coriiceps depending on the point, depth and season of catch. The sample was collected between February 2006 and February 2007. In the year of study, N. coriiceps, Trematomus bemacchii, Chaenocephalus aceratus (common species), Harpagifer antamticus and Pagotherda borchgrevinki (rare species in this region) were caught The average fish size in this region does not differ from other places in the Southern Ocean. In Cornice Channel and Stella Creek, N. coriiceps was smaller than at other points due to the narrowness and shallow depth of these places. In winter, large individuals apparently migrated from the coast. The diet of N. coriiceps consisted mainly of crustaceans and seaweeds, with a small number of mollusks (especially limpets), which are common. The number offish in the diet of N. coriiceps is relatively low for this region. Access to food was relatively the same at different points and depths of the catch. The lowest amount of food was in the fall, the highest amount of food was in the spring and summer. The condition and hepatosomatic index also did not change depending on the point and depth of the catch, but they were low in spring and high in summer. Perhaps this is due to the low energy value of food, which is not compensated by the amount It is necessary to conduct studies of the diet of N. coriiceps in other years to clarify the specificity of fish in the diet and phenological changes in somatic parameters. Similar studies are needed for other species in the region if catches are sufficient to collect a representative sample.

AB  - Forest restoration efforts in the intermountain west of North America generally seek to promote the continuation of pine dominance, enhance wildlife habitat, and decrease hazardous fuels, thereby mitigating catastrophic losses from various stressors and disturbances. We propose a method of focal tree release thinning that partitions the competitive neighborhood to provide alternative approaches to managers. Specifically, we sought to examine how competition index (CI) derived harvest simulations alter forest structure, composition, and variability, and evaluate the ecological implications and efficacy of achieving management recommendations. We used a tree inventory collected across 38 experimental plots in the mixed conifer forest of the Sierra Nevada and simulated post-harvest structure using common silvicultural prescriptions to the ownership and cover type. We calculated competition values for all trees using 10 CIs and simulated harvests from two defined integrals of each corresponding probability density function to compare with the standard marking scenario, for a total of 21 harvest simulations. We assessed post-harvest structure through tree density and diameter distributions, basal area by species, and a structural diversity index. Post-harvest conditions exhibited differences in levels of structural diversity and species dominance; however we did not detect any influence on tree density across diameter classes. Most simulations resulted in a decline of non-pine species basal area relative to the default, while only 3 thinning scenarios showed concomitant increases in pine. Every simulation resulted in greater variance of structural diversity than the default marking guidelines. Review of this method highlighted the variability in tree ranked competitive status across indices. We emphasize that no harvest simulation by CI was clearly superior in all aspects of achieving desired objectives, and there was no clear benefit to incorporating inter-tree distances to calculate CI. We consistently observed favorable outcomes in harvest simulations derived from an open-grown crown width parameter which averts the need for tree distance measurements. This approach can be tailored across multiple individual plots, each maintaining unique competitive environments that reflect local tree neighborhoods.

AB  - The diagnosis, monitoring and flukicide efficacy testing of fasciolosis on-farm is reliant on non-terminal methods. The coproantigen ELISA (cELISA) has been recommended for diagnosis of fasciolosis and associated flukicide efficacy testing as an alternative to fluke egg counts for monitoring parasitism. Recently experimental multi-age infections have suggested that the reliability of efficacy results can be improved by a second cELISA testing at 6 weeks post-treatment (wpt) in addition to the generally accepted 1 wpt. Afield study was conducted to determine the suitability of faecal fluke egg counts (FFEC) and cELISA as diagnostic, drug efficacy testing and epidemiological tools on Australian sheep and cattle farms. Faecal samples from sheep and/or cattle on three endemic farms were taken at monthly intervals for 12 months and examined by both methods. Normal farm management was maintained during the study period and opportunistic efficacy testing, in line with each farm's normal flukicide management was undertaken. Additionally, the suitability of the Ollerenshaw Index as a predictive model for fasciolosis under Australian conditions was examined. While both diagnostics demonstrated their value in the farm environment, the current data demonstrate a distinct and significant increase in diagnostic sensitivity for epidemiological studies by using the two tests in parallel. The agreement between the two diagnostics was found to be higher in cattle, despite the poor sensitivity of FFEC in this species. Similar levels of agreement between the two tests were demonstrated at both sheep properties, regardless of the marked difference in the intensity of F. hepatica challenge. Linear regression models demonstrated the results of the two diagnostics utilized in parallel were explained substantially (R-2=0.91) as were series data (R-2=0.88) when the respective models were fitted. In contrast, the fitted models for FFEC (R-2=0.54) and cELISA (R-2=0.58) were poor explanations for test outcomes. The outcomes of these models support previous findings that suggest that the two diagnostic tests are best utilized together, particularly in parallel. The application of the Ollerenshaw Index to Australian conditions requires further investigation.

AB  - This contribution presents a procedure for sustainability assessment in coastal areas, based on a series of indicators and indices that reflect environmental quality. Three dimensions of environmental quality are taken into account: 'functions', 'interactions' and 'components'. Functions are considered from the 'ecocentric' (naturalness) and 'anthropocentric' (source of resources, sink for wastes, support of activities and provider of services) points of view. Humans-environment interactions are represented by means of pressure, state and response indicators. Environmental components include air, water, biota, soil, geomorphologic characteristics and processes, etc. Numerical indices are used to assess specific dimensions as well as integrated environmental quality. Increases or decreases in index values are assumed to indicate trends towards greater or lesser sustainability of existing practices. The procedure proposed has been developed within the ELANEM Euro-Latin American project (INCO Programme, European Commission). The methodological framework, indicators and criteria used for the assessment are explained. Results obtained on several study areas of Spain, Mexico and Argentina are presented and discussed.

AB  - 1. Grazing by introduced ungulate livestock is a major form of land use over large parts of Australia. Due to the tendency of stock to concentrate around water, riparian zones and wetlands are heavily impacted by grazing. However, little is known about how effects on riparian habitats vary spatially and with management regimes. We investigated how livestock affected riparian habitats on the Murrumbidgee River in south-eastern Australia.
   2. A rapid appraisal index of the ecological condition of floodplain riparian habitats was developed. This measured habitat continuity and extent, vegetation cover, bank stability, soil structure, quantity of fallen debris, dominance of natives vs. exotics, and the presence of indicative species. The method could be readily adapted for use on other floodplain rivers with extensive riparian habitats.
   3. Riparian condition was scored at 138 sites along 620 km of the Murrumbidgee River on private properties (n = 77), in State Forests (n = 27) and on Crown Land (n = 34). Riparian condition declined significantly with increasing grazing intensity and also with distance upstream in the upper half of the floodplain.
   4. Stocking rate, distance upstream, relative periods of paddock rest and grazing, proportion of bank accessible to stock, and the presence of off-river water in the paddock, accounted for 76% of the variance in riparian condition.
   5. Most riparian habitats on the Murrumbidgee River and other rivers in the Murray-Darling Basin are privately owned. Thus exclusion of the grazing industry from the riparian zone is not practical. However, lowered stocking rates, particularly in the upper parts of the catchment, resting of paddocks to allow recovery from grazing, and the provision of off-river watering points could all be used to improve riparian habitats.
   6. Exotic plants are ubiquitous, occurring even where grazing has been excluded for many years. Thus restoration of riparian habitats will require weed removal even in areas not used by livestock.

AB  - Questions: Species composition and ecology of treeline vegetation types in the Rolwaling Valley is largely unknown to date. The aim of this study is to differentiate plant communities along the elevational gradient in the treeline ecotone, and to identify site factors which cause the differentiation of the treeline ecotone vegetation. Study area: Rolwaling Valley (27 degrees 52' N; 86 degrees 25' E) in the central Himalaya, Nepal. Methods: We included 91 phytosociological releves along three elevational transects in this analysis, ranging from 3745 to 4300 m a.s.l. Plant communities were differentiated and vegetation-environment relationships analysed using cluster analysis and ordination. For each community and higher ranked unit, we detected diagnostic species according to their fidelity index (phi coefficient). Ecological preferences of each community were examined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results and conclusions: We identified five communities, belonging to two different classes: the Synotis alata-Abies spectabilis and Ribes glaciale-Abies spectabilis communities occupy the upper part of the subalpine forest zone, representing the uppermost forest stands below treeline. These communities are primarily comprised of Abies spectabilis and Betula utilis in the tree layer, with varying cover of several tree species and distinct differences within the herb layer. Above treeline, the mixed forest stands are replaced by the species-poor Boschniakia himalaica-Rhododendron campanulatum community, forming a dense krummholz belt. We assigned the forest and krummholz communities to the class Betula utilis-Abies spectabilis forests. In the alpine zone two communities were classified and assigned to the class Dasiphora arbuscula-Rhododendron anthopogon dwarf shrub heaths.The species-poor Pedicularis cf. micro calyx-Rho dodendron anthopogon community has a less developed herbaceous layer, whereas the Anaphalis royleana-Rhododendron anthopogon community is characterized by higher cover and higher species richness of herbs and grasses. Species composition of identified communities is mainly differentiated by soil temperature, nitrogen supply and availability, and soil moisture content.

AB  - The 2005 typhoon disasters taught us that the Mimikawa River system in Miyazaki Prefecture had various problems with sediments in the river basin (the riverbed in dam reservoirs rise so much that flooding risk increases, sediments captured at dams granulate the downstream river channel and destabilize the bridge piers in the downstream river channel). In one of the approaches to solve these problems simultaneously, since 2017, sediment sluicing at a series of dams has been operated cooperatively. Using this approach, we can expect that the river will recover its continuity of sediment movement, returning its physical environment and animal habitats to their original states. Based on environmental surveys and numerical analyses of the current conditions, we have predicted the environmental impacts due to sediment sluicing at dams and defined the method to assess them. This paper presents: 1) an overview of sediment sluicing at dams in the Mimikawa River system, 2) the analysis of the river environment prior to operating sediment sluicing at dams, 3) the prediction of the impacts of sediment sluicing at dams in the river environment, 4) the environmental impact assessment after operating sediment sluicing at dams.

AB  - South Australia's State Heritage Register contains 2294 listed places, the majority of which are from the 'Built' environment, ranging from settlers' huts, community buildings, historical industrial sites to magnificent stone mansions. Only 96 places are linked to the 'Natural' environment. The Register listings protect heritage places from alteration, damage or removal without formal prior consultation, compulsory under the South Australian Development Act. 'Natural' environments are landscape-based and oriented towards Geological, Archaeological, Palaeontological and Speleological heritage ('GAPS heritage'). A process to provide a greater balance between 'Natural' and 'Built' listings has initiated a series of State Heritage 'Natural' environment assessments, mostly of single sites. Two individual caves in the Naracoorte Caves National Park are already entered in the State Heritage Register as single sites. However, an innovative broader multiple-site nomination has focused on the many different but significant GAPS features contained within the 25 caves of the Naracoorte Caves National Park, providing a further level of protection for the land and the caves' exteriors and interiors. The example of the Naracoorte Caves draws attention to the number of important land and coastal karst (limestone) features across South Australia that were generated by steady geological uplift of three large sections of Oligocene-Miocene limestone-the Nullarbor Plain, the Murray Basin and the Gambier Karstfield (which includes Naracoorte and Mount Gambier), resulting in specific karst forms worthy of a broader coordinating management approach across South Australian karst parks.

AB  - To identify a proper strategy for future feed-efficient pig farming, it is required to evaluate the ongoing selection scenarios. Tools are lacking for the evaluation of pig selection scenarios in terms of environmental impacts to provide selection guidelines for a more sustainable pig production. Selection on residual feed intake (RFI) has been proposed to improve feed efficiency and potentially reduce the associated environmental impacts. The aim of this study was thus to develop a model to account for individual animal performance in life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to quantify the responses to selection. Experimental data were collected from the fifth generation of pig lines divergently selected for RFI (low line, more efficient pigs, LRFI; high line, less efficient pigs, HRFI). The average feed conversion ratio (FCR) and daily feed intake of LRFI pigs were 7% lower than the average of HRFI pigs (P < 0.0001). A parametric model was developed for LCA based on the dietary net energy fluxes in a pig system. A nutritional pig growth tool, InraPorc(R), was included as a module in the model to embed flexibility for changes in feed composition, animal performance traits and housing conditions and to simulate individual pig performance. The comparative individual-based LCA showed that LRFI had an average of 7% lower environmental impacts per kilogram live pig at farm gate compared to HRFI (P < 0.0001) on climate change, acidification potential, freshwater eutrophication potential, land occupation and water depletion. High correlations between FCR and all environmental impact categories (>0.95) confirmed the importance of improvement in feed efficiency to reduce environmental impacts. Significant line differences in all impact categories and moderate correlations with impacts (>0.51) revealed that RFI is an effective measure to select for improved environmental impacts, despite lower correlations compared to FCR. Altogether more optimal criteria for efficient environment-friendly selection can then be expected through restructuring the selection indexes from an environmental point of view.

AB  - During the recent decades the environmental impact attributed to the economic development and population expansion becomes a constant preoccupation of the local authorities and also a growing public concern. Some economic activities developed into a Romanian industrial site were evaluated in terms of environmental impact assessment against the environmental component: soil. The evaluation procedure requires specific collection of soil samples from the investigated industrial site, analyses of some specific soil quality indicators and evaluation of soil pollution state using a combined alternative methodology of global pollution index (i.e. quality index (EQ(soil)) - evaluation score (ESsoil) based on a specific compliance scale alternative method (I*(Gp))). The calculated value of global pollution index (i.e. I*(GP) = 2.067) indicates a real situation of soil pollution state estimated as 'soil environment modified by the potential polluting activities generating discomfort effects and risks for life forms coexisting onto soil site'. This situation requires soil remediation action, periodic monitoring and control.

AB  - Environmental assessments rely on data derived from metrological schemes in order to draw in due detail the state of the ecosystems. The reliability of the data and the cost-effectiveness of the scheme become critical, especially if the ultimate goal involves decision making and policy development. Biosensor platforms provide the versatility required for integrating environmental, metrological and operational parameters at the design phase. The pertinency and the opportunity for environmental biosensing is apparent, although not seized appropriately with only a few environmental biosensors in the market. This study is based on a technology forecasting approach using bibliometric data to trace the dynamics of the science base and content analysis to identify the drawbacks of the technology base. The results are compared with market forecasts in an effort to align research dynamics with market opportunities. A number of key findings emerged, such as the increase in networking and the establishment of a multi-disciplinarity trend, as well as a shifting of research scope towards ready-to-market designing. Notwithstanding, a renewed interest of the physical chemistry sector has been identified herein, indicating necessary revisions of the science-base, adding a critical parameter in the uncertainty of trajectories.

AB  - Health studies have shown premature death is statistically associated with exposure to particulate matter < 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5). The United States Environmental Protection Agency requires all States with PM2.5 non-attainment Counties or with sources contributing to visibility impairment at Class I areas to submit an emissions control plan. These emission control plans will likely focus on reducing emissions of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, which form two of the largest chemical components of PM2.5 in the eastern United States: ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate. Emission control strategies are simulated using three-dimensional Eulerian photochemical transport models.
   A monitor study was established using one urban (Detroit) and nine rural locations in the central and eastern United (SO42-) States to simultaneously measure PM2.5 sulfate ion 4, nitrate ion (NOD, ammonium ion (NH4+), and precursor species sulfur dioxide (SO2) nitric acid (HNO3) and ammonia (NH3). This monitor study provides a unique opportunity to assess how well the modeling system predicts the spatial and temporal variability of important precursor species and co-located PM2.5 ions, which is not well characterized in the central and eastern United States.
   The modeling system performs well at estimating the PM2.5 species, but does not perform quite as well for the precursor species. Ammonia is under-predicted in the coldest months, nitric acid tends to be over-predicted in the summer months, and sulfur dioxide appears to be systematically over-predicted. Several indicators of PM2.5 ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate formation and chemical composition are estimated with the ambient data and photochemical model output. PM2.5 sulfate ion is usually not fully neutralized to ammonium sulfate in ambient measurements and is usually fully neutralized in model estimates. The model and ambient estimates agree that the ammonia study monitors tend to be nitric acid limited for PM2.5 nitrate formation. Regulatory strategies in this part of the country should focus on reductions in NOx rather than ammonia to control PM2.5 ammonium nitrate. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sour orange is a valuable citrus rootstock. It is characterized as salt tolerant, based mainly on the mineral content of the leaves and roots under saline environment and to a lesser extent based on any biochemical indices. Therefore, the aim of the present experiment was to study both nutrient content and biochemical changes involved in this rootstock's tolerance. One-year-old sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.) trees growing in 5-L pots were subjected to four levels of sodium chloride salinity stress (control, 40 mM, 80 mM, and 120 mM sodium chloride) for 60 days. At the end of the stress period, plant growth was evaluated by measuring leaf, shoot, and root dry weights. Carbohydrates, chlorophylls, lipid peroxidation, and electrolyte leakage were also determined in leaves. Plant nutrient status was evaluated in leaf, shoot, and root samples, and the soil was also analyzed for nutrient content. Leaf sclerophylly indexes were determined to assess water stress induced by salinity. Leaf dry weight was not significantly affected, whereas shoot and root dry weights decreased with salt stress. Soil electrical conductivity and sodium and chloride concentrations increased with increasing salt concentration, whereas available potassium concentration decreased. Salt stress induced a significant accumulation of sodium and chloride in leaves, shoots, and roots. Potassium and phosphorus concentrations in leaves were enhanced under salt stress, whereas inconsistent changes were detected concerning magnesium, zinc, manganese, and copper concentrations. Sucrose and glucose concentrations were significantly reduced under salt stress while fructose concentration did not exhibit significant changes. Chlorophyll concentration was also reduced under stress. Based on lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage indexes, cell membrane integrity was maintained. According to leaf characteristics indexes, leaves' water stress was negligible, even after 2 months under salt stress. Based on the present results, sour orange accumulated significant amounts of sodium and chloride ions, inducing a reduction of growth, possibly through a reduction of carbon assimilation rate under low chlorophyll content, resulting in reduced carbohydrate concentration in the leaves.

AB  - Background In Germany and the EU, most headwaters are still far from reaching a good chemical and ecological status as it is required by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), until 2027 the latest. Particularly, in densely populated areas, impacts from municipal and industrial wastewater discharges or diffuse agricultural emissions are still a matter of concern. This also applies to the Nidda River which is considered to be in a moderate to rather poor condition. In our study, we investigated short-term and long-term consequences of anthropogenic pollution on fish health via one monitoring with caged fish (CF) and two field sampling campaigns (FF). In the CF monitoring, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were caged for seven weeks at four selected sites along the Nidda, whereas in the FF monitoring approach, feral fish, including brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario), European chub (Leuciscus cephalus) and stone loach (Barbatula barbatula) were caught in June and September 2016. Results Histopathological analyses of liver and gills were conducted, accompanied by measurements of hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity to assess the cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1) function, and genotoxicity via the micronucleus assay. Caged as well as field-captured fish exhibited impaired health conditions showing lesions particularly in the liver, and a presumably overwhelmed CYP1A1 system, whereas genotoxicity was not induced. The variation between sampling sites and seasons was rather low, but two trends were recognisable: (a) liver condition was poorest around spawning season and (b) tissue integrity and EROD activity were most affected downstream of industrial dischargers. Furthermore, effects were species dependent: the generally highly sensitive S. trutta f. fario proved to be impacted most, whereas L. cephalus with its pelagic lifestyle was affected less than the benthic B. barbatula, indicating a relevant contamination of sediments. Conclusion Our results confirm the impaired ecological state of the Nidda and emphasise that a sustainable improvement of aquatic ecosystem health needs to include both water quality and sediment contamination to approach the ambitious WFD goal.

AB  - In the wheatbelt of eastern Australia, rainfall shifts from winter dominated in the south (South Australia, Victoria) to summer dominated in the north (northern New South Wales, southern Queensland). The seasonality of rainfall, together with frost risk, drives the choice of cultivar and sowing date, resulting in a flowering time between October in the south and August in the north. In eastern Australia, crops are therefore exposed to contrasting climatic conditions during the critical period around flowering, which may affect yield potential, and the efficiency in the use of water (WUE) and radiation (RUE). In this work we analysed empirical and simulated data, to identify key climatic drivers of potential water- and radiation-use efficiency, derive a simple climatic index of environmental potentiality, and provide an example of how a simple climatic index could be used to quantify the spatial and temporal variability in resource-use efficiency and potential yield in eastern Australia.
   Around anthesis, from Horsham to Emerald, median vapour pressure deficit (VPD) increased from 0.92 to 1.28 kPa, average temperature increased from 12.9 to 15.2 degrees C, and the fraction of diffuse radiation (FDR) decreased from 0.61 to 0.41. These spatial gradients in climatic drivers accounted for significant gradients in modelled efficiencies: median transpiration WUE (WUEB/T) increased southwards at a rate of 2.6% per degree latitude and median RUE increased southwards at a rate of 1.1% per degree latitude. Modelled and empirical data confirmed previously established relationships between WUEB/T and VPD, and between RUE and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and FDR. Our analysis also revealed a non-causal inverse relationship between VPD and radiation-use efficiency, and a previously unnoticed causal positive relationship between FDR and water-use efficiency.
   Grain yield (range 1-7 t/ha) measured in field experiments across South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland (n = 55) was unrelated to the photothermal quotient (Pq = PAR/T) around anthesis, but was significantly associated (r(2) = 0.41, P< 0.0001) with newly developed climatic index: a normalised photothermal quotient (NPq = Pq. FDR/VPD). This highlights the importance of diffuse radiation and vapour pressure deficit as sources of variation in yield in eastern Australia. Specific experiments designed to uncouple VPD and FDR and more mechanistic crop models might be required to further disentangle the relationships between efficiencies and climate drivers.

AB  - Simple Summary: Temperature and thermal conditions of the interior of a swine trailer during transport were monitored over a broad range of outdoor conditions (34 trips total) managed according to industry best practice (Transport Quality Assurance (TQA) guidelines (NPB, 2008)). For the outdoor temperature range of 5 degrees C (40 degrees F) to 27 degrees C (80 degrees F), generally acceptable trailer thermal conditions were observed according to the TQA. Beyond this outdoor temperature range, undesirable conditions within the trailer were prevalent. Areas for potential improvement in transport management were identified. Stops resulted in rapid increases in temperature, which could be beneficial during cooler outdoor temperatures, but detrimental for warmer outdoor temperatures.
   Abstract: Transport is a critical factor in modern pork production and can seriously affect swine welfare. While previous research has explored thermal conditions during transport, the impact of extreme weather conditions on the trailer thermal environment under industry practices has not been well documented; and the critical factors impacting microclimate are not well understood. To assess the trailer microclimate during transport events, an instrumentation system was designed and installed at the central ceiling level, pig level and floor-level in each of six zones inside a commercial swine trailer. Transport environmental data from 34 monitoring trips (approximately 1-4 h in duration each) were collected from May, 2012, to February, 2013, with trailer management corresponding to the National Pork Board Transport Quality Assurance (TQA) guidelines in 31 of these trips. According to the TQA guidelines, for outdoor temperature ranging from 5 degrees C (40 degrees F) to 27 degrees C (80 degrees F), acceptable thermal conditions were observed based on the criteria that no more than 10% of the trip duration was above 35 degrees C (95 degrees F) or below 0 degrees C (32 degrees F). Recommended bedding, boarding and water application were sufficient in this range. Measurements support relaxing boarding guidelines for moderate outdoor conditions, as this did not result in less desirable conditions. Pigs experienced extended undesirable thermal conditions for outdoor temperatures above 27 degrees C (80 degrees F) or below 5 degrees C (40 degrees F), meriting a recommendation for further assessment of bedding, boarding and water application guidelines for extreme outdoor temperatures. An Emergency Livestock Weather Safety Index (LWSI) condition was observed inside the trailer when outdoor temperature exceeded 10 degrees C (50 degrees F); although the validity of LWSI to indicate heat stress for pigs during transport is not well established. Extreme pig surface temperatures in the rear and middle zones of the trailer were more frequently experienced than in the front zones, and the few observations of pigs dead or down upon arrival were noted in these zones. Observations indicate that arranging boarding placement may alter the ventilation patterns inside the trailer.

AB  - To improve ecological relevance, regulatory agencies are promoting assessments of effects at higher levels of organization, an objective that requires an understanding of current ecological theories. One such theory, hierarchy theory, contends that the effects of a disturbance acting at one level of organization (e.g., population) are not, as a rule, transmitted to higher levels of organization (e.g., community). Conversely, effects at higher levels of organization only occur if lower level variables have been affected. Further, responses to disturbance depend on disturbance history. In this study, I determined the effects of a disturbance treatment at the population, guild, and community levels of organization for vegetation in five wetlands with a disturbance history ranging from highly to rarely disturbed. The 2-year field experiment revealed that the effects of the disturbance treatment were most strongly felt at the population level of organization in wetlands without a history of disturbance. These observed impacts took place against a backdrop of constant change. Thus, the eventual disappearance of treatment effects was not due to a return to the pre-treatment state, but rather a return to a trajectory similar to that exhibited by the control plots. The implications of these results for ecological risk assessment are: (1) the observed effects of a stressor in a system cannot be extrapolated to other systems unless they have similar disturbance histories, (2) detecting effects before they become serious requires monitoring at lower levels of organization, (3) recovery to a naturally innate state is not a viable concept, and (4) the traditional approach of using one post-treatment measurement to determine if reference and impact sites differ is of very questionable value.

AB  - Objective An urban stream is currently being reconstructed as an ecological stream in Paju City, Korea. The diversity of fish, benthic macroinvertebrates, and periphyton in Geumchon stream was investigated, and the condition of the ecological health was assessed using the physicochemical condition of the water system. The goal is to use the data from this investigation to contribute to the establishment of policy for the conservation of Korea's water environment. Methods Samples of fish, benthic macroinvertebrates, and periphyton were collected from three sampling sites along the river a total of five times during the period October 2015 to June 2018 to determine the ecological structure of the Geumchon stream and its need for restoration. Samples of water and sediment were collected five times from five sampling sites for analysis of the physiochemical properties of the stream. Results Four families and ten species of fish were found with a total of 339 individuals. The fish found in the stream included theCarassius auratus, the Pseudorasbora parva, and theOryzias sinensis, most of which are tolerant of water pollution. The relative richness index forCarassius auratus,Oryzias sinensis,Hemiculter eigenmanni,andPseudorasbora parvawas 52.5, 16.5, 12.7, and 12.4%, respectively. The predominant benthic macroinvertebrates observed at most sites were the Chironomidae sp. The dominant periphyton from 2015 to 2017 was theNitzschia paleaand in 2018 theOscillatoriasp. Using the benthic macroinvertebrates index (BMI), the fish assessment index (FAI) and the trophic diatom index (TDI), the environmental condition ranged from moderate (C grade) to bad (D grade). Conclusions The predominant species caught reflect the turbulent condition of the urban stream due to its reconstruction and the pollution. The biological indices (BMI, FAI, and TDI) and the physicochemical water items (BOD) were assessed separately to identify the quality of the water in the stream. The application of these biological assessments together with the chemical properties of the water can be used to provide a composite picture of the ecological health of a water system and to identify disturbances to its current condition.

AB  - Objective To assess trends in 30-day emergency readmission rates across England over one decade.
   Design Retrospective study design.
   Setting 150 non-specialist hospital trusts in England.
   Participants 23 069134 patients above 18 years of age who were readmitted following an initial admission (n=62 584 297) between April 2006 and February 2016.
   Primary and secondary outcomes We examined emergency admissions that occurred within 30 days of discharge from hospital ('emergency readmissions') as a measure of healthcare quality. Presented are overall readmission rates, and disaggregated by the nature of the indexed admission, including whether it was elective or emergency, and by clinical health condition recorded. All rates were risk-adjusted for patient age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, comorhidities and length of stay.
   Results The average risk-adjusted, 30-day readmission rate increased from 6.56% in 2006/2007 to 6.76% (P<0.01) in 2012/2013, followed by a small decrease to 6.64% (P<0.01) in 2015/2016. Emergency readmissions for patients discharged following elective procedures decreased by 0.13% (P<0.05), whereas those following emergency admission increased by 1.27% (P<0.001). Readmission rates for hip or knee replacements decreased (-1.29%; P<0.001); for acute myocardial infarction (-0.04%; P<0.49), stroke (+0.62%; P<0.05), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (+0.41%; P<0.05) and heart failure (+0.15%; P<0.05) remained stable; and for pneumonia (+2.72%; P<0.001), diabetes (+7.09%; P<0.001), cholecystectomy (+1.86%; P<0.001) and hysterectomy (+2.54%; P<0.001) increased.
   Conclusions Overall, emergency readmission rates in England remained relatively stable across the observation period, with trends of slight increases contained post 2012/2013. However, there were large variations in trends across clinical areas, with some experiencing marked increases in readrnission rates. This highlights the need to better understand variations in outcomes across clinical subgroups to allow for targeted interventions that will ensure highest standards of care provided for all patients.

AB  - The 2011 MV Rena grounding on Otaiti (Astrolabe reef) in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand is considered to be New Zealand's worst maritime environmental disaster and one of the most expensive shipwreck and oil spill salvage and recovery operations ever undertaken, with the clean-up currently costing in excess of $660 million (NZD) (Schiel et al., 2016; Beca, 2014). The resultant environmental impacts due to the fuel oil spilled and flotsam were also experienced anthropocentrically as economic, social and cultural impacts. The presence and consideration of impacts experienced by the indigenous groups of the impacted regions within the on-going recovery process is a major contributing factor to the uniqueness of this scenario internationally. The scale and complexity of impacts from this disaster is without precedent in New Zealand. The consideration of past and potential future impacts is especially significant in present times, with the resource consent application to leave the remnants of the wreck and associated debris in place on the reef and seabed, being granted on February 26 2016.
   The assessment builds on the methodology presented by Faaui et al (2016) which established indicator sets for measuring impacts upon the mauri of the affected environments (post-Rena state) and assessing the state of the environment prior to the grounding (pre-Rena state). Using the sustainability indicator sets compiled previously by Faaui et al. (2016), the Mauri Model Decision Making Framework has been used to present a holistic assessment of the impacts of the disaster on the reef and surrounding ecosystems, from October 2011 (date of the grounding) to October 2015. These indicators have been expanded on, defining the threshold conditions for scoring the indicators within the Mauri Model. The impact assessment methodology has included a process that identifies the indicator scoring thresholds which ensures objectivity in the scoring of indicators, and therefore the impact assessment, allowing for repeatable and robust results.
   This assessment is the first use of the Mauri Model Decision Making Framework at this scale, providing a holistic assessment of the impacts experienced within the Rena affected regions in this post-Rena time period. This research leads directly into the post resource consent time period and the associated future impacts as a result of the consent and given consent conditions.

AB  - Determination of physical, chemical and biological attributes with individual analyses is inadequate for improving the understanding of soil conditions as a function of land-use change (LUC) in comparison to the natural state of soil. For a more accurate soil condition diagnostic, it is necessary to consider various indicators related to these characteristics, which requires the use of multivariate statistical analysis. The aim of this work was to characterize, through multivariate analysis, different types of LUCs in an Oxisol as a function of the physical, chemical and biological attributes and to clarify the relationship of these attributes with the quality of the soil in comparison to these attributes in natural soil conditions, in the southern Amazon in Brazil. The land uses evaluated in the municipality of Alta Floresta, state of Mato Grosso (MT), Brazil, were native amazon forest (ma), degraded pasture (pd), managed renewed pasture (pn), permanent preservation area in recovery (app), crop area (rice), forage sugarcane (ca) and reforested area with eucalyptus (eu). To characterize the physical and chemical soil attributes, samples were collected in each land-use area, at depths of 0-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m, and the determination of soil microbial activity (biological attributes) was evaluated at a depth of 0-0.10 m. The interrelationship between the analyzed attributes was described by multivariate techniques, which included hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analyses, principal component analysis, canonical correlation, and structural equation modeling. The multivariate approach for the analysis of soil attribute data was efficient in the identification of anthropogenic actions on areas in comparison to natural conditions. Together, the cluster analysis and principal components analysis identified two groups that differed mainly in terms of anthropic operations of soil tillage and liming. The land use that was most similar to the natural condition was degraded pasture, which was mainly due to K and H + Al contents, soil microporosity and soil basal respiration. Structural equation modeling indicated that the latent factor soil chemical attributes had three times greater interference (-0.5828) than the latent factor soil physical attributes (0.1735) on the latent factor soil biological attributes. Therefore, anthropic actions, especially the liming, modified soil acidity conditions, affecting the microorganisms of its flora and changing the native fungal community of the soil that was evaluated.

AB  - In 1988, the incoming head of one of the most prominent scientific assessment bodies, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), explained: "Right now, many countries, especially developing countries, simply do not trust assessments in which their scientists and policymakers have not participated." Since then, the international community gathered significant experience in designing and organising international assessments that allow for broad participation by representatives of national governments and influence domestic and international policy making. By analysing the case study of the IPCC, the paper focuses on the role of individual nation states played in international assessments and how this role changed over time and why. It is shown that there is a tendency of increasing internationalisation in the field of climate research and climate policy that limits the specific influence of individual nation states. The study of the internal processes of the IPCC reveals a growth of internal dynamics that built up boundaries for the behaviour of individual actors (such as government representatives and scientists). However, over the years the actors involved also learned how to use the IPCC mechanisms more effectively. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the correlations between land use/cover change and cultivated land ecological security in flatland and mountainous areas. Firstly, the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of land use/cover change are described in conjunction with ArcGIS10.5 software based on remote sensing images of 2005 and 2015. Then, by establishing a pressure-support framework as an assessment indicator system and developing an improved BP neural network model via a genetic algorithm with the help of MATLAB2016a, the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of cultivated land ecological security in Yuxi City from 2005 to 2015 are evaluated. The results showed that the transformation of farmland area accounted for a large proportion of increased constructive land and land use/cover spatial variations were significantly different among counties, which manifested the changes in farmland and the construction land in flatland areas but also facilitated a mutual transformation of forest and grass in mountainous areas. Moreover, ecological security status presented a clear difference among counties due to their different land use/cover changes. The ecological security state of the flatland expressed a higher ecological pressure and lower ecological support, so the security grade was IV. Otherwise, the ecological security was superior and the security grade was level II or I in the mountainous areas. Thus, protection strategies for ecological security should be differentiated in the flatland areas and mountainous areas due to their different ecological security status brought by land use/cover change.

AB  - The successful use of macroinvertebrates as indicators of stream condition in bioassessments has led to heightened interest throughout the scientific community in the prediction of stream condition. For example, predictive models are increasingly being developed that use measures of watershed disturbance, including urban and agricultural land-use, as explanatory variables to predict various metrics of biological condition such as richness, tolerance, percent predators, index of biotic integrity, functional species traits, or even ordination axes scores. Our primary intent was to determine if effective models could be developed using watershed characteristics of disturbance to predict macroinvertebrate metrics among disparate and widely separated ecoregions. We aggregated macroinvertebrate data from universities and state and federal agencies in order to assemble stream data sets of high enough density appropriate for modeling in three distinct ecoregions in Oregon and California. Extensive review and quality assurance of macroinvertebrate sampling protocols, laboratory subsample counts and taxonomic resolution was completed to assure data comparability. We used widely available digital coverages of land-use and land-cover data summarized at the watershed and riparian scale as explanatory variables to predict macroinvertebrate metrics commonly used by state resource managers to assess stream condition. The "best" multiple linear regression models from each region required only two or three explanatory variables to model macroinvertebrate metrics and explained 41-74% of the variation. In each region the best model contained some measure of urban and/or agricultural land-use, yet often the model was improved by including a natural explanatory variable such as mean annual precipitation or mean watershed slope. Two macroinvertebrate metrics were common among all three regions, the metric that summarizes the richness of tolerant macroinvertebrates (RICHTOL) and some form of Err (Ephemeroptera. Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) richness. Best models were developed for the same two invertebrate metrics even though the geographic regions reflect distinct differences in precipitation, geology, elevation, slope, population density, and land-use. With further development, models like these call be used to elicit better causal linkages to stream biological attributes or condition and call be used by researchers or managers to predict biological indicators of stream condition at unsampled sites.

AB  - The perceived blue color of a lake often contributes to its aesthetic appeal, and changes in blueness can be indicative of major shifts in water quality. We developed a quantitative blue water index (B-w) for natural waters, and used it to evaluate spatial and seasonal variations in ultraoligotrophic Lake Tahoe, where clarity and blueness are of ecological and economic value and a focus for lake management strategies. Spectral reflectance was measured using a profiling hyperspectral radiometer, and the values were converted to the axis values of a color space: the International Commission on Illumination L*a*b*, where L* is the lightness of color, a* ranges from green to magenta, and b* ranges from blue to yellow. The blue water index B-w, defined as negative b*, was similarly high at two offshore monitoring sites in Lake Tahoe, but much lower in a semienclosed bay and a small adjacent lake. Seasonal variations of B-w were determined using a hyperspectral radiometer attached to a buoy in the middle of Lake Tahoe. The B-w values were highest in summer, and there was a strong inverse correlation between B-w and phytoplankton concentrations as measured by in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence. However, there was no significant correlation between B-w and Secchi depth. Blueness and visual clarity are complementary measures of the perceived optical state of natural waters, and for many lakes may provide a powerful combination of indicators for conveying water quality to the public.

AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus, which are native to estuaries globally, are agents of seafood-borne or wound infections, both potentially fatal. Like all vibrios autochthonous to coastal regions, their abundance varies with changes in environmental parameters. Sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), and chlorophyll have been shown to be predictors of zooplankton and thus factors linked to vibrio populations. The contribution of salinity, conductivity, turbidity, and dissolved organic carbon to the incidence and distribution of Vibrio spp. has also been reported. Here, a multicoastal, 21-month study was conducted to determine relationships between environmental parameters and V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus populations in water, oysters, and sediment in three coastal areas of the United States. Because ecologically unique sites were included in the study, it was possible to analyze individual parameters over wide ranges. Molecular methods were used to detect genes for thermolabile hemolysin (A), thermostable direct hemolysin (tdh), and tdh-related hemolysin (trh) as indicators of V. parahaemolyticus and the hemolysin gene vvhA for V. vulnificus. SST and suspended particulate matter were found to be strong predictors of total and potentially pathogenic V. parahaetnolyticus and V. vulnificus. Other predictors included chlorophyll a, salinity, and dissolved organic carbon. For the ecologically unique sites included in the study, SST was confirmed as an effective predictor of annual variation in vibrio abundance, with other parameters explaining a portion of the variation not attributable to SST.

AB  - The occurrence of stereotypies in animals is primarily related to (i) internal states induced by the captive environment or other external stimuli that continuously trigger or motivate specific behaviours, (ii) situations in which the environment causes a state of chronic stress that influences the path from the cortex to the basal ganglia promoting and sequencing a behaviour that results in a lack of proper inhibition and (iii) an experience in early ontogeny that influenced the development of the central nervous system, causing inappropriate sequencing and a lack of inhibition with effects visible even in adult life.
   Such features of stereotypic behaviour as its repetitiveness, a gradual loss of variability and increasing predictability might be related to positively reinforcing opioid effect, environment predictability or synaptic priming.
   Consequences of stereotypies are various and depend on their causes and the types of stereotypic movements. They might influence the physical state of the animal, handicapping its social interactions, but also decrease anxiety and ability to react to external stimuli. Stereotypies and their consequences are strictly related with other welfare indicators and are unequivocally treated as a symptom of abnormality.

AB  - We apply our recently developed methodology for first-principles computations of paramagnetic NMR shieldings and explore the shieldings in a selected set of radicals that form core units in molecular magnets. The influence on these parameters of hydrogen bonding, that corresponds to the crystal environment, is the prime objective of the study. Nitronylnitroxide radicals with the hydroxyphenyl group in the ortho, meta, and para positions, as well as p-methoxyphenyl derivatives, are chosen for this purpose. The strong (NOHO)-H-... hydrogen bonding in the real crystal structure has been simulated by adding water molecules in the twelve molecular complexes investigated. Comparison of calculated and experimental data is made by taking the special features of the solid state and solution environments into account. The observed change in the shielding constant due to hydrogen bonding is explained by the spin delocalization picture; the dominating contribution is the temperature-dependent contact shielding containing the isotropic hyperfine coupling constant.

AB  - The Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM) is a mechanistic framework for simulating ecological processes, based on statistical parameter estimation methods. This methodology is a sequential modelling process primarily developed to predict impacts of anthropogenic activities in the ecological status of ecosystems. Over the last years, this approach was increasingly tested and advances as well as limitations have clearly emerged from the different ecological contexts, scales and target organisms, guilds and/or communities studied. We review the performance of the StDM applications, by system types and upgraded innovation. Most published papers with StDM models were dedicated to assess anthropogenic pressures in the scope of the ecological integrity problematic by using the state variables as ecological indicators. We discuss the StDM concepts, requirements, ecological relevance, universality and the current spatial integration with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and other types of modelling approaches. Additionally, we describe a simple demonstrative application in order to illustrate the framework methodological steps, supporting the theoretic concepts previously presented with a study case background.

AB  - The health of medium and small river ecosystems is threatened by increasing hydropower development and human activities. How to properly diagnose rivers has become a global concern. As a well-accepted theory, the aquatic organism density can be an indicator of river health. A new river health assessment method based on macroinvertebrates habitat suitability curves (M-HSC) was proposed. In this study, the health of Qiaobian River (QBR), a tributary of Yangtze River, China was evaluated by investigating the distribution of macroinvertebrates, chemical and physical parameters during winter 2018 (low flow season) and summer 2019 (high flow season). Based on habitat suitability of dominant macroinvertebrates, the key habitat factors were screened by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Pearson correlation analysis. Suitability curves were determined by Generalized Additive Model (GAM). Ecosystem health comprehensive index method was used to evaluate the health status. The results show most suitable conditions forCorbicula flumineacontaining chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) of 1.48 mg L-1, total nitrogen (TN) of 0.27 mg L-1, dissolved oxygen (DO) of 11.17 mg L-1, pH of 8.42, turbidity of 1.76 NTU, and water depth (Dep) of 0.35 m. The health status of QBR is spatially heterogeneous with the apparently better upstream than the downstream. In general, 25, 12.5, 12.5% of the samples were classified as nature, health and sub-health status, respectively and the rest 50% were lower than sub-health. The results are consistent with the environmental quality standards for surface water in China (GB3838-2002), suggesting the applicability of macroinvertebrates habitat suitability for evaluating river health. By minimizing the temporal and spatial limitations of comprehensive evaluation method and indicator species method, this study, for the first time, used macroinvertebrates habitat suitability curves to assess the health of medium and small rivers. The study will provide new insights for future river health assessments.

AB  - In asset management, defect signals are critical indicators of upcoming malfunctions, whose initialization and growth are often affected by uncertain environmental stresses. It is cost-effective to postpone the removals of defects, so as to take advantage of the remaining useful lifetime since the defect identification. However, the impacts of environmental damage as well as heath state variation on postponement period are rarely addressed, which may lead to non-negligible malfunction hazard and maintenance resource waste. This study addresses these challenges by designing a state-based postponement maintenance policy. The environmental damage to asset lifetime is characterized by (a) random increment of state transition rates and (b) probabilistic malfunction risk. Two levels of postponed maintenance windows are set according to inspection consequences. Level-1 window is pre-set along with a finite number of inspections, where a normally working asset over the inspection zone is left untouched until the window. Level-2 window is determined upon the defect identification, offering shorter postponed duration due to the vulnerability. The applicability is demonstrated by a numerical experiment on asset management of oil pipelines.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare leaves of Eugenia uniflora from the city of Sao Paulo with leaves of plants from a rural site. Leaf size, tissue thickness, and stomatal and crystal density of E. uniflora growing at two sites in the city of Sao Paulo were investigated by light microscopy and compared with samples from a rural area. The level and types of air pollutants varied at the urban sites. Primary pollutants were present on Bandeirantes Avenue and secondary ones in the park (Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga - PEFI). Urban leaves were smaller, thinner and with higher stomatal and crystal density. We observed greater spongy parenchyma thickness in leaves from the avenue when compared to those from the park. No qualitative differences were observed between urban and rural leaves. Leaves from the two urban sites showed similarities, but were different from rural leaves, so we believe that the differences observed may be attributed to the polluted environment of Sao Paulo. In order to confirm this hypothesis, control experiments should be done.

AB  - Intertidal flats are very sensitive coastal environments. They support large communities of highly specialised fauna and flora and are subject to physical processes that combine hydrodynamic and sedimentary processes that are highly sensitive to change. An added factor to the difficulty of studying and monitoring intertidal flats and their environment is that they may be situated near a human settlement that requires protection from flooding or inundation. Monitoring sensitive intertidal flat ecosystems to obtain precise and updated information on its geomorphological and biological state is a challenging task for coastal scientists, managers and engineers, who have to deal with both, the conservation of the environment and human demands.
   This paper describes a monitoring programme designed to establish, for a sensitive intertidal flat, the state of a comprehensive number of environmental factors prior, during and after the construction of sea defences. The rigorous assessment of environmental impact has been the backbone of the design and implementation of this monitoring programme based in Newtownards, at the Northern end of Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland. The Lough is a major wildlife and scientific resource that is subject to several domestic conservation designations as well as being considered, under European Community Directives, as a site of importance for nature conservation. The individual components of the intervening forces and responses have been identified and studied on a high-resolution spatial basis whilst not interfering with the fragile ecosystem. Biological and geomorphological parameters were identified for monitoring. Surveys comprised plant ecology, spatial distribution of density and type of vertebrates and invertebrates, sedimentological analysis (both historical and contemporary), hydrodynamic controls and topographic evolution as well as salt marsh shoreline monitoring. A wide range of technologies have been implemented to achieve a monitoring programme that that can be fully integrated in a Geographic Information System minimising post-processing times for interpretation and data-base access. Some of the techniques include the use of an ATV mounted DGPS with sub-centimetre accuracy for topographical and biological surveys, colour infrared digital airborne image acquisition using the Kodak DCS460 and image analysis, as well as numerical wave modelling of wave propagation. A virtual monitoring centre is being created as the main outcome of this project. The participating institutions (research, management and the public) will be able to access the electronic libraries and maps via an integrated web-based database. This project has been approached as a research and development programme that serves as a model for integrated coastal zone management in sensitive tidal flat ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding how resilient rangelands are to climatic disturbances such as drought is of major importance to land managers. The resilience of ecosystems can be reduced by livestock grazing and by environmental conditions. Most studies quantifying resilience are based on model simulations. However, natural time series from satellite data offer the possibility to infer aspects of resilience from real systems. The objective of this study was to investigate two aspects of ecological resilience, namely resistance to climate variability and recovery from drought, by applying a change detection method (Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend; BFAST) spatially on a 28-year Landsat NDVI time series in a dry rangeland in southern Cyprus. First, we used the number of breakpoints fitted by the BFAST model as an inverted proxy for long-term vegetation resistance to climate variability (the ability to withstand change during a disturbance reduces the likelihood to trigger a breakpoint in the time series). Second, we used the linear slope of the BFAST model after a known drought as a proxy of the recovery rate of the vegetation. This information was then used to analyse the spatial distribution of the total number of breakpoints and of the NDVI recovery trend in relation to grazing and environmental properties. Our results show that high NDVI and a northern orientation (i.e. favourable environmental conditions) were associated with a highly resilient system, due to high resistance to climate variability and fast recovery after drought. Intermediate conditions were associated with low resistance. Unfavourable conditions and high grazing intensities were associated with an unresponsive ecosystem state characterised by high resistance and slow recovery after a drought event. Low grazing intensities positively affected the NDVI recovery trend, but did not improve resistance. On northern slopes, terrain slope had a positive effect on the NDVI recovery trend, while on southern slopes it had a negative effect. Our satellite-driven approach has a strong potential for resilience monitoring, because it can be applied on broad spatial and temporal scales in areas with low availability of field data. Moreover, it allows to jointly extract two important components of resilience: resistance and recovery rate.

AB  - Understanding the dependencies of the terrestrial carbon and water cycle with meteorological conditions is a prerequisite to anticipate their behaviour under climate change conditions. However, terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere interact via a multitude of variables across temporal and spatial scales. Additionally these interactions might differ among vegetation types or climatic regions. Today, novel algorithms aim to disentangle the causal structure behind such interactions from empirical data. The estimated causal structures can be interpreted as networks, where nodes represent relevant meteorological variables or land-surface fluxes and the links represent the dependencies among them (possibly including time lags and link strength). Here we derived causal networks for different seasons at 119 eddy covariance flux tower observations in the FLUXNET network. We show that the networks of biosphere-atmosphere interactions are strongly shaped by meteorological conditions. For example, we find that temperate and high-latitude ecosystems during peak productivity exhibit biosphere-atmosphere interaction networks very similar to tropical forests. In times of anomalous conditions like droughts though, both ecosystems behave more like typical Mediterranean ecosystems during their dry season. Our results demonstrate that ecosystems from different climate zones or vegetation types have similar biosphere-atmosphere interactions if their meteorological conditions are similar. We anticipate our analysis to foster the use of network approaches, as they allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the state of ecosystem functioning. Long-term or even irreversible changes in network structure are rare and thus can be indicators of fundamental functional ecosystem shifts.

AB  - Wheat is one of the most important cereals grown in the world, and in Brazil, increasing national production is still a challenge. Nitrogen (N) supply can favor grain yield and the physiological quality of wheat seeds. However, the definition of adequate N rate and fertilization timing must consider genotype, cultivation environment, and initial seed vigor level. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of initial seed vigor and the combinations of rates and timings of N application on grain yield and seed physiological quality of wheat cultivars under different edaphoclimatic conditions. The experiment was carried out in Londrina and Ponta Grossa, state of Parana, in a randomized block design in a 2 x 2 x 7 factorial scheme, with four replicates. Treatments consisted of two seed vigor levels (vigorous and non-vigorous seeds), two wheat cultivars (BRS Gralha-Azul and BRS Sabia) and seven combinations of fertilization timings and N rates (kg ha(-1)) (control-0N; 20N at sowing and 60N at tillering; 40N at sowing; 80N at sowing; 40N at sowing and 40N at tillering; 40N at tillering; 80N at tillering). Number of emerged seedlings, vegetation index, shoot dry matter, number of fertile spikes m(-2) and grain yield were evaluated. Additionally, the physiological potential of seeds produced in Londrina was evaluated by the testes of first count, germination, seedling emergence in sand and emergence speed index. The climatic conditions during the experiment, in both cultivation environments, were similar to average historical records, with some periods of water deficit. The highest grain yield was obtained with the BRS Gralha-Azul in Londrina, and with BRS Sabia in Ponta Grossa. The use of vigorous seeds favored the stand establishment and the response of plants to N fertilization. The treatments 40N + 40N, and 40N + 0N favored the majority of evaluated variables. Both cultivars showed potential for the production of high physiological potential seeds in Londrina environment. Inadequate N supply impairs wheat grain yield and seed production.

AB  - The article discusses the evolution and current state of transparency of environmental performance data in the Russian Oil and Gas sector. We build upon our first-hand experience in a transparent, publicly available information and third-party-verified rating system. Based on 2014-16 successive annual ratings, we conclude that implementing "soft" responsibility mechanisms can improve environmental responsibility standards and transparency in the oil and gas industry. At the same time, in terms of improving environmental performance of oil and gas companies it is reasonable to assume an emerging trend. Its full realization will require (1) longer rating time, including that for public exposure to misleading environmental performance information and the use of poorly verified nonfinancial reporting; (2) application of independent analysis of satellite monitoring information to the professional audit and public verification of nonfinancial reporting; and (3) sophistication of guidelines for professional audit and public verification of nonfinancial reports.

AB  - This research was conducted to study and classify the physico-chemical properties of soil, yield components of wheat and to determine the significance of these parameters on the grain yield formation. In this research, seven statistical methods consisting of simple correlation analysis (SCA), multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise regression (SR), factor analysis (FA), principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA) and path analysis (PA) have been investigated. The physico-chemical properties of soil, different morphological traits and wheat yield have been obtained from a field with 250x300 meter dimension located in Bajgah (with silty clay loam soil) that consisted of 30 samples. Among statistical analysis performed, MLR has provided more acceptable results. In this method, among the examined characteristics, five traits i. e., the number of stems without spikes per plant, biological yield, harvest index, soil soluble potassium and soil available phosphorus, examined 98.3% of the variations of the yield (P<0.05). Lack of soil nitrogen effect on yield is due to drought stress conditions in which the plant growth is less sensitive to nitrogen. Furthermore, the negative effect of phosphorus on the yield of plant may be due to the inverse relationship between the soil phosphorus and micronutrient elements on the plant growth. Generally, among the yield components, biological yield is the most important and effective trait on grain yield, that has presented a significant contribution in different statistical methods. For some of the used statistical methods, the measured traits, like length of spike, the number of spikes per square meter, the number of grains per spike and harvest index showed positive effects on the grain yield and other traits like 1000-grains weight, the weight of grain per spike and the number of tillers without spikes per plant showed negative effects on the grain yield with the highest correlation. Among different soil nutrition, soluble potassium, phosphorus, sulfate and available potassium with positive effects and the clay content with negative effects showed the most correlation with the grain yield.

AB  - Rare ecosystems support unique assemblages of flora and fauna within a small geographic area. As such, their conservation represents an effective method of biodiversity protection. The description, mapping, and assessment of rare ecosystems is a necessary and initial conservation action, yet this has not been completed for Alaska. Here, we provide the first comprehensive treatment of rare terrestrial ecosystems for the state. Thirty-five rare systems, representing different levels of ecological organization and geographic scale, are presented. In addition, a gap analysis was conducted to evaluate the systems' current level of land management protection relative to their conservation need. Eleven of the mapped ecosystems are considered adequately protected, two are moderately protected, and 22 are less protected. Conservation ranks are incongruously aligned with land management protection levels such that the rarest systems are often not well protected and the less-imperiled systems are often well protected. On the ecoregion scale, systems with arctic distributions are less protected than are those with boreal and maritime distributions. This rare ecosystem assessment complements species- and landscape-scale conservation studies previously completed for Alaska. Collectively, the recommendations from these assessments provide a science-based strategy for biological conservation in a vulnerable region of the world.

AB  - Fish species tolerance used as a component of fish-index of biological integrity (F-IBI) can be problematic as it is usually classified using the historical data, data from literature or expert judgments. In this study, fish assemblages, water quality parameters and physical habitat factors from 206 sampling sites in the Huntai River Basin were analyzed to develop tolerance indicator values (TIVs) of fish based on a (F-b-TIVs) and the weighted averaging (WA) method (F-W-TIVs). The two quantitative methods for fish tolerance were then compared. The F-W-TIVs and F-b-TIVs of fish species were calculated separately using a WA inference model based on ten water quality parameters (WT, pH, DO, SC, TDS, NH3, NO2-, NO3-, TP, Cl-, and SO42-), and six biological traits (lithophilic spawning, benthic invertivores, cold water species, equilibrium or periodic life history strategies, families of Cottidae, and species distribution range). Fish species were then classified into biological traits approach three categories (tolerant species, moderately tolerant species, and sensitive species). The results indicated that only 30.3% fish species have the same classification based on F-W-TIVs and F-b-TIVs. However, the proportion of tolerant species based on two methods had a similar response to environmental stress, and these tolerant species were correlated with PCA axes 1 site scores obtained by (F-W-TIVs, p < 0.05, R-2 = 0.434; F-b-TIVs, p < 0.05, R-2 = 0.334) and not correlated with PCA axis 2 site scores (F-W-TIVs, p > 0.05, R-2 = 0.001; F-b-TIVs, p > 0.05, R-2 = 0.012) and PCA axis 3 site scores (F-W-TIVs, p > 0.05, R-2 = 0.000; F-b-TIVs, p > 0.05, R-2 = 0.013). The results of linear regression analyses indicated that F-b-TIVs can be used for the study of fish tolerance. Fish tolerance assessments based on F-W-TIVs requires long-term monitoring of fish assemblages and water quality parameters to provide sufficient data for quantitative studies. The F-b-TIV method relies on the accurate identification of fish traits by an ichthyologist. The two methods used in this study can provide methodological references for quantitative studies of fish tolerance in other regions, and are of great significance for the development of biological assessment tools.

AB  - Background: Regular phytoplankton monitoring in Dutch coastal waters is performed as an indicator of the ecological state of these waters. The monitoring program is focused on temporal and spatial changes of species composition and abundance. Flow cytometry has been introduced to provide additional information, to improve ecosystem understanding, and to increase the efficiency of analysis and reportage.
   Methods: Phytoplankton community abundance and composition were routinely, determined by flow cytometry and microscopy at six locations in the North Sea over three annual cycles between 2000 and 2003. Supplementary measurements were also made for fluorescence (chlorophyll-a and other pigments) and, in combination with flow cytometric and microscopic data, were used to determine phytoplankton abundance and composition as a function of their size distribution. Real-time imaging of species was also used to identify species on the basis of their flow cytometric optical characteristics.
   Results: Flow cytometric analysis took 15 min on average. Analysis including data processing, and Web site reportage took less than 1 h. Phytoplankton concentrations (cells/ml), biomass (fluorescence/ml), and concentration of phycoerythrin- or Phycocyanin-containing cells (cells/ml) as a function of their algal size were produced every 2 weeks on average. The phytoplankton integrated annual concentration and biomass were used as ecological indicators for overall phytoplankton status. Real-time imaging of cells in flow enabled the identification of dominant species and was applied as an early warning system for Phaeocystis spp.
   Conclusions: The reproducibility and count precision due to the large number of observations of the flow cytometric technique provided reliable data for monitoring long-term trends. Flow cytometrically based analyses extended the lower detection limit (<0.5 mum) of analysis beyond the capabilities of other techniques such as the relation between small and larger phytoplankton, the relation between cell counts and biomass as a function of cell size, but also the ability to monitor and report on blooms of harmful algae. A good correlation was found between concentrations (cells/ml) measured by flow cytometry and microscopy. In practice, flow cytometric analysis of a single marine sample took 15 min on average.

AB  - Computer-assisted tools need to be developed to help in the accurate and efficient acquisition of fish age and growth data for ecological and assessment issues. Stating fish age and growth analysis as pattern classification issues, the proposed approach relies on a statistical learning strategy. Given otolith images interpreted by an expert, probabilistic kernel-based methods (namely Kernel Logistic Regression) are used to infer interpretation rules. More precisely, two different probabilistic models are introduced: one to infer fish age from otolith images and a second one aiming at evaluating whether or not a given otolith growth pattern is realistic w.r.t. training examples. These probabilistic models provide us with the basis for coping with three different issues: the automated estimation of fish age from otolith images, the estimation of individual otolith growth patterns, and the definition of a confidence measure of otolith interpretations. These computer-assisted ageing tools are validated for a dataset of plaice otoliths. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

AB  - This paper reviews the results obtained by Russian and foreign researchers of the importance of balanced development of a region as an autonomous system. The author proposes an algorithm for generation of balanced regional development indicators as well as determination of "regional vitality index", provides an example of graphic representation of the results for the proposed method. Additionally, the paper contains the set of assumed indicators based on a social nature of the state. Regions, as used herein, are classified into balanced, socially oriented, and economically oriented, and strategic directions are defined on the basis of existing vector of development and regional vitality index, i. e. type of the region.
   Key takeaways and recommendations are listed in the conclusion. In particular, the results of determining the "region vitality factor" make it possible to estimate the level of regional social and economic development with the possibility of quantitatively calculating functional imbalances, determining (if any) the vector and magnitude of deformation. The consistency of the approach to the formation of blocks of indicators allows considering the key aspects of social and economic development of the region.

AB  - The past several decades have seen significant changes in how governments approach water management decisions. This paper reviews 12 major water management decisions in Queensland, Australia, during 1980-2006. The resilience paradigm was used to place the water management decisions in a social-ecological systems context rather than the traditional water resource context. The social-ecological context was interrogated through three parameters: scientific knowledge, environment and institutions for each of the decisions. Results indicate: (a) a trend for increased adoption of formalised integrative (social, economic and environmental factors) evaluation methods (such as benefit cost analysis and environmental impact assessment) in the scientific knowledge parameter of social-ecological context; (b) the environmental parameter (e.g. drought) influenced the timing of water decisions; and (c) a possible threshold was found within the institutional context, i.e. change of State leadership, which determined the regime or type of water decision under consideration e.g.. supply or demand dominated management. These findings provide insight to policy makers and scientists on the importance of social-ecological context in the assessment of State water decisions.

AB  - There is great interest and rapid progress around the world in developing sets of indicators of marine ecosystem integrity for assessment and management. However, the complexity of coastal marine ecosystems can challenge such efforts. To address this challenge, an expert-based, hierarchical, and adaptive approach was developed with the objectives of healthy marine ecosystems and community partnerships in monitoring and management. Small sets of the top-ranked indicators of ecosystem integrity and associated human pressures were derived from expert-rankings of lists of identified candidate indicators of the status of, and pressures on, each of 17 ecosystem features, organized within 8 elements in turn within 3 overlapping aspects of ecosystem health. Over 200 experts played a role in rating the relative value of 1035 candidate indicators. A panel of topic experts was assigned to each of the 17 ecosystem features to apply 21 weighted indicator selection criteria. Selection criteria and candidate indicators were identified through literature reviews, expert panels, and surveys, and they were evaluated in terms of the experts' judgements of importance to the health of Canada's Pacific marine ecosystems. This produced a flexible, robust, and adaptable approach to identifying representative sets of indicators for any scale and for any management unit within Canada's Pacific. At the broadest scale, it produced a top 20 list of ecosystem state and pressure indicators. These top indicators, or other sets selected for smaller regions, can then guide the development of both regional and nested local monitoring programs in a way that maximizes continuity while including locally unique values. This hierarchical expert-based approach was designed to address challenges of complexity and scale and to enable efficient selection of useful and representative sets of indicators of ecosystem integrity while also enabling the participation of broad government and stakeholder communities.

AB  - A theoretical framework for environmental impact assessment of economic activity is formulated by using methods of mathematical modeling and thematic mapping. Theoretically, environment is considered as a surface of variety (manifold), linking various factors and conditions. Tangential planes to the surface correspond to any natural systems (ecosystems), individual according to their connections with the environment (points of tangency). An example of the display of the environmental variety is provided by landscape-typological maps of a territory. The equation of the plane specifies connections of factor parameters of ecosystems by taking into account their shift relative to environmental coordinates of these reference points. Different types of systemic interpretations of these equations (types of models) are formed with various quantitative criteria for change of in environmental status, such as the measures of responsibility and effectiveness of decisions made. Environmental impact assessment methods generally estimate changes in the state of natural systems rather than the transformation of their environment. Therefore, methods of distinguishing relevant indicators and selecting the characteristic features of their controlled changes are suggested. The antisymmetry of variability and stability is naturally discernible from the factors and conditions of economic activity, which is demonstrated by modeling the impact of economic processes on the environmental status: an assessment was made of the influence of the size of gross regional product on amounts of atmospheric emissions of pollutants as well as of waste water discharges on human health. The findings can be used in developing methods of mathematical modeling of the relationships between the ecological, economic and social blocks of territorial systems in order to solve problems of thematic mapping and seek optimal solutions in the field of environmental management.

AB  - In the present study, we analysed the photosynthetic performance in five varieties of Vigna radiata, viz. vars RMG 268, K-851, RMG 492, RMG 975 and Anand using chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. We observed that var. RMG 268 tended to reach highest effective quantum yield of PSII [Delta F/F-m'], maximum apparent electron transport rate [ETRmax] and saturating photosynthetically active photon flux density [PPFDsat], followed by var. K-851. Thus as judged by its photosynthetic performance, ecophysiologically var. RMG 268 seems to be better adapted to the semi-arid environment of the state of Rajasthan, India. On the contrary, var. Anand was least adapted to its environment as indicated by lowest ETRmax, PPFDsat and Delta F/F-m' values. The activities of certain antioxidant enzymes of Vigna radiata in response to drought were also examined in var. RMG 268 and var. Anand. The increased activities of antioxidant enzymes, presumed to limit cellular damage, were observed in var. RMG 268. Cellular malondialdehyde content signal indicators of lipid peroxidation were much higher in var. Anand compared to var. RMG 268. These data revealed that var. RMG 268 had high resistance to environmental and drought conditions and thus substantiated our results obtained on the basis of plant performance.

AB  - Insects, particularly ants, are good bioindicators of the state of ecosystems. Nevertheless, incorporating them into conservation surveys is expensive due to problems associated with their identification, which is exacerbated by the fact that there are fewer and fewer taxonomists working today. "Taxonomic sufficiency" (TS), which identifies organisms to a level of taxonomic resolution sufficient enough to satisfy the objectives of a study, has never been applied to Neotropical ant communities. We analysed five Neotropical datasets representing ant assemblages collected with different sampling methods in various habitats. We first treated them using two complementary and cumulative TS methods, higher-taxon and "indicator taxa" surrogacies, before testing a new approach called "mixed-level method" that combines the two previous approaches. For the higher-taxon surrogacy, we showed that, above species, genus is the most informative taxonomic level. Then, mixed-level method provided more information on ant assemblages than did the two others, even though the "indicator taxa" surrogacy was based on relevant indicator genera. Although habitat type has no effect on its efficiency, this new method is influenced by the dataset structure and the type of sampling method used to collect data. We have thus developed a new method for analyzing Neotropical ant faunas that enables the taxonomic work linked to the identification of problematic species to be significantly reduced, while conserving most of the information on the ant assemblage. This method should enhance the work of Neotropical entomologists not specialised in taxonomy, particularly those concerned with biological conservation and indication. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the chemical compositional and nutritional profiles of a two number of white lupine cultivars (Lupinus albus, cultivars Amiga and Energy) suited to the pedoclimatic conditions in Romania, collected in the year 2015. No significant differences were observed among lupine cultivars in their dry matter (DM), crude ash or alkaloid contents. The highest protein content (36.4 +/- 1.1% of DM) and crude fat (10.1 +/- 1.2% of DM) was found in seeds from lupines belonging to cv. Amiga, while the highest crude fibre content (15.2 +/- 1.7% of DM) was found in cv. Energy. Both varieties examined were characterised by a shortage of methionine and lysine, but lysine deficiency was higher in cv. Energy. Amiga cultivar was found to be a nutritionally more valuable crop than cv. Energy by the standards of nutrition for mature human and animals (chicken broilers and growing pigs). Amiga lupine was characterised by a higher essential amino add index (EAAI) as well as chemical score (CS) of lysine, and the high nutritional index (NI) and biological value (BV) of protein as compared to cv. Energy. The white lupine seeds examined can serve as a source of good quality food protein for adult humans, meet the requirement for exogenous amino acids (EM) and Lys in chicken broilers and to a lesser degree in the case of growing pigs, according to the standards of nutrition used. Fatty acid (FA) composition showed that oleic acid (C18:1 n-9) was the major fatty acid, followed by linoleic (C18:2 n-6) and linolenic (C18:3 n-3) acids. Apart from the highest level of polyunsaturated fatty adds (PUFA) the seed oil of Amiga cultivar showed and the largest content of linolenic add (n-3) and the most favourable report n-3/n-6 FA.

AB  - 1. Earlier declines in marine resources, combined with current fishing pressures and devastating coral mortality in 2015, have resulted in a degraded coral reef ecosystem state at Puako in West Hawai'i. Changes to resource management are needed to facilitate recovery of ecosystem functions and services.
   2. We developed a customised ecosystem model to evaluate the performance of alternative management scenarios at Puako in the provisioning of ecosystem services to human users (marine tourists, recreational fishers) and enhancing the reef's ability to recover from pressures (resilience).
   3. Outcomes of the continuation of current management plus five alternative management scenarios were compared under both high and low coral-bleaching related mortality over a 15-year time span.
   4. Current management is not adequate to prevent further declines in marine resources. Fishing effort is already above the multispecies sustainable yield, and, at its current level, will likely lead to a shift to algal-dominated reefs and greater abundance of undesirable fish species. Scenarios banning all gears other than line fishing, or prohibiting take of herbivorous fishes, were most effective at enhancing reef structure and resilience, dive tourism, and the recreational fishery. Allowing only line fishing generated the most balanced trade-off between stakeholders, with positive gains in both ecosystem resilience and dive tourism, while only moderately decreasing fishery value within the area.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our customised ecosystem model projects the impacts of multiple, simultaneous pressures on a reef ecosystem. Trade-offs of alternative approaches identified by local managers were quantified based on indicators for different ecosystem services (e.g. ecosystem resilience, recreation, food). This approach informs managers of potential conflicts among stakeholders and provides guidance on approaches that better balance conservation objectives and stake-holders' interests. Our results indicate that a combination of reducing land-based pollution and allowing only line fishing generated the most balanced trade-off between stakeholders and will enhance reef recovery from the detrimental effects of coral bleaching events that are expected over the next 15 years.

AB  - According to the smart city concept, transformation of the urban environment requires state and municipal authorities to use information and communications technology. However, the system of performance evaluation within the initial process often does not reveal the difficulties in introducing innovative methods. The paper discusses the problems arising when executive authorities introduce digital technologies into the housing and utility sector. The theories of strategic management, project management, organizational change and the smart city concept constitute the research methodology. The study is based on mapping and visual assessment of actors' routes during the working day and the authors' system for a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the actors' work results and performance discipline that takes into account the digitalization of the control and planning functions. The information base includes the data from the system "Monitoring of the cleaning vehicles performance of road service companies" in Saint Petersburg (Russia). The statistical relationships between the assessment system indicators are determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient. As research results show, the main barriers to obtaining the planned result of organizational changes in the state management of basic processes in the housing and utility sector are technical imperfection of planning and control tools, fragmented application of innovations, invalidity and incompleteness of metrics in organizational management, peculiarities of labor behavior and performance discipline, as well as the lack of tools for prompt communication between decision-makers and actors. The findings can be used by state and municipal authorities when introducing digital technologies, including in the routine processes of ensuring the city life.

AB  - This work describes some aspects of reproductive biology of the Cichlidae Tylochromis jentinki (Steindachner, 1895) in Ebrie lagoon (Ivory Coast). Fish were sampled with gill nets from February 2004 to January 2006. The whole sample consisted in 1850 specimens with standard length (SL) ranging from 75 to 235 mm and weight from 11.90 to 407.57 g. Immediately after capture, SL was taken to the nearest 1 mm, and total body weight (TW) and eviscerated body weight (EW) to the nearest 0.1 g. The gonads and the liver were then removed, weighed to the nearest 0.001 g. The reproductive period of T jentinki was established by analysing the temporal evolution in the frequency of the maturity stages and monthly variations in the gonadosomatic index (GSI), the hepatosomatic index (HSI) and the condition factor (K). Sex-ratio was established taking into account the sex determinations. The sizes at which 50% of the specimens became mature (L-50) were estimated by means of logistic function that was fitted to the proportion of the mature individuals using a nonlinear regression. The sex-ratio for the overall sample showed a statistically significant predominance of females (1: 1,2; chi(2) = 14.54; n = 1850; p < 0.05). The first sexual maturity size was 118 mm (SL) for males and 126 mm for females. The smallest mature female was 81 mm (SL) while the smallest mature male was 93 mm (SL). Both monthly gonadosomatic index and macroscopically determined gonad stages strongly indicate that Tylochromis jentinki in Ebrie lagoon spawns in April and from October to December. Tylochromis jentinki exhibits a breeding strategy in relation to the lowest salinity and the food variability conditions. The reproduction of this species was synchronised to take advantage of the beneficial optimal environmental conditions in order to ensure greatest survival of the young. During oocyte growth, the hepatosomatic index and the condition factor increased. On the other hand, spawning leads to a decrease of HSI and K. Absolute fecundity was 105 and 465 oocytes for females of 114 and 230 mm (SL). The mean relative fecundity was 2223 +/- 765 ovocytes Kg(-1) of females. The mean oocyte diameter was 5.51 +/- 0.27 mm at spawning.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to show a relationship between toxicity of 100-fold concentrated water and aquatic habitat conditions. Environmental waters are 100-fold concentrated with solid-phase extraction. Medaka early fry was exposed in these waters for 48 h. The number of death and disorder was counted at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h; toxicity was expressed using inverse median effect time and median lethal time (ET (50) (-1) , LT (50) (-1) ). Average score per taxon (ASPT) for benthic animals and Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for fish were applied as indices of aquatic habitat conditions. The results of toxicity test were compared using ASPT and IBI. The different levels of toxicity were detected in the seawater of Japan. At the Husino River area, toxicity cannot be detected. In rivers, high toxicity appeared at urban districts without sewerage. By Spearman coefficient, the relationship between toxicity and high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were obtained. BOD household wastewater contains hydrophobic toxic matters; otherwise, seawater in industrial area does not show clear relationship between toxicity and chemical oxygen demand. Gas chromatography to mass spectrometry simultaneous analysis database may give an answer for the source of toxicity, but further test is required. Ratio of clear stream benthic animal sharply decreased over 0.25 of LT (50) (-1) or 0.5 of ET (50) (-1) . Tolerant fish becomes dominant over 0.3 of LT (50) (-1) or 0.5-1.0 of ET (50) (-1) . By Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, correlation coefficient between toxicity and ASPT was obtained at -0.773 (ET (50) (-1) ) and -0.742 (LT (50) (-1) ) at 1 % level of significance with a high negative correlation. Toxicity (LT (50) (-1) ) has strong correlation with the ratio of tolerant species. By Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, correlation coefficient between toxicity and IBI obtained were -0.155 (ET (50) (-1) ) and -0.190 (LT (50) (-1) ) at 1 % level of significance and has a low or no correlation between toxicity and IBI. Even with low toxic environmental waters, toxicity test using 100-fold concentrated and medaka early fly could detect acute toxicity. The detected toxicity seemed to limit the inhabiting aquatic species in the water body.

AB  - Streams and other waterbodies in poor ecological condition often require causal assessment to determine appropriate follow-up actions. However, site-specific causal assessments can be time consuming. To streamline the process, we describe a quantitative method that expedites a key component of causal assessment: identifying a group of ecologically similar (comparator) sites with which to compare and contrast biological condition and stressor exposure at the site of interest. A good set of comparator sites should: 1) represent environments that could support biota similar to the degraded site in the absence of disturbance, 2) comprise a gradient of biotic conditions, and 3) contain enough sites to assess variability. We used expected biological similarity to select good sets of comparator sites from a large pool of potential sites for 15 poor-condition test sites in Southern California. Expected biological similarity was measured as Bray-Curtis dissimilarity values (BC) calculated from the expected benthic macroinvertebrate taxa lists produced by a predictive biotic index of stream health. We used an expected BC threshold of <= 0.05 to create the sets of comparator sites. Based on this criterion, we identified >70 comparator sites for each of the 15 test sites. To illustrate their utility in a causal assessment, we used the comparator sites to derive evidence of whether 4 example stressors-elevated conductivity, elevated N, elevated fine sediment, and hardening of the stream channel-contributed to the poor biotic conditions at each of the 15 test sites. We used spatial-temporal co-occurrence type of evidence to evaluate the data and found that elevated conductivity and elevated fine sediment were the likely cause of biotic degradation at the most test sites. We developed the comparator site selection approach described here in the context of the stream bioassessment program in California, USA, but this approach could be adapted by any bioassessment program with a large amount of sample data and an associated predictive index of biotic condition, such as the National Aquatic Resource Survey. Furthermore, this approach lays the groundwork for rapid, screening-level causal assessment to become part of routine bioassessment, which would then inform follow-up management actions.

AB  - A detailed coal maceral and random vitrinite reflectance (R-o mean %) study of fourteen (14) coal seams, intersected in a deep (582.50 m) bore-hole No. ML-858 from Mallayyapalli region, Godavari Valley Coalfield is presented here. Quite low vitrinite reflectance variation between 0.48 % and 0.49 % is recorded from the upper parts of seams II Top, IIB and the entire IIC seam, indicating the attainment of sub-bituminous B stage. Whereas, the seams MA and III bottom, have shown higher reflectance of 0.69%, thus having reached high volatile bituminous B rank. However, the seams IB, Index below IB, IA Top, IA Bottom, I, basal parts of II Top and IIC and the entire IIB, Index above III, IIIB and III Top with vitrinite reflectance variation between 0.51 % and 0.59% have attained high volatile bituminous C stage.
   The maceral study has revealed the existence of very high amount of mineral matter from the topmost Index above IB and III top seam. The ternary mineral matter free (m.m.f.) diagram suggest, that the Index below IB, IIIB and III bottom seams contain vitric type of coal. Index above III seam has fusic coal constitution whereas; the seams IA top and IIIA contain mixed type of coal. The seams IIB and IIC seams have been found associated with vitric and fusic coal types. Similarly, IB and II Top seams contain fusic and mixed type of coal and the IA bottom and I seam is characterized by vitric and mixed coal types.
   The maceral and mineral matter constitution has indicated that, most of the coal seams in Mallayyapalli area have been deposited during the prevalence of alternate oxic and anoxic conditions, except the Index below IB seam, which has witnessed wet moor conditions with intermittent moderate to high flooding. A similar climatic change during deposition has also been noticed in I and IA bottom seams. However, a wide range of climatic alterations viz., existence of alternate oxic and anoxic moor conditions, invasion of moderate as well sudden high floods at the depositional site have been recorded for the IIB seam.

AB  - Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was evaluated for the detection of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), Enterococcus spp., in San Diego County beach water samples collected under diverse conditions, from multiple pollution sources, as part of regulatory monitoring activities over 20 months. Two US EPA-approved methods, qPCR (EPA 1609.1) and Enterolert (SM9230D), were used as reference comparator methods. A total of 361 samples were assayed by both ddPCR and qPCR and yielded an acceptable Index of Agreement (IA) of 0.89, based on EPA Site-Specific analysis guidelines. A Pearson's correlation coefficient of r = 0.87 (p < 0.001), further indicated a strong relationship between the methods results. From the 361 samples, 185 split samples with ddPCR and Enterolert values within the limits of quantification, were used as a `training' data set to derive an intrinsic copy number equation (ICE) for scaling ddPCR gene copy number to Enterolert most probable number (MPN). Of the 1993 samples that comprised the complete `test' data set assayed by ddPCR and Enterolert, 1086 generated results that fell within the limits of quantification for Enterolert and yielded an overall IA of 0.64. Re-analysis using median as a measure of central tendency to account for significant skewing of Enterolert data yielded an IA of 0.72. Beach grouping-specific IA values ranged from 0.63 to 0.93. Pearson's correlation coefficient, r, ranged from 0.13 to 0.94 within beach groupings and generated a combined value of 0.60 for all groupings. Using the ICE, a ddPCR advisory threshold of 1413 DNA copy number/100 mL was empirically determined to be the equivalent to the California Enterolert beach action threshold of 104 MPN/100 mL, based on comparison with all 1993 paired ddPCR and Enterolert results. Using the 1413 DNA copy number/ 100 mL as a beach action threshold for ddPCR resulted in a 90.4% agreement with Enterolert (6.0% false negative and 3.7% false positive). Together these findings support the conclusion that ddPCR readouts align closely with Enterolert MPN for identifying FIB exceedance levels of Enterococcus spp. in coastal waters of San Diego, CA.

AB  - Watersheds are spatially explicit landscape units that contain a range of interacting physical, ecological and social attributes. They are social-ecological systems that provide a range of ecosystem services valued by the society. Their ability to provide these services depends, in part, on the degree to which they are impaired by human-related activity. An array of indicators is used by natural resource managers, both private and government, to assess watersheds and their sub-components. Often these assessments are performed in comparison with a reference condition. However, assessments can be hampered because natural settings of many systems differ from those sites used to characterize reference conditions. Additionally, given the ubiquity of human-related alterations across landscapes (e.g. atmospheric deposition of anthropogenically derived nitrogen), truly unaltered conditions for most, if not all, watersheds cannot be described. Definitions of integrity' have been developed for river ecosystems, but mainly at the reach or site scale and usually for particular species, such as fish or macroinvertebrates. These scales are inappropriate for defining integrity at the watershed scale. In addition, current assessments of endpoints do not indicate the source of impairment. Our definition of watershed integrity' is the capacity of a watershed to support and maintain the full range of ecological processes and functions essential to the sustainability of biodiversity and of the watershed resources and services provided to society. To operationalize this definition as an assessment tool, we identify key functions of unimpaired watersheds. This approach can then be used to model and map watershed integrity by incorporating risk factors (human-related alterations or stressors) that have been explicitly shown to interfere with and degrade key functions in watersheds. An advantage of this approach is that the index can be readily deconstructed to identify factors influencing index scores, thereby directly supporting the strategic adaptive management of individual components that contribute to watershed integrity. Moreover, the approach can be iteratively applied and improved as new data and information become available. (c) 2015 The Authors. River Research and Applications published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We developed and tested a species-level Bray-Curtis (BC) similarity to reference index and a genus-level diatom model affinity (DMA) index to quantify agricultural and acid mine drainage (AMD) impacts on streams in the Western Allegheny Plateau of southeastern Ohio. Decreased similarity to references sites was found in impaired streams, and diatom metrics further indicated how assemblages were impacted. Sites identified by index scores as impaired had significantly greater conductivity, PO4-P, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl-, % pasture in the upstream watershed, and forest fragmentation than minimally impaired sites (p < 0.05). Percent acidophilic diatoms significantly increased with reduced alkalinity caused by mining impacts (p < 0.01). Relative abundances of species indicating low P and N status decreased with increased pasture and row crops in upstream watersheds (p < 0.01), whereas abundance of motile diatoms increased (p < 0.01). In a case study, diatom, macroinvertebrate, and fish assemblages were compared among 18 sites in a single watershed (6 sites along an AMD impact gradient, 6 NaOH-treated AMD sites, and 6 sites with no mining impacts). All assemblages indicated severe impairment by AMD, but fish were least useful because they were absent from 5 of the 6 sites. Macroinvertebrates indicated unimpaired conditions at treated sites, but fish signaled potential problems (lower than expected biomass and presence of deformities) despite high species richness and index of biotic integrity scores. Diatom indices indicated significant impairment at AMD and treated sites (p < 0.01). Diatom metrics and indices very effectively signaled agricultural and mining impacts at the regional scale and were especially useful in the case study because they provided finer resolution of AMD effects and additional information of ecological importance missed by or in conflict between macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages. The DMA and BC indices responded similarly to stressors at the regional scale, but BC more effectively signaled impacts at the watershed scale. However, DMA was an effective assessment tool that might be used more easily than BC by novice phycologists and watershed groups because it requires less taxonomic expertise. If implemented in future watershed or regional studies, diatom indices could greatly benefit policy, management plans, and current monitoring efforts.

AB  - Rapid urbanisation and industrial growth in South Africa increases the need for proactive allocation of freshwater resources on a regional scale. A nine-step method is described that sets long-term targets for water resource condition and future use with a focus on estuary water quantity and quality requirements. The approach specifically focuses on the environmental flow allocation to estuaries, nested within a broader, regional (multi-catchment and multi-estuary) water resource landscape. The method differs to most other approaches in that the responses of multiple estuaries to escalating future development in a region are coherently quantified (versus only considering a single estuary in a single catchment). A case study that assessed the health, biodiversity importance and resilience to current and future pressures of 64 estuaries is used to illustrate the method. Projected growth in the study area was integrated into a range of future dam development and wastewater discharge scenarios. The results showed that estuaries around the urban centres were in poor condition, but those in the more rural areas in a more natural state. As a result of their small size, most of the estuaries in the region had little resilience to changes in freshwater quantity and nutrient loading. In contrast, the larger systems, targeted for dam development, only showed sensitivity to water abstraction during low-flow periods when base-flow reduction caused mouth closure and changes in nutrient processes. Broadly, the approach aimed to find a balance between ecological requirements and socio-economic development which meant that maintaining larger systems in relatively good condition would be at the expense of smaller systems that are already in a poor condition. The approach developed was successful in quantifying the responses of multiple estuaries to escalating future pressures on a regional scale, and could be replicated to assist in managing water resources elsewhere in data-limited environments.

AB  - The highly productive northern Bering and Chukchi marine shelf ecosystem has long been dominated by strong seasonality in sea-ice and water temperatures. Extremely warm conditions from 2017 into 2019-including loss of ice cover across portions of the region in all three winters-were a marked change even from other recent warm years. Biological indicators suggest that this change of state could alter ecosystem structure and function. Here, we report observations of key physical drivers, biological responses and consequences for humans, including subsistence hunting, commercial fishing and industrial shipping. We consider whether observed state changes are indicative of future norms, whether an ecosystem transformation is already underway and, if so, whether shifts are synchronously functional and system wide or reveal a slower cascade of changes from the physical environment through the food web to human society. Understanding of this observed process of ecosystem reorganization may shed light on transformations occurring elsewhere.
   Exceptionally warm years in 2017-2019 have caused changes in the physical and biological characteristics of the Pacific Arctic Ocean. What these changes mean for the ecosystem and societal consequences will depend on if they are evidence of a transformation or anomalies in the system.

AB  - This paper investigates one specific cultural ecosystem service: outdoor recreation. We present a method to map the collective preferences for outdoor recreation and to identify the substitutability among nature sites in the context of the province of Antwerp, Belgium. We propose an indicator of substitutability among nature areas, contrasting unique but poorly substitutable sites (hot spots) with highly substitutable sites (cold spots). Using a combination of survey information, public participation GIS (PPGIS) and kernel density mapping, we produce density surfaces representing the distribution of the collective preferences for outdoor recreation and identify the spatial characteristics of the market (e.g. extent, discontinuities) for outdoor recreation. We also compute Getis-Ord G(i)* spatial statistics to identify local outdoor recreation clusters. In addition, we explore how recreational behaviour affects substitutability. Our results suggest a duality between the social value of outdoor recreation and the level of substitutability among nature sites. Highly substitutable sites tend to be found near areas of higher population density, which are as well highly visited sites. The type of recreational activity - hiking, cycling, dog walking or jogging - appears to substantially modify substitutability patterns among nature sites. We conclude by discussing the methodological implications of this research in the context of stated preference ecosystem service valuation and stress several policy -related implications.

AB  - Oyster populations in Chesapeake Bay, USA, declined precipitously over the past three decades, and on-going efforts to restore the native oysters to former abundance were considered to be ineffective. Maryland and Virginia natural resource agencies proposed the introduction of a non-native Asian oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis) that is resistant to diseases affecting the native oyster and well adapted to the Chesapeake Bay environment. Numerous stakeholders raised concerns about potential adverse consequences of an introduction of a non-native species into a new environment. In response, state and federal agencies determined that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) should be prepared to address the environmental consequences of such an introduction as well as of seven other oyster restoration alternatives, including several involving only the native oyster. Preparation of an Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) of the proposed action as well as all alternatives was an integral element of EIS preparation. This series of articles describes several different analyses that contributed to and collectively comprised the ERA conducted as input to the EIS. The final article of this series in HERA describes how the ERA and EIS findings were taken into account in the final decision on the preferred restoration alternative by state and federal agencies.

FX  - The work reported on in the articles in this series was funded by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, via cooperative agreements with the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Studies, and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. Work on the ERA and the EIS was conducted in collaboration with the Maryland Environmental Service and performed under the direction and leadership of a management team comprised of Mr. Thomas O'Connell, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Mr. Jack Travelstead, Virginia Marine Resources Commission, Mr. A. C. Carpenter, Potomac River Fisheries Commission, and Mr. Mark Mansfield, Norfolk District, USACE (CENAO). Technical direction was provided by a Project Delivery Team consisting of representatives of: Norfolk District, USACE (CENAO); Virginia Marine Resources Commission; National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); Engineering Research and Development Center, USACE (ERDC); Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC); Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR); Potomac River Fisheries Commission; USEPA; and, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The assessment relied on the considerable research on the Asian oyster that was carried out by individuals at various universities and government research laboratories. Many of those researchers provided insights into data interpretation and reviewed various parts of the assessment. The large number of contributors to the overall program are identified in the various appendices of the Final PEIS (USACE 2009) and their contributions to this effort are too numerous to summarize in a brief acknowledgment.

T2  - REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Colonies of the green alga Botryococcus occur in the Precambrian and throughout the Phanerozoic succession and have been interpreted as indicators of freshwater environments or influence. It has long been known that Botryococcus is a source of hydrocarbons in geological deposits and this has stimulated much research on the living alga, B. braunii Kutzing. This research has shown, for example, that the nature of the hydrocarbon produced may be related to the physiological state of the alga. In a study of Mesozoic samples it has been observed that the Botryococcus colonies exhibit different stages of development, similar to the physiological states of the living alga; the different stages appear to be specific to certain samples and are seldom, if ever, found together. Material from Swedish Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sediments has been studied to investigate possible relationships between environment and the state of development of the alga. Torbanite from Scotland, kerosene shale from New South Wales, Australia, and colonies of modern Botryococcus have also been studied for comparative purposes. Detailed examination and the recognition of the stages of development at which Botryococcus colonies are preserved may yield more information about the palaeoenvironment than was previously recognised, leading, in some cases, to firmer interpretations of depositional conditions.

AB  - Ecosystem can offer regulating services to change biodiversity patterns and ecological processes and then affect the prevalence of crop pests. Biological pest control could serve as an environmentally friendly ecological control service to suppress crop pests and decrease pesticide use by maintaining or increasing natural enemies. However, few study focus on the explicit process of natural enemies, pest dynamics, quantitative assessment and maintaining mechanism of ecological control service in multi-crop farmland landscape system for the whole crops growing cycle. Here, an experimental model of rotation-intercropping ecosystem via wheat-maize-cotton was planned for three consecutive years to response above questions. Our result found the rotation-intercropping ecosystem help to increase the abundances of the dominant natural enemy, Propylea japonica adults and then promoted aphid reduction in center cotton plots. In crops growing cycle, many predators maintained in wheat from Mid-April to late May, then the predator moved to inhabit in maize before wheat harvest during early June. During the intercropping period of maize and cotton, the predator would prefer to back and forth inhabit in maize and travel to cotton to actively prey on cotton pests. Quantitative evaluation of pest control based on a new built method of Ecological Control Service Index (ESI) found that crop diversity has highly efficient control function in rotation-intercropping ecosystem. The values of ESI at the peak of cotton aphids on center cotton plots were 0.80 in 2012, 0.31 in 2013 and 0.61 in 2014, respectively. The sustainably available prey resources in multi-crops ecosystem and maize as crop habitat with conditions of relative low temperature (28.5 degrees C) and high humidity (68.3 %) are beneficial to maintain the predator natural enemy and ecological control service. Thus, our results suggest that giving full play to the ecological control service of crop diversity in rotation-intercropping ecosystem is beneficial to decrease crop pests and pesticide use, especially under the aggravating agricultural intensification. These findings support growing efforts from landowner, field manager and policy-makers to promote this ecosystem service via designing crops patterns and adjusting crops growing circle in regional agroecosystem.

AB  - The fundamental goal underlying studies of the environment and environmental processes is to be able to evaluate the impact of various contaminants on live organisms, including humans. Until recently, data obtained by common chemical and physicochemical methods were used in environmental risk assessment. However, such data could be characterized as routine and limited to the determinations of chosen toxic substances expressed as generalized chemical indicators of environmental pollution.
   In recent years, there has been intense development of bioanalytical techniques that employ live organisms as indicators. Biotests detect the presence of toxic substances in the environment, and determine their toxicity in the samples analyzed by quantitatively estimating the harm that they cause to live organisms.
   Ecotoxicological tests are also employed as one of the tools in comprehensive assessment of the state of the environment. In this case, the environmental data and the information on the impact of pollutants on live organisms are obtained from environmental samples that have been analyzed with both chemical techniques and biotests.
   In this article, we present the data available on the application of integrated research for assessing the quality of the aquatic environment. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid Ecological Assessment protocols are important tools for the training of postgraduate students, as well as the collection of data on poorly-known and protected areas with the potential for the preservation of water supplies for urban areas. The objective of this study was to perform a survey of water quality and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in two sub-basins at the Mata do Junco Wildlife Refuge in the Brazilian state of Sergipe. The collection of data in the field, laboratory processing, and the interpretation and discussion of data were conducted in groups by students from two postgraduate programmes in Ecology and Conservation (UFMG and UFS), personnel of the state environment agency (SEMARH), school teachers from the local town of Capela, and members of the reserve's voluntary fire brigade. The results of the assessment were organised, analysed, and presented at the reserve headquarters in the form of posters, for the development of environmental education activities with pupils from local schools, as well as contributing to a SEMARH seminar. Samples were characterised by distinct taxonomic compositions and diversity, as confirmed by MDS and additive partitioning of diversity analyses. The gravel substrate presented the lower mean taxonomic richness in each sampling unit (alpha(1) = 28%), while the average difference among samples (beta(1) diversity) was elevated for both substrates (39% for leaf litter, 41% for gravel), reflecting the pronounced variation among samples, even adjacent ones within the same stream. Diversity between streams was lower in the case of leaf litter in comparison with gravel (beta(2) = 21 and 31%, respectively). A total of 57 fish specimens were collected with a predominance of individuals of the orders Characiformes (62%) and Perciformes (21%). This rapid ecological assessment confirmed the importance of the conservation unit and emphasised the need for its continuation, given its importance for the maintenance of water quality and its other ecological services, such as the conservation of the region's aquatic biodiversity and providing the local town of Capela (circa 20,000 inhabitants) with its water supply, the Mata do Junco being its only source.

AB  - The European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) seeks to achieve, for all European seas, "Good Environmental Status" (GEnS), by 2020. Ecological models are currently one of the strongest approaches used to predicting and understanding the consequences of anthropogenic and climate-driven changes in the natural environment. We assess the most commonly used capabilities of the modelling community to provide information about indicators outlined in the MSFD, particularly on biodiversity, food webs, non-indigenous species and seafloor integrity descriptors. We built a catalogue of models and their derived indicators to assess which models were able to demonstrate: (1) the linkages between indicators and ecosystem structure and function and (2) the impact of pressures on ecosystem state through indicators. Our survey identified 44 ecological models being implemented in Europe, with a high prevalence of those that focus on links between hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry, followed by end-to-end, species distribution/habitat suitability, bio-optical (remote sensing) and multispecies models. Approximately 200 indicators could be derived from these models, the majority of which were biomass and physical/hydrological/chemical indicators. Biodiversity and food webs descriptors, with similar to 49% and similar to 43% respectively, were better addressed in the reviewed modelling approaches than the non-indigenous species (0.3%) and sea floor integrity (similar to 8%) descriptors. Out of 12 criteria and 21 MSFD indicators relevant to the abovementioned descriptors, currently only three indicators were not addressed by the 44 models reviewed. Modelling approaches showed also the potential to inform on the complex, integrative ecosystem dimensions while addressing ecosystem fundamental properties, such as interactions between structural components and ecosystems services provided, despite the fact that they are not part of the MSFD indicators set. The cataloguing of models and their derived indicators presented in this study, aim at helping the planning and integration of policies like the MSFD which require the assessment of all European Seas in relation to their ecosystem status and pressures associated and the establishment of environmental targets (through the use of indicators) to achieve GEnS by 2020.

AB  - The Gulf of Mexico is one of the most ecologically and economically valuable marine ecosystems in the world and is affected by a variety of natural and anthropogenic phenomena including climate, hurricanes, coastal development, agricultural runoff, oil spills, and fishing. These complex and interacting stressors, together with the highly dynamic nature of this ecosystem, present challenges for the effective management of its resources. We analyze a compilation of over 100 indicators representing physical, biological, and economic aspects of the Gulf of Mexico and find that an ecosystem-wide reorganization occurred in the mid-1990s. Further analysis of fishery landings composition data indicates a major shift in the late 1970s coincident with the advent of US national fisheries management policy, as well as significant shifts in the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s. These latter shifts are aligned temporally with changes in a major climate mode in the Atlantic Ocean: the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). We provide an explanation for how the AMO may drive physical changes in the Gulf of Mexico, thus altering higher-level ecosystem dynamics. The hypotheses presented here should provide focus for further targeted studies, particularly in regard to whether and how management should adjust to different climate regimes or states of nature. Our study highlights the challenges in understanding the effects of climatic drivers against a background of multiple anthropogenic pressures, particularly in a system where these forces interact in complex and nonlinear ways.

AB  - This research aims at contributing to the use of Polymesoda arctata, Anadara tuberculosa, and Larkinia grandis as prospective biomonitors and sentinels, surrogate of Crassostrea rhizophorae for pollution biomonitoring in mangrove-lined coastal systems. Localities were selected along the Nicaraguan coastline in the rainy and dry seasons during 2012-2013: A tuberculosa and L grandis were collected in the Pacific, and P. arctata in the Caribbean. The tissue concentration of metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPS) were integrated into pollution indices (chemical pollution index -CPI- and pollution load index -PLI-) and biological endpoints (flesh-condition, reproduction, histopathology and stress-on-stress) were determined as biomarkers of ecosystem health disturbance. In the Caribbean, contaminant tissue concentration was low in P. arctata, with some exceptions. Ag, As, Cd, Hg, Ni and V were mainly recorded during dry season, and PAHs and POPs (HCHs, DDTs, AHTN, PCBs and BDE85) during rainy season. Metals and PAHs were not a major threat in the study area; in contrast, high levels of HCHs and DDTs and low-to-moderate levels of musk fragrances and PBDEs were recorded. Minor differences were found in biological parameters albeit during the rainy season the LT50 values were low and seemingly associated to high PLI and CPI values. In the Pacific, the main pollutants recorded in A. tuberculosa and L. grandis were HCHs, DDTs, AHTN and PDBEs in rainy season and Cd in dry season. Although basic research is needed to understand the general biology, ecology and diseases in these species, biological endpoints comparable to those used in other sentinel bivalves are seemingly suitable biomarkers of health disturbance. Overall, Caribbean P. arctata and Pacific A. tuberculosa and L. grandis seem to be potential target species for pollution monitoring and ecosystem health disturbance assessment in mangrove-lined Nicaraguan coastal systems. Their use together with C. rhizophorae would provide opportunities for common approaches to be applied in inter-ocean countries of the Mesoamerican region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human societies, and their well-being, depend to a significant extent on the state of the ecosystems that surround them. These ecosystems are changing rapidly usually in response to anthropogenic changes in the environment. To determine the likely impact of environmental change on ecosystems and the best ways to manage them, it would be desirable to be able to predict their future states. We present a proposal to develop the paradigm of predictive systems ecology, explicitly to understand and predict the properties and behaviour of ecological systems. We discuss the necessary and desirable features of predictive systems ecology models. There are places where predictive systems ecology is already being practised and we summarize a range of terrestrial and marine examples. Significant challenges remain but we suggest that ecology would benefit both as a scientific discipline and increase its impact in society if it were to embrace the need to become more predictive.

AB  - Sustainable transportation in the U.S. is essential for long-term economic growth and mobility, and environmental preservation. Using a non-radial slack-based measurement data envelopment analysis (SBM-DEA) model and state-level data, this study assesses the environmental efficiency of the transportation sector in the U.S. from years 2004 to 2012. In addition to environmental efficiency, carbon efficiency and potential carbon reduction were estimated for the 50 U.S. states. The findings of this study reveal that U.S. transportation sector was environmentally inefficient; U.S. states had an average transportation environmental efficiency score below 0.64. Therefore the states could substantially reduce carbon emissions to improve the environmental efficiency of their transportation sectors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Within the perspective of siting wind farms offshore of Rhode Island, USA, the State and National Environmental Agencies had requested a local marine ecological assessment, which led to an ecological zoning of the area. In view of expanding this zoning outside its limit of the test area and filling gaps in ecological zones, an effort to model those ecological zones using marine landscape or abiotic features was carried out. This study tests the accuracy of selected machine learning algorithmic models, decision tree, and random forest, for relating marine landscapes features to ecological sub-regions. Both models show to be good predictive tools with accuracy after cross validation of the order of 5-3%. Key abiotic variables to provide an accurate model were investigated. The study demonstrates the importance of the distance to coast, the sediment characteristics (fraction of clay, median size of the sediments), the hydrodynamic features, in particular not only tidal current/drag force, but also wave drag force, and finally the oceanographic characteristics such as stratification and sea surface temperature to built a good predictive model. Those findings provide some insight on the pre-monitoring effort optimization.

AB  - AimsThe aim of this work was to identify the main environmental factors that induce the special physiology displayed by fungi growing in solid culturethat is, higher secondary metabolite (SM) productioncompared with those in submerged culture.
   Methods and ResultsLovastatin-specific production (SP) was used as an indicator of the physiological status, and different model culture systems were used to evaluate the impact of potential solid-state fermentation (SSF) environmental stimuli. Direct contact with air was identified as an important stimulus. Cultures with two or more hours of exposure to air showed typical SSF lovastatin SP (1462% higher than cultures exposed for 008h). Intermediate times of exposure generated intermediate physiological states. Support-related stimuli also induced higher lovastatin SP, even in a liquid environment (679% increase).
   ConclusionsDirect contact with air, as well as support-related stimuli, are major environmental cues that induce the physiology of solid medium.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis knowledge is the starting point to investigate how these environmental cues are sensed and transduced, impacting SM and enzyme production. These results have important applied potential in new strategies to generate overproducing strains, as well as application in the design of novel production systems.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges when conducting a continental-scale assessment of wetlands is setting appropriate expectations for the assessed sites. The challenge occurs for two reasons: (1) tremendous natural environmental heterogeneity exists within a continental landscape and (2) reference sites vary in quality both across and within major regions of the continent. We describe the process used to set reference expectations and define a disturbance gradient for the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency's National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA). The NWCA employed a probability design and sampled 1138 wetland sites across the conterminous US to make an unbiased assessment of wetland condition. NWCA vegetation data were used to define 10 reporting groups based on ecoregion and wetland type that reduced the naturally occurring variation in wetland vegetation associated with continent-wide differences in biogeography. These reporting groups were used as a basis for defining quantitative criteria for least disturbed and most disturbed conditions and developing indices and thresholds for categories of ecological condition and disturbance. The NWCA vegetation assessment was based on a reference site approach, in which the least disturbed reference sites were used to establish benchmarks for assessing the condition of vegetation at other sites. Reference sites for each reporting group were identified by filtering NWCA sample data for disturbance using a series of abiotic variables. Ultimately, 277 least disturbed sites were used to set reference expectations for the NWCA. The NWCA provided a unique opportunity to improve our conceptual and technical understanding of how to best apply a reference condition approach to assessing wetlands across the US. These results will enhance the technical quality of future national assessments.

AB  - Antidepressant drugs have been detected in municipal wastewater effluents (MWWEs) at ng/L to low mu g/L concentrations. We exposed fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) over a full lifecycle to a mixture of five antidepressants at concentrations similar to a MWWE (1x AntiD Mix); venlafaxine at 2400 ng/L, citalopram at 240 ng/L, fluoxetine at 90 ng/L, sertraline at 20 ng/L, and bupropion at 90 ng/L, and 10x these concentrations (i.e. 10x AntiD Mix). Mean measured concentrations of venlafaxine, citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and bupropion were 2300, 160, 110, 7 ng/L, and below detection limits, respectively, for the 1x AntiD Mix, and 33,000, 2900, 1000, 210, and 100 ng/L, respectively for the 10x AntiD Mix. During the life-cycle exposure, no significant changes were observed in survival of fathead minnows. When male fish from the exposed treatments reached maturity, their weights were increased compared to control males. There were no significant differences in condition factor, gonadosomatic index, or liver-somatic index in the exposed fish. Exposed fathead minnows produced similar numbers of eggs as control fish, and there were no changes in nest-defense behaviours of male minnows. Egg quality, % fertilization, and % hatching in F1 fry were unaffected by exposure to the antidepressants. Eggs hatched 0.5 d earlier, deformities in fry were 50% lower, and there were transient decreases in length of F1 larvae at 8 days post-hatch in offspring from the treatment with the 10x AntiD Mix. Overall, exposure to the antidepressant mixture at environmentally relevant concentrations (i.e. 1x AntiD Mix) caused no adverse effects in fathead minnows. Exposure to the 10x AntiD Mix increased the weight of adult male minnows and caused subtle effects in F1 offspring. This study is the first to assess sublethal effects in fish exposed to mixtures of antidepressants over a full lifecycle.
   Capsule: No effects were observed in fathead minnow exposed for a lifecycle to antidepressant mixtures at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bis(2-ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate (TBPH), a high production volume flame retardant chemical used as a replacement for banned flame retardants, has been detected in media and human and wildlife tissues globally. We describe bioaccumulation and biological effects from dietary exposure of TBPH to an estuarine fish, Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Briefly, adult fish were fed carrier control or chemically amended diets for 28 d, followed by 14 d of control diet feeding. Diets were amended with TBPH (TBPH_LO diet, 139g/g dry wt, or TBPH_HI diet, 4360g/g dry wt) or a polychlorinated biphenyl congener (PCB153 diet, 13g/g dry wt), which was included as a positive control for bioaccumulation. Although bioaccumulation of either chemical correlated with fish size, only a small proportion of the TBPH offered (<0.5% total TBPH) had bioaccumulated into TBPH-treated fish by 28 d. In contrast, 24.5% of the PCB153 offered was accounted for in 28-d PCB-treated fish. Although 28-d bioaccumulated concentrations of TBPH differed by sex and treatment, sexes did not differ in their rates of TBPH bioaccumulation, and the time to achieve 50% of 28 d concentration (T-1/2) was estimated to be 13 d. Depuration rates of TBPH did not differ by sex or treatment, and the time after exposure to achieve T-1/2 was estimated to be 22 d. Independent of treatment, male fish grew faster than female fish, but for both sexes reproductive condition (gonadal somatic index) declined unexpectedly over the experimental period. Across treatments, only the TBPH_LO treatment affected growth, reducing male but increasing female growth rates by small amounts relative to respective controls. In summary, our study used very high concentrations of dietary TBPH to contaminate fish tissues above the highest levels reported to date in wild biota, yet we observed few adverse biological effects.

AB  - The aim of the contribution was to find to which extent a higher resistance of the laying hens of brown-egg type to stresses [infection, sudden changes in housing medium, bad quality of feed], reflects in their performance, if the influence of adverse effects is reduced to minimum, i. e. technology of rearing, prophylaxis and nutrition correspond to requirements of present large-scale production of eggs.
   Laying tests of the years 1981/1982 - 1985/1986 were used for analysis carried out at Random Sample Tests Station [RST] at St. Johann, Kitzingen, Neu Ulrichstein, Kalkriese and Eickelborn in Germany. There were 14 [239 samples] white and 12 [218] brown egg type of hybrid combinations.
   The effect of interaction: type of laying hen X station on the performance of laying hens was tested on the basis of linear model [1], where y(ijklm) is a phenotypic value of the tested sample, mu - average for the whole set, a(i) is effect of type of layer, b(ij) - effect of hybrid within the type of layer, c(k) effect of station, d(l) effect of a year, [ac]ik effect of interaction: type of layer X station, [ad]il effect of interaction: type of layer X year, e(ijklm) residual deviation.  Interaction [ac]ik was statistically significant [P < 0.01] in most of properties under study [Tab. I, column 5].  It is evident that white-egg and brown-egg layers do not respond to conditions of testing stations identically sensitively.  Therefore, a response of layers we tried to express more concrete by means of regression coefficients.
   Four parameters of performance - weight at the end of rearing, mortality during laying period hen housed egg production, egg mass - were selected for regression analysis.  Regression coefficients were estimated for 12 most numerously represented hybrid combinations [Tabs. II to V].  We started from regression model [2], where y(khlm) is a phenotypic value of tested sample, mu + a(h) average phenotypic value of the sample h-th hybrid, b1h regression coefficient of dependence y(hklm) for I(kl), I(kl) so-called index of environment, b2h regression coefficient of dependence y(hklm) for year, d(l) effect of year, e(hklm) deviation form regression.  The rate of phenotypic stability of layers is in the model [2] regression coefficient b(lh), which expresses dependence of hybrid phenotype on the quality of environment of stations.  In the case of theoretically average hybrid, i. e. y(hklm) = I(kl), is b(th) = 1.  If it is below 1, this is the case of hybrid with higher phenotypic stability than is the mean of a set.  If it is above 1, it is the hybrid with lower stability than is mean of a set, i.e. with higher sensitivity on outside factors of environment.  Index I(kl) characterizes the quality of environment of particular stations.  This is determined on the basis of the mean value of samples at the given station and in the given year according to the formula [3] where n.kl is a number of samples in k-th station in l-th year, n..1 number of samples in l-th year.  We expect that the effect of the stations can be changed over the years, these changes may not be additively summed up with effects of years.
   The results of regression analysis in view of mortality of layers laying period are described in Tab. III.  It is evident that higher range of values XBAR and b(lh) exhibit the hybrids of white-egg type.  In white-egg crossbreeds, XBAR values are ranging form 4.38 to 6.94 %, b(lh) values are ranging from 0.16 to 1.46, in brown-egg layers within the range of 4.11 to 4.91 % and 0.43 to 1.08,  Conditions created for laying hybrids at RST than do not induce a mortality so often in brown egg layers like in white egg layers. Brown egg layers responsed less sensitive to the difference between environmental conditions in individual RST stations [Tab. III].  Their response is either mean [b(lh) 0.94-1.08], or below - average [b(lh) 0.43-0.72] in comparison with the response of most layers tested in the given conditions.  In white-egg type according to the value of b(lh) one may expect a different response to the environment of the station in dependence on the genotype of a concrete hybrid.  Higher resistance of brown-egg layers to the stress factors, evident in large-scale conditions, when some important agents does not gain a suitable level, is manifested in the conditions we regard as very good for both genotypes.
   The results of regression analysis of live weight at the end of rearing are described in Tab. II.  The values b(lh) significantly differs among groups of white-egg and brown-egg layers.  In white-egg, this ranges from 0.63 to 1.07, in brown-egg layers it is ranging from 1.08 to 1.23.  b(lh) values exhibits a certain dependence of average body weight [Fig.1].  It can be expected that in good conditions of Industrial large-scale production, the weight at the end of rearing is more variable parameter in brown-egg hybrids than in white-egg hybrids.  This fact seem to be very surprising.  An explanation is evidently associated with higher resistance of brown-egg layers.  The action of adverse effects, which is not leading to mortality very often due to higher resistance of these layers.  This must reflect more in the body weights, being an important indicator of health of layers.
   Hen housed egg production and egg mass exhibit a wide range of values XBAR and b(lh) within both groups of hybrids [Tab. III,IV].  The difference in the values b(lh) is of similar tendency as a mortality rate [properties dependent on mortality].  The response of the group of white-egg layers on the change in conditions of environment is in the case of egg production and egg mass output slightly balanced as in the percentage of mortality during laying period.  Except the hybrid Nick Chick, the hybrids change their performance either proportionally to the given environment [b(lh) about 1], or are rearing more steady [b(lh) < 1].  It follows from the above-mentioned that the susceptibility to the outside environment in these traits conditioned first of all by specificity of genotype of a certain hybrid, less dependent on its ranking among on or other group of layers.
   On the basis of average level of performance XBAR and the values of phenotypic stability b(lh) hybrids may be divided according to the hen housed egg production and egg mass roughly into four groups corresponding to quadrants A, B, C and D in Figs. 3 and 4. From a commercial view, it seems to be as a less prospective - hybrids from the quadrant C whose gain a comparatively stable lower values of performance. In turn, for the purposes of commercial use the best are the hybrids of the quadrant D, maintaining comparatively stable above- average performance.

AB  - Environment-biased technical progress can stimulate improvement in environmental quality, leading to coordinated development between the economy and the environment. However, the existing literature scarcely refers to the factors influencing the technical progress bias. We use the overlapping generations model to realize the endogenesis of biased technical progress in the Chinese context. We show that an increase in the aging population will encourage the use of pollution-biased technology and focus the attention of enterprises on improving economic benefits rather than environmental quality. We measure the directions of technical progress during 2003 to 2013 and estimate regressions for the relevant indicators of the labor force employment structure. Under equilibrium, increased ratios of the aging population and state-owned enterprises will stimulate environment-biased technical progress. Further, the effects of research and development and clustering of state-owned enterprises on environmental technology improvement are significant. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges when conducting a continental-scale assessment of streams is setting appropriate expectations for the assessed sites. The challenge occurs for 2 reasons: 1) tremendous natural environmental heterogeneity exists within a continental landscape and 2) reference sites vary in quality both across and within major regions of the continent. We describe the process used to Set expectations for the multimetric index of biotic integrity (MIBI) and observed/expected (O/E) indices generated from predictive models used to assess stream condition for the US Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA). The assessment was based on a reference-site approach, in which the least-disturbed sites in each region of the US were used to establish benchmarks for assessing the condition of macroinvertebrate assemblages at other sites. Reference sites were compiled by filtering WSA sample sites for disturbance using a series of abiotic variables. Additional reference sites were needed and were obtained from other state, university, and federal monitoring programs. This pool of potential reference sites was then assessed for uniformity in site quality and comparability of macroinvertebrate sample data. Ultimately, 1625 sites were used to set reference expectations for the WSA. Reference-site data were used to help define 9 large ecoregions that minimized the naturally occurring variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with continental-wide differences in biogeography. These ecoregions were used as a basis for developing MIBI and O/E indices and for reporting results. A least-disturbed definition of reference condition was used nationally, but We Suspect that the quality of the best extant sites in ecoregions, Such as the Northern Plains and Temperate Plains, was lower than that of sites in other ecoregions. For the MIBI assessment, we used a simple modeling approach to adjust scores in ecoregions where gradients in reference-site quality Could be demonstrated conclusively The WSA provided an unparalleled opportunity to push the limits of our conceptual and technical understanding of how to best apply a reference-condition approach to a real-world need. Our hope is that we have learned enough from this exercise to improve the technical quality of the next round of national assessments.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence and environmental partition of urban pesticides and the dependence of these compounds on the physicochemical properties of the sediment and water of the Ceara River (fluvial and mangrove regions) located on the tropical coast of northeast Brazil. Surface sediment and water were collected from each site. Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, conductivity, depth, turbidity, and salinity were measured in situ. Bifenthrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, imiprothrin, and malathion were analysed in both environmental matrices. An ecological risk assessment was performed using the risk quotient (RQ) calculated from responses of aquatic organisms to the target compounds compiled in the United States Environmental Protection Agency ECOTOXicology knowledgebase (ECOTOX). The highest concentrations were found for the urban pesticides cypermethrin, permethrin, and deltamethrin, ranging from 37.39 to 367.60, 44.49 to 226.45 ng L-1, and 60.99 to 170.56 ng L-1 in water and 270.99 to 623.99, 27.00 to 307.00 ng g(-1) and 0.27 to 443.48 ng g(-1), in sediment in dry weight, respectively. Malathion, cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, and deltamethrin are related to chemical control performed for combatting vectors of diseases. The main sources of permethrin and imiprothrin are household insecticides. Bifenthrin may be related to its use by specialised pest control services. The study of toxic effects and the ecological risk assessment revealed cyfluthrin to be extremely toxic to marine and estuarine organisms, followed by deltamethrin, bifenthrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin, whereas imiprothrin and malathion were classified as toxic and non-toxic, respectively. The urban pesticides investigated in this study were on the same level of magnitude as those found in agricultural areas, except for malathion and imiprothrin, the levels of which were higher due to the fact that these compounds are commonly used in urban pest control.

AB  - Benthic diatoms are useful indicators of the ecological state of river systems. To understand the factors determining benthic diatom metacommunity composition in urban rivers, we studied in situ surface sediment diatom communities from 23 rivers in Shanghai City. Based on our study results on the metacommunity structure of benthic diatoms and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), we found substantial differences between restored (G1) and unrestored rivers (G2-G4) in taxa richness, relative abundances, and dominant and indicator taxa of benthic diatoms. The epiphytic diatoms Cocconeis placentula and Amphora libyca var. baltica were representative of the restored rivers (G1), where aquatic macrophytes were more abundant and the water was clearer. The motile epipelic diatoms Navicula recens and Navicula germainii dominated the moderately polluted rivers (G2). The eutrophic taxa Cyclotella meneghiniana, Aulacoseira granulata, and Cyclostephanos tholiformis dominated in G3, which comprised relatively heavily polluted rivers with low organic matter sediment and high disturbance. The polysaprobic taxon Nitzschia palea and the halophilous taxon Fallacia pygmaea represented relatively heavily polluted rivers with a comparatively higher sedimentary salinity (SSal) (G4). Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that total phosphorus (TP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), silicon dioxide (SiO2), dissolved oxygen (DO), Secchi depth (SD), SSal, and the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C/N) in the sedimentwere important environmental factors explaining variation among benthic diatom metacommunity composition. Partial RDA (pRDA) implied that the relative importance of environmental factors in structuring benthic diatom metacommunity was much higher than spatial factors. Classification and regression trees (CART) further indicated that DOC, the sediment C/N ratio, and SSal were the key local environmental factors affecting grouping patterns of benthic diatom metacommunities. Our study proposes that benthic diatom metacommunities respond to the complex characteristics of local environment in urban rivers and provides useful knowledge for consideration in the ecological monitoring of urban river systems.

AB  - Surface sediments were collected from Busan North Port (southern coast of Korea) and the outer port area (OPA) in February and August 2009 to ascertain the distribution of benthic foraminifera and assess controlling environmental factors. Ninety-eight species (81 calcareous and 17 agglutinated), 40 of which had live representatives, were identified. Busan North Port can be divided into distinctive regions according to different depositional environments and to the degree of influence from pollution sources, such as nearby streams and industrial facilities around the inside north port (INP) and outside north port (ONP). The OPA is characterized by inner continental-shelf environments. These areal distinctions corresponded well to cluster- and principal component-analysis results based on foraminiferal-assemblage and heavy-metal data. The degree of organic enrichment and heavy-metal concentration in the sediments were major factors explaining the distributions of the foraminiferal assemblage.
   The low abundance of benthic foraminifera in the INP compared to the OPA seems to be directly related to heavy-metal toxicity caused by high Cu, Zn, and Pb concentrations. The dominant occurrence of pioneer species Cribroelphidium excavatum and Trochammina hadai appears to indicate the adverse effects of heavy metals and high levels of organic matter on benthic foraminiferal distribution in the INP. Species diversity, however, was unusually high in Busan North Port across all pollution levels, and can possibly be explained in two ways. Short water-residence time in the inner port and maintenance of high salinity through active seawater exchange may reduce the effects of heavy metals and possibly make the area hospitable to a variety of species. High diversity may also be attributed to "rare short-lived" species that favor unstable conditions. The response of the benthic foraminiferal community to the unstable environment seems to be a succession of these "rare short-lived" species rather than a predominance of a few opportunistic ones. The uncoupling of species diversity and pollution level observed in Busan North Port might not be uncommon, and caution should be exercised when benthic foraminiferal diversity is used as an index of relative environmental health. Presence of indicator species and/or size distribution in the foraminiferal assemblage should be considered as well as species diversity to correlate the community structure with environmental change and pollution level.

AB  - Our objective was to investigate the effect of probiotic therapy on the profile of a psycho-emotional state and nature of neuroimmune-endocrine changes among patients with depressive disorders.
   Material and methods - The study involved 119 patients, diagnosed with a mild depressive episode (F32.0) or a moderate depressive episode ( F32.1). The patients were split among two groups: Main Group, in which subjects were taking a probiotic medicine in addition to the standard therapy (Cipralex + Bac-Set Forte), and Comparison Group in which subjects were taking a placebo pill in addition to the standard therapy (Cipralex). The Control Group consisted of 30 subjects belonging to the health group 1 sensu the Order of the Ministry of Health care of the Russian Federation No. 869an of January 1, 2018. The examination included clinical and psychopathological, psychometric, and laboratory methods.
   Results - Patients with depressive disorders had dysfunction of cortisol and monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems, along with an increased content of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in their blood. As a result of the therapy with a probiotic medicine, in combination with an antidepressant, patients with depressive disorders had a statistically significant decrease in the levels of cortisol, dopamine, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and NO, as well as a more pronounced reduction of depression symptoms, in comparison with the indicators of the patients who underwent standard therapy.
   Conclusion - Use of probiotics resulted in a more pronounced improvement of neuro-immune-endocrine indicators in study subjects, with subsequent improvement of their mental state - particularly, due to less obvious symptoms of depressive disorders.

AB  - Cortinarius is the most species rich genus of mushroom forming fungi with an estimated 2000 spp. worldwide. However, species delimitation within the genus is often controversial. This is particularly true in the section Calochroi (incl. section Fulvi), where the number of accepted taxa in Europe ranges between c.60 and c. 170 according to different taxonomic schools. Here, we evaluated species delimitation within this taxonomically difficult group of species and estimated their phylogenetic relationships. Species were delimited by phylogenetic inference and by comparison of ITS sequence data in combination with morphological characters. A total of 421 ITS sequences were analyzed, including data from 53 type specimens. The phylogenetic relationships of the identified species were estimated by analyzing ITS data in combination with sequence data from the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase 11 (RPB1 and RPB2). Seventy-nine species were identified, which are believed to constitute the bulk of the diversity of this group in Europe. The delimitation of species based on ITS sequences is more consistent with a conservative morphological species concept for most groups. ITS sequence data from 30 of the 53 types were identical to other taxa, and most of these can be readily treated as synonyms. This emphasizes the importance of critical analysis of collections before describing new taxa. The phylogenetic separation of species was, in general, unambiguous and there is considerable potential for using ITS sequence data as a barcode for the group. A high level of homoplasy and phenotypic plasticity was observed for morphological and ecological characters. Whereas most species and several minor lineages can be recognized by morphological and ecological character states, these same states are poor indicators at higher levels. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Estuaries are dynamic systems at the transition between freshwater and marine ecosystems. In this study, a spatially and temporally explicit Bayesian network (BN) was developed for a tidally connected estuary in southeastern Australia. The BN provides an environmental risk assessment (ERA) for the probability of a shift to a eutrophied state based on markers of pelagic and benthic primary production. The model was created to provide an initial framework of system knowledge based on empirical data, with the intention that the model and its linkages be iteratively developed as more information becomes available. The BN was investigated for its potential to predict trophic shifts and provide a framework for evidence-based decision making. Model assessment was conducted through both sensitivity analysis and scenario tests. Through evaluation and updating, the BN can provide information on the key nutrients and bio-physical mechanisms regulating changes in trophic state in estuarine ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the indicators of the country's development and competitiveness is the level of media technology. It becomes increasingly difficult for a person to navigate the world of information in the conditions of complexity and dynamics of social processes, the quantitative increase in mass information, strengthening of mass information flows and technological development of information networks. The media become the main source of information for the population of any state. Communication environment is becoming increasingly as mass, rather than interpersonal. Expansion of media space complicates the possibility of analyzing and orienting the audience in the media environment and increases psychological pressures. In connection with this, an urgent task for the pedagogy of higher education is the problem of finding adequate means that would help prevent such an effect on the youth and reduce the degree of manipulative damage. The article is devoted to the problem of formation of media competencies among students studying in the system of higher professional education of the Republic of Kazakhstan. It provides a terminological analysis of key concepts; the conditions for the formation of media competence of students as a result of systematic pedagogical work aimed at preventing the manipulative influence of the media on individual, which are explained, the characteristics of the special course program aimed at ensuring the effectiveness of this process, which are given, the results of the ascertaining experiment with the fragments of statistics are stated.

AB  - In this study, thermo-ecological analysis has been applied by using ecologic objective function "ECO" and ecological coefficient of performance "ECOP" to the kilns used in the firing process of the ceramic plant. Five different environmental (dead state) temperatures (between 10 degrees C and 30 degrees C) are taken into account. The irreversibility, which are the most important criteria affecting ecological performance, occurs during the heat transfer in the burners and cooling in the kiln. The irreversibility and product exergy values are compared under different environmental temperatures. The ECO and ECOP values are inversely proportional to the environment temperatures. The maximum ECO and ECOP values are determined as -2387.156 kW and 0.051, respectively, while their corresponding minimum values are -2577.394 kW and 0.026, respectively. The results obtained can be a guide for the thermo-ecological design of industrial kilns, The losses of the kiln are high. It is necessary to reduce the losses to increase the performance and ecologic indicator results. The kilns are not environmentally benign at higher ambient temperatures. The optimum working condition of the kiln can be considered as 10 degrees C. Better insulations are necessary for the side, bottom and top surfaces of the kilns to reduce the losses. In this regard, the waste heat recovery for the gases can be taken into account for better efficiency and environmental assessment.

AB  - The paper reviews observations of modern crustal movements (MCMs) using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) at nuclear facilities (NF). In 1995-2002, observations were conducted at geodynamic test sites of the Novovoronezh, Kalinin, and Rostov NPPs. Following the results of GNSS observations, a conclusion was drawn about the stability of the Kalinin NPP test site: it was recommended that design solutions take into account deformation of the Earth's surface in the north-south direction. The creation of a geodynamic test site for observing the activity of the Rostov NPP area based on GPS technology promoted the passage of a state environmental impact assessment during the launch of the first NPP reactor in 2001. In the construction area of Russia's first deep-level radioactive waste disposal site (Krasnoyarsk krai), a geodynamic test site was created to observe MCMs, and a methodology was developed for processing and interpreting geodynamic observation data taking into account the large-scale spatiotemporal effect. For the first time, for the area at the junction of the largest tectonic structures-the Siberian Platform and the West Siberian Plate-the rates of horizontal crustal deformations were instrumentally measured and the cyclical nature of the geodynamic regime was established. Observations made in 2010-2016 showed that in 2010-2013, maximum changes in distances between observation points did not exceed 10 mm/year. In 2013-2014, the tectonic regime was activated, manifested by a change in the signs of compressional and extensional strain of the upper crust on the right and left banks of the Yenisei River. The annual rates of maximum change in the lengths of baselines during the activation period reached +/- 18 mm. The standard horizontal and vertical errors for 2012-2016 were 3.0-3.5 and 6.0-7.4 mm, respectively. To take into account the scale factor, methodological approaches to interpreting the observational data were developed, which made it possible to assess the extent of impact of MCMs on the stability of the natural insulating properties of rock massifs while substantiating the geoecological safety of radioactive waste disposal. Based on the observation results, the boundary conditions for modeling the stress-strain state of a rock massif were established and the site of the GKhK Mining and Chemical Combine was geodynamically zoned.

AB  - The EU Biodiversity Strategy stipulates in Target 2, Action 5 that the member states must map and assess the state of the ecosystems and their services and promote the integration into the reporting systems at the EU and national level by 2020. Therefore indicators for capturing and assessing ecosystem services (ES) are needed. In this paper we report for which ES class types currently ES indicators are being developed for Germany in the context of an ongoing research project. Additionally, we provide the indicator specifications, which are based on underlying framework concept. By way of the example of the provisioning service 'raw wood production' and the development of the main-indicator 'annual wood accrual' and six sub-indicators, we illustrate the concrete procedure, including discussion of results and target values. The indicators for the ES wood provision are not only suitable for an exemplary illustration of procedure, data selection and data basis in Germany. Furthermore, it shows that indicators for provisioning ES can eminently conflict with biodiversity and other ES. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Regional bioassessment programs of states, various federal agencies, and other governmental and private groups often use different methods to collect and analyze stream invertebrate samples. This lack of uniformity has created concern and confusion over the comparability of disparate sources of data, but few studies have attempted to evaluate differences in performance between methods or to reconcile the results produced from different methods. We conducted concurrent sampling at 40 sites in the eastern Sierra Nevada of California using 3 bioassessment methods to obtain directly comparable data sets. The riffle-based methods (University of California Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Laboratory [UC-SNARL, Lahontan Water Board], California Stream Bioassessment Protocol, and US Forest Service Region 5) differed at each stage from field sample collection to laboratory processing and data analysis. We used a performance-based methods system to compare precision, uniformity, discrimination, accuracy, and correlations among multimetric Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) scores and multivariate River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS)-type observed/expected (O/E) ratios. Reference and test sites were identified using local and upstream-watershed disturbance criteria, and invertebrate community measures and models were then developed to discriminate between reference and test sites. The more-intensive UC-SNARL method showed slightly, but consistently, greater sensitivity for discriminating impairment than the other 2 methods. The UC-SNARL method produced greater differences between reference- and test-site means relative to lower reference-site standard deviations than the other 2 methods. However, assessment scores were highly correlated among methods and distinguished reference from test sites with similar accuracy among methods despite the slight differences in performance. Our results show that differing bioassessment methods can yield very similar, effective discrimination of impaired biological condition even though they have multiple differences in field and laboratory protocols (mesh size, replication, area sampled, taxonomic resolution, total counts). Moreover, this conclusion did not depend on the approach taken to data analysis because both multimetric IBIs and multivariate RIVPACS-type O/Es were in close agreement. Methodological uniformity is important when coordinating monitoring programs, but our results suggest that data from multiple sources could potentially be used interchangeably and for cross-validation of assessments of stream biological integrity.

AB  - Marine spatial planning (MSP) has rapidly become the most widely used integrated, place-based management approach in the marine environment. Monitoring and evaluation of MSP is key to inform best practices, adaptive management and plan iteration. While standardised evaluation frameworks cannot be readily applied, accounting for evaluation essentials such as the definition of evaluation objectives, indicators and stakeholder engagement of stakeholders is a prerequisite for meaningful evaluation outcomes. By way of a literature review and eleven practical MSP case studies, we analysed present day trends in evaluation approaches and unravelled the adoption of evaluation essentials for three categories for monitoring and evaluation for plan making, plan outcomes, and policy implementation. We found that at a global scale the focus of MSP evaluation has shifted over the past decade from evaluating predominantly plan outcomes towards the evaluation of plan making. Independent of the scope of the evaluation, evaluation approaches varied greatly from formal and structured processes, building for instance on MSP goals and objectives, to informal processes based on stakeholder interviews. We noted a trend in the adoption of formalised approaches where MSP evaluations have increasingly become linked to MSP policy goals and objectives. However, the enhanced use of MSP objectives and indicators did not result in a more straightforward reporting of outcomes, e.g. such as the achievement of specific MSP objectives. Overall, we found weak linkages between defined MSP objectives, indicators and available monitoring data. While the apparent shift towards a focus on objectives is promising, we highlight the need of fit-for purpose monitoring data to enable effective evaluation of those objectives. Hence, effective MSP and adaptive management processes require customised and concurrent monitoring and evaluation strategies and procedures. We argue that evaluation processes would also benefit from a better understanding of the general environmental, socio-economic and socio-cultural effects of MSP. Therefore, to understand better environmental effects of MSP, we praise that forthcoming MSP processes need to deepen the understanding and considerations of cause-effect pathways between human activities and changes of ecosystem state through the adoption of targeted cumulative effects assessments.

AB  - Ecological restoration programs (ERPs) have greatly expanded forested areas in China to mitigate environmental problems. Unfortunately, this general increase in forest cover has not revealed clear changes in the states of fragmentation and loss of connectivity of forested habitats, and few studies have investigated the effects of ERPs on the spatial patterns of forests. Taking the Three Gorges Reservoir Area as a case study, we assess and quantify how the dynamics of the spatial patterns of forest following massive ERPs from 1990 through 2015 by morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA). We examine possible landscape structure thresholds in the forest restoration gradient. The results indicate that dramatic decreases in forest fragmentation and patchiness have occurred since ERP implementation. Among the seven MSPA forest types, core forests show the highest increase of 513.91 km(2).yr(-1). ERPs promote the defragmentation of forests via two pathways: (1) Old forests are preserved and expanded by building new forests around existing patches and closing perforations within forests; and (2) new core forests are gradually created in areas far from older forests. However, isolated forest patches surrounded by cropland production areas formed after the conversion of croplands into forests have appeared across the study area. Furthermore, at least two points of nonlinear changes in the landscape structure with increasing forest cover are identified. These nonlinear trajectories can be used as indicators of critical shifts in ecosystem states, and relevant thresholds support the identification of specific conservation actions. Our findings demonstrate the importance of ERPs for the defragmentation of forest patches and provide a basis to establish a more effective arrangement of patches necessary to mitigate fragmentation effects. Given that landscape structural changes are not expected in ERP design, future ERPs should focus on remaining isolated forest patches and on maintaining the health and sustainability of landscapes.

AB  - There are many studies on the relationship between energy consumption and various environmental indicators in Africa, and SANE countries in particular. However, there is a dearth of studies that relate external debt to CO2 emissions, and even the ecological footprint, which is a more comprehensive environmental indicator. As such, this paper applies advanced estimation techniques to explore the role of external debt in the famous energy-growth-environmental nexus in SANE countries from 1970 to 2018. The findings from the Augmented Mean Group estimator indicate that economic growth and energy consumption increase environmental pressure in the SANE countries. On country-level results, the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, monotonic increase, and monotonic decrease for ecological footprint holds in South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, respectively. Also, the results reveal that external debt increases the ecological footprint in South Africa and Algeria. Furthermore, the Konya (2006) bootstrap country-level Granger causality test shows that ecological footprint is sensitive to economic growth and energy consumption in South Africa and Nigeria, while economic growth is sensitive to the ecological footprint in both Algeria and Nigeria. This study argues that stringent policy suggestions should be centred on reducing the overdependence on non-renewable energy sources since it underscores the major deteriorating state of environmental quality across SANE countries.

AB  - Sustainable catchment management requires increased levels of integration between groups of natural and social scientists, land and water users, land and water managers, planners and policy makers across spatial scales. Multiple policy drivers, covering urban and rural communities and their relationships with land and water use, have resulted in the need for an integrated decision making framework that operates from the strategic national scale to the local catchment scale. Large gaps in integration between policies are resulting in uncertain outcomes of conflicting and competing policy measures. The need for further integration is illustrated by little or no reductions in nitrate and phosphate levels in surface and ground waters in England and Wales. There is a requirement for natural scientists to consider the socio-economic setting and implications of their research. Moreover, catchment system level science requires natural and social scientists to work more closely, to provide robust analysis of the state of the environment that fully considers the biophysical, social, political and economic settings. The combined use of spatial technologies, scenarios, indicators and multicriteria analysis are increasingly being used to enable improved integration for sustainable catchment management.

AB  - Environmental stress models (ESM) provide a useful framework to study the direct and indirect ecological drivers of community diversity and resilience. ESMs make predictions about the relative importance of structuring processes (e.g., predation) based on the relative stress suffered by consumers and prey. Their practical application, i.e., determining the conditions under which consumers and prey performance is more negatively affected, has been limited because the roles of behavior and physiology are not usually considered. We examined the role of thermal sensitivity and behavior on the thermal performance of the rocky intertidal predator Pisaster ochraceus and its main prey Mytilus californianus. We propose a novel framework that merges thermal performance curves (TPC) with observations of microhabitat use to provide a realistic perspective of the relative physiological conditions of predator and prey. First, by deriving aquatic and aerial TPCs for both species and from two sites, we found differences in parameter values that in some cases correspond to the individuals' origins. Second, we calculated realized thermal performance in the field by combining TPCs with body temperatures recorded with biomimetic sensors. Notably, thermal performance of Pisaster was higher than that for Mytilus (i.e., prey-stress model), contrary to previous expectations based on caging experiments. Third, these estimates of thermal performance corresponded loosely with a measured indicator of overall physiological condition (body mass index, BMI) and a marker for extreme thermal stress (heat-shock proteins 70 kDa), suggesting that environmental drivers other than temperature, such as food supply, must be considered. We found no evidence that Pisaster movement significantly influences thermal performance under typical conditions, suggesting instead that its preference for sheltered microhabitats provides a mechanism for avoiding exposure to extreme environmental conditions. Through the application of TPCs and ESMs, this study provides a unique perspective on the importance of physiology and behavior in driving the sensitivity of species interactions to environmental change. Crucially, this framework allowed clarifying that this system behaves as a prey-instead of consumer-stress model, which may also apply to many other ectotherm -species interactions.

AB  - Mountains of the Afrotropics are global biodiversity hotspots and centers of speciation and endemism; however, very few studies have focused on the phylogenetic and functional dimensions of Afromontane small mammals. We investigated the patterns and mechanisms of small mammal phylogenetic and functional diversity and assembly along elevational gradients in Mount Kenya, the second highest mountain in Africa, and a contrasting low mountain range, Chyulu Hills. We sampled 24 200-m interval transects in both sites; 18 in Mt. Kenya (9 each in the windward side, Chogoria, and the leeward side, Sirimon) and 6 in Chyulu. We extracted the mitochondrial Cytochrome b gene to reconstruct a time-calibrated species tree for estimating phylogenetic diversity indices [phylogenetic richness (PD), mean nearest taxon distance (PDMNTD), and nearest taxon index (PDNTI)]. A functional trait data set was compiled from the field-recorded measurements and published data sets for estimating functional diversity indices [functional richness (FD), mean nearest taxon distance (FDMNTD), and nearest taxon index (FDNTI)]. Several environmental variables representing water-energy availability, primary habitat productivity, and topographic heterogeneity were used to estimate the predictive power of abiotic conditions on diversity variances using generalized linear and generalized additive regression models. The PD and FD peaked around mid-elevations in Mt. Kenya, unimodally increased or decreased in Chogoria and Sirimon, and monotonically increased in Chyulu. The divergence and community structure indices-PDMNTD, FDMNTD, and PDNTI and FDNTI-were relatively weakly associated with elevation. Overall, the tendency of assemblages to be phylogenetically and functionally closely related than expected by chance decreased with elevation in Mt. Kenya but increased in Chyulu. Across the indices, the annual precipitation and topographic ruggedness were the strongest predictors in Mt. Kenya, evapotranspiration and temperature seasonality were the strongest predictors in Chyulu, while temperature seasonality and terrain ruggedness overlapped as the strongest predictors in Chogoria and Sirimon in addition to annual precipitation in the latter and normalized difference vegetation index in the former. The observed contrasting trends in diversity distribution and the strongest predictors between elevational gradients are integral to the sustainable management of the high faunal biodiversity in tropical Afromontane ecosystems.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bounded to street dust are a severe environmental and human health danger. This study provides preliminary information on the abundance of PAHs in street dust from Rafsanjan city, Iran, where industrial emissions are high and data are lacking. Seventy street dust samples were collected from streets with different traffic loads. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Standard Methods 8270D and 3550C were used for the measurement of PAHs using GC mass spectroscopy. The total concentration of PAHs was 1443 ng g(-1), with a range of 1380-1550 ng g(-1). Additionally, the concentration of carcinogenic PAHs ( n-ary sumation (carc)PAHs) ranged from 729.5 to 889.4 ng g(-1), with a mean value of 798.1 ng g(-1). Pyrene was the most abundant PAH, with an average concentration of 257 ng g(-1). Source identification analyses showed that vehicle emissions along with incomplete combustion and petroleum were the main sources of PAHs. The ecological risk status of the studied area was moderate. Spatial distribution mapping revealed that the streets around the city center and oil company had higher PAH levels than the other sectors of Rafsanjan. The results indicated that dermal contact and ingestion of contaminated particles were the most important pathways compared to inhalation. The mean incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was 1.4 x 10(-3) and 1.3 x 10(-3) for children and adults, respectively. This implies potentially adverse health effects in exposed individuals. The mutagenic risk for both subpopulations was approximately 18 times greater than the one recommended by USEPA. Our findings suggest that children are subjected to a higher carcinogenic and mutagenic risk of PAHs, especially dibenzo[a,h]anthracene (DahA), bounded to street dust of Rafsanjan. Our study highlights the need for the development of emission monitoring and control scenarios.

The brief time intervals that characterize interactions between substance use and psychotic symptoms in daily life are inaccessible to standard research protocols. The authors used electronic personal digital assistants (PDAs) to examine the temporal association of diverse forms of substance use with psychotic symptoms and psychological states in natural contexts.
   Method: Of 199 community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were contacted to participate in the study, 92% accepted and 73% completed the study. The 145 participants who completed the study provided reports of substance use, psychotic symptoms, mood, and event negativity multiple times per day over 7 consecutive days through PDAs.
   Results: Participants responded to 72% of the electronic interviews (N=2,737) across daily life contexts. Strong within-day prospective associations were observed in both directions between substance use and negative psychological states or psychotic symptoms, but considerable variation was observed by substance type. Consistent with the notion of self-medication, alcohol use was most likely to follow increases in anxious mood or psychotic symptoms. Cannabis and other illicit substances, demonstrating more complex patterns, were more likely to follow certain psychological states but were also associated with the later onset of psychotic symptoms.
   Conclusions: The dynamic interplay of substance use and psychotic symptoms is in many cases consistent with both causal and self-medication mechanisms, and these patterns of association should be considered in the design of treatment and prevention strategies.

AB  - In this article, I examine how the authoritarian control of scientific research with regard to the Russian space program and the Baikonur Cosmodrome sustains toxic geographies and an information void in Kazakhstan. Baikonur is the oldest, largest, and now busiest space complex in the world, operating continuously since the clandestine Soviet program began in 1957. After 1991, Baikonur became part of a global services industry. Since 2007, a string of violent explosions of Proton class rocket engines, littering designated "fall zones" in central Kazakhstan with toxic debris, have revealed public concern over the use of unsymmetrical dimethyl-hydrazine (heptyl) fuel. When activists' opposition to the use of Proton engines is not squelched as an irrational fear of the cosmos or cosmophobia, Russian and Kazakh authorities resort to censorship, intimidation, and imprisonment. Although located in Kazakhstan, Baikonur's launch facilities, the adjacent closed city of the same name, and rocket "fall zones" are administered by the Russian Federation through several post-Soviet techno-diplomatic leasing agreements. All environmental assessment or remediation related to Baikonur is channeled through the Russian Space Agency (RosCosmos), rendering access, publishing, and independent scientific research outside of public scrutiny. Based on twenty months of field research and key interviews with Russian space industry actors, Kazakh state officials, environmental groups, environmental consultants, and local citizens, I examine how the post-Soviet privatization of Baikonur and a legally binding lease agreement facilitate the emergence of authoritarian forms of environmental governance that normalize pollution and block activist interventions.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between environmental variables and the Gonadosomatic Monthly Mean (GMM) index of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) to understand how the environment affects the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing. The data examined corresponds to biological information collected from samples of the landings off northern Chile (18 degrees 21'S, 24 degrees 00'S) during the period 1990-2010. We used the Humboldt Current Index (HCI) and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), which combine several physical-oceanographic factors in the Tropical and South Pacific regions. Using the GMM index, we studied the dynamics of anchovy reproductive timing at different intervals of length, specifically females with a length between 11.5 and 14 cm (medium class) and longer than 14 cm (large class). Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Mobile Average (SARIMA) was used to predict missing observations. The trends of the environment and reproductive indexes were explored via the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) statistical technique and the relationship between these indexes via cross-correlation functions (CCF) analysis. Our results showed that the habitat of anchovy switched from cool to warm condition, which also influenced gonad development. This was revealed by two and three significant changes (breaks) in the trend of the HCI and MEI indexes, and two significant breaks in the GMM of each time series of anchovy females (medium and large). Negative cross-correlation between the MEI index and GMM of medium and large class females was found, indicating that as the environment gets warmer (positive value of MEI) a decrease in the reproductive activity of anchovy can be expected. Correlation between the MEI index and larger females was stronger than with medium females. Additionally, our results indicate that the GMM index of anchovy for both length classes reaches two maximums per year; the first from August to September and the second from December to January. The intensity (maximum GMM values at rise point) of reproductive activity was not equal though, with the August-September peak being the highest. We also discuss how the synchronicity between environment and reproductive timing, the negative correlation found between MEI and GMM indexes, and the two increases per year of anchovy GMM relate to previous studies. Based on these findings we propose ways to advance in the understanding of how anchovy synchronize gonad development with the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is widely accepted that riverine ecosystems are influenced by the landscape pattern changes of their corresponding watersheds, but few studies have identified the most sensitive and nonsensitive biotic indices, the most influential landscape metrics and the relationship between aquatic biota and landscape patterns. To address this problem, Taizi river basin of Northeast China is taken as a case study, in which GIS technology and landscape ecology method are adopted. The study is performed at both the basin scale (entire drainage area upstream from certain sample point) and the riparian scale (a certain width buffer on each side of sample point extending the length of drainage network) to direct future landscape pattern design at the corresponding scales. The results show that at the basin scale, the species richness of benthic macroinvertebrate (B-S) and the fish index of biotic integrity (F-IBI) are the most sensitive biotic indices to landscape metrics, whereas the species richness of phytoplankton (P-S), the Shannon-Weaver diversity index of phytoplankton (P-H), zooplankton (Z-H), benthic macroinvertebrate (B-H) and fish density (F-D) are not sensitive to landscape pattern changes; at the riparian scale, F-IBI, B-S and zooplankton density (Z-D) have significant correlations with 9 of 10 landscape metrics calculated in this study, whereas P-S, P-H, Z-H, B-H, F-D and species richness of fish have very low correlations with riparian landscape pattern changes. At the basin scale, no landscape pattern metrics show obviously more influence on the riverine ecosystems than other metrics. At the riparian scale, Shannon's diversity index is a very influential factor. As to both of the two scales, B-S and F-IBI are correlated with most landscape metrics. The information derived above can help understand the impacts of landscape change on river ecosystems more clearly and provide useful scientific information on river ecosystem protection from the viewpoint of landscape.

AB  - Environmental quality assessment has to focus more on the quality of whole ecosystems, instead of focusing on the direct effects of a specific stressor, because of a more integrated environmental policy approach. Yet, how can the ecosystem quality be measured? Partly this is a normative question, a question of what is considered good and bad. At the same time, it is a scientific question, dealing with the problem of how the state of a system as complex as an ecosystem could be measured. Measuring all abiotic and biotic components, not to mention their many relationships, is not feasible. In this article we review several approaches dealing with this scientific question. Three approaches are distinguished; they differ in type of variable set and ecosystem model used. As a result of this, the information about the state of the ecosystem differs: ultimate breadth, comprising information about the whole ecosystem, is at the expense of detail, while ultimate detail is at the expense of breadth. We discuss whether the resultant quality assessments differ in character and are therefore suitable to answer different policy questions.

AB  - The paper's main aim is to assess the measures implemented within the Rural Development Program (RDP) 2007-2013 in Poland. This programme is dedicated to the diversification of business activities in rural areas and rural livelihood and, thus, the improvement of the multifunctionality of rural areas. The analysis covered two measures from Axis 3, Improvement of the quality of life in rural areas and diversification of rural economy: M311, diversification into non-agricultural activities; and M312, Establishment and development of micro-enterprise. The study and the discussion are presented from a geographical perspective and, in a broader context, take into account several conditions (natural, urban, agricultural and historical) and the spatial diversity of the allocation of European Union (EU) funds. Models of a policy of multifunctional rural development, implemented after accession to the EU, are presented. The research's spatial scope covers Poland's territory on two spatial scales: the system of regions (16 NUTS2 units) and poviats (314 LAU level 1 units). The analysis covers all the projects implemented in Poland under the two measures of Axis 3 of the RDP 2007-2013. A set of conditions was prepared for all LAU1 units, forming the background for assessing the impact of the EU funds on the development of non-agricultural activities. To determine the relationship between the RDP measures and the selected groups of conditions, a synthetic index and a correlation index are used. They are also used to determine the mutual relations between the two analyzed activities in terms of the spatial scales used. Access to the EU funds (RDP) has considerably enlarged the opportunities for accelerating agricultural modernisation and restructuration towards multifunctional development, as well as the opportunities for implementing new development and work methods in the countryside in Poland. The attractiveness of the two studied RDP measures varied across regions. The beneficiaries' activity depended on the local potential (resources), culture and tradition of the region, and size and potential of the farm. In the areas where agriculture is deeply rooted, beneficiaries were more willing to engage in ventures tapping into the resources available in their farms. Thus, they create additional livelihood of income and workplaces for household members. In turn, the beneficiaries from the areas where farms are smaller and economically weaker often undertake activities related to setting up a new business (outside farming).

AB  - Aquatic bryophytes have been studied and used as biological indicators of water quality for more than thirty years. A bibliographic review describing research studies carried out on this topic is presented here; this work is based on international publications and French reports more or less distributed which gives to this work an original look. Aquatic bryophytes are described. A biological indicator or 'bioindicator' is defined as "an organism or a group of organisms which,-using biochemical, cytological, physiological, ethological or ecological parameters-are able to characterize conveniently and reliably the state of ecosystems and to show as early as possible their natural or induced changes" (Blandin, 1986). Pollutant bioaccumulation, as well as physiological responses related to stress is here outlined. Research studies on mechanisms of bioaccumulation of metals in aquatic environments are well-developed. Bioaccumulation is mainly a very efficient mechanism of adsorption that occurs in the cell-walls and external plasma membranes of cells of mosses. Intracellular absorption also occurs and leads to the storage of metal in moss cells. Parameters that induce changes of the level of bioaccumulation of metal in mosses are environmental-pH, temperature, light, season, external metal concentration, competition between metals, mineral and organic suspended matter, current velocity; and biological physiological state and variability between species of mosses. Acidity, which plays an important role in these various processes, is discussed. Mechanisms of metal decontamination involving the biosynthesis of molecules like glutathion, or the increase of intracellular calcium, could play a role in protecting living cells against metal toxicity in mosses. These results have permitted a constant improvement of the efficiency of the use of bryophytes to assess contamination levels of metal in aquatic ecosystems. Mosses are also known to be good accumulators of radionuclides, and the mechanisms of bioaccumulation are similar to those of metals. However, processes of organic compound accumulation by bryophytes including pesticides, polychlorobiphenyls, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and monocyclic hydrocarbons, and antibiotics-are still poorly known. From a practical point of view, passive biomonitoring is based on the study of autochthonous mosses, i.e. mosses naturally present in the studied sites. Active biomonitoring is based on mosses transplanted from non-contaminated sites to the studied sites. Advantages and drawbacks of these methods are discussed. Concerning studies on physiological responses related to heavy-metal induced stress, research on bryophyte oxidative stress is not developed enough to permit this to be used as bioindicator tool at present. On the other hand, the chlorophyll-to-pheophytin ratio (D665/D665a) is a useful method for the estimation of global water quality. It is an index of physiological stress in aquatic bryophytes based on the degradation of chlorophyll into pheophytin after the loss of a magnesium atom.
   On a cellular scale, ionic movements of essential elements, namely the cellular loss of potassium, magnesium of calcium ions have been studied. The loss of potassium is an indicator of an increase of membrane permeability that follows membrane alteration. Microscopic and macroscopic observation of aquatic bryophytes is another method used to quantify visible effects of pollutants present in high or highly toxic concentrations. The French Water Agencies currently use indices like the index of metal contamination (based bioaccumulation of a metal in mosses) or index of polymetallic pollution (based on accumulation of a mixture of metal). All these studies further develop the use of aquatic bryophytes as bioindicators of freshwater quality.

AB  - We used spadefoot toad larvae to evaluate assumptions and test predictions of the Wilbur and Collins model for plasticity in age and size at metamorphosis. The model assumes that there is a threshold during larval development after which it is possible to metamorphose and to accelerate metamorphosis in response to certain environmental stimuli. The threshold presumably sets the minimum size and/or age at metamorphosis. Development after the threshold is modified according to environmental conditions, with growth rate serving as an index of environmental quality. Rapidly growing larvae are predicted to delay metamorphosis to take advantage of a favorable larval environment. Slower growers are predicted to transform closer to the threshold, thus enabling them to escape from a poor larval environment. Groups of three larvae from all three species (Experiment 1) or isolated larvae from two species (Experiment 2) in the genus Scaphiopus were reared at three food levels. At predetermined ages, subsamples of larvae had their food supply eliminated. The cessation of feeding represents a decline in the quality of the larval environment. After food elimination, larvae either completed development or entered a developmental stasis, making no further progress toward metamorphosis. The ability to complete development was demarcated by a specific stage of development or a narrow range of stages, thus defining a threshold. The threshold for successful metamorphosis was arrived at earlier at higher food levels and is best described as a function of both stage and mass. If food was eliminated after the threshold had been reached, the starved larvae completed larval development at an earlier age than continuously fed controls at each food level except the lowest food treatment of S. intermontanus. The magnitude of this acceleration of development was greatest in fast-growing (high food) larvae and smallest in slow growers (low food). These results confirm that all three species respond to a decline in the quality of the larval environment as predicted by Wilbur and Collins. Furthermore, the interspecies comparison implies an adaptive shift in this plasticity in the form of a change in the stage of development that serves as a threshold, the degree of acceleration in development rate after the threshold, and the flexibility in the amount of growth that is seen after the threshold. S. couchii, which is derived from the most ephemeral environment, reaches the threshold at an earlier stage of development. It also displays a greater proportional acceleration in development rate after the threshold, matched by a larger trade-off in reduced body size at metamorphosis in comparison with species from less ephemeral environments.

AB  - The data on the geochemical features of the bedrocks and soils of the province are given. Considerable attention is paid to regional abundances, as well as enrichment and dispersion factors of the chemical elements in landscapes. Using the example of the North Caucasus, it is shown that for such indicators as phytomass, geological, geomorphological, and geobotanical features, it is possible to make a preliminary outlining of regional structures conesponding to geochemical provinces. At the same time, a subsequent geochemical study of these structures remains mandatory. Upon determining certain geochemical associations, geochemical provinces can be basically distinguished; to a large extent, geochemical properties of these accumulated and scattered associations of elements contribute to the regional soil geochemistry. The results of long-term monitoring studies of the North Caucasus geochemical province have shown that the key features of the regional landscapes are due to the composition of bedrock and the presence of a large number of ore deposits and occurrences. The data obtained are the basis for assessing the state of the environment in conditions of increasing anthropogenic impact, and the established regional abundances can be used to assess the degree of pollution in agricultural, residential, and mining landscapes.

AB  - Using the historical range of forest conditions as a reference for managing landscapes has been proposed as a coarse-filter approach to biodiversity conservation. By emulating historical disturbance processes, it is thought that forest management can produce forest composition and structure similar to the conditions that once supported the native biota. A recent project was designed to integrate social and ecological findings to investigate the important relationships between the state of ecological understanding of a region, the state of the region's biodiversity, and the state of the region's social understanding of how it might be managed for biodiversity conservation into the future. The project relied on established concepts of the historical range of variability (HRV) and developed the concept of the social range of variability to help explain the interaction of social and ecological assessments, particularly their interaction to create future ranges of variability. The Oregon Coast Range, where a rich history of HRV research has been completed starting with paleoecological reconstructions of the historical fire regime, was one of five sites in the United States that were selected as case studies. We found land development and impending climate change to be major hurdles impeding the use of the HRV as a management regime. We also found that the complexities and uncertainties of management preclude the use of any single tool to tackle landscape-scale challenges and suggest that land management needs to become a continuous process of negotiation.

TI  - Within-day variability in microbial concentrations at a UK designated bathing water: Implications for regulatory monitoring and the application of predictive modelling based on historical compliance data

AB  - Prediction of bathing water quality is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Union (EU) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and is an established element in bathing water management designed to protect public health. Most commonly, historical regulatory compliance data are used for model calibration and provide the dependent variable for modelling. Independent (or predictor) variables (e.g. rainfall, river flow and received irradiance) measured over some antecedent period are used to deliver prediction of the faecal indicator concentration measured on the day of the regulatory sample collection. The implied linked assumptions of this approach are, therefore, that; (i) the independent variables accurately predict the bathing-day water quality; which is (ii) accurately characterized by the single regulatory sample. Assumption (ii) will not be the case where significant within-day variability in water quality is evident. This study built a detailed record of water quality change through 60 days at a UK coastal bathing water in 2011 using half-hourly samples each subjected to triplicate filtration designed to enhance enumeration precision. On average, the mean daily variation in FIO concentrations exceeded 1 log(10) order, with the largest daily variations exceeding 2 log(10) orders. Significant diurnality was observed at this bathing water, which would determine its EU Directive compliance category if the regulatory samples were collected at the same time each day. A sampling programme of this intensity has not been reported elsewhere to date and, if this pattern is proven to be characteristic of other bathing waters world-wide, it has significance for: (a) the design of regulatory sampling programmes; (b) the use of historical data to assess compliance, which often comprises a single sample taken at the compliance point on a regular, often weekly, basis; and (c) the use of regulatory compliance data to build predictive models of water quality.

AB  - Insect exclusion cages are commonly used in agricultural and ecological studies to examine plant-insect interactions in a field setting while maintaining control over insect populations. However, these insect cages can unintentionally alter the climate inside of the cage and impact plant physiology, growth and yield as well as insect populations. This can subsequently affect interpretations of experimental results obtained from caged experiments. To address this concern, we measured meteorological variables in conjunction with soybean physiology, growth, and yield over a two-year period. In a 2011 field study in southern Wisconsin, we compared photosynthetic rates, leaf area index (LA!), soil environmental-conditions, and various components of yield for plants grown inside and outside of an industry standard insect cage (Lumite 32 x 32 mesh). Inside of cages, several variables were higher (P < 0.05) including surface (0-6 cm) soil moisture (38%), stomatal conductance (42%), and total plant biomass (30%), while LAI was 20% lower (P < 0.001) inside of the cages. During the 2012 growing season, we measured wind speed, wind gusts, solar radiation, air temperature and relative humidity inside of cages compared to open field conditions. We found that wind speed and solar radiation were 89% and 42% lower, respectively, and air temperature, relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit were not significantly affected. There was also a significant (P < 0.0001) effect of the time of day on differences in wind speed and radiation between cages and open field plots. Our findings suggest that commonly used insect cages significantly alter the microclimate inside of the cage, and create a radiation regime in which the amount of direct and diffuse radiation received by plants is altered compared to the open field. Plant physiological processes and growth are affected by these environmental changes, adding a confounding factor when comparing caged to open field plants. Because the effects are likely a function of the type of cage, and mesh size and color, we recommend that future studies more thoroughly measure the microclimate for a variety of common cage types used in experiments.

AB  - This paper focusses on a conceptual overview of ways to address a comprehensive analysis of ecosystem services (ES) in a country as large and heterogeneous as Russia. As a first step, a methodology for assessing the services for the federal subjects of Russia was chosen, i.e., its constituent provinces and similar entities, in physical terms. Russia harbors a great diversity of natural conditions and ecosystems which are suppliers of ES, and likewise a variety of the socio-economic conditions that shape the demand for these services and their consumption. The methodological approach described permits several important tasks to be addressed: the evaluation of the degree of satisfaction of people's needs for ES, the identification of ecological donor and acceptor regions, and zoning of the country's territory for ES assessment. The next step is to prepare a prototype of a National Report on ES in Russia, for which we are presenting the planned structure.

AB  - This study aims at evaluating the completeness of the content of the ecological part in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) on content review basis. The requirements of the ecological content as stated in the of five sets of Thai's EIA guidelines, namely the specific guidelines for power plants, industrial projects, dams and harbors and the general guideline are used as the basis for this research. The main fmdings are that the requirements of the content of the ecological part in the guidelines differ from one guideline to another and the most different one is the specific guideline for dam projects. Generally, ecosystem, habitat and species population are presented. The guideline specifies the requirements for data presentation more clearly than those for ecological impact assessment. In addition, thirty EISs of power plant projects are systematically reviewed and it is found that there are a number of improper practices of ecological impact assessment process including insufficient baseline study, inconsistent impact interpretation, and ignorance of ecological point of view in setting up mitigation measures and monitoring programs. Ecological content in EIA guidelines and EISs can be shown in a logical sequence of events in order to form an effective system of ecological impact assessment.

AB  - Mining has been described as an important source of contaminants to the coastal zone worldwide, which is greatly intensified in the case of tailing dam ruptures. This study assessed the environmental quality of the marine coastal area impacted by a mining disaster (Fundao Mine dam collapse on 05 November 2015, Southeast Brazil) by applying a geochemical multi-index and physical approach over 18 months (from October 2018 to March 2020). Nutrients, metal(oid)s and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) were integrated by quality indexes: Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CWQI) and the Pollution Load Index (PLI) for water quality; Sediment Quality Guideline Quotients (SQG-q metal(oid)s and SQG-q PAHs) for sediment quality. Three scenarios regarding river discharge and wave-heights (Hs) were considered: 2018/2019-wet, 2019-dry, 2019/2020-wet. An Environmental Risk Assessment framework was built to describe the overall environmental quality in regards to water and sediment quality indexes as well as physical conditions. Here we show that the worsening of environmental quality is highly associated with the decrease of water quality by metal(oid)s (total forms of As and Ni; dissolved forms of Co and Fe) during the 2019-dry scenario when river discharge was at the lowest and the highest Hs occurred. Resuspension of fine sediment and suspended Fe(III) oxy-hydroxide nanoparticles by waves seem to be the main processes for releasing metal(oid)s into the water column. CWQI and PLI showed marginal and polluted conditions for water quality, respectively, and SQG-q for metals and PAHs indicated moderate impact in the sediment during the 2019-dry period. Toxicity to pelagic and benthic fauna is expected to occur in those conditions. Recovery of environmental quality occurred during the 2019/2020-wet scenario, which could be explained by alongshore and offshore transport of sediment and the dilution of aqueous metal(oid)s by intense river discharge on the continental shelf.

AB  - In monitoring the marine ecosystem, the search to find simple and universal methods has led to selected species being commonly used as indicator organisms. In the Baltic Sea, the bladder wrack (Fucus vesiculosus L., Phaeophyceae), the only broadly distributed perennial macroalga, is commonly used in monitoring the state of the coastal ecosystem. One parameter used is growth measured as apical tip length. The possible utility of apical growth of F. vesiculosus as an indicator of environmental stress in relation to within- and between-plant variation, within- and between-site variation, and between habitat (wave exposed vs. sheltered) variation was tested in the northern Baltic Sea. The analysis showed that variation within plants, among plants within a single site, and among sites of similar wave exposure was significant. Although the difference between exposures also was important, the apical growth of F. vesiculosus should not, without great caution, be used as a measure of environmental condition.

AB  - The stress-dependent evolution of mechanical Dauphine twinning has been investigated in axial compression experiments on a low-grade metamorphic quartzite, applying both time-of-flight neutron diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction. The data of the experimentally stressed quartzite samples were compared with those of the naturally deformed starting material to monitor Dauphine twinning in relation to different experimental stress states. This comparison shows that in the experimental conditions of 500 degrees C temperature and 300 MPa confining pressure, Dauphine twinning initiates below 145 MPa differential stress and saturates between 250 MPa and 460 MPa differential stress.
   A single grain orientation analysis (SGOA) has been developed based on the distinction of quartz grains free of Dauphine twin boundaries (DTBs) and containing Dauphine twin boundaries. Comparing pole figures and inverse pole figures of DTB-free grains of the starting material with those of the experimentally stressed samples shows a significantly different orientation distribution of the positive {10(1) over bar1} (r) and the negative {01(1) over bar1} (z) rhombs. In DTB-containing grains, the SGOA allows to distinguish between host and twin domains. Using DTB-free grains, the SGOA furthermore reveals a particular pattern, with one of the r rhomb maxima parallel to the axial compressive stress direction and a girdle with two r rhomb submaxima perpendicular to it. We believe that this relationship between the axial compressive stress direction and the rhomb orientation distribution shows the potential of the SGOA in the reconstruction of the paleostress state in naturally stressed quartz-bearing rocks.

AB  - The Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) is a facial-expression-based pain coding system that incorporates six Facial Action Units, independently scored. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether HGS score changed in response to emotional states other than pain. Seven riding school horses were exposed to different experimental conditions that are known to elicit different emotional states (new environment, grooming, anticipation of food reward, fear). As a control, videos were also recorded with the horse undisturbed in their home environment. Videos were recorded in each experimental condition and individual frames were captured from HD video files. Thirty-five pictures were scored using HGS by three experimental design blind observers. The results showed that the HGS score did not change in any of the experimental conditions when compared with control. In all the conditions but one (fear), the mean HGS score was low (<= 2 on a maximum score of 12), but not zero; the scores of stiffly backward ears and prominent strained chewing muscles tended to be higher in fear than in other conditions. Although these are preliminary results as the number of tested horses is limited, HGS seems to be a specific tool to assess pain in horses. Changes in ear posture and tension in chewing muscles tend to be present in negative emotional states such as fear; therefore, a larger scale study is needed to collect data from the same horses in positive and negative situations, including pain.

AB  - Translocation, transfer, and safety evaluation of engineered nanomaterials in non-mammalian alternative assay model of Caenorhabditis elegans are summarized and discussed. Due to the extensive applications of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) in industry, agriculture, medicine and public health, environmental exposure of ENMs to human and environmental organisms is inevitable, therefore studies on translocation, transfer, and toxicology of ENMs receive wide interest. Modelling the nematode C. elegans, a widely recognized non-mammalian alternative toxicity assay system has been proven to be valuable in environmental safety evaluation, toxicological study, and examination of translocation and transfer of toxicants. In this review, we summarize and discuss the values and contributions of C. elegans in studies on environmental safety evaluation, toxicology, and translocation and transfer of ENMs. We introduced acute and chronic toxicity assay systems and discussed environmental safety assessment of specific ENMs at predicted environmental relevant concentrations, and influences of chemical properties of ENMs, exposure routes, developmental, genetic or physiological state, and environmental factors on nanotoxicity formation in nematodes. We then discussed the toxicological mechanisms of ENMs mainly with respect to roles of oxidative stress in normal and stress conditions and signaling pathways, reproductive toxicology, neurotoxicology, and translocation, distribution, transfer and metabolism of ENMs in C. elegans. Ways to eliminate or reduce the toxicities of specific ENMs by chemical modification with surface designs were further discussed. Finally, four important challenges have been raised and discussed by surrounding the aspects of environmental safety assessment, toxicological mechanisms, and designs of new safe ENMs.

AB  - It is widely recognized that the hydrological regime of natural flow plays a primary and crucial role in influencing the physical condition of habitats, which, in turn, determines the biotic composition and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems. The current hydro-ecological understanding states that all flow components might be considered as operational targets for water management, starting from base flows (including low flows) to high and flood regimes in terms of magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change. Several codes have been developed and applied on different case studies in order to define common tools to be implemented for Eflow assessment. This work deals with the definition of an operative procedure for the evaluation of the Eflow monthly distribution to be adopted in a generic watercourse cross-section for sustainable surface water resource management and exploitation. The methodology proposes the application of the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration methodology (IHA by TNC) coupled to the valuation of the Index of Hydrological Regime Alteration (IARI by ISPRA) as an operative tool to define the ecological flow in each monitoring cross-section to support sustainable water resource management and planning. The case study of the Agri River in Basilicata (Southern Italy) is presented. The analyses were carried out based on monthly discharge data derived by applying the HEC-Hydrological Modeling System at the basin scale using the daily rain data measurements obtained by the regional rainfall gauge stations and calibrated through the observed inlet water discharge registered at the Lago del Pertusillo reservoir station.

AB  - RecentAbstract. Recent approaches to wetland assessment have advocated a multilevel approach which incorporates assessments based on landscape (remote sensing) data, on-site but "rapid" methods, and intensive methods where quantitative data is collected. Brown and Vivas (2004) recently pro- posed an assessment method that uses remote sensing information (Landscape Development Index or LDI) and propose that it may also be usable as a quantified human disturbance gradient. The LDI was evaluated using a large reference wetland data set from Ohio using land use percentages within a 1 km radius circle of the wetlands. The LDI had interpretable and significant relationships with another human disturbance gradient (the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method for Wetlands or ORAM) and with most metrics and scores from the Vegetation Index of Biotic Integrity (VIBI) developed for use in the State of Ohio. Metrics from emergent wetlands had the most significant correlations with the LDI (10 of 10 metrics), followed by forested wetlands (8 of 10 metrics) and shrub wetlands (4 of 10). Poor correlation for VIBI scores and metrics of shrub wetlands was due to differences in attainable LDI scores based on ecoregion and natural buffers shielding the wetland from otherwise intensive land uses. The ORAM and VIBI were developed for use in wetlands in Ohio completely independent of the LDI. It is an important test of the LDI concept that so many interpretable and significant relationships occurred between the VIBI scores, VIBI metric values, and the ORAM scores. For the purposes of VIBI development, the LDI is an independent, quantified disturbance gradient that has provided an additional test of the VIBI. Given its theoretical underpinnings and the fact that it uses quantified land use percentages, the LDI has many advantages over more qualita- tive human disturbance gradients. Using land use percentages from increasingly smaller distances from the wetland edge (100-200 m) may improve the resolution of the LDI to detect on-site dis-turbances to a wetland which degrade its ecological condition. The LDI should be evaluated with other large reference data sets in other regions to evaluate its validity and usefulness as an assessment tool.

AB  - The sensitivity of size-based, species-based, and trophodynamic indicators is examined for the fish community of the southern Benguela ecosystem (South Africa) through simulations of different fishing scenarios using the multispecies model OSMOSE. The simulations suggest that it may be erroneous to consider one absolute reference direction of change for any indicator because the direction of change is specific to both the multispecies assemblage and the fishing scenario considered. The analysis of species versus community indicators is helpful for understanding which processes drive the emergent properties of the ecosystem. Informative about the structure and state of the ecosystem, both types of indicators weighted by biomass or by abundance should be used to evaluate ecosystem changes. Indicators characterizing size distribution (e.g., slope of size spectrum) appear to be more helpful in distinguishing the cause of ecosystem changes than mean community indicators because their response is specific to the fishing scenario simulated (i.e., global or hake-targeting fishing). Some indicators do not seem to be sensitive to fishing pressure (slope of the diversity size spectrum) or do not vary consistently with other studies (W statistic).

AB  - By converting anaerobic landfills into a biologically stabilized state through accelerating aerobic organic matter degradation, the effort and duration necessary for post-closure procedures can be shortened. In Austria, the first full-scale application of in-situ landfill aeration by means of low pressure air injection with simultaneous off-gas collection and treatment was implemented on an old MSW-landfill and operated between 2007 and 2013. Besides complementary laboratory investigations, which included waste sampling from the landfill site prior to aeration start, a comprehensive field monitoring program was conducted to assess the influence of the aeration measure on the emission behavior of the landfilled waste during the aeration period as well as after aeration completion. Although the initial waste material was described as rather stable, the lab-scale aeration tests indicated a significant improvement of the leachate quality and even the biological solid waste stability. However, the aeration success was less pronounced for the application at the landfill site, mainly due to technical limitations in the full-scale operation. In this paper main performance data of the field investigation are compared to four other scientifically documented case studies along with stability indicators for solid waste and leachate characteristics in order to evaluate the success of aeration as well as the progress of a landfill towards completion and end of post-closure care. A number of quantitative benchmarks and relevant context information for the performance assessment of the five hitherto conducted international aeration projects are proposed aiming to support the systematization and harmonization of available results from diverse field studies and full-scale applications in future.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems are exposed to multiple anthropogenic stressors such as fishing, pollution, and climate change. Ecosystem-based coastal management requires understanding where the combination of multiple stressors has large cumulative effects and where actions to address impacts are most urgently needed. However, the effects of multiple stressors on coastal and marine ecosystems are often non-linear and interactive. This complexity is not captured by commonly used spatial models for mapping human impacts. Flexible statistical and machine learning models like random forests have thus been used as an alternative modeling approach to identify important stressors and to make spatial predictions of their combined effects. However, tests of such models' prediction skill have been limited. Therefore, we tested how well ten statistical and machine learning methods predicted three ecological indicators of coastal marine ecosystem condition (kelp biodiversity, fish biomass, and rocky intertidal biodiversity) off California, USA. Spatial data representing anthropogenic stressors and ocean uses as well as natural gradients were used as predictors. The models' prediction errors were estimated by double spatial block cross-validation. The best models achieved mean squared errors about 25% lower than a null model for kelp biodiversity and fish biomass; none of the tested models worked well for rocky intertidal biodiversity. The models captured general trends, but not local variability of the indicators. For kelp biodiversity, the best performing method was principal components regression. For fish biomass, the best performing method was boosted regression trees. However, after tuning, this model did not include any interactions between stressors, and ridge regression (a constrained linear model) performed almost as well. While in theory flexible machine learning methods are required to represent the complex stressor-ecosystem state relationships revealed by experimental ecologists, with our data, this flexibility could not be harnessed because more flexible models overfitted due to small sample sizes and low signal-to-noise ratio. The main challenge for harnessing the flexibility of statistical and machine learning methods to link ecological indicators and anthropogenic stressors is obtaining more suitable data. In particular, better data describing the spatial and temporal distribution of human uses and stressors are needed. We conclude by discussing methodological implications for future research.

AB  - During the past 50 yr, ecological and agricultural scientists have pursued an integrated definition and metric of soil quality. In the past 20 yr, considerable attention has been paid to nematodes, demonstrating that these ubiquitous members of the soil community reflect change in ecological structure and function of soils in ways more predictable and efficient than for other soil flora or fauna. With the help of multivariate analysis, we studied the application of free-living nematode communities as model indicators of physical and chemical disturbance of agricultural soil. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial CCA to segregate effects of tillage and chemical/nutrient treatments. With the results of CCA, we assigned relative direct and indirect tillage sensitivity and chemical/nutrient sensitivity ratings to soil genera found in two test data sets, each containing three matrices: (1) sites by species or genera, (2) sites by soil properties, and (3) sites by management practices. Of 46 total genera, the ones most sensitive to direct effects of tillage include Aphelenchoides, Eucephalobus, Eudorylaimus, Heterocephalobus, and Wilsonema compared to the tolerant genera Achromadora, Anatonchus, Cephalobus, Chiloplacus, Clarkus, Epidorylaimus, Mylonchulus, Plectus, and Tylencholaimellus. Some genera are more sensitive to indirect than direct effects of tillage: these include Achromadora, Cephalobus, Microdorylaimus, Monhystera, Panagrolaimus, and Prionchulus. With the exception of Discolaimus and Prismatolaimus, genera sensitive to chemical/nutrient treatments differ from those sensitive to tillage treatments including Alaimus, Cylindrolaimus, Mesorhabditis, Odontolaimus, and Protorhabditis. Likewise, genera uniquely sensitive to indirect but not direct effects of chemical/nutrient treatments are Aphelenchus, Aporcelaimellus. and Diplogaster. Eudorylaimus and Eumonhsytera are sensitive to indirect effects of both tillage and chemical/nutrient treatments. Our results suggest that physical and chemical/nutrient disturbances can alter populations of nematode genera differently, and that indirect effects of management are greater than direct effects. This methodology aids in distinguishing nematode genera that have distinctive responses to agricultural management practices from those that are ambiguous. This knowledge is useful for both interpretation and enhancement of free-living nematode community indices.

AB  - Clearing native vegetation has pervasive effects on stream and river ecosystems worldwide. The stated aims of replanting riparian vegetation often are to restore water quality and to re-establish biotic assemblages. However reach-scale restoration may do little to combat catchment-scale degradation, potentially inhibiting restoration success. Whether reinstating biodiversity is a realistic goal or appropriate indicator of restoration success over intermediate timeframes (<30 years) is currently unclear. We measured the response of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages to riparian replanting in a chronosequence of replanted reaches on agricultural streams in south-eastern Australia. Sites had been replanted with native vegetation 8-22 years before the study. Indices of macroinvertebrate sensitivity did not respond to replanting over the time gradient, probably because replanting had little benefit for local water quality or in-stream habitat. The invertebrate assemblages were influenced mainly by catchment-scale effects and geomorphological characteristics, but were closer to reference condition at sites with lower total catchment agricultural land cover. Reach-scale replanting in heavily modified landscapes may not effectively return biodiversity to pre-clearance condition over decadal time-scales. Restoration goals, and the spatial and temporal scale of processes required to meet them, should be carefully considered, and monitoring methods explicitly matched to desired outcomes.

AB  - Competition for food is widely cited as an important cost of coloniality among birds and much of the evidence in support of this hypothesis comes from studies of colonial piscivorous seabirds. However, for generalist seabirds able to switch between different prey types, the role of food availability in relation to colony size is unclear. Here we investigate patterns of the consumption of seabird prey in relation to colony size in a generalist seabird, the great skua Stercorarius skua, in Shetland, UK. At the population level skuas feed mainly on sandeels Ammodytes marinus and fishery discards, but respond to declines in fish availability to facultatively prey on other seabirds. By comparing the consumption of seabirds among seven different sized colonies, including one colony with artificially reduced numbers of skuas (Fair Isle), we investigate whether consumption of seabird prey is influenced by skua population size, while simultaneously measuring seabird prey availability. Data from five years also enables us to investigate the influence of annual variation in environmental conditions on seabird consumption. Using measures of body condition and reproductive performance we investigate the consequences of living in different sized colonies, which may provide insight into ultimate costs of nesting at high population density. Skua diets varied among colonies and the proportion of seabird prey in the diet was inversely related to skua colony size, despite similar per capita numbers of seabirds across colonies. At the colony where their numbers were artificially suppressed, skuas consumed a greater proportion of seabirds per capita. Highly significant year effects in seabird predation were observed but the pattern among colonies remained consistent over time. Two measures of adult body condition (pectoral muscle index and mean corpuscular volume) revealed that adult great skuas were in poorer condition at the largest colony (Foula), but reproductive performance did not alter significantly among colonies. This study provides evidence that intra-specific competition among skuas may limit opportunities for obtaining seabird prey, which may be particularly important during periods of poor availability of sandeels and fishery discards, and has implications for assessing the impact of skuas on seabird populations.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the extremely unfavorable state of ecological system of the Caspian sea and the coastal zone. In the nearest future, intensive development of oil and gas fields on the continental shelf of the Caspian sea (Kashagan) may dramatically increase the environmental burden not only on the Kazakh part of the Caspian region, but also on the entire water area of the middle and northern part of the Caspian sea. Oil as a pollutant contains polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which represent a wide class of environmentally stable organic compounds. It is generally accepted that the toxic and carcinogenic effects of polyaromatic hydrocarbons are caused by their metabolites. Pyrene is the main component of oil and the studied oil samples always contain it.
   The main aim of this study is to determine polyaromatic hydrocarbons in oil and metabolite (benz(a)pyrene), as well as associated heavy metals and radionuclides in the body of test objects as a sufficiently objective method for assessing environmental risk.
   Objects. The aquatic (picses, molluskas, polyhetas) and terrestrial inhabitants (earthworm) of the coastal zone of the Caspian sea were selected from natural populations as test-objects (bio-indicators).
   Methods: atomic adsorption spectrometry and radiological methods of research.
   Results. The authors have analyzed the ability of hydrobionts and ground representatives capable of accumulating petroleum products, included heavy metals and radionuclides and studied the main features of accumulation of pollutants in the body of test-objects representing different ecology systems of the studied zone, determined the level of total radioactivity. The paper compares the studied species of hydrobionts, the content of petroleum products, heavy metals and radionuclides in organs and tissues.

AB  - In the western United States, significant environmental change is expected through the combined effects of climate change, tree mortality, drought, and invasive species. Wild animals can be used as indicators of threats to populations and even entire communities by looking for histopathological changes in their tissues. This method may identify threats to wild populations quickly and more accurately than waiting to observe population declines; however, baseline data are needed for comparisons. Here, rodents are surveyed at 5 sites in the Great Basin to record histopathological changes. Additionally, one site is next to a copper mine that was in operation for nearly 100 years. This site is compared to the other more pristine sites. Liver, lung, heart, and kidney tissues of 143 rodents from 10 species were processed and examined using standard histological methods. Thirty percent of rodents had histopathological changes. The most common histopathological changes were extramedullary hematopoiesis (11.9%), hyperplastic BALT (6.3%), and pyelitis (4.9%). Two pathogens were found: the nematode Capillaria hepatica (0.7%) and the fungus Emmonsia crescens (2.8%). The most common rodent captured, Peromyscus maniculatus (n = 116), was used to determine whether sex and mass predict histopathological changes. Body mass, not sex, was the best predictor, suggesting that heavier, older individuals should be selectively sampled if the goal is to assess potential threats to rodent populations. Data such as these can be compared to future data to assess populations and communities for effects of environmental change.

AB  - This study describes a new methodology by which the concentrations of non-protein (NP) thiols glutathione (GSH), cysteine (CSH), N-acetylcysteine (AcCSH), and protein (P) thiols (PSH), as well as the contribution of these components to symmetric and mixed disulfides (NPSSR, NPSSC, NPSSCAc, PSSR, PSSC, PSSCAc, PSSP) can reliably be measured. The methodology consists of a strict sequence of methods which are applied to every sample. Free thiols at any given state of the procedure are measured by Ellman's assay, the CSH fraction is measured by its unique response in the ninhydrin assay, AcCSH is selectively measured with ninhydrin after enzymatic deacylation, proteins are separated from non-protein thiols/disulfides by precipitation with trichloroacetic or perchloric acid, disulfides are reduced into free thiols with borohydride, mixed disulfides between a protein and a non-protein component are measured by extracting the non-protein thiol from the protein pellet after borohydride treatment, and protein thiols/disulfides are measured after resolubilization of the protein pellet.
   When this method was applied to animal and fungal tissue, new molecular indicators of the thiol redox state of living cells were identified. The findings of the present study clearly show that the new parameters are very sensitive indicators of redox state, while at the same time the traditional parameters GSH and GSSG often remain constant even upon dramatic changes in the overall redox state of biological tissue. Therefore, unbiased assessment of the redox state also requires explicit measurement of its most sensitive thiol indicators.

KW  - environmental flow requirements
KW  - ecological Reserve
KW  - water resource management
AB  - In the South African National Water Act (NWA, No 36 of 1998), the ecological Reserve is defined as the quality and quantity of water required to ensure appropriate protection of water resources, so as to secure ecologically sustainable development and use. Aquatic ecosystems are recognised as the core location of water resources, and although considerable progress has been made in developing methods for quantifying environmental flow requirements, this paper describes and discusses the first agreed method for quantifying environmental water quality requirements in an ecological Reserve assessment. Integration of flow and water quality is emphasised, and is based on the philosophy that environmental flows should be motivated to provide ecologically important flow-related habitat, or geomorphological function, but should not be motivated to solve water quality problems by dilution. Water quality is multivariate, and not all variables can be considered in an ecological Reserve assessment, but core water quality variables include: system variables (salts, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, temperature), nutrients (phosphate, nitrite, nitrate) and toxic substances (those listed in the South African Water Quality Guidelines for Aquatic Ecosystems, including toxic metal ions, toxic organic substances, and/or substances from a chemical inventory of an effluent or discharge). In addition, biological indicator data (e.g. SASS data), chlorophyll-a (e.g. phytoplankton and periphyton data) and toxicity test data may be used. For each variable, a concentration range or response is linked to a class within a water resource, classification system, where classes range from minimally to severely modified. There are five main stages in the environmental water,quality method:
   Initiate study and determine scope of assessment.
   Delineate water quality sub-units.
   Select sites and collect data and information.
   Determine, benchmarks, including generic boundary values (literature-based concentrations related to classes); the unimpacted, natural or reference condition; the present ecological state; and the contribution of water quality to the overall ecosystem importance and sensitivity.
   Provide quantified and qualitative water quality objectives for each ecosystem health class, and each variable in each resource unit. These steps are integrated with environmental flow assessment procedures. After environmental flows have been recommended to achieve a selected level of protection (class), flow-concentration relationships are modelled, and the likely water quality consequences of modified flows are provided to resource managers, who then decide on whether to allocate water for dilution and/or to address the pollution problem directly using source controls.

AB  - 1. To examine the effects of forest harvest practices on headwater stream macroinvertebrates, we compiled a 167 site database with macroinvertebrate, fish, physical habitat and catchment land cover data from the three forested ecoregions in western Oregon. For our analysis, headwater streams were defined by catchment areas < 10 km(2) and perennial water during summer low flows. Almost all sites in the database were selected using a randomised survey design, constituting a representative sample of headwater streams in these ecoregions.
   2. Macroinvertebrate taxonomic and functional feeding group composition were very similar among the three ecoregions in the study area (Coast Range, Cascades and Klamath Mountains). On average, 55% of the individuals at each site were in the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera or Trichoptera. Dipteran taxa (mostly chironomids) accounted for another 34%. At almost all sites, non-insects made up < 10% of the macroinvertebrate assemblage. Almost half (49%) of the assemblages were collectors; remaining individuals were about evenly divided among scrapers, shredders and predators.
   3. There were 189 different macroinvertebrate taxa at the 167 sites with richness at individual sites ranging from 7 to 71 taxa. Ordination by non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed a strong association between % Ephemeroptera, especially Baetis, and site scores along the first axis. This axis was also strongly related to % coarse substratum and fast water habitat. The second axis was strongly related to % intolerant individuals, site slope and altitude. No strong relationships were evident between any ordination axis and either logging activity, presence/absence of fish, catchment size or ecoregion.
   4. Based on macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores, 62% of the sites had no impairment, 31% of the sites had slight impairment and only 6% of the sites had moderate or severe impairment. IBI scores were not strongly related to forest harvest history. All four severely impaired sites and five of the seven sites with moderate impairment were lower altitude, shallower slope stream reaches located in the Coast Range with evidence of agricultural activity in their catchment or riparian zone. % sand + fine substratum was the environmental variable most strongly related to macroinvertebrate IBI.

AB  - Assessments of the environmental status of the Baltic Sea as called for by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) must be based on a set of indicators. A pre-core indicator is the diatom/dinoflagellate index (Dia/Dino index), which reflects the dominance of diatoms or dinoflagellates during the phytoplankton spring bloom. Here we explain the principles of the Dia/Dino index and the conditions for its calculation using examples from two very different water bodies, the Eastern Gotland Basin and Kiel Bay. The index is based on seasonal mean diatom and dinoflagellate biomass values. A precondition for its applicability is the coverage of the bloom. As a criterion, the maximum value of diatom or dinoflagellate biomass has to exceed a predefined threshold, e.g., 1000 mu g/L in the investigated areas. If this condition is not fulfilled, an alternative Dia/Dino index can be calculated based on silicate consumption data. Changes in the dominance of these two phytoplankton classes impact the food web because both their quality as a food source for grazers and their periods of occurrence differ. If diatoms are dominant, their rapid sinking reduces the food stock for zooplankton but delivers plenty of food to the zoobenthos. Consequently, the Dia/Dino index can be used to follow the food pathway (Descriptor 4 of MSFD: "food web"). Moreover, a low Dia/Dino index may indicate silicate limitation caused by eutrophication (Descriptor 5 of MSFD: "eutrophication"). The Dia/Dino index was able to identify the regime shift that occurred at the end of the 1980s in the Baltic Proper. Diatom dominance, and thus a high Dia/Dino index, are typical in historical data and are therefore assumed to reflect good environmental status (GES). In assessments of the environmental status of the Eastern Gotland Basin and Kiel Bay, Dia/Dino index GES thresholds of 0.5 and 0.75, respectively, are suggested. The GES thresholds as calculated by the alternative Dia/Dino index are 0.84 and 0.94, respectively.

AB  - ObjectiveOur current knowledge on nocturnal enuresis (NE) in adults is scarce due to its uncommon nature. The present study was designed to investigate symptom characteristics and risk factors of NE in adult women to improve the current clinical understanding and management of this rare disease. MethodsOver a 3-year period, we enrolled 70 adult women who complained of bedwetting, with a frequency of at least once per week and a symptom duration of 3 months or longer. Patients were excluded if they had known pregnancy, current urinary tract infection, untreated malignancies, anatomical abnormalities, and irregular sleep cycle. The International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-female lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder diary were employed to appraise lower urinary tract symptoms and voiding behavior. Urodynamics was performed to assess the bladder function. A linear regression analysis was applied to determine potential risk factors for NE frequency. ResultsAmong the recruited subjects, comorbidities and lower urinary tract symptoms were frequently reported. On bladder diary, patients commonly presented with nocturnal polyuria (NP), reduced nocturnal voided volumes (RNVVs), or both. Urodynamics revealed multiple dysfunctions, namely, detrusor overactivity (DO), urodynamic stress incontinence (USI), reduced compliance, bladder outlet obstruction, detrusor underactivity (DU), and simultaneous DO and DU. Patients with more frequent NE (>= 4/week) demonstrated markedly increased body mass index, more comorbid conditions, worse incontinence symptoms, NP or NP plus RNVVs, reduced compliance, and poorer voiding possibly owing to DU. Whereas, RNVVs alone and worse overactive bladder-related parameters were associated with milder NE. Multivariate analysis indicated that frequency/urgency quality of life, incontinence symptom, NP + RNVVs, poor flow, increased bladder sensation, USI, and simultaneous detrusor overactivity plus DU were independent risk factors for NE severity. ConclusionNE in adult women may have both urological and non-urological pathophysiology. Imbalanced circadian urine production, jeopardized continence mechanisms, overactive bladder, and DU-induced poor voiding are major factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of NE in adult women. Focused treatments on restoring these functions should be individually considered.

AB  - Regime shifts are ecosystem-scale phenomena. In lake studies, most supporting evidence is frequently based on a single state variable. We examined the sediment record of the shallow lake Blanca Chica (Argentina) to explore the response of multiple proxies belonging to different trophic levels (nutrients, chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments, diatoms, Cladocera remains, and Rotifera resting eggs) over the last 250 yr. We explored different ecological indicators to assess changes consistent with regime shifts. To do so, first we identified the timing of transitional periods on multiple-proxies. Then, we explored (1) the nature of the change (linear versus non-linear dynamics), (2) different indicators of a shift across the food web: multimodality and resilience indicators (standard deviation and autocorrelation), and (3) examined the synchronicity of the detected indicators at multiple-trophic levels. Generalized additive models fitted to the ordination scores of the assemblages analyzed revealed two transitions: ca. 1860-1900, and 1915-1990. Ecological indicators of regime shifts revealed that the first transition is consistent with a threshold state response (change in the ecosystem state manifest as a jump when the driver exceeds a state threshold), and the second one with a critical transition (hysteretic transition in which the system change to an alternate stable state). After the first transition lake structure shifted from littoral to pelagic species dominance (evidenced by Cladocera and diatom assemblages), and turbidity increased, in-dicating a rise in lake water level. This transition was non-linear, showed multimodality, and is most likely driven by an increase in precipitation registered in the region since 1870. During the second transition, nutrient levels rose, all indicators showed multimodality, non-linear dynamics and an increase in standard deviation prior to the regime shift. These dynamics are consistent with a critical transition in response to eutrophication, and coincides with a post-1920 change in land use. Our results show that several ecological indicators of regime shifts need to be examined to perform an accurate diagnosis. We highlight the relevance of a multi-proxy ap-proach including multiple-trophic level responses as the appropriate scale of analysis to determine the occur-rence, type and dynamics of regime shifts. We also show that resilience indicators and critical transitions can be detectable in the whole food web and that shallow lakes can undergo different types of regime shifts.

AB  - Smartphones were used in an online Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) design to test prodromal functioning relative to the interictal state in migraine patients. Eighty-seven participants completed an electronic diary 4 times daily during 3-6 weeks to monitor their migraine attacks. Twice daily the diary additionally included 16 multi-answer questions covering physical symptoms (30 items), cognitive-affective functioning (25 items) and external factors (25 items). Eight clustered prodromal features were identified in the current study: sensory sensitivity, pain/stiffness, fatigue, cognitive functioning, positive affect, negative affect, effort spent and stressors encountered. Per feature, individual change scores with interictal control days - excluding 24-hour post-attack recovery - were computed for six 12-hour pre-attack time windows covering three prodromal days. Linear mixed model (fixed-effect) analysis established significant increases in sensory sensitivity, pain/stiffness and fatigue, and a tendency for increased negative affect, in the 12 hours prior to the attack. Positive affect and cognitive functioning were impaired both in the 25-36 hour and - more strongly - in the 12-hour time window before the attack. No effects were found for effort spent and stressors encountered. Exploratory (random effect) analysis revealed significant individual differences in the change scores in sensory sensitivity, pain/stiffness, fatigue and negative affect. It is concluded that the prodromal change in migraine - relative to interictal functioning - predominantly exists within the last 12 hours before attack onset. Individual diversity is large, however. Future research should zoom in to identify prodrome development within the 12 pre-attack hours as well as to isolate individual patterns.

AB  - We determined the solubility of ikaite from 0-degrees to 25-degrees-C to model its saturation state in natural waters and test the hypothesis that it is the precursor of the calcite pseudomorphs in thinolite tufa of Quaternary Lake Lahontan. Reversible solubility at buffered P(CO2) yields the following expression for the dissolution constant of ikaite: log K(ikaite) = 0.15981 -2011.1/T. Where T = degrees-K, and 0-degrees-C less-than-or-equal-to t less-than-or-equal-to 25-degrees-C. Derived standard state properties are DELTAG-degrees(ikaite) = -2541.9 kJmol-1 +/- 0.66; DELTAH-degrees(ikaite) = -2973.4 kJmol-1 +/- 1.02; S-degrees(ikaite) = 306.6 JT-1mol-1 +/- 1.2. Modeling shows that ikaite is undersaturated at all temperatures in seawater and in alkaline lakes, but that it rapidly approaches saturation near 0-degrees-C. Its precipitation in near-freezing marine sediments requires large additions of HCO3 to pore fluids from the diagenetic decomposition of organic matter. Its crystallization in tufas of alkaline lakes, however, requires only small additions of Ca from springs. Simple kinetic experiments show that ikaite is stabilized in natural environments by orthophosphate, which prevents the crystallization of the more stable anhydrous forms of CaCO3 but does not interact with the ikaite. Therefore, the presence of ikaite or its pseudomorphs is an indicator of near-freezing conditions in environments with high concentrations of orthophosphate. If ikaite is the precursor of thinolite tufa, then the thinolite likely grew below the sediment-water interface at the site of sublacustrine springs during prolonged cold periods.

AB  - Vegetation degradation causes reduction in the available biomass, and decline in the vegetative cover. The Sadra watershed which covers the upper reaches of Marharlu basin, in southern Iran, has been chosen for a test hazard assessment of this type of degradation. The different kinds of data for indicators of vegetation degradation were gathered from collecting of field data like percent canopy and biomass and also records and published reports of the governmental offices of Iran. A new model has been developed for assessing the hazard of vegetation degradation using DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impacts and Responses) framework. The approach is based on the use of indicators, which may be direct or indirect, ecological, technical, socioeconomic or cultural causes of environmental hazard. Taking into consideration fourteen indicators of vegetation degradation the model identifies areas with different hazard class. The preparation of hazard maps based on the Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis of these indicators will be helpful for prioritizing the areas to initiate remedial measures. By fixing the thresholds of severity classes of the fourteen indicators, a hazard map for each indicator was first prepared in GIS. The hazard classes were defined on the basis of hazard scores arrived at by assigning the appropriate attributes to the indicators and the final hazard map was prepared by intersecting fourteen hazard maps in five main hazard layers including anthropogenic, natural, current state of hazard, livestock pressure and trend of degradation in the GIS. Results show among the five main hazard maps used in the model, the most main effective indicator in vegetation degradation of the study area is 'Current State of Hazard'. Also areas under severe hazard class have been found to be widespread (58%) and areas under moderate hazard class have been found (42%) in the Sadra watershed.

AB  - Tourist attractiveness is determined by tourist values (natural and anthropogenic), technical infrastructure and cultural resources. Tourist values are elements of the environment or specific manifestations of business attracting tourists. Identification and assessment of natural resources should be included in the ecosystem services strategy. Tourism development is an important element of the policy implemented by regional and local authorities. The aim of the study is to evaluate the value of forests together with tourist infrastructure on the example of the Ciezko-wice commune (S Poland). The field research included inventory of forest as well as tourist infrastructure in the commune and was carried out on 70 study plots (forests) in Ciezkowice commune. The forest evaluation included 11 assessment criteria for example visual attractiveness of forest, forest resistance to tourist use, health values for the forest user, or species richness. Analysed forests characterised with high tourist attractiveness values (54 plots out of 70). We also distinguished 5 forests with very high tourist attractiveness values and 11 ones with medium values. Most studied forests are attractive for tourist purposes and they can be included in the tourist traffic through the implementation of recreational, health, qualified or religious tourism. Generally analysed forests are suitable for direct tourist use. The limitations were observed in a few forest areas, mainly due to the low resistance of the undergrowth layer to trampling. Formulated directions should be considered for implementation by the local commune. They include monitoring which could help in checking the existing state of natural values of forests and in indicating whether the tourist activity of users does not significantly affect the degradation of forest ecosystems. If the tourist pressure were too high, it should be considered by implementing other solutions related to tourist traffic.

AB  - Using the retrospective case study of Peristenus digoneutis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) introduced in the United States for biological control of native Lygus plant bugs (Hemiptera: Miridae), laboratory and field studies were conducted in the area of origin to evaluate whether the fundamental host range of P. digoneutis matches its ecological host range. Furthermore, it was determined whether these approaches would have been indicative of the post-introduction host range of P. digoneutis in North America [Day, W.H., 1999. Host preference of introduced and native parasites (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) of phytophagous plant bugs (Hemiptera: Miridae) in alfalfa-grass fields in the north-eastern USA, BioControl 44, 249-261.]. Seven non-target mirid species were selected to define the fundamental host range of P. digoneutis in the area of origin in Europe. Laboratory choice and no-choice tests demonstrated that all selected non-target species were attacked by P. digoneutis and were largely suitable for parasitoid development. To confirm the validity of the fundamental host range, the ecological host range of P. digoneutis in the area of origin was investigated. Peristenus digoneutis was reared from 10 hosts, including three Lygus species and seven non-target hosts from the subfamily Mirinae. Despite the fact that laboratory tests demonstrated a high parasitism level in non-targets, ecological assessments in both North America (Day, 1999) and Europe suggest a much lower impact of P. digoneutis on non-target mirids, with low levels of parasitism (below 1% in Europe). Therefore, ecological host range studies in the area of origin provide useful supplementary data for interpreting pre-release laboratory host range testing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A main source of uncertainty currently associated with environmental risk assessment of chemicals is the poor understanding of the influence of environmental factors on the toxicity of xenobiotics. Aiming to reduce this uncertainty, here we evaluate the joint-effects of two pesticides (chlorpyrifos and mancozeb) on the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus under different soil moisture regimes. A full factorial design, including three treatments of each pesticide and an untreated control, were performed under different soil moisture regimes: 25%, 50%, and 75% WHC. Our results showed that soil moisture had no effects on isopods survival, at the levels assessed in this experiment, neither regarding single pesticides nor mixture treatments. Additivity was always the most parsimonious result when both pesticides were present. Oppositely, both feeding activity and biomass change showed a higher sensitivity to soil moisture, with isopods generally showing worse performance when exposed to pesticides and dry or moist conditions. Most of the significant differences between soil moisture regimes were found in single pesticide treatments, yet different responses to mixtures could still be distinguished depending on the soil moisture assessed. This study shows that while soil moisture has the potential to influence the effects of the pesticide mixture itself, such effects might become less important in a context of complex combinations of stressors, as the major contribution comes from its individual interaction with each pesticide. Finally, the implications of our results are discussed in light of the current state of environmental risk assessment procedures and some future perspectives are advanced. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper reflects analyzes of Cd impact on the total activity (nM pyruvic acid/ml s) of aspartate aminotransferase (AST, EC 2.6.1.1) nitrogen metabolism in Glechoma hederacea L. leaves subject (as model) which dominated in the research area (in natural floodplain oak with Stellaria holostea L.) in conditions of Cd pollution (as anthropogenic press) and digging activity by Mammalia (as biotic action, with Talpa europaea L., European mole, as model),) and their combine action. The Cd was introduced in the form of salts Cd(NO3)(2) in the concentrations: 0.25, 1.25 and 2,5 g/m2, equivalent to the inclusion of Cd in 1,5 and 10 doses of MAC on experimental sites. When adding Cd, the content of doses (5 mg/kg soil MAC of Cd) was taken into account. It was founded the increasing of the AST activity on 26% (with adding the Cd salts at a dose of 1.A. and digging activity by Talpa europaea L) according to control (1 MAC Cd), witch it proved the non-specific reaction on stress. With Cd concentration 5 and 10 MAC we observed the repression of the enzymes activity according to controls (5 and 10 MAC Cd) on 10% and 50% in accordance. The protective properties by T. europaea L. hadn't positive results. The transferase enzyme activity according to another control (the area, is without pollution of Cd and digging activity by T. europaea L.) reflected the increasing AST enzyme activity from 166% t. 218% (in presence 1 and 5 MAC Cd) and reduction around 46% (in presence 10 MAC Cd). The digging activity by T. europaea L. lowered the toxic metal effect and the normalisation of the nitrogen metabolism by increasing the activity of AST from 55% to 266%, from 318% to 291% (AST, 1 Ta 5 MAC Cd). The digging activity by Mammalia did not contribute the metal toxic effect under the Cd 10 MAC. Thus, using the different representatives of zoocoenosis promotes improvement in the Steppe Dnieper at low concentrations of the factor has been revealed.

AB  - Important tasks of modern landscape ecology are to monitor and assess natural resources, to examine the impacts and effects of human intervention and, last but not least, to observe the state of the environment over long periods of time. Substantial goals of research at the Leibniz Institute of Ecological and Regional Development (IOER) are the development of methods for the detection of land use changes and for the description of this development by indicators, as well as the analysis and evaluation of the effects of such processes on selected environmental protection assets. GIS technologies were developed for the digital preparation and analysis of historical maps, and subsequent digital land use mapping.
   This contribution focuses on spatial indicators to describe the environmental effects of land use change. The results from a long-term monitoring project will be presented: the structural changes of land use and their impact on landscape functions in a rural area within the national park region Saxon-Bohemian Switzerland, and the development of landscape fragmentation by transport infrastructure over the whole Federal State of Saxony. The analysis of the structural landscape changes proved to be an important aspect. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Social interaction between the state and society is an essential criterion of democracy. The state and society social interaction level assessment is significant for developing a democratic society and the positioning of states in the global environment, which is the target of public marketing. In recent years, special attention has been paid to the research area regarding the public marketing impact on the state socially-oriented tasks successful implementation. However, there is a lack of research that assesses the state and society social interaction level through indicators of socio-economic development of countries, which are determined by the public marketing influence mechanism. The obtained results can be helpful for public administration bodies of different countries to implement the democratic society sustainable development tasks. The article develops a scientifically substantiated array of tools for assessing the level of social interaction between the state and society by calculating a taxonomic indicator based on the socio-economic development of different countries.

KW  - Environmental impact assessment
AB  - Although the limitations of implementing the mitigation hierarchy have been widely discussed in scientific literature, these studies have drawn mainly on feedback concerning terrestrial ecosystems. In the case of development projects in marine and coastal environments, certain issues must be tackled to improve existing practice. This article focuses on the methodologies used to assess both the ecological losses resulting from a development project and the ecological gains generated by an offset measure. The originality of this article is to propose a standardized, operational approach regardless of the development project and the ecosystem impacted that (i) enhances avoidance and reduction efforts and (ii) assesses biodiversity offset needs based on data available in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). The proposed hybrid method combines a multi-criteria analysis of the state of the environment, inspired by the Unified Mitigation Assessment Method (UMAM), and a more accurate assessment at indicator level inspired by Habitat Equivalency Analysis (HEA). The steps of the method, from the selection of biophysical indicators to offset sizing, are described and are then applied to two EIA case studies: one related to a port extension and the other to an offshore wind farm.

AB  - Researchers and managers within the Upper Midwest currently use a variety of sampling methodologies and biological indices to assess ecological condition of stream systems. With multiple entities collecting bioassessment data it is important that we determine the comparability of data and the indices derived from these data for effective assessment of natural systems. In this study we assessed the similarity of data collected by different agencies and we focused on data from one watershed to examine the outputs of different indices for stream assessment, and the temporal variation of index score within sites. We compared duplicate macroinvertebrate community data collected by the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality for overall community composition and index scores derived from these data. Duplicate samples were similar in composition index scores. Taxonomic resolution was addressed and indicated that genus level resolution gives a more favorable score when using indices. We also evaluated the utility of currently available macroinvertebrate indices of biotic integrity to assess data from the Big Manistee River watershed. The indices evaluated were the Hilsenhoff biotic index, the benthic community index for the Northern Lakes and Forests (NLFBCI), the Great Lakes Environmental Assessment Survey (GLEAS) procedure 51 for macroinvertebrates and a biological condition gradient model for the Upper Midwest. Outputs from the indices were moderately correlated (Spearman rank order correlation, r=0.35-0.698) though they indicated different assessments of overall site integrity. Compared with larger scale regional indices, locally calibrated indices generally classified sites as having better biological condition. Replicate samples collected within sites indicated the GLEAS had higher levels of variability (0-265%CV) within sites than the other indices (<10%CV). Data from long-term (I 0 year) monitoring stations were used to evaluate seasonal and long-term index performance. There were differences in index score classifications from spring and fall samples indicating that standardization of sampling time is necessary for comparative analysis. Temporal trends over 10 years reveal natural variation and set the baseline for evaluating the influence of anthropogenic effects. Overall, results indicate that choice of index can alter assessment of site condition. For bioassessment in the Big Manistee River watershed the NLFBCI performs well and accurately reflects site condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Endosulfan sulfate is a persistent environmental metabolite of endosulfan, an organochlorine insecticide-acaricide presently registered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. There is, however, limited acute fish toxicity data for endosulfan sulfate. This study determines the acute toxicity (LC(50)s and LC(10)s) of endosulfan sulfate to three inland Florida native fish species (mosquitofish [Gambusia affinis]; least killifish [Heterandria formosa]; and sailfin mollies [Poecilia latipinna]) as well as fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Ninety-six-h acute toxicity tests were conducted with each fish species under flow-through conditions. For all of the above-mentioned fish species, 96-h LC50 estimates ranged from 2.1 to 3.5 mu g/L endosulfan sulfate. The 96-h LC10 estimates ranged from 0.8 to 2.1 mu g/L endosulfan sulfate. Of all of the fish tested, the least killifish appeared to be the most sensitive to endosulfan sulfate exposure. The above-mentioned data were combined with previous acute toxicity data for endosulfan sulfate and freshwater fish for an effects analysis. The effects analysis estimated hazardous concentrations expected to exceed 5, 10, and 50% of the fish species' acute LC50 or LC10 values (HC5, HC10, and HC50). The endosulfan sulfate freshwater-fish acute tests were also compared with the available freshwater-fish acute toxicity data for technical endosulfan. Technical endosulfan is a mixture of alpha- and beta-endosulfan. The LC(50)s had a wider range for technical endosulfan, and their distribution produced a lower HC10 than for endosulfan sulfate. The number of freshwater-fish LC(50)s for endosulfan sulfate is much smaller than the number available for technical endosulfan, reflecting priorities in examining the toxicity of the parent compounds of pesticides. The toxicity test results and effects analyses provided acute effect values for endosulfan sulfate and freshwater fish that might be applied in future screening level ecologic risk assessments. The effects analyses also discussed several deficiencies in conventional methods for setting water-quality criteria and determining ecologic effects from acute toxicity tests.

AB  - The Po'ouli (Melamprosops phaeosoma), a Hawaiian honeycreeper endemic to Maui, has a population of only three known individuals; no breeding pair currently exists, and their home ranges are too far apart for breeding to occur. Without timely intervention this monotypic genus will likely go extinct. Conservationists have faced a dilemma: facilitate breeding amongst the known individuals, manage their ecosystem to benefit uncounted Po'ouli, or a combination of both? Po'ouli biology is poorly known - but their remote home ranges are closely monitored. A State and Federal Environmental Assessment in 1999 recommended that one Po'ouli be translocated into the home range of another in an attempt to facilitate breeding. This first manipulative recovery action was achieved in April 2002, and provided valuable new information for future captive management efforts, but upon release, radio telemetry confirmed that the translocated bird returned to its own home range after one day. We describe the recent progress that has been made to recover the Po'ouli, and critically evaluate the Po'ouli case study and the lessons learned from it that can help expedite recovery of other birds of extreme rarity.

AB  - Despite the well-documented positive effect of exercise on health outcomes, most people do not succeed in exercising regularly. In addition to several other influences, affective states seem to support exercise participation. Associations between exercise and affect have been shown in the laboratory. However, the dynamic relation between affect and exercise in daily life is not yet well-understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the bi-directional effect of momentary affective states on naturally occurring exercise and vice versa in healthy participants in real-life environments by applying an ecological momentary assessment design. We hypothesized that (1) exercise duration is positively associated with affective states on a day level, (2) affective states in the morning predict subsequent exercise duration, and (3) exercise duration predicts affective states in the evening on that respective day. Data from N = 60 students aged between 19 and 32 years were analyzed. Affect and exercise duration were assessed daily over a period of 20 days via an electronic diary. Multilevel analysis revealed that positive affective valence was positively associated with exercise duration (p = 0.003) on a day level. In addition, the more the participants exercised that respective day, the better and more content they felt in the evening (p = 0.009). Energetic arousal in the morning significantly predicted subsequent exercise duration (p = 0.045). The findings indicate that it would be worthwhile to focus more on within-subject analyses when analyzing the dynamic relation between affect and exercise. Furthermore, affective states should be taken into account in creating effective interventions to foster exercise behavior and enhance maintenance.

AB  - Data resources and assessment frameworks are two keys to ecosystem health assessment (EHA). Application of the land use database together with the Pressure State Response (PSR) model in EHA provides better precision relative to traditional data resources and assessment frameworks for EHA at the county scale. The raw data are taken from The Anlu County Annals, The Soil Records of Anlu County, and The Statistical Yearbook of National Economy in Anlu County. The spatial and attribute data are partly extracted from the database of current land use in Anlu City using the MAPGIS platform. Based on the results from principal component analysis (PCA), a total of eleven indicators were selected to build an indicator system designed to assess the ecosystem health at the county scale. According to the PSR model, the scores from three indices (press index, state index, and response index) and a comprehensive assessment index (CAI) were calculated, and an assessment map was constructed. The results from the index scores and spatial analysis display a large range for the state of ecosystem health due to the evolution of natural ecosystems and human activities at the county scale. The precision of the current land use database (scale of 1:10,000) makes it a better candidate for evaluating ecosystem health than the traditional data resources. This study also demonstrates the numerous benefits of combining land use databases with GIS functions to assess ecosystem health at the county scale. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 1990, the US Congress amended the Clean Air Act (CAA) to reduce regional-scale ecosystem degradation from SOx and NOx emissions which have been responsible for acid deposition in regions such as the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. An ecosystem assessment project was conducted from 1994 to 2012 by the Darrin Fresh Water Institute to determine the effect of these emission reduction policies on aquatic systems. The project investigated water chemistry and biota in 30 Adirondack lakes and ponded waters. Although regulatory changes made in response to the 1990 CAA amendments resulted in a reduction of acid deposition within the Adirondacks, the ecosystem response to these reductions is complicated. A statistical analysis of SO4, pH, Al, and DOC data collected during this project demonstrates positive change in response to decreased deposition. The changes in water chemistry also have lowered the risk of Al toxicity to brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis [Mitchill]), which allowed the reintroduction of this species to Brooktrout Lake from which it had been extirpated. However, pH and labile aluminum (Al-im) fluctuate and are not strongly correlated to changes in acid deposition. As such, toxicity to S. fontinalis also is cyclic and provides rationale for the difficulties inherent in re-establishing resident populations in impacted aquatic environments. Overall, aquatic ecosystems of the Adirondacks show a positive response to reduced deposition driven by changes in environmental policy, but the response is more complex and indicates an ecosystem-wide interaction between aquatic and watershed components of the ecosystem.

AB  - This study examines whether pesticide risk indicators can be used to evaluate the environmental effects of pesticide applications within integrated pest management (IPM) projects. Pesticide risk indicators, commonly used in European countries, are mathematical equations that consider data inputs such as application rates, toxicity levels of a pesticide's active ingredient, meteorological data, the soil characteristics of farm fields, and other information to generate potential risk scores for pesticide applications. These potential risk scores represent the best estimate of a pesticide's impact on the surrounding environment. This project analyzed eight pesticide risk indicators, developed throughout Europe and the United States, with two years of pesticide application data from four farms using IPM. This two-year study allowed for a determination of the validity and reliability of pesticide risk indicators. The findings reveal that only three pesticide risk indicators performed consistently and gave valid results. These indicators are: the synoptic evaluation model for plant protection agents (SYNOPS) indicator from Germany, the multi-attribute toxicity factor from the United States, and the environmental impact quotient from the United States. As a result, the authors recommend these three indicators for future research and for IPM evaluative efforts that emphasize the environmental effects of pesticides.

AB  - The k-means cluster technique is used to examine 43 yr of daily winter Northern Hemisphere (NH) polar stratospheric data from the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40). The results show that the NH winter stratosphere exists in two natural well-separated states. In total, 10% of the analyzed days exhibit a warm disturbed state that is typical of sudden stratospheric warming events. The remaining 90% of the days are in a state typical of a colder undisturbed vortex. These states are determined objectively, with no preconceived notion of the groups. The two stratospheric states are described and compared with alternative indicators of the polar winter flow, such as the northern annular mode. It is shown that the zonally averaged zonal winds in the polar upper stratosphere at similar to 7 hPa can best distinguish between the two states, using a threshold value of similar to 4 m s(-1), which is remarkably close to the standard WMO criterion for major warming events. The analysis also determines that there are no further divisions within the warm state, indicating that there is no well-designated threshold between major and minor warmings, nor between split and displaced vortex events. These different manifestations are simply members of a continuum of warming events.

AB  - Shade grown coffee crops generate environments more similar to mountain ecosystems than monocultures of coffee exposed to direct sunlight. Although butterflies are considered useful bioindicators of the state of ecosystem health, their diversity remains unknown in coffee agroecosystems in Santander, where coffee is grown under shade. The structure and composition of the assembly of the Papilionoidea in a shade coffee plantation (Hacienda La Capellania, Curiti, Santander) at an altitude of 1756 m (August-September, 2014) are described. In three parallel transects of 50 m inside the crop, nine Van Someren-Rydon traps were baited with decomposed fruit, and additional specimens were captured with an entomological net. The sampling coverage was estimated at 81.67 % (Clench equation). Overall, 341 individuals of 49 species of the family Nymphalidae (spp. = 39), Pieridae (spp. = 7), Papilionidae (spp. = 2) and Lycaenidae (sp. = 1) were captured. The most abundant species were Cissia pompilia, Graphita griphe and Hermeuptychia harmonia. Species richness (a = 16), dominance (D = 0.07), evenness (J' = 0.81) and effective number of species (degrees D = 58.8, D-1 = 23.73 and D-2 = 14.26) were estimated. Vegetation structure was related to the composition of butterfly communities (canonical correspondence analysis). The abundance of butterflies was significantly associated with the percentage of tree cover, height, trunk diameter, and the abundance of trees in the coffee plantation. This study is one of the first to describe the diversity of butterflies associated with shade coffee in the department of Santander. Traditional shade coffee agroecosystems may benefit the diversity of butterflies because the heterogeneity of their plant structure offers a greater availability of resources and shelter for them.

AB  - In land systems, equitably managing trade-offs between planetary boundaries and human development needs represents a grand challenge in sustainability oriented initiatives. Informing such initiatives requires knowledge about the nexus between land use, poverty, and environment. This paper presents results from Lao PDR, where we combined nationwide spatial data on land use types and the environmental state of landscapes with village-level poverty indicators. Our analysis reveals two general but contrasting trends. First, landscapes with paddy or permanent agriculture allow a greater number of people to live in less poverty but come at the price of a decrease in natural vegetation cover. Second, people practising extensive swidden agriculture and living in intact environments are often better off than people in degraded paddy or permanent agriculture. As poverty rates within different landscape types vary more than between landscape types, we cannot stipulate a land use-poverty-environment nexus. However, the distinct spatial patterns or configurations of these rates point to other important factors at play. Drawing on ethnicity as a proximate factor for endogenous development potentials and accessibility as a proximate factor for external influences, we further explore these linkages. Ethnicity is strongly related to poverty in all land use types almost independently of accessibility, implying that social distance outweighs geographic or physical distance. In turn, accessibility, almost a precondition for poverty alleviation, is mainly beneficial to ethnic majority groups and people living in paddy or permanent agriculture. These groups are able to translate improved accessibility into poverty alleviation. Our results show that the concurrence of external influences with local-highly contextual-development potentials is key to shaping outcomes of the land use-poverty- environment nexus. By addressing such leverage points, these findings help guide more effective development interventions. At the same time, they point to the need in land change science to better integrate the understanding of place-based land indicators with process-based drivers of land use change.

AB  - We investigate reference points for ecosystem indicators in support of an Ecosystem Approach to Fishery. In particular, we assess indicator capacity to detect when the Multispecies Maximum Sustainable Yield (MMSY) is reached, under a wide range of multispecies fishing strategies. The analysis was carried out using a simulation approach based on the ecosystem model OSMOSE in the southern Benguela. We show that the 13 ecosystem indicators have reference points at MMSY that are highly variable across fishing strategies. The state of the ecosystem at MMSY is so variable across fishing strategies that it is not possible to set reference points without considering the fishing strategy. However, strategy-specific reference points were found to constitute robust proxies for MMSY in more than 90% of the simulated fishing strategies. For instance, under the current fishing strategy in the southern Benguela, robust reference points at MMSY could be identified for the following indicators: mean length of fish, mean lifespan, biomass over catch ratio, trophic level of the surveys, mean trophic index, proportion of predatory fish, intrinsic vulnerability index, and mean maximum length.

AB  - We studied the changes in morphophysiological (gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, spleen index) and biochemical (protein, glycogen, lipids, malonic dialdehyde, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and cortisol) parameters in redfish under the action of toxic loading. Two lakes were chosen as model zones. These reservoirs differ significantly in anthropogenic impact and water quality (oxygen content and mineralization). The high content of toxicants (heavy metals) in Lake Kyrylivske significantly affected the physiological status of the studied fish. In the case of intensive toxic pollution of the reservoir, the indicators of the liver and spleen in redfish increase by 1.9 and 1.6 times, respectively that testified to the increasing functional activity of these organs. Changes in energy substrates accompanied enhancement of the functional activity of internal organs. The protein and glycogen content in the tissues of the liverwort from the contaminated lake was lower by 24.5% and 36.0%, respectively, compared with the conditional control. We found that the anthropogenic load on the reservoir protein content in the gills of fish increases by 18.2% (p >= 0.05). However, under these conditions, its content in the muscles is significantly reduced by 24.5% compared to fish from relatively clean water. Confirmation of chronic stress at the time of the study was the high value of malonic dialdehyde in liver tissue. In fish from Lake Kyrylivske (dirty reservoir), its content was higher by 40.7% (p >= 0.05) than the same indicator for conditional control. Significant changes in hormone content also occurred during the stay of the Rudd in unstable hydro ecological conditions. Thus, we found that the content of triiodothyronine in the blood plasma of fish under the influence of toxic contamination was 2.9 times lower (p <= 0.05) compared to fish from control conditions. However, the content of thyroxine in the blood plasma of redfish from the contaminated lake was higher by 40.0% (p <= 0.05) relative to the conditional control. The content of thyroxine and triiodothyronine in the blood plasma allows assessing the strength of anthropogenic impact on fish adequately. The obtained data on the physiological state of the Rudd allows monitoring (by changes in internal organs, by the content of hormones, malonic dialdehyde) the ecological state of water bodies located in geographically urbanized areas. This will further help minimize the harmful effects of toxic loads on the aquatic ecosystems of the city and its environs.

AB  - The state of ecological balance of cities is determined by the analysis of the qualitative composition of green space. The lack of green space inventory in small towns in the Kyiv region has prompted the use of express analysis provided by the EOS Land Viewer platform, which allows obtaining an instantaneous distribution of the urban and suburban territories by a number of vegetative indices and in recent years - by scene classification. The purpose of the study is to determine the current state and dynamics of the ratio of vegetation and built-up cover of the territories of small towns in Kyiv region with establishing the rating of towns by eco-balance of territories. The distribution of the territory of small towns by the most common vegetation index NDVI, as well as by SAVI, which is more suitable for areas with vegetation coverage of less than 30%, has been monitored. We found that the share of dense vegetation in the territory of towns increased on average from 2.4 to 49.3% during 1990-2018. 'Ihe share of the vegetation cover of moderate density decreased from 40.8 to 27.1%, and of sparse one from 37.5 to 14.9%. High variability of these indicators is noted. The share of open area for small towns decreased on average from 15.4 to 3.8%. The vegetation-free areas in 1990, 2005 and 2018 accounted for 3.8, 2.6 and 4.4%, respectively, which may indicate the intensive expansion of built-up areas over the last fifteen years. The development of urban greening systems was completely individual and depended not only on natural conditions but also on the manifestations of anthropogenic activity. The reduction of the ecological balance of the territories of small towns as of 2018 took place in the following sequence - Irpin, Tarashcha, Boiarka, Rzhyshchiv, Kaharlyk, Skvyra, Myronivka, Yahotyn, Uzyn.

AB  - Background. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the possibility to use some soil biochemical parameters as effective indicators for defining soil biological fertility status. In this article, results obtained from different studies carried out in Mediterranean ecosystems were reported in order to evaluate the "quality" of natural forest soils or undergoing the pressure of different degenerative processes.
   Methods. Some parameters able to describe microbial biomass activity in soil (metabolic quotient, potentially mineralisable carbon, microbial biomass carbon/total organic carbon ratio, C-mineralisation kinetic) were considered.
   Results. Results showed that disturbed sites were characterised by high mineralisation activity, high metabolic quotient and low microbial C/total organic C ratio, while undisturbed sites showed the opposite trend In the case of natural forest systems, the more homogeneous was the vegetal cover, the slower was the microbial activity; in contrast, mixed forest sites were characterised by elevated amounts of mineralised organic carbon and corresponding high values of metabolic quotients.
   Conclusions. These studies indicated that the parameters considered could be effective as both indicators of soil disturbance and soil-state descriptors for natural systems, suggesting to take them into account as soil quality indicators, when a "restoration programme" is planned.

AB  - Understanding wetland food webs is critical for effective habitat management, restoration and conservation. Microalgae are recognized as key food sources for marsh invertebrates but the importance of different groups under various conditions is rarely examined. We tested the hypothesis that faunal utilization of microalgae, and cyanobacteria in particular, is significant in Southern California created and natural salt marshes but varies with habitat type (creek bank versus marsh interior) and season (spring versus autumn). We used stable isotope analysis and mixing models (IsoSource) to compare food webs in adjacent young (created) and mature (natural) salt marshes. Isotopic values of some primary producers, macrofauna, epifauna, and fish demonstrated significant differences between the adjacent salt marshes. delta C-13 and delta S-34 values of the benthic microalgal community varied with taxonomic composition (diatoms versus cyanobacteria) and to a lesser extent with season. Depleted delta N-15 values of benthic diatoms and macroalgae indicated that N-2 fixed within algal mats was recycled within the benthic algal community. Marsh fauna, including most major macrofauna taxal, Cerithidea, and Fundulus, also exhibited seasonal differences in isotopic composition, and Cerithidea and selected macrofauna (oligochaetes, polychaetes) from the marsh interior were more enriched in C-13 and depleted in N-15 than those from the creek bank. In the young marsh, the cyanobacteria contributed a minimum of 17-100% of the primary production in food webs supporting macrofauna, and cyanobacteria contributed at least 40% of the primary production included in Cerithidea and Fundulus food webs. A wider range of primary producers contributed to food webs in the mature marsh. Cyanobacteria were a greater source of trophic support for macrofauna from the marsh interior than the creek bank, whereas Spartina was a more important food source for creek bank macrofauna in both marshes. Insect larvae largely consumed cyanobacteria, whereas polychaetes exhibited greater utilization of Spartina. Phytoplankton was the primary food resource for mussels in both marshes. Although the spatial and temporal complexity of food webs has traditionally been collapsed into the study of relatively simplified food webs, isotope signatures reveal fine-scale patterns in food web structure that may be used to make more accurate assessments of ecosystem state. Accurate interpretation of marsh trophic structure using natural abundance stable isotopes requires fine-scale resolution in space and time, a large number of samples, and a high level of taxonomic resolution.

AB  - This study presents an analysis of the relationships among tree species, the type of mine soil substrate vs. vegetation development and features of plant communities. The study was conducted on two types of afforested mine sites (open strip sulphur and sand pit mine) built from various parential rocks: mixed quaternary sands and Neogene clays (QsNc) and quaternary loams (Q1). The study plots were arranged in stands of Scots pine (Punts sylvestris L.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), silver birch (Benda pendula Roth) and black alder (Abuts glutinosa Gaertn.) from 25 to 35 years old. Tree stand parameter measurements and analyses of soil substrate properties and vegetation characteristics based on phytosociological surveys were done. The diversity expressed as the number of species (S) and Shannon-Wiener index (H), the Simpson dominance index (C) and ecological indicator values of vascular plants (EIVP) were assayed. We hypothesised that in similar substrates (parent rock conditions) the influence of tree stand species in the early phase of reclaimed ecosystem development is significant. Based on the results, we concluded that forest floor vegetation under deciduous species had clearly more herb layer cover and less moss in comparison to vegetation under coniferous species, which confirmed a significant influence only on the level of the ecological group of trees and not at the level of individual tree species. In contrast, the diversity of plant communities was influenced mainly by tree stand species. The highest diversity indexes (H) of communities were under birch and larch, and the lowest H was noted under alder. This phenomenon may be explained by the impact of the alder on soil nitrogen content, which led to the domination of communities by highly competitive species such as Aegopodium podagraria L. and Geranium robertianum L. on QsNc and Calamagrostis epigejos (L.) Roth on Ql. Only EIVP values depended more strongly on soil substrate than tree stand species, and these were only slightly affected by tree stand species composition. Among the tree species, alder significantly increased the value of trophy indicators.

AB  - Ubiquitous distribution, fast growth rate and manifold relevance has credited algae a potential bioresource in current state of affairs of environmental degradation. In the present study, green algaChlorococcumsp. has been collected from waste water, isolated and cultured to assess their accumulation and toxicity responses at different As(III) concentration. Results revealed thatChlorococcumsp. treated with 10 mu M As(III) showed a minimal reduction (21%) in chlorophyll concentration with high proline and carotenoids content indicating its adaptive tolerance potential against As(III). The EC(50)of As(III) for inhibiting growth of the microalgae after 10 days of experiment was 9.4 mu M. Further,Chlorococcumsp. accumulated 239.09 mu g g(- 1)dw As at the concentration of 10 mu M of As(III) after 10 days of treatment. Concentration dependent accumulation pattern and antioxidant responses inChlorococcumsp. could be a used as a potential bioindicator and bioremediator of As from waste water.

AB  - The emergence of high-resolution land cover data has created the opportunity to assess the accuracy of impervious cover (IC) provided by the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). We assessed the accuracy of the 900 m2 NLCD2011 %IC for 18 metropolitan areas throughout the conterminous United States using reference data from 1 m(2) land cover data developed as part of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's EnviroAtlas project. Agreement was assessed from two perspectives: 1) sensitivity to the size of the assessment unit used for the comparison, and 2) utility of NLCD %IC to serve as a proxy for high-resolution IC. The former perspective was considered because statistical relationships can be sensitive to assessment unit size and shape, and the latter perspective was considered because high resolution (reference) %IC data are not available nationwide. The utility of NLCD %IC as a proxy for the high resolution data was assessed for seven lattice (square) cell sizes ranging from 1 ha to 200 ha using four EnviroAtlas IC indicators: 1) %IC per 100 ha (1 km(2)); 2) %IC by Census block group; 3) %IC within a 15 m (radius) of the riparian zone, and; 4) %IC within a 50 m (radius) of the riparian zone. Agreement was quantified as per assessment unit deviation (NLCD %IC reference %IC) and summarized as Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Mean Deviation (MD) both within and across the 18 metropolitan areas. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression (y = reference %IC and x = NLCD %IC) was also used to evaluate the quality of the NLCD %IC data. MAD was <= 5% for six of the seven lattice cell sizes. MAD was also 5 5% for Census block groups >= 100 ha and for both riparian units. These results suggest that uncertainty attributable to the measurement of %IC was no greater than the uncertainty related to the effect of IC on aquatic resources that have been derived from studies of aquatic condition (e.g., benthic fauna) over a range of %IC. Overall, agreement was variable from one metropolitan area to the next. Agreement improved as assessment unit size increased and declined as the level of urbanization (NLCD %IC) increased. NLCD %IC tended to underestimate reference %IC overall, but NLCD %IC was sometimes greater than reference %IC in urbanized settings.

AB  - Climate change and a growing wildland-urban interface create new challenges for forest managers and restoration practitioners. In this shifting environment, effective public communication of scientific understanding of forest ecosystems and their changing state can be crucial. As a potential tool to help meet this communication need, we present a model for an index of forest health piloted in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. The index presents ratings of forest health through the lens of public goals, using selected climatic, ecological, and socioeconomic data. A set of indicators combined with judgment about the metrics of health and how to weight them yields a quantitative rating system with a score for each indicator. Coproduced via a partnership between nongovernmental organizations, managers, and researchers, the result is a still evolving prototype of an educational resource with potential to also act as a decision support tool for tracking forest health and gauging management strategies.

AB  - P>1. The Upper Yangtze River drains a catchment of c. 1 million km2 from its headwaters on the Tibetan Plateau to the city of Yichang below the Three Gorges Dam. The Upper Yangtze River Basin supports a diverse aquatic fauna, including 118 endemic fish species. The river basin has a long history of human use and environmental alteration and is further threatened by the demands of a large population and rapid economic development.
   2. We identified a set of areas that, with adequate protection and/or management, might maintain the aquatic biodiversity and ecological processes representative of the basin. Methods were developed to address the scope and scale of conservation planning across the entire Upper Yangtze Basin in a short time-frame using available data. The analytical framework is a watershed hierarchy of five catchment size classes derived from a globally available hydrography dataset called HydroSHEDs. Catchments were assigned to ecosystem types according to catchment area and patterns of climate, catchment morphology, geology and sources of water. Catchments were also ranked by ecological condition using an index of cumulative anthropogenic impacts.
   3. We defined conservation priorities as a combination of expert-designated focal areas that support endemic fish assemblages and habitat in good condition; sites selected with the conservation planning software MARXAN to meet representation targets for ecosystems and optimise ecological condition and longitudinal connectivity; and a set of rivers selected to provide refugia for fishes affected by a hydropower and flood control infrastructure development project.
   4. Areas selected as conservation priorities include 3200 km (27% of total length) of large rivers, 9900 km (39% of total length) of small rivers and 30% of small stream catchments in the basin. To evaluate the degree to which the set of conservation priority areas supports threatened and endemic fishes, we conducted a gap analysis using survey records and historic range maps of 131 threatened and/or endemic fish species. The conservation priority areas contain survey records or portions of the known historic range of 116 (88%) of the 131 species we evaluated, with an average of 49% of the survey records and/or 26% of the known historic ranges of each species.

AB  - Developing a standardized approach to measuring the state of biodiversity in landscapes undergoing disturbance is crucial for evaluating and comparing change across different systems, assessing ecosystem vulnerability and the impacts of destructive activities, and helping direct species recovery actions. Existing ecosystem metrics of condition fail to acknowledge that a particular community could be in multiple states, and the distribution of states could worsen or improve when impacted by a disturbance process, depending on how far the current landscape distribution of states diverges from pre-anthropogenic impact baseline conditions. We propose a way of rapidly assessing regional-scale condition in ecosystems where the distribution of age classes representing increasing time since last disturbance is suspected to have diverged from an ideal benchmark reference distribution. We develop two metrics that (1) compare the observed mean time since last disturbance with an expected mean and (2) quantify the summed shortfall of vegetation age-class frequencies relative to a reference age-class distribution of time since last disturbance. We demonstrate the condition metrics using two case studies: (1) fire in threatened southwestern Australian proteaceaous mallee-heath and (2) impacts of disturbance (fire and logging) in the critically endangered southeastern Australian mountain ash Eucalyptus regnans forest on the yellow-bellied glider Petaurus australis. We explore the effects of uncertainty in benchmark time since last disturbance, and evaluate metric sensitivity using simulated age-class distributions representing alternative ecosystems. By accounting for and penalizing too-frequent and too-rare disturbances, the summed shortfall metric is more sensitive to change than mean time since last disturbance. We find that mountain ash forest is in much poorer condition (summed shortfall 38.5 out of 100 for a 120-yr benchmark disturbance interval) than indicated merely by loss of extent (84% of vegetation remaining). Proteaceaous mallee-heath is in worse condition than indicated by loss of extent for an upper benchmark interval of 80 yr, but condition almost doubles for the minimum tolerable time since last disturbance interval of 20 yr. To fully describe ecosystem degradation, we recommend that our summed shortfall metric, focused on habitat quality and informed by biologically meaningful baselines, be added to existing condition measures focused on vegetation extent. This will improve evaluation of change in ecosystem states and enhance management of ecosystems in poor condition.

AB  - The physiological and biochemical characteristics of seedlings of Descurainia sophia (Fisch.) and Lepidium apetalum Wild. have been used as examples to demonstrate that long-term exposure of plant populations to environmental stress factors causes adaptive changes in antioxidant and genomic systems that may considerably affect the radioresistance of seed progeny. The resistance to additional acute irradiation of seed progeny of wild plants adapted to different environmental conditions has been found to be determined not only by the combination of antioxidant and DNA-repair protection systems and the vulnerability of the functioning genome, but also by their variability. The data on the relationship of the radioresistance of wild plant populations with physiological and biochemical characteristics and their variability may be used for expert environmental assessment of the state of the biota and prediction of its viability under exposure to abiotic environmental factors.

AB  - The impact of long-term turfgrass management practices on soil nematode population and community structure and nutrient pools were studied in replicated Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) plots managed under 9 different organic- and mineral-fertilizer regimes for 15 years in Delaware, Ohio. Soil samples were collected in September 2003, July 2004 and October 2004. Nematodes were extracted using the Baermann funnel technique, identified to genus level, and populations of total, free-living (FLN), bacterivorous, fungivorous, predatory, omnivorous, and plant-parasitic (PPN) nematodes, were counted. FLN/PPN ratio, total number of genera, genus diversity, richness, evenness, Maturity Index, Plant-Parasitic Index, and Combined Maturity Index were calculated. in addition, soil nematode faunal profile analysis was conducted to determine soil food web condition using Enrichment Index and Structure Index. Concentrations of NH4-N, NO3-N, dissolved organic nitrogen, microbial biomass nitrogen, and soil organic matter (SOM) were measured in soil samples to describe soil nutrient status. Results from repeated measures analysis of variance showed that in general, nematode populations and food web indices were not differently affected by the 9 turfgrass management regimes but microbial biomass nitrogen and SOM were different. Further group analysis revealed that nematode community indices, Maturity Index and Combined Maturity Index, were significantly lower and Enrichment Index was significantly higher under high (223 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and medium (171 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) N-input compared to low N-input (98 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) management group, indicating disturbance of the nematode food web. In addition, organic- fertilizer based turf management resulted in significantly higher soil microbial biomass compared to mineral-fertilizer management or the control, but no differences were found in the nematode community between the two fertilizer types. Herbicide, insecticide, or fungicide applications had no significant negative effect on soil nematode community, microbial biomass and SOM. We conclude that the amount of N fertilizer influences the soil nematode food web and nutrient pools in turfgrass while pesticides have no effect. our results also show that irrespective of the management regime, the soil nematode food webs under turfgrass are more enriched but less structured than those under natural grassland ecosystems, indicating an overall food web disturbance.

AB  - Diversity and distribution of chironomid fauna (Diptera: Chironomidae) in 36 springs in the Italian Prealps (Veneto and Trentino NE-Italy, 46 degrees N, 10-11 degrees E) was studied in relation to altitude, spring type and grade of disturbance. The springs were located between 62 and 1710 m asl of altitude, in three calcareous mountain areas (Mt. Baldo, Mts. Lessini and Mt. Pasubio). They differed in conservation status (natural, moderately and highly disturbed) and belonged to five hydromorphological types (rheocrene, limnocrene, rheohelocrene, rheolimnocrene, rheohygropetric). Each spring was surveyed once, between early summer and autumn, within 50 m of the spring's source (eucrenal). A total of 4198 chironomid larvae and pupae were sorted from 111 macroinvertebrate samples collected, belonging to five subfamilies (Tanypodinae, Diamesinae, Prodiamesinae, Orthocladiinae and Chironominae), 41 genera and 60 species/groups of species, and three juveniles taxa. As expected, Orthocladiinae accounted for a large part of specimens (88%) and species (74%), with Tvetenia calvescens/bavarica as the most frequent and abundant taxon, shared by pristine and disturbed springs and by all spring types. Most taxa were found in few sites, and frequencies declined gradually for most wider distributed species. A high number (74%) of rare (=present in less than 10% of sites) taxa were found and from one to 23 taxa were identified per spring. Maximum richness occurred in moderately disturbed (Shannon-H=1.29 +/- 0.60) springs, located at medium-high altitude (385-1266 m asl), according to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Even the evenness (Equitability-J) was higher as average in these springs. A Cluster Analysis run on Bray-Curtis similarity index highlighted a high similarity i) between the chironomid assemblages of moderately disturbed and natural springs (44 species in each spring group, with 29 species in common), and ii) between rheocrene and rheohelocrene types, thus the springs with the highest microhabitat heterogeneity. High individuality of springs was revealed, and new information about non-biting midges autecology provided. The utility of chironomids as bioindicators of water quality and ecological state of springs was confirmed, with some species e associated with high disturbance level (e.g., Polypedilum nubeculosum gr. to water intake works) and others with pristine conditions (e.g., Pseudodiamesa branickii).

AB  - 1. Microplastics in soils have become an important threat for terrestrial systems as they may potentially alter the geochemical/biophysical soil environment and can interact with drought. As microplastics may affect soil water content, this could exacerbate the well-known negative effects of drought on ecosystem functionality. Thus, functions including litter decomposition, soil aggregation or those related with nutrient cycling can be altered. Despite this potential interaction, we know relatively little about how microplastics, under different soil water conditions, affect ecosystem functions and multifunctionality.
   2. To address this gap, we performed an experiment using grassland plant communities growing in microcosms. Microplastic fibres (absent, present) and soil water conditions (well-watered, drought) were applied in a fully factorial design. At harvest, we measured soil ecosystem functions related to nutrient cycling (beta-glucosaminidase, beta-D-cellobiosidase, phosphatase, beta-glucosidase enzymes), respiration, nutrient retention, pH, litter decomposition and soil aggregation (water stable aggregates). As terrestrial systems provide these functions simultaneously, we also assessed ecosystem multifunctionality, an index that encompasses the array of ecosystem functions measured here.
   3. We found that the interaction between microplastic fibres and drought affected ecosystem functions and multifunctionality. Drought had negatively affected nutrient cycling by decreasing enzymatic activities by up to similar to 39%, while microplastics increased soil aggregation by similar to 18%, soil pH by similar to 4% and nutrient retention by up to similar to 70% by diminishing nutrient leaching. Microplastic fibres also impacted soil enzymes, respiration and ecosystem multifunctionality, but importantly, the direction of these effects depended on soil water status. That is, under well-watered conditions, these functions decreased with microplastic fibres by up to similar to 34% while under drought they had similar values irrespective of the microplastic presence, or tended to increase with microplastics. Litter decomposition had a contrary pattern increasing with microplastics by similar to 6% under well-watered conditions while decreasing to a similar percentage under drought.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Single ecosystem functions can be positively or negatively affected by microplastics fibres depending on soil water status. However, our results suggest that microplastic fibres may cause negative effects on ecosystem soil multifunctionality of a similar magnitude as drought. Thus, strategies to counteract this new global change factor are necessary.

AB  - A prerequisite for environmental indices is that they represent environmental pressure, and the state of, and impact on environmental conditions. In other words, they should capture as much as possible of the cause-effect chains they represent and relate pressure and effect to criteria of environmental quality. The approach proposed in the article attempts to link the pressure-state-impact-response framework of indicators to the integrated environmental model, based on the method of response function (MRF). The MRF allows to construct purposeful, credible models from data and prior knowledge or information. The data are usually time series observations of system inputs and outputs, and sometimes of internal states. The output of such models is presented with highly aggregated environmental indices, reflecting the main pressure-state-impact-response cause-effect chains. The proposed approach is illustrated with the example of soil erosion indices. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasing life expectancies, burgeoning healthcare costs and an emphasis on the management of multiple health-risk behaviours point to a need to delineate health lifestyles in older adults.
   The aims of this study were to delineate health lifestyles of a cohort of older adults and to examine the association of these lifestyles with biological and psychological states and socio-economic indices.
   Cluster analysis was applied to data derived from the self-reported 45 and Up cohort study (N = 96,276) of Australians over 45 years, regarding exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, diet and cancer screening behaviours.
   Six lifestyle clusters emerged delineated by smoking, screening and physical activity levels. Individuals within health-risk dominant clusters were more likely to be male, living alone, low-income earners, living in a deprived neighbourhood, psychologically distressed and experiencing low quality of life.
   Health lifestyle cluster membership can be used to identify older adults at greatest risk for physical and psychological health morbidity.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Land use and changes in land use have a significant impact on biodiversity. Still, there is no agreed upon methodology for how this impact should be assessed and included in LCA. This paper presents a methodology for including land use impact on biodiversity in Life Cycle Impact Assessment and provides a case example from forestry operations in Norway.
   Materials and Methods. The methodology presented applies indirect assessments of biodiversity based on knowledge on what key factors are important for maintaining biodiversity in a boreal forest. These are used to construct an index on Conditions for Maintained Biodiversity. In addition the intrinsic quality of an area is assessed on the basis of the Ecosystem Scarcity and Ecosystem Vulnerability. Globally available data on ecoregions are here used. In addition the spatial and temporal impact is assessed based on the annual regrowth of the forest.
   Results. In the case study different forestry management regimes for the ecoregions 'Scandinavian and Russian taiga' and Scandinavian coastal coniferous forests' are compared. Based on the proposed methodology, the intrinsic quality difference of the two ecoregions is estimated to approximately 40% and the reduction in impact on biodiversity from land use by adopting new and realistic targets for the key factor 'areas set aside' is estimated to 20%.
   Discussion. The paper presents a new methodology for how land use impacts on biodiversity can be included in LCA. The methodologv is based upon a proposed framework and the results from the case study show that the methodology is capable to distinguish between different forestry management regimes and forestry in different ecoregions. The data used are readily available, but more research is needed to scale the proposed key factors and also include new key factors. It is at present not possible to validate the size of the differences.
   Conclusions. The importance of land use impact on biodiversity is of major importance and should be included in LCIA. The proposed methodology is developed within a framework developed within the UNTEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative and provides a methodology demonstrated to be able to distinguish between both similar activities in different ecoregions and different management practices within one ecoregion.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. More work is needed to establish a methodology for land use impact on biodiversity in LCIA and due to the importance this should be a prioritized task. The proposed application of indirect indicators to assess impact on biodiversity from land use changes in LCIA should be further explored, but the proposed methodology can already be applied with globally available data on ecoregions. The challenge is to develop sound key factors for the relevant ecosystems.

AB  - Currently, the conservation of the unique ecosystems of small water bodies located within cultural landscapes and/or in areas with limited nature protection status is of urgent issue. It is such hydrobiocenoses that are the most susceptible to increasing anthropogenic impact. Phytoplankton is a good indicator of the ecological situation in the reservoir. The aim of the work was to analyze the composition and structure of phytoplankton of some small urbanized lakes of Samara region with different levels of protection and degree of anthropogenic load.
   Here, this is the first time we present an analysis of the current ecological state of three small water bodies having various nature protection statuses: Lake Yaitskoe (53 degrees 10'85 '' N,50 degrees 17'46 '' E), the regional natural monument; Lake Gatnoe (53 degrees 14'93 '' N, 50 degrees 11'83 '' E), Samara region natural heritage site; and Lake Bolshoe Vasilievskoe (53 degrees 54'40 '' N, 49 degrees 5324 '' E), the suburban lake located in the transition zone of the Middle Volga complex biosphere reserve (See Table 1). We collected samples for phytoplankton study and basic physical and chemical measurements in the growing season from 2013 to 2014 (See Table 2). We sampled the algae with a Ruffner bathometer. The material was fixed with 40% formalin solution. The cell count was carried out in the chamber "Uchinskaya" (Russia) with a volume of 0.01 ml. This chamber is a glass plate with low sides, the bottom of which is equipped with a special counting grid, optimized for counting plankton. Organisms are counted twice in 20 bands. Species identification of algae and counting of their cells were carried out on the microscope "BIOLAR PI" (limited liability company "Biolar", Poland) with an increase of 600 times. To determine the species of algae, we used reference guides from the series "Determinants of freshwater algae of the USSR" and "Susswasserflora von Mitteleuropa". The classification of Reynolds and co-authors was used to differentiate phytoplankton into functional groups. S-1-type (planktotrichete type) consisted of filamentous non-heterocyst forms of cyanoprokaryotes that previously belonged to genus Oscillatoria, M-type contained representatives of genus Microcystis, H-1-type contained representatives of genera Anabaena and Aphanizomenon. The similarity of the algae species composition of lakes was estimated with the Sorensen coefficient (Ks). The level of cenotic diversity and the degree of community alignment were assessed using Shannon (H) and Pielu (E) indices, respectively, taking into account the standard deviation. The dominant species were those whose number and biomass was 10% or more of the total value. The Simpson dominance index (S) was used to estimate the degree of dominance of individual species. Assessment of saprobity of waters was carried out by the method of Pantie and Bucc in the modification of Sladechek, using known indicator values of saprobity of individual species.
   The general state of ecosystems of the studied lakes was analyzed on the basis of the qualitative composition and quantitative development of phytoplankton from 2013 to 2014. In all lakes, the species richness of phytoplankton was quite high and contributed mainly by chlorophytes, diatoms and cyanoprokaryota species (See Table 3 and Fig. 1). Floristic analysis revealed signs of imbalance in lake ecosystems, probably caused by anthropogenic impact and/or lack of biogenic limitation (See Table 4). This situation is especially unfavorable for ecosystems of water bodies of protected nature areas. Ecological and geographical analysis did not reveal significant differences between the algal flora of the studied reservoirs (See Table 5). The level of similarity of the species composition of the studied reservoirs was quite high (See Table 6). Perhaps this was due not only to similar abiotic parameters of the environment, but also to a high level of identical anthropogenic load. Quantitative phytoplankton development was high in all water bodies, the highest one was observed in Lake Bolshoe Vasilievskoe, and the lowest in lake Gatnoe (See Fig. 3). According to average algal biomass over the study period, Lake Bolshoe Vasilievskoe corresponds to the hypertrophic state, while lakes Gatnoe and Yaitskoe are eutrophic. Phytoplankton species diversity and alignment were highest in lake Gatnoe, and smallest in lake Yaitskoe. According to saprobity, the studied water bodies were beta-mezosaprobic which corresponds to the water quality class III. Analysis of the floristic composition, the ratio of taxonomic ranks, indicators of quantitative development and the structure of the dominant species complex revealed signs of an imbalance in ecosystems and the development of "oscillatory" disease in all studied lakes, regardless of their conservation status due to anthropogenic impact and lack of biogenic restriction.

AB  - The first step to develop an environmentally sound weed management is to know how weed communities respond to environmental drivers. Among these, climate and management practices are probably the more determinant factors for annual plants community assembly. In this framework, a trait based approach may be useful to assess weed community responses and the processes behind them. Here, we focused on three non-inversion tillage practices which differently affect soil conditions and the vertical distribution of weed seeds. We also took into account the climate variability across years. We specifically asked whether the type of non-inversion tillage system and the annual variability in climatic conditions explain the differences in the functional structure of weed communities. To assess this question we conducted a nine yearlong field experiment in which three non-inversion tillage systems were compared: subsoil tillage, minimum tillage and no-tillage. We characterized the functional structure of weed communities by first obtaining data on three resource acquisition traits (specific leaf area, plant height and growth habit) and five regenerative traits (seed weight, longevity index, dispersal structures, seed cover and emergence time). Then, we computed the community weighted mean (CWM) and the mean pairwise distance (MPD) of each trait as well as a multi trait MPD index. Climate annual conditions were characterized based on autumn-winter precipitation, average temperature and number of frost days. We found that tillage systems and climatic factors mainly sorted weed species according to their emergence time and seed weight. Weed communities from no-tillage plots were characterized by having an earlier emergence and seeds without pericarp. Regarding climatic conditions, we found that warmer and rainier autumn-winter conditions were related to lower functional diversity of regenerative traits and higher diversity in terms of resource acquisition traits. Our results highlight that factors affecting seedling emergence as well as traits related to these processes are critical during weed community assemblage. Our results also showed that none of the compared tillage systems was clearly outstanding in terms of functional diversity, but that each system benefited certain functional design. Furthermore, the relative importance of these management practices to drive weed functional structure was clearly lower than the effects of climatic inter-annual fluctuations.

AB  - Numerous models and indices exist that attempt to characterize the effect of environmental factors on the comfort of animals and humans. Heat and cold indices have been utilized to adjust ambient temperature (Ta) for the effects of relative humidity (RH) or wind speed (WS) or both for the purposes of obtaining a "feels-like" or apparent temperature. However, no model has been found that incorporates adjustments for RH, WS, and radiation (RAD) over conditions that encompass hot and cold environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to develop a comprehensive climate index (CCI) that has application under a wide range of environmental conditions and provides an adjustment to Ta for RH, WS, and RAD. Environmental data were compiled from 9 separate summer periods in which heat stress events occurred and from 6 different winter periods to develop and validate the CCI. The RH adjustment is derived from an exponential relationship between Ta and RH with temperature being adjusted up or down from an RH value of 30%. At 45 degrees C, the temperature adjustment for increasing RH from 30 to 100% equals approximately 16 degrees C, whereas at -30 degrees C temperature adjustments due to increasing RH from 30 to 100% equal approximately -3.0 degrees C, with greater RH values contributing to a reduced apparent temperature under cold conditions. The relationship between WS and temperature adjustments was also determined to be exponential with a logarithmic adjustment to define appropriate declines in apparent temperature as WS increases. With this index, slower WS results in the greatest change in apparent temperature per unit of WS regardless of whether hot or cold conditions exist. As WS increases, the change in apparent temperature per unit of WS becomes less. Based on existing windchill and heat indices, the effect of WS on apparent temperature is sufficiently similar to allow one equation to be utilized under hot and cold conditions. The RAD component was separated into direct solar radiation and ground surface radiation. Both of these were found to have a linear relationship with Ta. This index will be useful for further development of biological response functions, which are associated with energy exchange, and improving decision-making processes, which are weather-dependent. In addition, the defined thresholds can serve as management and environmental mitigation guidelines to protect and ensure animal comfort.

AB  - Seagrasses are indicators of ecosystem state because they are sensitive to variations in water composition and clarity resulting from watershed-level impacts. A simulation model designed to study Zostera marina (eelgrass) habitat dynamics in a variable littoral zone environment was used to address the potential ecological responses to eutrophication in lower Chesapeake Bay. The adjacent channel boundary environment is a source of dissolved and particulate materials to the littoral zone. In the simulations, concentrations of key water quality variables in the adjacent estuarine channel boundary were either halved or doubled relative to the base case to investigate light versus nitrogen effects. The role of the seagrass meadow in littoral zone carbon and nitrogen dynamics was evaluated when meadow size was changed in the model. Particulate and dissolved organic carbon accounted for 83% of the submarine light attenuation in the seagrass meadow In all model runs, the water column concentrations of chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were below the habitat criteria proposed as critical to seagrass survival. Eelgrass community production was carefully regulated by the interactive effects of light, nitrogen, and grazing on epiphyte growth. Increased eelgrass coverage in the littoral zone led to a simulated doubling of ecosystem primary production but reduced the fraction of production by planktonic and sediment microalgae. The simulation model presented here demonstrated the importance of material input from the channel in littoral zone biogeochemical dynamics. Submarine light regulated primary production more strongly than inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the model. External DIN concentrations influenced seagrass survival indirectly: enrichment stimulated growth of epiphytes and phytoplankton and promoted shading of the seagrass leaf. The model was based upon a unimpacted ecosystem and deteriorated water quality negatively influenced primary production greater than the increases triggered by improved conditions. Increased material loading to the littoral zone reduced submarine light availability, increased phytoplankton production, lowered ecosystem production, and reduced subtidal vegetated habitat. This simulation model of the estuarine littoral zone model combines hydrodynamics, biogeochemical sources and sinks, and living resources in order to better understand structure, function, and change in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding the integrated effect of external factors (e.g., human activities) and internal factors (e.g., hydrodynamics, sediment properties) on metal(loid) distributions is necessary for relevant decisionmakers to develop river basin management strategies. In attempts to understand the possible causes of the distribution of nine target metal(loid) s in riverbed sediments across Xijiang River basin in China, we grouped and portrayed the multiple metal(loid) distributions by calculating metal(loid)'s normalised-and-weighted average concentrations, and then canonical correlation analysis combined with a series of statistical operations, collectively called optimized CCA analysis, was applied to quantify the strength of relationship between multiple metal(loid) distribution and integrated effect of internal-external factors. Results showed that the target metal (loid) s can be divided into three groups according to their distribution patterns: Group A (including Zn, As, Cd, Sb and Pb), Group B (including Cr, Ni and Cu) and Group C (including Tl). Among them, metal(loid) s in Group A was significantly enriched in comparison with the reference values of Chinese sediments, and the wide-ranging accumulation of Cd and Sb in the whole study area needs paying great attention to. For those metals in natural states (e.g., metals in Group B), the affinity of sediment (e.g., Fe and Mn oxides) is responsible for their distributions. By contrast, when metal(loid) s (e.g., metal(loid) s in Group A and Group C) had obvious anthropogenic sources, the interferences of anthropogenic inputs (e.g., non-ferrous metal enterprises' waste-discharging activities) and the specific sedimentary characteristics (e.g. karst topography and low-energy hydrodynamic depositional conditions) in study area can weaken the correlation between the binding affinity of sediment and the contents of metal(loid) s. The optimized CCA analysis can be an alternative and advantageous statistical operation for determining the main types of causes of multiple metal(loid) distribution in the case of observations with relatively low case-per-variable ratios.

AB  - Parapotamal cut-off meanders from two different geological catchment regions of the Allier River, 117km apart (upstream - metamorphic-basalt and downstream - sedimentary), differ in their degrees of infill or depth. In each region, three cut-off meanders were examined; one in each region was impacted by gravel extraction (upstream deepening) and halieutic improvement (downstream deepening), whereas the others were left in their natural state having different silt accumulations either almost cut-off from the river or less silted-up and more open to the river. The sites were monitored for one year for physical and chemical characteristics. Diatom samples collected in summer 2009 were examined along with their associated biocenosis. The two catchments, differing in geology, land-use and water quality, sheltered different diatom communities. Physical and chemical differences were recorded between up- and downstream zones of each cut-off meander due to both the influence of the groundwater (buffering the water temperature among others) and the periodic inflow from the main channel (increased oxygen saturation concentration in downstream end of the cut-off meanders, except for the impacted upstream zone which contained a lot of macrophytes). In the upstream reach (except for one site), the connection with the groundwater from the surrounding catchment, which acts as a hydro-geological reservoir, might explain the highest mineralization and water hardness recorded mainly in the upstream zone of the cut-off meander, and the presence of Pseudostaurosira subsalina (Hustedt) Morales and Thalassiosira weissflogii (Grunow) Fryxell & Hasle. For the downstream reach, in addition to up- and downstream differences, other factors came into play giving rise to different communities, for example, cattle trampling in the cut-off meander leading to the presence of hypereutrophic and polysaprobic taxa or the potential local re-emergence of mineral springs associated with brackish taxa. Moreover, the up- or downstream deepening also induced differences: the extraction of sediment nearer to the river created a system in which water input from the main channel flows in through a larger opening, inducing allochthonous processes. This increased the river's influence, creating a renewal of earlier morphological and ecological conditions, whereas the gravel extraction that modified the upstream zone increased the influence of groundwater from the surrounding catchment on this area of the site and led to water conditions independent of the main channel. Furthermore, this study has provided an important picture of the environmental variables, mechanisms and processes that drive the distribution of diatoms within the cut-off meanders along the Allier River, which can can be applied in future paleo-environmental studies.

AB  - The analysis of the existing system of surface water monitoring in Russia is carried out. The methodological and practical problems that arise when monitoring the surface water bodies of the country are identified. It is noted that in order to improve the monitoring system of water bodies in Russia, first of all, it is necessary to update existing monitoring programs, more widely use modern equipment, methods of remote sensing of the Earth and information technologies. The list of indicators to be assessed when monitoring water bodies should be compiled in accordance with the environmental characteristics and the nature of the use of the water body, taking into account new types of pollutants entering water ecosystems, the transformation of substances in the reservoir, the probability of secondary water pollution by biogenic elements and toxic substances as a result of diffusion from pore solutions of bottom sediments. The current issue is the regulation of the impact of various substances on the state of aquatic ecosystems. Possible solutions to this issue are the development of regional standards for assessing the state of water bodies, the transition from a hazard-based approach to a risk-based approach to normalizing the impact on water bodies.

AB  - India is the leading country with respect to area and production of pulse crop pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.). However, the productivity of this crop is too low and almost static for the last five decades due to cultivation of long-duration cultivars that are prone to climatic variations causing temporary water logging, drought and frost. Proper selection of the cultivar and use of appropriate crop establishment may help in enhancing productivity. Therefore, a field investigation was carried out for 3 consecutive years to determine the impact of establishment techniques on cultivars of two maturity durations-long (250-280 days; cv. JA-4) and short (130-145 days; cv. ICPL-88039), grown using the conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT), zero tillage (ZT) and broad bed furrow (BBF). The BBF method significantly improved the growth, biological yield, harvest index ratio, water productivity and physicochemical properties compared to the CT, MT and ZT. The yield of pigeon pea seed and stalk under the BBF increased 9.9 and 4.1% compared to the CT. The short-duration cultivar produced higher yield (16.8%) in frost-affected year (2012-2013) but was at par with the long-duration cultivar during the normal climatic condition year (2013-2015). Overall, the short-duration cultivar produced significantly higher yield. Land use efficiency and total water use were significantly higher for the long-duration cultivar a compared to the short-duration cultivar, whereas production efficiency and water productivity were higher for the short-duration cultivar. Compared to the other tillage practices, BBF showed significantly higher organic carbon and infiltration rate but decreased pH. The trend of infiltration rate was in the order BBF > ZT > MT > CT. The bulk density of surface (0-15 cm) and sub-surface (15-30 cm) layers were significantly lower under the BBF compared to the other tillage practices. Maximum increment of available N, P, K and S in surface soil (0-15 cm) was recorded under the BBF. For the short-duration maturity cultivar of pigeon pea the BBF method appeared beneficial in terms of assured higher yield, improved water productivity and physicochemical properties of soil under variable climatic conditions in Central India.

AB  - One-quarter of forest areas worldwide are managed for forestry purposes. Depending upon the type of practice and intensity of management, forestry may alter forests to various degrees and raise sustainability issues. To mitigate the alteration of natural forests by forestry and to promote sustainability, ecosystem management has been implemented widely over the past quarter century. A need remains for the development of comprehensive and operational assessment approaches to validate its effectiveness. Naturalness assessment could be used to validate effectiveness of ecosystem management since this concept relates to the degree to which a natural state has been altered. We developed an approach that integrates stand- and landscape- scale traits of naturalness into a single comprehensive assessment that can be performed using only forestry maps. To illustrate our approach, we assessed naturalness in four managed forest landscapes (2184 km(2)), representing a management gradient of increasing intensity from passive restoration to plantation forestry. We defined four naturalness classes, i.e., natural, semi-natural, altered and artificial. Assessment was performed in two steps. At step one, we attributed a class to each managed stand by comparing its current composition with natural stand compositions of its potential natural vegetation. At the landscape scale, certain developmental stages or forest types could be in excess in managed forest landscapes compared with natural forest landscapes. At step two, we transferred numbers of stages or types in excess from the natural class to more altered classes. We demonstrated that naturalness decreased as management intensity increased. Passive restoration and extensive management generated a landscape where semi-natural forests predominated in mixtures with a lower abundance of natural forests. Intensive management generated a largely semi-natural forest landscape. Plantation forestry generated a landscape where semi-natural and altered forests predominated. In conclusion, it should now be possible to validate the effectiveness of different practices and intensity of ecosystem management in promoting sustainability, by performing our assessment approach periodically following every update of forestry maps. Our approach could also allow for more comprehensive assessment of forest management strategies developed to mitigate global change by putting into better perspective their potential effects upon forest alteration of various forestry practices that have been implemented to sequester carbon.

AB  - We studied the chemical water quality, physical habitat and biotic integrity of an urban stream subjected to restoration measures in South Korea. We used the water pollution index (WPI), qualitative habitat evaluation index (QHEI) and index of biotic integrity (IBI) on the water quality, physical habitat and fish assemblage data respectively, during 2007-2016 in Gap Stream to evaluate the ecological health before and after restoration measures. The results revealed annual mean total phosphorus (TP) dramatically decreased by 13-fold for 10 years and the values of biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) also decreased by >50% over the time, indicating decrease in nutrient enrichment and organic matter pollution after restoration measures. In the meantime, biological health analyses using IBI indicated no major transformation in fish assemblages under restoration impact. However, the proportion of sensitive species increased, and tolerant species decreased after restoration. Gap stream is home to 50 distinct fish species. QHEI proposed that the physical habitat health was in good' condition during the study period. WPI showed the chemical water quality status remained poor' during and before restoration but improved to fair-good' condition in the ensuing years after restoration. The IBI results, however, indicated very poor-poor' biotic integrity irrespective of restoration measures. CHL-a and TP showed strong (r < 0.7) to moderately strong (r = 0.5-0.7) correlation with significantly important water quality factors. Spatially significant pattern change in TN and TP was obvious as measured levels were significantly higher (p < 0.01) in downstream than upstream. Principal component analysis successfully indicated the placement of water quality factors and indices used as in three distinct stream compartments. The higher pollutant levels in the downstream mainly linked to the nutrient-rich effluents from emerging from the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and industrial complexes operative in the stream catchment. Overall, restoration measures indicated minor impact on fish assemblages and physical habitat due to slow and steady improvement, however, water quality improved due to a decline of nutrients and chemicals downstream. This indicated a positive tendency of improvements in physical habitat and richness of fish assemblages in Gap Stream.

AB  - Water Framework Directive requires that the EU member states must develop ecological assessment methods for all biological quality elements in order to ensure the good ecological status of surface waters by 2015 or 2027, the latest. The elaborated assessment methods should be comparable between countries sharing the same water bodies; therefore geographical intercalibration (GIG) is necessary. In this paper, the assessment method elaborated for benthic invertebrate fauna from coastal water bodies commonly with Bulgaria was tested on available data for marine transitional waters. The dataset include data of benthic invertebrate fauna collected in the period 2006-2014 on four transects situated between Sulina (Danube mouths) and Portita from mobile fine sediments (fine sand and mud) in shallow waters (5-20 m depths). For comparison with recent data, additional data from 1986 and 1987 was considered. In the marine transitional water body, the main pressure addressed is represented by Danube inflow. Therefore, a number of parameters (BOD5, suspended solids in water column, and contaminants heavy metals, TPH, PAH and pesticides) were analysed in relation with selected multivariate index, M-AMBI*(n). Based on correlation results, a reference site for transitional water body was established. Reference conditions were derived for benthic invertebrate fauna in transitional marine waters, for boundary setting procedure using the percentile 0.05 for AMBI and 0.95 for the other indices: M-AMBI*(n), H (Shannon diversity index), and S (species richness).

AB  - The Journal of Experimental Biology Female blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) in their pubertal moult stage release unidentified sex pheromone molecules in their urine, causing males to respond with courtship behaviours including a display called courtship stationary paddling and a form of precopulatory guarding called cradle carry. We hypothesized that pheromones are mixtures of molecules and are more concentrated in urine of pubertal premoult females compared with other moulting stages and thus that these molecules are biomarkers (i.e. metabolites that can be used as an indicator of some biological state or condition) of pubertal premoult females. We tested this hypothesis by combining bioassay-guided fractionation and biomarker targeting. To evaluate the molecular mass of the putative pheromone by bioassay-guided fractionation, we separated urine from pubertal premoult females and intermoult males by ultrafiltration into three molecular mass fractions. The <500 Da fraction and the 500-1000 Da fraction but not the >1000 Da fraction of female urine induced male courtship stationary paddling, but none of the fractions of male urine did. Thus, female urine contains molecules of <1000 Da that stimulate courtship behaviours in males. Biomarker targeting using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral analysis of the 500-1000 Da fraction of urine from premoult and postmoult males and females revealed a premoult biomarker. Purification, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of this premoult biomarker identified it as N-acetylglucosamino-1,5-lactone (NAGL) and showed that it is more abundant in urine of premoult females and males than in urine of either postmoult or juvenile females and males. NAGL has not been reported before as a natural product or as a molecule of the chitin metabolic pathway. Physiological and behavioural experiments demonstrated that blue crabs can detect NAGL through their olfactory pathway. Thus, we hypothesize that NAGL is a component of the sex pheromone and that it acts in conjunction with other yet unidentified components.

AB  - The alteration of natural tree species composition is defined as the deviation of the current tree species composition from that of the natural state. It can be used as a measure of human influence on forest vegetation, and thus as an indicator of the naturalness of forest vegetation. The aim of the study was to develop a standard procedure for estimating the alteration of natural tree species composition, to explain factors driving alteration and to examine its significance for susceptibility of forest stands to natural disturbances. The alteration of natural tree species composition was estimated for the Dinaric region (5556 km(2), Slovenia) by the Robic Index of Dissimilarity (RID), ranging from 0 (completely natural) to 100 (completely altered). The index was calculated on the compartment level (24 ha each on average) with data on current and potential natural forest vegetation. The influence of human activities on tree species alteration was examined by using topographic and accessibility variables. The susceptibility of forest stands to natural disturbances was analysed with data on sanitary felling. In the study area, the natural tree species composition of forest stands is moderately preserved; the average value of RID was 50.05, ranging from 1.76 to 100, and the coefficient of variation was 0.49. The alteration of the natural tree species composition of forest stands is primarily the result of forest management and past land use, conditioned either by topography or accessibility of forests. The degree of alteration of tree species composition decreased along the gradients of rockiness, inclination and elevation. A greater degree of alteration appeared on the slopes of intermediate and south facing aspects than on north facing slopes, and in areas that were closer to the forest edge. A higher level of alteration significantly increases the susceptibility of forest stands to natural disturbances. The procedure represents a novel approach in modelling the alteration (naturalness) of tree species composition of forest vegetation. It is applicable at different spatial scales and fosters an understanding of the patterns of tree species composition under the influence of human activity across forest landscapes.

AB  - Earthworms are known to bio-degrade various types of organic materials added or already present in soil. Two soils were collected from different land use patterns viz. an agricultural land (AL) and an undisturbed land (UL) of a mountain ecosystem of State of Himachal Pradesh in India for the present investigation. A laboratory microcosm study was carried out to elucidate effects of various agricultural soil amendments, viz. wood ash (WA), rice husk (RH), cow dung (CW) and their mixture (MA) applied @25 t ha(-1), on selective biological and chemical properties of earthworm (Eisenia fetida) casts and growth in the collected soils. Subsequently, earthworms were reared in soils from both AL & UL, treated with the amendments; and the resultant earthworm cast (EwC) properties were found to be largely determined by the nature of amendments rather than land use types. Soils treated with MA produced casts displayed higher nutrient content, microbial biomass C with higher activities of dehydrogenase and urease. Earthworm growth and cast formation were greater in the soil from UL over soil from AL for all treatments except WA, implying better acclimatization and earthworm activity in the former. Further, casts produced under UL had higher nutrient mobilization and enzyme activity in comparison to AL. Results suggested that agricultural intervention in an undisturbed land might weaken its ability to support growth, development in conjunction with the activities of earthworms and associated enzymes.

AB  - A study was undertaken to improve upon the prognosticative capability of Environment and Climate Change Canada's (ECCC) UV Index forecast model. An aspect of that work, and the topic of this communication, was to investigate the use of the four UV broadband surface irradiance fields generated by ECCC's Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) numerical prediction model to determine the UV Index.
   The basis of the investigation involves the creation of a suite of routines which employ high-spectral-resolution radiative transfer code developed to calculate UV Index fields from GEM forecasts. These routines employ a modified version of the Cloud-J v7.4 radiative transfer model, which integrates GEM output to produce high-spectral-resolution surface irradiance fields. The output generated using the high-resolution radiative transfer code served to verify and calibrate GEM broadband surface irradiances under clear-sky conditions and their use in providing the UV Index. A subsequent comparison of irradiances and UV Index under cloudy conditions was also performed.
   Linear correlation agreement of surface irradiances from the two models for each of the two higher UV bands covering 310.70-330.0 and 330.03-400.00 nm is typically greater than 95% for clear-sky conditions with associated root-mean-square relative errors of 6.4 and 4.0 %. However, underestimations of clear-sky GEM irradiances were found on the order of similar to 30-50% for the 294.12-310.70 nm band and by a factor of similar to 30 for the 280.11-294.12 nm band. This underestimation can be significant for UV Index determination but would not impact weather forecasting. Corresponding empirical adjustments were applied to the broadband irradiances now giving a correlation coefficient of unity. From these, a least-squares fitting was derived for the calculation of the UV Index. The resultant differences in UV indices from the high-spectral-resolution irradiances and the resultant GEM broadband irradiances are typically within 0.20.3 with a root-mean-square relative error in the scatter of similar to 6.6% for clear-sky conditions. Similar results are reproduced under cloudy conditions with light to moderate clouds, with a relative error comparable to the clear-sky counterpart; under strong attenuation due to clouds, a substantial increase in the root-mean-square relative error of up to 35% is observed due to differing cloud radiative transfer models.

AB  - The article focuses on assessing the global competitiveness of countries in the context of their environmental regulatory stringency. The article analyzes the views of scientists on the need to slow down economic growth and transition to stable economy, the relationship between economic growth and environmental changes in the form of environmental Kuznets curve, as well as environmental policy instruments along with the degree of their stringency. The authors put forward and confirm the hypothesis that the quality of institutions and the value assessment of environmental goods directly affect the competitiveness of national economies, regardless of environmental stringency. A comprehensive statistical analysis of the perennial indices of global competitiveness, environmental performance and stringency of environmental regulations on a large sample of countries confirms the hypothesis that significant stringency of environmental regulations in welfare states can be internalized and that their global competitiveness remains high against the background of high-quality environmental goods.

AB  - The article considers the conditions for the reproduction of fish in the waters of the Volgograd reservoir of the villages Akhmat and Zolotoe, such as level and temperature regimes, as well as production processes (the rate of gross photosynthesis, the rate of respiration of the plankton community, net primary production, which can serve as indicators of the state of the natural food base). According to the results of the fry survey in 2020, the conditions for the fish reproduction in the waters of the Volgograd reservoir of villages Akhmat and Zolotoe should be recognized as very unfavorable, which could be predicted by the dynamics of the level and temperature regimes. Black Sea sprat (Clupeonella cultriventris (Nordmann, 1840)), as in previous years, is reproduced in the water area of the village of Zolotoe and is not reproduced in the water area of the village of Akhmat. The high food capacity of the studied water areas has a noticeable effect on the efficiency of reproduction of certain fish species in years with a more favorable level regime but is not able to compensate for the damage caused to the reproduction of fish by a particularly unfavorable regime of the water level in general.

AB  - Biodiversity in managed plantations has become an important issue for long-term sustainability of ecosystems. The environmental effects of plantations comprised of fast-growing introduced trees have been vigorously debated. On one hand, monocultures have been said to exhaust resources, resulting in decreased biodiversity. Conversely, it has been stated that monocultures may favor regeneration of undergrowth plants from surrounding forests, increasing biodiversity. In order to clarify the effects of planting Eucalyptus trees on species composition, diversity, and functional type of understory vegetation in Yunnan province, a field trial was implemented to compare Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) with two other local current vegetation types (secondary evergreen forests (SEs), and abandoned farmlands (AFs)). Each vegetation type was sampled in each of three elevational ranges (low = 1,000-1,400 meters above sea level (masl), medium = 1,400-1,800 masl, and high = 1,800-2,200 masl). Sample sites within each elevational range had similar environmental characteristics (slope, aspect, etc.). Thus, we sampled three vegetation types at each of three sites at each of three elevations for a total of 27 plots. We calculated relative abundance and importance value of species and diversity indexes to evaluate differences among local current vegetation types and elevational ranges, employing multivariate ordination analyses and other methods such as Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) and Indicator Species Analysis. We found that fast growing introduced Eucalyptus plantations led to reduced plant diversity in the study area, and that rare or threatened species were recorded almost exclusively in the SE plots, being essentially absent from the EP and AF plots. The understory plant diversity did not correlate with the altitude gradient significantly. Eucalyptus plantations (EPs) have a simpler community structure than that of either secondary evergreen forests (SEs; similar to natural state) or abandoned farmlands (AFs). No variable significantly explained variation of the understory shrub layer, but soil moisture-holding capacity and overstory coverage were significant in explaining variation of the understory herb layer, suggesting that the study of soil physical properties is necessary for better understanding of their importance in Eucalyptus plantations and other local current vegetation types.

AB  - The coastal zone is subject to many and varied changes resulting from human activities and natural processes. Existing or emerging agreements and legislation acknowledge the relevance of indicators for monitoring these. In the UK, following a series of recent workshops, potential indicators of nearshore disturbance have been identified and grouped into three broad indices: 'Coastline Morphological Change', 'Resource Use Change' and 'Environmental Quality and its Perception'. The present study developed these indicators further and tested their use by applying them to 18 sections in the Humber Estuary, Eastern England. The results obtained reflect the current knowledge of the state of the Humber environment and show the potential of integrative indicators but indicate that further studies are required to assess the relative importance of the indicators and their value in reflecting the ability of the ecosystems to sustain natural habitats and populations at a good conservation status.

AB  - This study investigated differences in learning styles and personality types among engineering students, agricultural systems management students, and faculty in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Pennsylvania State University. Learning styles and personality types were evaluated using the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), respectively. Mean values for the GEFT for all three groups indicated a strong preference for the field-independent learning style. There were no significant differences in MBTI type preferences between engineering students and faculty. However, the agricultural systems management students differed significantly (p < 0.05) from faculty in their preference for Perceiving and from engineering students in their preference for Sensing. Results of the study are useful in helping faculty better understand and improve the teaching and learning process involving the two groups of students.

AB  - Question Is valuable information lost when plant trait group composition is used, rather than species composition, to describe plant community response to range management? Location Elkhead Watershed, Colorado, US. Methods Current model-building efforts use species composition to define changes in ecosystem state, but plant traits may offer a faster and more broadly applicable alternative. We (1) compare states defined by species composition to those defined by trait-based groups of differing complexity and (2) determine how management and environmental site characteristics relate to species- and trait group-defined states. We sampled 72 plots with different grazing and chemical shrub treatment histories on two soil types. We measured plant species composition in each plot and categorized species into trait groups using three classification schemes, which represented increasing numbers of traits and levels of classification complexity. The classifications employed easily measured traits that affect plant response to range management: life form, life history, resprouting ability, height, vegetative reproduction and N-fixation. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified states with similar species or trait group composition. We explored relationships between each set of potential states and management history and environmental factors using logistic regression. Results Trait-based group composition and species composition identified many of the same potential states and responses to grazing and chemical shrub treatment. Relationships between species and trait group composition and management and environmental characteristics differed on the two soil types. Species composition was sensitive to more different management practices, on average, than trait group composition. Trait group composition revealed some relationships to management and environmental drivers that were not detected using species composition. Conclusion This study confirms that species composition is a more sensitive indicator of sagebrush steppe response to range management, and some information is lost with a trait-based approach. However, traits also add to depth of understanding by revealing additional community patterns related to different drivers. Using the most complex trait grouping scheme that is feasible in a particular study, and also looking for patterns based on simpler trait groups, will provide the most complete understanding of sagebrush steppe response to range management.

AB  - The cumulative effects of increasing human use of the ocean and coastal zone have contributed to a rapid decline in ocean and coastal resources. As a result, scientists are investigating how multiple, overlapping stressors accumulate in the environment and impact ecosystems. These investigations are the foundation for the development of new tools that account for and predict cumulative effects in order to more adequately prevent or mitigate negative effects. Despite scientific advances, legal requirements, and management guidance, those who conduct assessments including resource managers, agency staff, and consultants continue to struggle to thoroughly evaluate cumulative effects, particularly as part of the environmental assessment process. Even though 45 years have passed since the United States National Environmental Policy Act was enacted, which set a precedent for environmental assessment around the world, defining impacts, baseline, scale, and significance are still major challenges associated with assessing cumulative effects. In addition, we know little about how practitioners tackle these challenges or how assessment aligns with current scientific recommendations. To shed more light on these challenges and gaps, we-undertook a comparative study on how cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is conducted by practitioners operating under some of the most well-developed environmental laws around the globe: California, USA; British Columbia, Canada; Queensland, Australia; and New Zealand. We found that practitioners used a broad and varied, definition of impact for CEA, which led to differences in how baseline, scale, and significance were determined. We also found that practice and science are not closely aligned and, as such, we highlight opportunities for managers, policy makers, practitioners, and scientists to improve environmental assessment.

AB  - We compared different methods for generating indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) for Great Lakes coastal wetlands using bird community data collected by participants in Bird Studies Canada's Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program (GLMMP) including: rank sum and multivariate approaches for defining landscape disturbance gradients; and generalist-specialist (IBI-1), multimetric (IBI-2), and probabilistic (IBI-3) approaches for calculating IBIs. Scores from the multivariate disturbance gradient, IBI-1, and IBI-3 increased rapidly at the impaired and unimpaired ends of the impaired-to-unimpaired spectrum, whereas scores from the rank sum disturbance gradient and IBI-2 increased rapidly only at the unimpaired end. IBIs with metrics that both increased and decreased along the landscape disturbance gradient were more sensitive for identifying especially impaired and unimpaired sites (i.e., IBI-1 and IBI-3) compared to IBIs with metrics that only increased (i.e., IBI-2). Scores from all but one of the IBIs were significantly correlated with scores of at least one of the landscape disturbance gradients and scores from all three of the IBIs were significantly moderately correlated with each other (r(s) = 0.3-0.7). Site ranks arranged from impaired to unimpaired differed by 25-50 positions out of 142 possible positions depending on the pair of IBIs chosen. Much of the variation that we observed could be explained by differences among IBIs in the metrics that contributed most to impaired and unimpaired sites. Thus, we recommend the following not only for IBI users assessing the integrity of Great Lakes coastal wetlands, but also any other ecosystem where multiple landscape disturbance gradients and IBIs are available for use: (1) use multivariate instead of rank sum approaches for defining landscape disturbance gradients; (2) use IBIs with metrics that both increase and decrease along the landscape disturbance gradient instead of IBIs with metrics that only increase or only decrease; and (3) ensure that site-level species lists are reasonably complete, particularly for species that disproportionately contribute to especially impaired and unimpaired scores. Following these guidelines will increase the sensitivity and accuracy of IBIs for identifying especially impaired and unimpaired sites and ultimately result in better conservation.

AB  - The rapid decline in the extent and health of coastal salt marshes has created a need for nondestructive methods for evaluating the condition of salt marsh ecosystems. This paper describes simultaneous uses of held sampling and remote sensing approaches to understand salt marsh ecosystem functions and species distributions and discusses the implications for salt marsh monitoring using remote sensing. Three sites along the Petaluma River near the entrance into San Pablo Bay, California, which represented a range of soil salinity, water content, and nutrients, were studied. Standing biomass was directly assessed by field sampling and indirectly estimated through canopy reflectance. The sites were dominated by almost monotypic stands of Salicornia virginica, Spartina foliosa, and Scirpus robustus. For Salicornia, we found a positive relationship between salinity and biomass up to a threshold of 42 g/kg, after which biomass declined monotonically with increasing salinity. No Scirpus or Spartina were found at soil salinities >20 g/kg. Although significantly different levels of nitrate and ammonium nitrogen were found in the interstitial water and soils at these sites, no strong relationships were found between biomass and nitrate nitrogen. Soil ammonium nitrogen, in contrast, was positively related to biomass. Soil redox and salinity increased with elevation and distance from the shoreline, while soil moisture and H2S decreased. Canopy biomass was estimable using remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices at 58-80% accuracy depending on. species. Simple Vegetation Index (VI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) measured by handheld field spectrometers were the best estimators of green biomass for high cover of Salicornia. Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Soil Adjusted and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (SARVI) gave the best estimates for Spartina while the Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI) was the best estimate for Scirpus. The relationships between vegetation indices and biomass were developed from field spectra. The VI was used to estimate spatial patterns of biomass across the salt marsh from Landsat satellite Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The TM image showed spatial patterns corresponding with species zones and biomass abundance. Narrow band reflectance features measured with a handheld spectrometer can be used to predict canopy plant water content (R-2 = 63%). Interpolated estimates of water content from field-measured canopy reflectance were shown to relate to variation in salinity and soil moisture. Canopy water content was estimated from Airborne Advanced Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer data, which showed similar spatial patterns at the site. Results indicate that both biomass production and canopy water content can be accurately determined from remotely sensed spectral measures. Species-specific differences in these characteristics may be used for monitoring species distribution and abundance from airborne or satellite images.

AB  - The Permanent Preservation Areas (APP), established by the Forest Code in 1965, depict an integrating element of the landscape as defined by the National Plan of Protected Areas. However, the Native Vegetation Protection Law, approved in 2012, has produced several changes in the parameters for the delimitation of APP, especially in those that define APPs on hilltops. As a result, to recover part of the lost area, in 2014, the State Environmental Institute of Rio de Janeiro (INEA) published the Resolution 93, which established its own methodology of delimitation for the state. The goal of this study is to analyze the spatial distribution of the hilltop APP through mapping and calculating landscape metrics, based on legal provisions applied in four areas with different geomorphological units that represent most of the Rio de Janeiro's relief, considering the Forest Code of 1965, the Native Vegetation Protection Law of 2012, and the INEA Resolution of 2014. APP mapping was done by spatial digital automatic mode and the use of a Digital Terrain Model at 1:25.000 scale. The results showed that the changes in the parameters that delimit the APP on hilltops resulted in a significant reduction of area (up to 85%) and number patches (up to 95%), as well as the increase of the average distance (from 135 m to > 800 m) between hilltop APP patches. It was observed that the distribution of APP is preserved in all geomorphological units mapped with the Forest Code of 1965, while in the other legal scenarios the indicators are worse, as the relief becomes less rugged. Thus, it can be concluded that the Native Vegetation Protection Law of 2012 leads to a fragmented landscape with the close extinction of the hilltop APP. The scenario is mitigated by Resolution 93, that preserves part of the APP only in the rugged relief, while the Forest Code of 1965 has the best indicators that represent the extension, connectivity and the spatial arrangement in the studied geomorphologic units. In this way, the changes on legal provisions represent a scenario of greater fragmentation and smaller structural connectivity between the hilltops.

AB  - Questions In drylands above-ground net primary production (ANPP) and rain-use efficiency (RUE) are common ecological indicators for assessing ecosystem state, including degradation and supply of key ecosystem services. However, both indicators have been criticized as lumped parameters, since they aggregate complex information. Their value as ecological parameters in decision-making and their use in ecological modelling therefore have been challenged and their explanatory power remains unclear. Furthermore, there is no consensus about the response of ANPP and RUE along precipitation gradients. Methods Taking advantage of several long-term studies in (semi-)arid environments where ANPP and RUE were recorded, we compiled a data set of 923yr. We used meta-analysis to disentangle the effects of different ecological layers (climate, soil and land use) on ANPP and RUE. Linear piece-wise quantile regression (LPQR) was used to analyse the response of maximum and median ANPP and RUE as functions of precipitation. We assumed that looking at maximum response (instead of average response) stratified for land-use intensity was an ecologically more plausible way to understand ANPP constrained by precipitation and land use. Results We separated the impact of different environmental factors into distinct, quantitative effect sizes with the aid of meta-analyses. ANPP was affected by recent and previous precipitation, land use, soil and biome. LPQR revealed that both parameters displayed several sequential linear intersects, which together formed a unimodal trend, peaking around precipitation of 200mmyr-1. Unimodal response was more pronounced for maximum values (ANPPmax, RUEmax) than for median values. Peak ANPPmax and RUEmax, as well as post-peak decline (>200mmyr-1) were affected by land use: higher land-use intensity decreased intercepts and increases post-peak decline. Conclusions Our results have important consequences for the use of RUE as an ecosystem indicator and a tool in ecosystem monitoring and decision-making. Most importantly, grasslands, shrublands and savannas significantly differ in their primary production, with a biome-specific importance of precipitation, land use and previous year's precipitation. We thus propose to establish biome-specific reference values of maximum and average RUE. Our study also contributes to reconcile contradictory findings for ANPP and RUE response along precipitation gradients of varying length.

AB  - The relevance of the research consists in studying hydrochemical river discharge as one of the main indicators of the ecological state of water objects.
   The main aim of the research is to obtain new knowledge on hydrochemical discharge of the rivers at southern Khabarovsk region, which are required for objective assessment of the ecological status of the region and for carrying out effective water protection measures.
   Objects of the research are the Amur River and seven lesser streams: Bikin, Khor, Podkhorenok, Bira, Kiya, Malaya Chirka, 2-ya Sedmaya.
   Methods. Concentration of major anions (Cl-, SO42-) were analyzed by ion chromatography (Shimadzu LC-10A); major cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), trace elements and rare earth elements - with ICP-MS (Agilent, 7500c) method. The hydrocarbonate ion (HCO3-) concentration was taken as the total alkalinity. It was analyzed by direct titration by Bruyevich method. The total mineralization (Sigma i) is the sum of concentrations of major river water elements.
   Results. In July 2011 the Amur River and seven lesser streams (Bikin, Khor, Podkhorenok, Bira, Kiya, Malaya Chirka, 2-aya Sedmaya), located at southern part of Khabarovsk region, were sampled and analyzed for their major elements, trace elements and rare earth elements. During summer flood river waters are low-mineralizated, Si does not exceed 50 mg/l. Ca2+ is the predominant cation and HCO3- is the major counter-ion for cations in all samples. High concentrations of dissolved Al, Fe u Pb were found in the surface waters of all the rivers studied. In the Malaya Chirka River there are high concentrations of dissolved Co, Cu, Mn and extremely high Cd, exceeding the average global concentrations in 40 times. The concentration of the other trace elements in the studied rivers is in general corresponded to their average global concentrations and is a characteristic of the natural regional background during summer floods. A regional level of total concentrations of soluble forms of rare earth elements (1,44-5,44 mu g/l) was established. The distribution and level of rare earth elements concentrations in the studied river waters reflect the overall composition of the watershed rocks. The calculated total daily fluxes of major elements, trace elements and rare earth elements, supplied by the Bira, Kiya, Podhorenok, Bikin, Khor and Amur rivers, equal to 61894, 377 and 2,21 t/day, respectively.

AB  - Spatially well-informed decisions are essential to sustain and regulate processes and ecosystem services (ES), and to maintain the capacity of ecosystems to supply services. However, spatially explicit ES information is often lacking in decision-making, or exists only as ES maps based on categorical land cover data. Remote sensing (RS) opens new pathways to map ES, in particular biophysical ES supply. We developed an observation-based concept for spatially explicit and continuous ES mapping at landscape scale following the biophysical part of the ES cascade. We used Earth observations in combination with in situ data to map ecosystem properties, functions, and biophysical ES supply. We applied this concept in a case study to map two ES: carbon dioxide regulation and food supply. Based on Earth observations and in situ data, we determined the ecosystem property Sun-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) to indicate ecosystem state and applied scaling models to estimate gross primary production (GPP) as indicator for ecosystem functioning and consequently carbon dioxide regulation and food supply as ES.
   Resulting ES maps showed heterogeneous patterns in ES supply within and among ecosystems, which were particularly evident within forests and grasslands. All investigated land cover classes were sources of CO2, with averages ranging from -66 to -748 g C m(-2) yr(-1), after considering the harvest of total above ground biomass of crops and the storage organ, except for forest being a sink of CO2 with an average of 105 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Estimated annual GPP was related to food supply with a maize grain yield average of 9.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and a sugar beet root yield of 110 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Validation with in situ measurements from flux towers and literature values revealed a good performance of our approach for food supply (relative RMSE of less than 23%), but also some over- and underestimations for carbon dioxide regulation. Our approach demonstrated how RS can contribute to spatially explicit and continuous ES cascade mapping and suggest that this information could be useful for environmental assessments and decision-making in spatial planning and conservation.

AB  - The determination of parameters comprising exact depth to bedrock and its lithological type, lateral changes in lithology, and detection of fractures, cracks, or faults are essential to designing formidable foundations and assessing the integrity of civil engineering structures. In this study, soil and site characterization in a typical hard rock geologic terrain in southwestern Nigeria were carried out employing integrated geophysical and geotechnical techniques to address tragedies in civil engineering infrastructural development. The deployed geophysical measurements involved running both very low frequency electromagnetic (VLF-EM) and electrical resistivity methods (dipole-dipole imaging and vertical electrical sounding (VES) techniques) along the established traverses, while the latter technique entailed conducting geological laboratory sieve analysis and Atterberg limit-index tests upon the collected soil samples in the area. The results of the geophysical measurement, based on the interpreted VLF-EM and dipole-dipole data, revealed conductive zones and linear features interpreted as fractures/faults which endanger the foundations of public infrastructures. The delineation of four distinct geoelectric layers in the area-comprised of topsoil, lateritic/clayey substratum, weathered layer, and bedrock-were based on the VES results. Strong evidence, including high degree of decomposition and fracturing of underlying bedrock revealed by the VES results, confirmed the VLF-EM and dipole-dipole results. Furthermore, values in the range of 74.2%-77.8%, 55%-62.5%, 23.4%24.5%, 7.7%-8.2%, 19.5%-22.4%, and 31.65%-38.25% were obtained for these geotechnical parameters viz soil percentage passing 0.075 mm sieve size, liquid limit, plasticity index, linear shrinkage, natural moisture content, and plastic limit, respectively, resulting from the geotechnical analysis of the soil samples. The comparatively analyzed geophysical and geotechnical results revealed a high weathering of charnockitic rocks resulting in plastic clay material mapped with a mean resistivity value of 73 Ohm-m, in conformity with the obtained geotechnical parameters, which failed to agree with the standard specification of subsoil foundation materials and which, in turn, can impact negatively on the foundational integrity of infrastructures. Based on these results, the area subsoils' competence for foundation has been rated poor to low. This study has more widely demonstrated the effective application of integrative geophysical and geotechnical methods in the assessment of subsoil competence.

AB  - Anthropogenic soil erosion is a problem of global concern and recently has become the focus of extensive research. In spite of this, our knowledge about the history of land-use and its long-term impact on soil erosion and the local environment remains limited. This study seeks to address this issue by investigating sediments of lake Murten, Switzerland, using a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct the history of land-use and its impacts in the catchment. We analyzed pollen and charcoal to reconstruct past land-use and vegetation dynamics, and used the distributions of terrestrial leaf wax biomarkers, their delta C-13 isotopic composition and their soil retention time (compound-specific C-14) to evaluate long-term effects on past soil carbon dynamics.
   Arboreal pollen abundances, charcoal influx and cultural indicators match the archaeological evidence and reveal an eventful past around the lake. The first signs of human presence were detected around 5000 BCE, when Neolithic pile dwellers occupied the lake's shores. However, human land-use had no significant effect on the pollen and the sedimentary organic matter (OM) composition during Neolithic times and the Bronze Age. This changed during the late Iron Age and the Early Roman Period (ca. 70 BCE). Coincident with the rise of Aventicum, a Roman city, large-scale deforestation and agriculture began in the region. Severe soil degradation and outwash of soil organic carbon (SOC) at this time is documented by enhanced input of soil-derived and pre-aged leaf waxes, and resulted in cultural eutrophication ca. 2000 years ago. Soil erosion decreased after the fall of the Roman Empire and a short period of renaturation followed. Although the export of SOC returned to pre-Roman values after ca. 200 years, the forest never recovered to its past extent. The last two detected periods of land-use change correlate with the onset of Medieval agriculture (ca. 1000 CE) and the Industrial Period (ca. 1800 CE). Today, the mean transit time of leaf waxes is almost five times longer compared to the Roman Period, suggesting that substantial soil erosion has occurred and that an even longer time period would be necessary for the soil carbon dynamics to recover to their natural state.

AB  - Growth and yield can be decoupled in lentil whereby excessive vegetative growth leads to self-shading, reduced pod and seed set, low harvest index and higher risk of disease and lodging. We evaluated the degree of coupling between growth and yield in 20 lentil lines grown in eight environments varying in water and photothermal conditions returning a 10-fold yield range, from 21 to 221 g m- 2. Calibration curves between shoot biomass and canopy cover measured with NDVI and green canopy cover measured with Canopeo app were improved with canopy height as a multiplication factor returning a 3-D trait. Calibration curves were used to phenotype shoot biomass and calculate crop growth rate.
   For the pooled data, yield correlated non-linearly with crop growth rate, with an x-intercept of 0.09 g m- 2 [oCd]-1, suggesting a minimum plant size for reproduction, and an inflection point at 0.43 g m- 2 [oCd]-1. Yield correlated with biomass and crop growth rate in the more stressful conditions (yield < 107 g m-2) and was decoupled in higher yielding conditions (yield > 170 g m-2). Yield associated with harvest index at all yield levels, but more strongly in high-yielding conditions. Biomass and harvest index correlated in environments with yield < 107 g m- 2, and decoupled under more favourable conditions (yield > 170 g m-2). Yield associated with phenology under stress but not in favourable conditions. For the combination of lines and environments in this study, broad sense heritability was 0.96 for flowering time, 0.93 for harvest index, 0.89 for yield, 0.87 for crop growth rate and 0.39 for biomass. Selection for harvest index would improve yield across environments whereas selection for growth rate could further improve yield under stress. Agronomic practices to improve the coupling of yield and growth under favourable conditions need to be explored; for example, using precision seeding to reduce rectangularity of crop arrangement and favour penetration of radiation into the canopy and pod set.

AB  - In the diagnosis of stressful conditions in humans and other animals, ionic indicators remain practically unused. In this work, we studied the changes in the concentrations of sodium ions in the blood plasma of freshwater fish under stress caused by stressors of different quality and quantity. Most of the experiments were carried out on adult bream (Abramis brama L) from the Rybinsk Reservoir. Separate experiments were duplicated on adult individuals of roach (Rutilus rutilus L.), pike (Esox lucius L.), and blue bream (Abramis ballerus L.). The concentration of cations in the blood plasma was determined using a Flapho-4 flame photometer. Under the action of mild and short-term stressors of different qualities, the sodium concentration in the internal environment altered toward an increase in concentration gradients on the cell membrane (eustress or physiological stress). Hypernatremia was approximately 10%. Under the action of strong and/or prolonged stressors of different strength, the sodium concentration in the internal environment changed toward a decrease in concentration gradients on the cell membrane (distress or pathological stress). Hyponatremia was 50% in the conditions of acute lethal stress, 20% in subacute lethal stress, 10% or more in chronic lethal stress. During strong acute reversible stress, hyponatremia could reach 30%. Analysis of the material on mammals allowed us to conclude that the adaptation mechanisms in fish and higher vertebrates are similar. In this work, for the first time, the state of the system of electrolyte balance of animals under stress was analyzed from the standpoint of the leading role of ionic concentration gradients on the cell membrane (mainly sodium) in the energetics (level of disequilibrium) of the organism. We propose a concept that in normal and extreme conditions fish use two different defense reactions (or adaptation strategies): active and passive, consisting, respectively, in increasing or decreasing the level of disequilibrium (energy) in the organism. The hyponatremia recorded by numerous authors, which accompanies diseases in humans, is evidently a nonspecific reaction of the organism and serves as an indicator of reduced energy of the organism. It is suggested that the sodium level in the internal environment of the organism be used for diagnosing the stress state of animals.

AB  - Crop biomass information is of great importance for a variety of applications, ranging from supporting farm management decisions to modeling the crop-environment system. Dimensionless spectral vegetation index values derived from satellite imagery are commonly used to derive crop biomass. However, the highly empirical nature of spectrally derived biomass estimates requires frequent and costly calibration with manually collected ground data. Recently, low cost, autonomously operating terrestrial laser scanners (ATLSs) have become available for near-surface applications. In contrast to the dimensionless nature of spectral index values, autonomous light detection and ranging (lidar) technology measures physical vegetation structure by recording the x, y, z coordinates of canopy components at very high spatial (<10 cm), and temporal (<2 days) resolution. The objective of this study was to assess the suitability of an ATLS to i) monitor crop growth dynamics and ii) calibrate satellite imagery for estimating crop biomass. Wheat (Triticum aestivum spp.) growth was monitored by acquiring hypertemporal (every 28 h for a full growing season) ATLS data at three different field sites across a range of experimentally manipulated crop growth conditions. The ATLS-derived crop height explained nearly three-quarters of the variability in destructively sampled wheat biomass (r(2) = 0.74, RMSE = 514.20 kg ha(-1)), showing a slightly stronger correlation to crop biomass than did leaf area index (LAI) measurements collected in the field using a LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (r(2) = 0.71, RMSE = 546 kg ha(-1)). Satellite-based crop biomass estimates calibrated with ATLS data captured the variability in wheat biomass throughout a farm field with a biomass error of 730.96 and 727.60 kg ha(-1) (RMSE) during the jointing (Development stage: Zadoks 37) and heading (Development stage: Zadoks 50) growth stages, respectively. These findings suggest that the hypertemporal lidar information provided via ATLS technology could constitute a major step forward in operational monitoring and mapping of crop biomass.

AB  - Millions of people rely on the ecosystem services provided by coral reefs, but sustaining these benefits requires an understanding of how reefs and their biotic communities are affected by local human-induced disturbances and global climate change. Ecosystembased management that explicitly considers the indirect and cumulative effects of multiple disturbances has been recommended and adopted in policies in many places around the globe. Ecosystem models give insight into complex reef dynamics and their responses to multiple disturbances and are useful tools to support planning and implementation of ecosystem-based management. We adapted the Atlantis Ecosystem Model to incorporate key dynamics for a coral reef ecosystem around Guam in the tropical western Pacific. We used this model to quantify the effects of predicted climate and ocean changes and current levels of current land-based sources of pollution (LBSP) and fishing. We used the following six ecosystem metrics as indicators of ecosystem state, resilience and harvest potential: 1) ratio of calcifying to non-calcifying benthic groups, 2) trophic level of the community, 3) biomass of apex predators, 4) biomass of herbivorous fishes, 5) total biomass of living groups and 6) the end-to-start ratio of exploited fish groups. Simulation tests of the effects of each of the three drivers separately suggest that by mid-century climate change will have the largest overall effect on this suite of ecosystem metrics due to substantial negative effects on coral cover. The effects of fishing were also important, negatively influencing five out of the six metrics. Moreover, LBSP exacerbates this effect for all metrics but not quite as badly as would be expected under additive assumptions, although the magnitude of the effects of LBSP are sensitive to uncertainty associated with primary productivity. Over longer time spans (i.e., 65 year simulations), climate change impacts have a slight positive interaction with other drivers, generally meaning that declines in ecosystem metrics are not as steep as the sum of individual effects of the drivers. These analyses offer one way to quantify impacts and interactions of particular stressors in an ecosystem context and so provide guidance to managers. For example, the model showed that improving water quality, rather than prohibiting fishing, extended the timescales over which corals can maintain high abundance by at least 5-8 years. This result, in turn, provides more scope for corals to adapt or for resilient species to become established and for local and global management efforts to reduce or reverse stressors.

AB  - We measured lipid biomarkers (n-alkanes [n-ALKs] and n-alkanoic acids [n-FAs]) and other components of organic matter (total organic carbon [TOC] and total nitrogen [TN]) in a sediment core from Lake Issyk-Kul, Central Asia, to infer environmental changes in and around the lake during the last similar to 300 years. Stratigraphic shifts in lipid biomarkers, TOC and TN, indicate three distinct environmental stages in the lake over the past three centuries: (1) Stage I (1670s-1790s, 51-36 cm sediment depth) corresponds to a period of stable hydrology in the lake, reflected by relatively constant concentrations of n-ALKs and n-FAs and values of related indexes. The interval was a period of relatively low trophic state. Natural factors were the main controls on environmental changes in and around the lake. (2) Stage II (1800s-1970s, 35-15 cm sediment depth) was a period when human activities began to exert influence on the environment in and around the lake. Enhanced agricultural exploitation and greater regional rainfall resulted in delivery to the lake of more land-derived lipids. Logging activity around the lake altered the vegetation, as revealed by shifts in C-27/C-33 ratios and the average chain length (ACL(27_33)). A significant decline in lake level caused by excessive water consumption impacted aquatic macrophytes, as revealed by a reduction in macrophyte indicators. Lower nutrient concentrations were inferred for this period. (3) Stage III (1980s-present, 14-0 cm sediment depth) corresponds to a period of accelerating eutrophication. Before year 2000, lake level declined steadily as a result of low rainfall (drought) and high evaporation, which exerted a strong influence on the lake condition. In addition, anthropogenic activities contributed to lake eutrophication. After 2000, the lake experienced a dramatic increase in trophic state, characterized by high algal productivity, as indicated by greater TN, short-chain n-ALKs and short-chain n-FAs. The change was probably caused by flourishing tourism around the lake. In summary, environmental changes in and around Lake Issyk-Kul during the past similar to 300 years were originally driven largely by natural factors such as shifts in regional precipitation amount. Human activities (e.g. logging, agriculture, water extraction, and more recently, tourism) took on increasingly important roles during the last two centuries, affecting watershed vegetation, the lake primary producer community and lake trophic status. Changes recorded in the lake sediments over the last similar to 300 years are in good agreement with historical records.

AB  - The Food Security Index (consists of 19 indicators) was developed to assess the impact of environmental determinants on the state of food security. The formation of the integral index was carried out using principal component analysis. The proportions of the inclusion of each of the 19 indicators are based on the eigenvalues of the 1st principal component that explains 48.37% of the variation. Identification of the environmental factors influence on the Food Security Index was carried out using panel data regression analysis (random-effect GLS regression) for the sample of 28 post socialistic countries for the period 2000-2016. Empirical results reveal a statistically significant positive effect of most ecological determinants of sustainable agro-management on food security. While the impact of growth in coal use for electricity and fossil fuels is insignificant. However, the increase in the consumption of electricity and growth of unproductive energy losses negatively affects the food security.

AB  - The thrust of much work in ecological economics has been to develop better means of identifying and quantifying aspects of the environment which have instrumental or resource value. Less attention has been paid to quantifying environmental and social phenomena that have intrinsic value. Indeed, some economists would argue that intrinsic value does not exist. Yet many environmental issues arise in the first place because of strongly felt concern about the threat to intrinsic values and the need to make these sacred. In New Zealand, environmental legislation explicitly requires that the state of intrinsically valued environmental capital be monitored and included in environmental decisions. A problem for those of us trying to develop ESSD indicators is that intrinsic values seem vague and ad hoc with no clear relation to other forms of capital and no unambiguous define criteria. This paper provides a clear defining criterion and propose a taxonomy of capital that incorporates both instrumental and intrinsic values. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - Ecosystem-based Fisheries Management is a holistic management approach that integrates the dynamics of an entire ecosystem, including societal dimensions. However, this approach seldom lives up to its promise because economic and social objectives are rarely specified. To fill this gap, we explored how an ecosystem model could better integrate economic and social objectives, using the coral reef ecosystem around Hawai`i as a case study. After meeting with stakeholders and conducting a literature review of policy/strategy documents, we identified societal and ecological objectives and associated performance indicators for which data existed. We developed a social-ecological system conceptual framework to illustrate the relationships between ecological and social state components. This framework was the foundation for the development of the final social-ecological system model which we simulated using an Ecopath with Ecosim model. We simulated four gear/species restrictions for the reef-based fishery, two fishing scenarios associated with the opening of hypothetical no-take Marine Protected Areas for the deepwater-based fishery, and a Constant Effort (No Action) scenario. Despite limitations in the model, our approach shows that when social and economic objectives and social-ecological relationships are defined, we can quantify the trade-offs among the identified societal objectives to support managers in choosing among alternative interventions.

T2  - CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE OCEANIC FISHERIES INVESTIGATIONS REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Individual, geographic, and interannual variation in morphometric and life-history traits was examined and related to environmental variables. In the winters of 1984 and 1985, 1,836 otolith-aged northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) were obtained from 16 California-northern Baja California stations. Life-history characters were age, size (mean of logs of 11 morphometric measures), condition, and gonadosomatic index (GSI). Principal components analysis of 11 log-transformed morphometric traits adjusted for size and sex revealed five factors that summarized variation in (1) length of body, (2) length of jaw and operculum, (3) length of anal-fin base, (4) body depth, and (5) length of orbit and preorbital region. Independent variables used in further analyses were age, sex, size, year of sampling, year-class, distance offshore, CalCOFI line, depth of bottom, and sea-surface temperature at station. Within-station age-classes containing more than 13 fish were treated as independent subsamples (a total of 37).
   Morphometric factors, although independent of size, were found to reflect condition. Although GSI and condition were negatively correlated among ages within years, they were independent among subsamples. Only 0.7% of individual variation in GSI was attributable to sex. Although there was overall positive correlation of GSI and size, the allometric relationship of GSI with size within a subsample (GSI slope) was negatively correlated with subsample mean GSI, signifying individual variation in reaction-norm allometry.
   Spatial heterogeneity was unexpectedly large for all life-history and morphometric characters. Two temperature-correlated, mesoscale spatial patterns were found: (1) of size, GSI, and GSI slope; and (2) of condition, body depth, and body length. Pattern 2 resembled published satellite images of a recurrent pattern of phytoplankton-pigment concentration, reflecting primary production. A third pattern of negative correlation of jaw length with condition and body depth was independent of temperature, year, and other independent variables. Year-class- and temperature-related differences between 1984 and 1985 samples suggested expected effects of the 1982-84 El Nino, but these were not cleanlyseparable from the much larger contributions of geographic variation. Heterogeneity within and among subsamples, particularly in jaw and anal-fin-base lengths, suggested heterogeneity of early environment, both among ages from the same station and within certain subsamples.

AB  - Reference points identify benchmarks, thresholds, or decision points for fisheries management, and are commonly defined by stock status indicators that presume equilibrium population conditions in the absence of fishing (e.g., equilibrium biomass, B-0). However, equilibrium population biomass may be an inappropriate reference level when stock productivity is influenced by environmental change, predator-prey dynamics, ecosystem thresholds, and myriad other factors. Simulations were conducted to compare equilibrium-based (static B-0) and non-equilibrium based (dynamic B-0) indicators of stock status under alternative states of nature driven by time-varying recruitment dynamics (productivity regime), fishing dynamics (mortality regime), and species life history. Using dynamic B-0 often implied a different state of the stock under directional productivity regime shifts, but was more similar to static B-0 reference points under cyclic or white noise productivity scenarios. Uncertainty in stock status arising from incorrectly identifying changes in system productivity generally outweighed the uncertainty associated with initial equilibrium conditions. Empirical results across 18 U.S. West Coast groundflsh stock assessments indicated predominantly small differences (< 10%) between static B-0 and dynamic B-0 indicators of stock status, although in some cases differences were large (up to 72%) or spanned reference points that trigger management action. Although caution is warranted when considering dynamic reference points, this paper shows these approaches are likely to be most useful when stock productivity shifts directionally, if that productivity signal can be correctly ascertained.

AB  - The establishment and maintenance of protected areas is the backbone of global conservation strategies to halt biodiversity loss. However, despite the more than 200,000 legally designated protected sites worldwide, the rate of species extinction has not decreased, for which some debate the real effectiveness of protected areas to preserve biodiversity. Using data from tropical areas, many studies have attempted to test the effectiveness of protected areas by comparing species richness in protected and neighbouring unprotected sites, without reaching a consensus. Here, we extend this line of research with data from temperate deciduous forests inside and outside Picos de Europa National Park and Biosphere Reserve (N Spain). Specifically we compare data from mixed broadleaved woodlands, beech forests (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) forests. We conducted botanical inventories and recorded ecological data from 25 0.2-ha concentric plots distributed in forest commons inside the reserve and from other 25 similar plots established in neighbouring not protected forest commons. Data were used to construct a set of ecological indicators and evaluated using modelling methods. We found no significant differences in species composition between plots in protected and non-protected forest commons, likely due to the similar management criteria applied in both land uses. We found less active management outside the protected area, which helps to maintain stands in a semi-natural state. In contrast, we observed the presence of silvicultural treatments inside the protected area, although these treatments were non-intensive, promoting vegetation composition associated to late-successional ecosystems. We only detected significant differences between plots inside and outside the protected area when relation between species richness was analysed with reference to forest habitat type. Precisely, plots of beech forests inside Picos de Europa were more homogenous than plots outside the protected area, which may indicate that management practices inside the protected area do not favour tree species diversity. Non-intensive silviculture management in beech forests inside Picos de Europa seems to promote the presence of the dominant tree species Fagus sylvatica L, which in the absence of perturbations is characterized by conforming monospecific vegetation communities. Overall, our results do not support the idea that protected areas hold more biodiversity than surrounding forest commons. Conservation treatments applied in protected areas should promote the presence of species associated to disturbances, particularly in stands tending to homogeneous species composition at late-successional stages, as this may enhance their resilience under the current rapid global changes.

AB  - Urban centers radically alter hydrological cycles, causing unintended consequences for the environment, such as the creation of extensive contamination plumes in unconfined aquifers. The Environmental Agency of the State of Sao Paulo has observed this issue since 1994. Therefore, this study aimed to create a method using nitrate as an indicator of contamination that permits an assertive interpretation of changes in the ground-water quality in monitoring wells of regional networks. The method was applied in ten cities with monitoring wells in the Bauru Aquifer System. The results correlated the presence of nitrate with the time and dynamics of land use in the capture zones of the wells over 54 years (1962-2016). In areas with sewer networks installed before 2001 and urban occupation greater than 60% of urban occupation in the capture zones, there was an increase in nitrate concentration of at least 35%. Likewise, extending this new method to other wells will make it possible to identify the causes of nitrate and other contaminants in the groundwater-monitoring network in the State of Sao Paulo.

AB  - Changes in land use and drainage have contributed to channel adjustment in small-order to medium-order streams in the prairie pothole region of south-west Minnesota. Although conversion from prairie to agriculture occurred a century ago, recent decades have seen increased subsurface tile drainage, annual row crop coverage and channel modifications, particularly at road crossings such that channel adjustment is ongoing. Channel evolution in Elm and Center Creeks, two fourth-order streams in the Blue Earth River basin, was studied to understand relationships between changes in channel morphology and suspended sediment concentrations. The construction of drainage ditches and expanded subsurface tiling has connected isolated basins to stream channels, effectively increasing drainage areas of Elm and Center Creeks by 1520%. Sinuosity has been reduced by grading and drainage of first-order sloughs, channel straightening at road crossings and natural cut-offs and agricultural ditching that have shortened Elm Creek by 15% between 1938 and 2003. Stream cross-sectional area was enlarged in response to the land-use and drainage changes. In the headwaters, public ditches are wider than historic channels and entrenched by berms. Unchannelized headwater and upper mainstem portions of Elm Creek are also highly entrenched (up to 1.07 meters below the pre-channelization bed elevation with a bank height ratio?>?1.5) but have not widened substantially. In contrast, the lower main channel has widened by an average of 68%. These channel adjustments contribute to the suspended sediment load and violations of Minnesota's turbidity and Index of Biotic Integrity standards. The watershed has a low sediment delivery ratio because it is a flat, poorly connected landscape and likely delivers less sediment to the Minnesota River than steeper rivers downstream, such as the Blue Earth River. Entrenchment and increased sediment transport capacity in the lower reaches of the river have lead to increased sediment delivery to the downstream Blue Earth and Minnesota rivers. Understanding geomorphic changes will be important for addressing water-quality impairments in the region. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The climate is changing day by day and water scarcity has developed a milieu for the breeder to think accordingly. Twenty-four advanced wheat lines along with four prominent check cultivars were evaluated independently in irrigated (IRE) and rain-fed environments (RFE) for yield related traits at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan during 2010-11, using randomized complete block design with three replications under each test environment Analysis of variance across the two environments exhibited highly significant variation (p <= 0.01) among the genotypes for yield and associated traits. Differences among the two test environments (E) were significant for tillers m(-2), 1000-grain weight and harvest index. Genotype x environment interaction (GxE) effects were significant only for 1000-grain weight and grain yield. There was general reduction in 1000-grain weight, biological yield and grain yield of all genotypes under RFE as compared to IRE. Magnitude of heritabilities estimates were greater for tillers m(-2), spikelets spike(-1) and grains spike(-1) under IRE than RFE. Heritabilities were greater in RFE than IRE for spike length (0.31 vs 0.26), biological yield (0.80 vs 0.22), grain yield (0.94 vs 0.20) and harvest index (0.41 and 0.39). Relative high expected selection response was recorded for all characters under IRE except spike length, grains spike(-1) and grain yield. In IRE, highest grain yield was produced by genotypes BRF-7 (5123 kg ha(-1)), B-VI(N)16 (5111 kg ha(-1)), B-IV(N)1 (5086 kg ha(-1)) and B-VI(N)5 (5049 kg ha(-1)), While genotypes B-VI(N)5 (4649 kg ha(-1)), B-IV(N)1 (4595 kg ha-1), BRF-7 (4486 kg ha(-1)) and B-IV(N)16 (4462 kg ha(-1)) were high yielding under RFE. Prominent stress selection indices used in the experiments were mean productivity (MP), tolerance (TOL), stress tolerance index (STI), trait index (TI) and trait stability index (TSI). MP and STI were the efficient and reliable selection indices in both environments (IRE & RFE). MP, TOL and STI had strong positive relationship with tillers m(-2), spikelets spike(-1), 1000-grain weight, biological yield and grain yield under IRE. Mean stress indices showed that the top ranking genotypes for MP and STI were B-VI(N)6, BRF-7, B-VI(N)5 and B-II(N)3, reflected their superior performance across both the conditions.

AB  - Water deficit is one of the most important factors limiting crop yield, and the monitoring of crop water status is important for reasonable irrigation and water saving cultivation. Drought stress tolerance is seen in almost all plants but its extent varies from species to species and even within species. In this study, seven agronomical traits (grain yield, 1000 grain weight, biomass, harvest index, plant height, main spike length and awn length) of 17 spring wheat lines with variable responses to drought stress, obtained from the agriculture research centre of Zanjan province, Iran, were investigated under three different levels: (a) normal irrigation (b) after anthesis drought stress condition, and (c) no irrigation, in a split block design in a randomized complete block design with three replications in Zanjan, Iran, from March to September 2006. This study was conducted to extract the probable correlation between different traits and stress tolerance index (STI) of wheat lines. It was also conducted to estimate the direct and indirect effects of traits on STI and heritability of these traits to provide plant breeders useful information regarding drought resistance in wheat breeding. Analysis of variance indicated that there were significant differences among the genotypes for all studied traits. For biomass, 1000 grain weight, grain yield and harvest index, there was no significant interaction between genotypes and levels of stress. The Zarrin line produced the highest amount of grain yield, biomass, and harvest index. Moreover, under normal irrigation and no irrigation conditions, the harvest index (75 and 70%) had the highest broad sense heritability. Under normal conditions, a positive and significant correlation between STI with grain yield, biomass, and harvest index was observed. Additionally, in stress conditions there was a positive and significant correlation between STI and awn length, spike length and plant height. Under normal conditions, the correlation between biomass and STI was bigger than the stress condition. In path analysis, in all three different conditions, the biggest direct effect on STI was related to grain yield resulting in a positive and significant correlation between grain yield and STI.

AB  - Climate change is expected to have strong effects on mediterranean-climate regions worldwide. In some areas, these effects will include increases in temperature and decreases in rainfall, which could have important implications for biological assessment programs of aquatic ecosystems. We used a consistently collected, 20-y benthic macroinvertebrate data set from 4 sites along 2 small northern California streams to examine potential climate-change effects on aquatic communities. The sites represented unique combinations of stream order and flow intermittency. The North Coast benthic macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) developed for northern California streams was not influenced by temperature extremes (cool and warm) or precipitation extremes (wet and dry). Other common indices and metrics used in biological monitoring studies, such as the ratio of observed to expected taxa (O/E), % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) individuals, and total richness were unaffected by temperature and precipitation variability. For future monitoring of climate-change effects on small streams, we developed a local climate-change indicator that is composed of the presence/absence of 9 macroinvertebrate taxa, identified to genus level. This indicator detected significant differences between years that were grouped based on temperature, precipitation, and a combination of temperature and precipitation. It also detected significant differences between groups in an external data set including 40 reference sites throughout the San Francisco Bay area, a result that suggests this indicator could be used at larger spatial scales in this region. Two biological trait categories found in large, long-lived organisms decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation at the most intermittent site. This result indicates that climate change might selectively affect taxa with certain traits. The robustness of the North Coast B-IBI and other common indices and metrics to temperature and precipitation variability demonstrates their continued applicability for examining water quality under future climate-change scenarios, but suggests that they probably will not be good indicators for detecting climate-change effects. The effects of climate change in mediterranean-climate streams can be monitored effectively within the framework of existing biological assessment programs by using regional indicators based on specific taxa identified to the generic level and information on their species traits.

AB  - Although fertilisers enriched in rare earth elements (REE) are widely used in agricultural practice, little is known yet about behaviour of the REE in soil-plant system. Among REE, europium (Eu) may be of highest interest. Eu may serve as an indicator of biogeochemical processes due to a change of its valence state under different environmental conditions. Since chemical characteristics of Ca and REE are similar, Eu may compete with Ca for organic ligands. In the present work we studied the influence of Eu and Ca on the growth and mineral nutrition of wheat seedlings. An application of Eu favoured germination and root growth, whereas in combination with Ca it produced a more sustained leaf growth. Eu affected uptake and distribution of certain nutrients in different parts of a plant. The content of Eu in all parts of wheat seedlings at the end of germination significantly increased. Transfer of the seedlings germinated in the Eu-rich medium into soil resulted in the release of Eu from the plants. Nevertheless, 9 days after the sowing, Eu concentration in the seedlings was still much higher than in the control plants. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conceptual and methodological divergence in defining the issue of energy poverty (i.e. the inability of households to afford adequate access to energy services) has made it difficult to assess the problem at a European level using a standardized approach. Moreover, existing research raises concerns with regard to socio-economic and environmental differences between European states that may have a significant impact on this phenomenon. The current paper builds upon a set of newly proposed econometric methods for the trans-national measurement of energy poverty and for the study of its determining factors - the Compound Energy Poverty Indicator. The research shows that Southern and Eastern European countries present peculiar socio-economic traits that distort the impact of predicting variables, such as the tenure status of households. The results imply that a cautious approach is needed when attempting to measure and predict energy poverty at a transnational level based on macroeconomic indicators. Regionally specific policy measures and indicators may be needed in order to assess the problem in a truly functional, accurate and more efficient.

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change is driving the rapid loss of biodiversity. Large declines in the abundance of historically common species are now emerging as a major concern. Identifying declining populations through long-term biodiversity monitoring is vital for implementing timely conservation measures. It is, therefore, critical to evaluate the likelihood that persistent long-term population trends of a given size could be detected using existing monitoring data and methods. Here, we test the power to detect declines in Australia's common landbirds using long-term citizen science monitoring. We use spatially explicit simulations of occupancy dynamics and virtual sampling, designed to mimic bird monitoring in better-sampled regions of Australia, to assess likely power in these data to detect trends relevant for conservation. We predict the statistical power for 326 common species that meet minimum requirements for monitoring data across 10 regions of Australia, estimating the number of species for which we would have a high (>= 80%) chance of detecting declines of different sizes. The power to detect declines of >= 30% per decade was predicted to be high for at least one-third of the common species in 7 of 10 regions, with a total of 103 (32% of 326) unique species sufficiently monitored in at least one region. These species spanned 12 taxonomic orders, four orders of magnitude in body mass, and a broad diversity of dietary guilds, suggesting the current species pool will likely serve as robust indicators for a broad range of environmental states and pressures. Power was strongly affected by species' detectability, and power to detect even large declines was negligible when species are detected on <= 50% of visits to an occupied site. Predicted power for many species fell just short of the 80% threshold in one or more regions, which suggests an increase in effort targeting these species could greatly enhance the species and regional representation of these data. Against the backdrop of unprecedented biodiversity losses, this study shows how critical evaluation of existing monitoring schemes is valuable both for assessing the contribution of citizen science schemes to biodiversity monitoring and for designing strategic monitoring to significantly improve the knowledge these schemes provide.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Environmental temperatures are increasing, and consequent global warming also has negative effects on dairy cattle farms, which may result in reduced production and poorer milk quality. The protein content of casein, in particular, is important in influencing the coagulation properties of milk and, therefore, the production and quality of cheese. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of heat stress on animal performance and on the expression of selected genes involved in milk protein metabolism. Eight dairy cows were kept under thermoneutral conditions for 8 days. The same animals were then maintained under mild heat stress conditions for an additional 8 days. The results of this study revealed that mild heat stress reduced the feed intake and performance of dairy cows in terms of milk and protein yield, but not the expression of the target genes involved in milk protein metabolism, such as those coding for caseins.
   The aim of this study was to assess the effect of heat stress on dairy cow performance and on the expression of selected genes involved in milk protein metabolism. Eight Italian Holstein Friesian cows were kept under thermoneutral conditions (temperature-humidity index (THI) < 72, CON) for 8 days and under mild heat stress conditions (72 < THI < 78, HS) for an additional 8 days. The rectal temperature, feed intake, and milk yield were recorded during the last 3 days of the CON and HS periods. During the same time period, milk samples were collected to assess the composition and expression of selected genes involved in milk protein metabolism. Gene expression analyses were performed on somatic cells from milk, which are representative of mammary tissue. In terms of dairy cow performance, HS resulted in lower milk and protein yields and feed intake but higher rectal temperature than for CON (p < 0.05). Under HS, there were greater abundances of HSPA1A (p < 0.05) and BCL2 (p < 0.05), compared to CON, but similar levels of CSN2 (p > 0.05), CSN3 (p > 0.05), HSPA8 (p > 0.05), and STAT5B (p > 0.05) mRNA. Mild heat stress reduced the performance of dairy cows without affecting the expression of genes coding for caseins.

AB  - Microbial community characterization is used as a disturbance indicator for soils. However, there is little evidence on the response of soil microbes to restoration. We aim to study the effects of restoration, using different trees, on soil communities and document temporal changes.
   On a phosphate mine in Yunnan Province, China we selected sites with different restoration ages (2, 23, and 30 years) and tree species (Eucalyptus globulus (exotic), Cupressus torulosa, Pinus yunnanensis (both indigenous)). Control sites included natural land, and disturbed sites without vegetation. Soil microbial communities were characterized using Phospholipid-derived fatty acids analysis. Soil nutrients concentrations were analysed.
   Compared to control sites, disturbed soils exhibited significantly lower microbial diversity, bacterial biomass, soil organic carbon and nutrient concentrations. Recultivation with trees restored the soil microbial communities to a state similar to natural soils. Indigenous trees increased soil N concentration, and microbial biomass at a faster rate than the exotic Eucalyptus trees. Soil microbial diversity increased with plantation age.
   Soil communities can be used as soil health indicators in restoration monitoring. Additionally, soil microbial communities recovered fastest under indigenous compared to exotic trees, which further underlines the importance of tree species selection in restoration management.

AB  - The enhanced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common pathway of toxicity induced by stressful environmental conditions. In polar environments, characterization of antioxidant defences in key sentinel species may be of particular value as early detection biomarkers of unforeseen effects of human activities which are progressively increasing in these remote areas.
   The complexities associated with predicting the consequences at the 'organism level' of variations of specific antioxidant defences have been recently overcome by the ability to quantify an index of specific biological resistance to various kinds of ROS.
   The total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) assay has been used in three species of scallops for quantifying their ability to neutralize peroxyl (ROO.) and hydroxyl ((OH)-O-.) radicals and peroxynitrite (HOONO). Adamussium colbecki and Chlamys islandicus represent key organisms for monitoring Antarctic and Arctic regions while Pecten jacobaeus was chosen for a comparison with a related temperate species. TOSC values for ROO. were significantly higher in A. colbecki indicating this species as the most efficient scavenger of ROO.. Mediterranean scallops had the lowest TOSC for ROO.. A. colbecki also exhibited the highest scavenging capacity for (OH)-O-. with values more than 2-fold greater than for C. islandicus and P. jacobaeus. TOSC for HOONO was lower for all scallops as compared to those for ROO. or (OH)-O-.. TOSC for microsomes was not significantly different among the species for any ROS studied, and the percentage contribution to the specific TOSC for the various oxidants of microsomes of all scallops accounted for 1-3% of the total TOSC of the post-mitochondrial fraction. The specific TOSC of scallop microsomes for (OH)-O-. was approximately ten times lower than that for ROO. or HOONO.
   The higher basal capability of the Antarctic scallop to neutralize different reactive oxygen species is discussed in terms of a possible adaptation to this extreme environment and TOSC is validated as a quantifiable measure of susceptibility to oxidative stress in marine organisms.

AB  - Deep-going analysis of the temporal and spatial variations of the major ions in rivers can reveal the sources of nutrients to a certain extent, which is of great value for the development of specialized governance strategies to control nutrient flows into rivers. The Yellow River stem and its reservoirs were selected as the study area, which is the most sediment-laden river in the world. A systematic survey of the Yellow River main steam was conducted from April to May and September to October 2019. The Yellow River was divided into three regions via cluster analysis of ion composition data, which represent the three states of natural and man-made influences. Based on the analysis of hydrochemical characteristics, the results indicated that: (1) the ion and nutrient concentrations in Region I were generally low, the concentrations in Region II were higher than those in Region I, and the concentrations in Region III remained consistently high. (2) the transportation of phosphorus is mainly controlled by the erosion of rainfall runoff and the adsorption of sediment in the Yellow River Basin; nitrogen is mainly derived from point source pollution during spring, but there is combined impact of point and nonpoint sources during autumn; and (3) ultimately, six indicators (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42- and HCO3-) were used to qualitatively analyze pollution sources. Of these, K-+,K- Mg2+, and HCO3- were selected as nonpoint source pollution tracers, and Na+, Cl-, and SO42- were selected as point source pollution tracers. Our results improve the understanding of applicability of hydrochemical characteristics method, and are important for water resource management in the Yellow River Basin.

AB  - Sustainable development is the fulfillment of the needs of the present generation without destroying the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Among the main elements of sustainable development, there are economic elements, socio - cultural elements and environmental elements. Reducing World hunger, gender equality, clean water and sanitary conditions, appropriate work and economic growth, industry-innovation and infrastructure, reduction of inequalities, responsible consumption and production, aquatic life, terrestrial life, peace and justice, poverty reduction, accessible clean energy, sustainable cities and habitats and healthy individuals are some of the key objectives of sustainable development.
   Health is considered one of the important indicators in achieving these goals. Health is one of the basic needs of humankind. According to the definition made by the World Health Organization health; is expressed as the state of full well-being of the individuals in physical, spiritual and social aspects. It is natural that this state of full well-being is closely related to economic development and the environment it affects. In evaluating the goals of sustainable development; health indicators which are used include variables such as nutrition status, mortality, hygiene conditions, drinking water, and health services. Relationship between sustainable development and health will be examined within Turkey examples study.

AB  - This work sought the survey of species and information about the distribution of the Class Oligochaeta in reservoirs sampled in the Sediment Quality Monitoring Network of CETESB (Environmental Company of the State of Sao Paulo). As such, this study aimed to inventory the limnic oligochaetes fauna to expand knowledge of the ecology and distribution of this group in reservoirs in the state of Sao Paulo. Ninety replicates were performed in 12 reservoirs in the state of Sao Paulo between 2014 and 2016, using van Veen or Ponar samplers in the sublittoral region, and Ekman-Birge in the deep region. Twenty-eight taxa were inventoried, belonging to the families Naididae and Opistocystidae. The species Dero righii and Pristina longisoma were recorded for the first time in Sao Paulo State, Nais magnaseta and Spirosperma velutina were first recorded in Brazil. The results presented here make this inventory extremely important for understanding the distribution of aquatic oligochaetes throughout the Brazilian territory.

AB  - For ecological and economic issues, evaluating the environmental fate of dissolved and suspended matter in catchments and river ecosystems still remains a challenge for the preservation and management of natural resources. Models are useful tools and may help to cope with this challenge, and especially to define the relationships between the state of natural systems and land and river management/uses. As it is difficult - even impossible - to carry out experiments on natural systems such as catchments, models are also useful to test hypotheses about the underlying processes acting on dissolved and suspended losses. We propose an innovative approach to achieve these objectives. By coupling environmental indicators and lumped modeling, this study aims to develop a conceptual and general framework to evaluate and test the functions that drive particulate and dissolved matter flows at the catchment and landscape scales, while respecting the constraint of parsimony for the number of model parameters. Calculated suspended matter (SM) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) losses agreed well with field data. Pb-210(ex) (excess Pb) activities in core sediments were also compared to those of Pb-210(ex) calculated from the filling of the reservoir. Our models are parsimonious and this does not impair their accuracy in reproducing recorded outflows or evaluating the sedimentation processes associated to particulate outflows. Considering the adequacy of our models, we validate the hypothesis that river bank erosion and water table behavior are the driving processes that govern losses of particulate and solute forms of P, in the studied extensive agriculture conditions.

AB  - Various indicators rooted in the concepts of information and entropy have been proposed to be used for ecological network analysis. They are theoretically well grounded and widely used in the literature, but have always been difficult to interpret due to an apparent lack of strict relations with node and link weight. We generated several sets of 10,000 networks in order to explore such relations and work towards a sounder interpretation. The indices we explored are based on network composition (i.e., type and importance of network compartments), or network flows (i.e., type and importance of flows among compartments), including Structural Information (SI), Total System Throughput (TST), Average Mutual Information (AMI), Flow Diversity (H), and Ascendency (ASC). A correlation analysis revealed a lack of strict relationships among the responses of the investigated indicators within the simulated space of variability of the networks. However, fairly coherent patterns of response were revealed when networks were sorted by following a "bottom-up" criterion, i.e. by increasing the dominance of the large-sized top predator in the network. This ranking is reminiscent of ecosystem succession, along which the prominence of higher trophic level organisms progressively increases. In particular, the results show that a simple increase in organisms having large size and low consumption rates is potentially able to simultaneously lead to an increase of different types of information (as SI, H and AMI), thus also emphasizing the importance of bionomic traits related to body size in affecting information-related properties in a trophically connected community. The observed trends suffer from a certain dispersion of data, which was diminished by imposing specific and ecologically meaningful constraints, such as mass balancing and restriction to certain range of the ratio A/C, an index related to the viability of ecological networks. These results suggest that the identification of a set of effective constraints may help to identify improved conditions for applicability of the investigated flow-based indicators, and also provide indication on how to normalise them with respect to meaningful network properties or reference states. Thus, in order to increase confidence in the derived network metrics describing a particular ecosystem state, and thus increase their applicability, it is advisable to construct replicate networks by taking the variability of input data into account, and by applying uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.

AB  - Several computational approaches have been proposed for inferring the affective state of the user, motivated for example by the goal of building improved interfaces that can adapt to the user's needs and internal state. While fairly good results have been obtained for inferring the user state under highly controlled conditions, a considerable amount of work remains to be done for learning high-quality estimates of subjective evaluations of the state in more natural conditions. In this work, we discuss how two recent machine learning concepts, multi-view learning and multi-task learning, can be adapted for user state recognition, and demonstrate them on two data collections of varying quality. Multi-view learning enables combining multiple measurement sensors in a justified way while automatically learning the importance of each sensor. Multi-task learning, in turn, tells how multiple learning tasks can be learned together to improve the accuracy. We demonstrate the use of two types of multi-task learning: learning both multiple state indicators and models for multiple users together. We also illustrate how the benefits of multi-task learning and multi-view learning can be effectively combined in a unified model by introducing a novel algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Natural capital accounting is an essential prerequisite for the harmonious development of human beings and nature and benign interactions between economy and environment. Although the ecological footprint has significantly contributed to sustainability evaluation for many years, the traditional ecological footprint model is limited by lack of value accounting, incomplete account content, neglect of multi-functions of land, and geographical spatial heterogeneity. These limitations reduce the universality of this model. To improve the value accounting of the ecological footprint model, this study takes national hectares (nha) as the measurement unit and includes the freshwater and pollution footprints. The dynamic changes of natural capital from 2000 to 2018 were calculated and analyzed in 31 Chinese provinces. The main findings are summarized here. China's physical quantity of ecological footprint, ecological carrying capacity, and ecological deficit in 2018 was 4.03, 0.79, and -3.24 billion nha, respectively. The energy account contributed most of the physical quantity in the ecological footprint (72.12% of the total). From 2000 to 2018, the physical quantities of the per capita ecological footprint and the per capita ecological deficit increased at 5.49% and 10.08% per annum, respectively, while the physical quantity of the per capita ecological carrying capacity decreased by 0.55% per annum. The physical quantities of the per capita ecological footprint and per capita ecological deficit were spatially distributed, reducing in the order of East > Central > West. The spatial distribution of the physical quantity of the per capita ecological carrying capacity showed the opposite trend. By 2018, China's ecological footprint, ecological carrying capacity, and ecological deficit were valued at 18.09, 12.44 and CNY -5.65 trillion, respectively. Over the 2000-2018 period, the per capita ecological footprint and ecological carrying capacity increased by 495 and CNY 370 per annum, respectively, while the per capita ecological deficit expanded at CNY -125 per annum. The biological account contributed approximately 59.53% of the value quantity of the ecological footprint. Since the twenty-first century, the cumulative effect of excessive consumption has placed increasing pressure on China's ecosystems. On mainland China, only Tibet showed an ecological surplus in 2018. The ecological pressure index decreased in the order of East > Central > West. As Western China has developed extensively and its ecological deficit is rapidly expanding, this region deserves special attention. The most ecologically challenging regions in China are Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing. In contrast, Jilin, Qinghai, and Tibet impose low ecological pressure in China. These findings contribute to the standardization and localization of the ecological footprint model in China and provide a reference for regional resource management and ecological construction.

AB  - The Montreal Process is a forest sustainability reporting framework adopted by 12 temperate-boreal nations consisting of 7 basic criteria and 64 indicators. This article focuses specifically on criterion 2, maintenance of the productive capacity of forest ecosystems, and its five indicators: area of forestland and net forestland available for timber production; growing stock and annual increment on forest available for timber production; area, percent, and volume in plantations; and annual removals of nonwood forest products (NWFP). We compare historic and current inventory processes, discuss the implications of each, present criterion 2 indicator highlights, and identify gaps in our current knowledge. In general, the productive capacity of US forests is strong. Forest and timberland areas have been stable for over 50 years, net growth continues to exceed removals, growing stock volume is up 51% since 1953, and planted forests continue to increase in area and provide a larger share of the nation's annual wood production. NWFPs continue to be difficult to track but progress has been made.

AB  - Managers need to know how to mitigate rising stream water temperature (WT) due to climate change. This requires identifying the environmental drivers that influence thermal regime and determining the spatial area where interventions are most effective. We hypothesized that (i) extreme thermal events can be influenced by a set of environmental factors that reduce thermal sensitivity and (ii) the role played by those factors varies spatially. To test these hypotheses, we (i) determined which of the environmental variables reported to be the most influential affected WT and (ii) identified the spatial scales over which those environmental variables influenced WT. To this end, the influence of multi-scale environmental variables, namely land cover, topography (channel slope, elevation), hydromorphology (channel sinuosity, water level, watershed area, baseflow index) and shade conditions, was analyzed on the three model variables (day thermal sensitivity, night thermal sensitivity, and non-convective thermal flux) in the model developed by Georges et al. (2021) of the temporal thermal dynamics of daily maximum WT during extreme events. Values were calculated on six spatial scales (the entire upstream catchment and the associated 1 km and 2 km circular buffer, and 50 m wide corridors on each side of the stream with the associated 1 km and 2 km circular buffer). The period considered was 17 extreme days during the summer identified by Georges et al. (2021) based on WT data measured every 10 min for 7 years (2012-2018) at 92 measurement sites. Sites were located evenly throughout the Wallonia (southern Belgium) hydrological network. Results showed that shade, baseflow index (a proxy of the influence of groundwater), water level and watershed area were the most significant variables influencing thermal sensitivity. Since managers with finite financial and human resources can act on only a few environmental variables, we advocate restoring and preserving the vegetation cover that limits solar radiation on the watercourse as a cost-effective solution to reduce thermal sensitivity. Moreover, management at small spatial scale (50 m riparian buffer) should be strategically promoted (for finance and staffing) as our results show that a larger management scale is not more effective in reducing thermal sensitivity to extreme events.

AB  - The landscape development intensity (LDI) index, which can be used as a human disturbance gradient, is an effective tool in assessing location of wetland mitigation banks where large tracts of land are managed to protect wetland function by offsetting wetland losses from off-site land development. As part of a larger study to determine the effectiveness of mitigation banking in Florida, this article focuses on characterizing the landscape intensity of wetland mitigation banks in the state. Two scales of the LDI index were calculated: wetland assessment area scale LDI index (n = 58), which characterizes the landscape surrounding a small parcel of land within a mitigation bank boundary, and mitigation bank scale LDI index (n = 26), which characterizes the lands surrounding the entire boundary of the wetland mitigation bank. Approximately two-thirds of the wetland assessment areas (n = 38) had LDI index scores less than 2.0 (where 0.0 represents no human development), with a mean LDI index score of 3.2 (sigma = 4.9). LDI index scores were calculated such that all lands within the 100 m zone surrounding a wetland assessment area designated as restoration, enhancement, creation, or preservation were assigned LDI index scores reflecting natural lands. In this application, the LDI index score was considered a tool to predict potential wetland condition based on successful restoration. Bank scale LDI index scores, based on land use within the 100 m zone surrounding the entire mitigation bank, were generally higher than assessment area scores, with a mean bank scale LDI index score of 7.8 (sigma = 5.4) and a median of 6.5. At the wetland scale, evaluation of landscape condition using the LDI index presented a quantitative analysis tool to determine potential ecological lift (i.e. expected gain in ecological condition) with successful wetland restoration practices within the mitigation bank. Whereas at the bank scale, LDI index calculations suggested the expected impacts from human land use activities outside of the control of the bank property. We propose using the LDI index to facilitate calculation of wetland mitigation potential and credit awards for mitigation banks, and that regardless of the tool used consideration of potential wetland functional lift should incorporate a landscape perspective.

AB  - Ants, as indicators of ecological changes, are widely used in land management and environmental monitoring. At the same time, effects of industrial pollution are less known compared to many other stressors. We studied variations in habitat variables and ant diversity near the Karabash copper smelter (KCS) in Russia, in 2009 and 2014. Pitfall traps were set up at 10 birch forest sites (3 plots per site and 5 traps per plot) located to the north and south of the smelter within a 1-32-km range, with two samplings per season (June and August). The tree height, stand basal area, species richness of the field and moss layers, and the cover of the field layer decreased towards the smelter. The vegetation almost disappeared at the industrial barren close to KCS. In total, 21 ant species of 7 genera were registered. The highest species richness, diversity, and total occurrence of ants were observed in the transitional zone between moderately polluted forest habitats and industrial barren. Ant diversity and occurrence showed the same pattern in different years. Our results conform to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis predicting the greatest diversity at intermediate frequencies or intensities of disturbance or environmental change. Apparently, contaminant exposure affects ant communities near KCS indirectly, through habitat transformation.
   The study emphasizes the need for thorough planning of field studies of pollution effects on ants with examination of the full range of exposures. In addition, the nonlinear pattern of diversity and abundance of the ant community along the pollution gradients suggests caution, when assessing the magnitude of human impact and the state of ecosystems with ants as bioindicators.

AB  - Divergent breeding lines of Romney sheep, selected as lambs for consistently high or low faecal worm egg count (FEC) following natural multi-species challenge by nematode parasites, were established in New Zealand at Wallaceville Animal Research Centre in 1979 and at Rotomahana Station in 1985. In 1988 the Rotomahana lines, including an unselected control line maintained tinder the same management conditions, were transferred to Tokanui Station where they remained for 4 years. In 1993 elite high and low FEC animals from Tokanui, along with the controls, were transferred to Wallaceville, where merged lines have since been managed together. Selection responses from the lines at Rotomahana and Tokanui, and from a further 5 years of divergent selection in the merged lines, are reported here. For the two most recent lamb crops (1996 and 1997 birth years), log-transformed FECs of the high and low lines were 1.27 and -1.46 phenotypic standard deviation units from the control. After backtransformation to the original scale, where the FEC for control line lambs averaged 1255 eggs per g, the means for the high and low lines were 3.05 and 0.27 times the control mean. Animal-model restricted maximum likelihood estimates of heritability and repeatability for single-record FEC (following separate infections) were 0.28 (s.e. 0.02) and 0.42 (s.e. 0.01), respectively. Correlated responses in production traits include significantly decreased post weaning weight gain and increased dags (breech soiling) in lambs, and decreased fleece weight in yearlings and ewes in the low FEC line, compared with those in the high line. However the low FEC line had proportionally 0.11 more lambs weaned per ewe mated than the high FEC line (P < 0.01). It is concluded firstly that selection for high or low FEC in Romneys has achieved an 11-fold difference between the divergent lines. Secondly, it will generally be necessary in a commercial environment to apply index selection for a combination of increased productivity, decreased FEC and possibly decreased dags, when potential candidates are recorded under conditions of nematode challenge.

AB  - A prevalent legacy of coal mining within Appalachia and elsewhere is acid mine drainage (AMD), which drastically alters both the chemical and biological components of the receiving waters. Hewett Fork is one such affected stream. Although AMD treatment has reduced acidity considerably downstream, the ability of this stream to sustain a biological community compared to those found in reference conditions remains unclear. To assess this, tiles colonized with diatom assemblages from a reference stream were transplanted into Hewett Fork in 5 locations along a 6.9 km stream length and sampled after one, three, and six weeks. Diatom assemblage structure metrics, including species evenness (J'), species richness (S), relative abundance of dominant taxon, and Shannon diversity (H'), as well as chlorophyll a concentrations, Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, and Acid Mine Drainage Diatom Index of Biotic Integrity (AMD-DIBI) scores were calculated for each site and sampling time. One-way ANOVAs of structural metrics showed significant differences (P <= 0.001) between the reference site and the 2nd and 3rd most upstream sites within the study reach for the duration of the study, with the exception of the relative abundance of dominant taxa at an intermediate site during the third week. Conversely, the most downstream Hewett Fork assemblage, located 11.6 km from the primary AMD input, did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) from that of the reference assemblage for any structural metrics after the initial sampling period. Throughout the study, only three sites obtained "good" AMD-DIBI narrative class:the reference site (weeks 1, 3, and 6), the most downstream site (weeks 1, 3, and 6; 11.6 km downstream of primary AMD input) and the uppermost site (weeks 1 and 6; 4.7 km downstream of primary AMD input). Results suggested that after an initial one-week acclimation period, assemblages at the uppermost and most downstream sites along the reach were relatively similar to those found in reference conditions, while sites within the middle region continued to show signs of impairment, although the factor(s) causing this impairment remain unknown. These findings suggest that while treatment has been effective on a site-specific basis, the expected linear-response to treatment was not achieved due to underlying factors that are inhibiting reference-like biological communities from reestablishing within the affected stream reach.

AB  - Indicators are widely used in climate variability and climate change assessments to simplify the tracking of complex processes and phenomena in the state of the environment. Apart from the climatic criteria, the snow indicators in ski tourism have been increasingly extended with elements that relate to the technical, operational, and commercial aspects of ski tourism. These non-natural influencing factors have gained in importance in comparison with the natural environmental conditions but are more difficult to comprehend in time and space, resulting in limited explanatory power of the related indicators when applied for larger/longer scale assessments. We review the existing indicator approaches to derive quantitative measures for the snow conditions in ski areas, to formulate the criteria that the indicators should fulfill, and to provide a list of indicators with their technical specifications which can be used in snow condition assessments for ski tourism. For the use of these indicators, a three-step procedure consisting of definition, application, and interpretation is suggested. We also provide recommendations for the design of indicator-based assessments of climate change effects on ski tourism. Thereby, we highlight the importance of extensive stakeholder involvement to allow for real-world relevance of the achieved results.

AB  - The concept of ecological memory provides a new perspective for research on forest succession by including historical factors and the initial state of ecological processes. However, there are still significant gaps between the concept and its application. We selected nine proxy indicators (plant species, soil seed banks, soil microbes, soil animals, birds, soil age, soil pollen, soil mineral distribution, and light environment) and developed a method to quantify ecological memory and succession in a subtropical forest succession in South China. Taking the climax-monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest as the reference ecosystem, we found that ecological memory increased nonlinearly and accumulated following a specific assembly rule during succession. Memory concerning major soil microbes and soil animals, which improve the soil substrate, mainly accumulated from the initial to the early successional stage. Memory concerning the number of bird species and the availability of light, which ensure a source of regenerative seeds and the survival of understory seedlings, mainly accumulated from the early to middle successional stages. Memory concerning vegetation and soil seed banks mainly accumulated late in succession, guaranteeing that the ecosystem would reach the regional climax stage. Prospective memory was greater than retrospective memory in every successional stage except the late stage, which indicated that all stages but the late stage were undergoing progressive succession. Our study demonstrates that the concept of ecological memory and the proposed evaluation framework are useful for guiding research on succession and restoration, and especially for assessing how "far" a restored ecosystem is from a reference ecosystem or how far a restored ecosystem has deviated from its natural succession trajectory.

AB  - Elevated population levels of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) can drastically alter forest ecosystems and negatively impact society through human interactions such as deer vehicle collisions. It is currently difficult to estimate deer populations at multiple scales ranging from stand, county, state, and regional levels. This presents a challenge as natural resource managers develop silvicultural prescriptions and forest management practices aimed at successfully regenerating tree species in the face of deer browsing. This study utilized measurements of deer browse impact from the new tree regeneration indicator developed by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. Seedling and sapling abundance and other plot-level characteristics were analyzed across three states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) in the Great Lakes Region of the United States. Socio-environmental datasets (Lyme disease cases, deer vehicle collisions, and deer density estimates) were used in conjunction with FIA data to determine their predictive power in estimating deer browse impacts by county. Predictions from random forests models indicate that using Lyme disease case reports, the number of deer-vehicle collisions, deer density estimates, and forest inventory information correctly predicted deer browse impact 70-90% of the time. Deer-vehicle collisions per county ranked highly important in the random forests for predicting deer browse impacts in all three states. Lyme disease cases ranked high in importance for the Lake States combined and for Minnesota and Wisconsin, separately. Results show the effectiveness of predicting deer browse impacts using a suite of freely available forest inventory and other socio-environmental information.

AB  - To describe the cascading spread problem of ecosystem vulnerability with continuous disturbance, we propose a novel model based on object function GeoPetri net (OFGPNM). The model makes ecological environment Petri net fully reflect in ecological environment system in a graphical manner. On this basis, we design four dynamic indicators (i.e., vulnerability, adaptability, state of cascade spread, state probability) for each sub-ecosystem and two global indicators (i.e., scale of cascade spread and scale rate) for entire ecosystem. Taking Shenfu coal field in Shaanxi Province of China as case study, we simulate the impact of accumulative vulnerability and dynamic evolution of three states over time. The results showed that depending on different states of the subsystem, the factors used to maintain the balance of system's original state are also different. The results showed that cyclic structure of Petri net based on the fluidity of a river made the ecosystem more vulnerable than acyclic structure. The results also showed that the emission rate of mine dust Q(o), the tolerance parameter a and the resilience parameter y had great effect on achieving the optimal state of ecosystem. Q(o) played an important role in slowing occurrence time of cascade spread. The rational investments by government in ecological construction and pollution management are the key to balancing economic expenditure with ecological benefits. The obtained results were quite convincing to prove the novel contribution of this research to the field of vulnerability with cascading spread analysis which might continue to be the reference for restoration and reconstruction of the environment.

AB  - Methods and indicators need to be developed to investigate urban ecosystem health to mitigate eco-environmental problems and develop holistic policies for integrated urban ecosystem management. Considering the importance of energy and materials flows in urban ecosystems, the emergy synthesis model was applied to organize the urban ecosystem health indicators from the biophysical perspective in this paper, through which a better understanding of urban ecological patterns and processes can be obtained. Set pair analysis was combined to conduct the data processing of health indicators and promote objectivity of ecosystem health criteria. Set pair analysis defines the approximate degree of a real index set relative to an optimal one, which is evaluated to describe the relative urban ecosystem health levels in view of the emergy-based health indicators. Six cities in the Yangtze River Delta urban cluster in China (Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Nanjing and Hangzhou) were selected as case studies using 2005 data. The evaluation showed that the urban ecosystem health states of Shanghai and Hangzhou are relatively good, while the health states of Wuxi and Suzhou are relatively poor. The health states of the cities based on the factors (vigor, structure, resilience, ecosystem service maintenance and environmental impact) and individual indicators were also analyzed to identify regulatory directions and measures for improving the health status of those cities with relatively poor ecosystem health. This paper presents a meaningful comparison between different urban ecosystems at different indicator levels and provides a useful framework for urban ecological management with respect to urban ecosystem health status.

TI  - Terrestrial Field Soil Dissipation studies in pesticide environmental risk assessment
T2  - TERRESTRIAL FIELD DISSIPATION STUDIES: PURPOSE, DESIGN AND INTERPRETATION
LA  - English
CP  - 220th Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society
AB  - Field dissipation studies are a key data requirement for the registration of crop protection products. Guidelines for the conduct of these studies have been developed by many countries and have similar (but not quite identical) specifications. Recently a proposal to revise the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and Canadian guidance has been put forward and promulgated as a potential Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidance document; this proposal adds requirements for the studies to address the relative importance of all routes of dissipation and fully characterize the compound's dissipation in terms of "mass balance" by the incorporation of additional "modules" such as leaching and runoff. This has prompted a detailed review of the function of Terrestrial Field Soil Dissipation (TFSD) studies within regulatory risk assessment schemes from which it became apparent that, in the USA, the current TFSD study is not used significantly in risk assessment or to trigger further studies. Surprisingly, despite the high financial and reviewing costs of these studies for both regulators and industry, they provide little useful return on investment. While the proposal to design a more comprehensive study offers several advantages, a detailed review shows that, in most cases, the resulting study will not adequately address the objective of understanding mass balance. Moreover, while some modules can easily be combined with field soil dissipation elements, some of the proposed add-in "modules" are incompatible with one another as well as with the traditional conduct of field soil dissipation studies such that attempts to incorporate them all are likely to result in unproductive compromises. It is proposed that a simple guideline be developed that describes a minimum set of data to measure surface soil dissipation. The study director should then be obliged to provide additional details as needed on a case-by-case basis in order to account for other potentially important dissipation mechanisms. These modules could be added to the TFSD study if appropriate or conducted as separate studies (as is generally done at present) at the discretion of the study director. Terrestrial field soil dissipation study findings would be compared with laboratory study and exposure modeling data to identify any discrepancies that require further field, laboratory or modeling effort. Ultimately, the combined laboratory, field and modeling data sets should be used to develop an environmental fate overview that adequately describes the environmental fate of the parent material and degradates and shows that the modeled estimated exposures used for risk assessments are supported by field dissipation data to demonstrate that modeled values are "reasonable".

AB  - The biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) connect all the abiotic and biotic components of ecosystems to one another in a holistic way. As such, the spatial and temporal dynamics of C and N budgets are closely coupled with variations in such ecosystem processes as productivity, nutrient cycling, stability, succession and biodiversity. In turn, the cycling rates of C and N are affected by the type, magnitude, severity and frequency of natural and anthropogenic disturbances, which induce changes in the structure and function of ecosystems locally and regionally, and which may endanger the sustainability of ecological goods and services globally. C and N budgets are, therefore, significant ecosystem-level indicators that can signal deviations from sustainable ecosystem management under current and changing patterns of human disturbances. Thus, they can assist in evaluating the potential effects of human disturbances on the structure and function of ecosystems, and in developing preventive and mitigative measures in decision- and policymaking. Examples are provided by process-based models to quantify regional C and N dynamics as indicators of sustainability for cropland, drastically disturbed (coal surface-mined land) and urban ecosystems in the State of Ohio in the American Midwest.

AB  - The Grand River watershed in Ontario, Canada, receives and assimilates the outflow of 29 Municipal Wastewater Effluent (MWWE) discharges which is a mixture of domestic and industrial wastes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cumulative impact of multiple sewage discharges on populations of wild fish. In field studies, responses of fish populations and individual fish responses in terms of growth (condition factor), reproduction (in vitro sex steroid production, gonadosomatic indices, histology [cellular development and intersex] were assessed upstream and downstream of two municipal discharges. Fish [Greenside Darters Etheostoma blennioides and Rainbow Darters E. caeruleum] collected downstream of two municipal wastewater plants had the potential to have greater growth (longer and heavier) when compared to reference fish collections regardless of sex. Fish were not assimilating additional anthropogenic resources into energy storage (increased condition, liver somatic index). Impacts on ovarian development appeared to be minor with no differences in growth, steroid production or cellular development. Sewage exposed male fish were experiencing impairment in the capacity to produce testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone in vitro, and in cellular development (GSI, intersex). Male darters of both species collected in the upstream agricultural region demonstrated no evidence of intersex whereas our urban reference sites had incidence of intersex of up to 20%. Rates of intersex were elevated downstream of both sewage discharges studied (33% and>60%, respectively). Lower rates of intersex at the intermediate sites, and then increases downstream of second sewage discharge suggests that fish populations have to potential to recover prior to exposure to the second sewage effluent. Pre-spawning darters demonstrated dramatically higher incidence of intersex in the spring at both urban reference sites (33% and 50%, respectively), and increased more so downstream of the near-field and far-field exposure sites (60% and 100%, respectively). These findings suggest that the compounds released in SIP effluents have a tendency to act on the male reproductive system. These effects may become more pronounced as projected human population growth will require the aquatic environment to assimilate an increasing amount of sewage waste.

AB  - This study investigated if ecological traits of forest floor vegetation could be used as indicators of naturalness of beech forest in Hungary, by comparing near-natural unmanaged stands with managed ones. Seventeen patches in the unmanaged Kekes Forest Reserve were compared with 11 subcompartments of different ages in the surrounding managed forest. In each stand, the character state distributions of 9 ecological species traits were calculated based on presence/absence data of plants. Averages for unmanaged versus managed stands were compared. Significant effects of management were shown. The characteristics of herbaceous plants with higher frequency in managed stands include late start and longer duration of flowering, overwintering canopy, and small epizoochorous seeds. Unmanaged stands are richer in plants that bear leaves from spring to autumn, start flowering early or flower very shortly, produce large seeds. Relevance of this method is discussed for Central Europe, where in large areas intensive forest management rather than fragmentation or break in forest continuity is the major human disturbance.

AB  - Purpose. The aim of the article was to identify and analyze negative trends, substantiate practical recommendations for improving regional policy for preserving human resources by regulating the external migration of young people from rural territories of the Carpathian region in Ukraine.
   Methodology / approach. The methodological basis of the study involved general scientific (graphic, structural analysis) and special (sociological, integral and correlation analysis) methods of research. Sociological survey was conducted by the SI "Dolishniy Institute of Regional Research of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine") in September-October 2019. The survey was focused on the higher educational institutions, vocational schools and general secondary schools graduate students from the Carpathian Region (1200 people). The author's approach to constructing an integral index of the migration activity environment involved the implementation of an algorithm based on the normalization of indicators (stimulators and de-stimulators), determination of the weights of indicators and groups of indicators by constructing a correlation matrix, calculation of multidimensional values in the form of weighted group indices.
   Results. In the article, due to sociological research, characteristics of external migration activity of young people from rural areas of the Carpathian Region in Ukraine were analyzed. Conclusions were based on the problematic aspects of youth migration and its impact on the further development of rural areas. The integral indices of push-factors determining population migration in Ukraine and Lviv Region were calculated, which allowed stating a higher level of "aggressiveness" of the population migration environment in the Carpathian Region compared to the average in the country. Recommendations on the instruments for regulating migration of young people from rural areas to preserve human potential for their development were substantiated.
   Originality / scientific novelty. A new methodology for calculating the integral index of the environment of population migration activity was developed (using five groups of indicators: demographic stability and health status; population enrolment in education; labour market and employment conditions; living standards; economic development), as well as approach to evaluation of the relationship between the push-environment and migration activity of population was improved.
   Practical value / implications. policy instruments for conserving human resources by regulating the external migration of young people from rural areas (by organizational, economic and institutional groups) were substantiated for their implementation by regional authorities.

AB  - Efforts to attain good environmental status in the marine realm require decisions which cannot be done without knowledge of effects of different management measures. Given the wide diversity of marine ecosystems, multitude of pressures affecting it and the still poor understanding on linkages between those, there are likely no models available to give all the required answers. Hence, several separate approaches can be used in parallel to give support for management measures. We tested three completely different methods - a spatial impact index, a food web model and a Bayesian expert method. We found that a large uncertainty existed regarding the ecosystem response to the management scenarios, and that the three different modelling approaches complemented each other. The models indicated that in order to reach an improved overall state of the ecosystem nutrient reductions are the more effective of the two management variables explored, and that cumulative effects of the management of nutrient inputs and fishing mortality are likely to exist.

AB  - Among Brassica species, Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun) is known to tolerate most abiotic stresses, including drought. Drought caused by low and erratic rainfall in semi-arid regions consistently challenges rapeseed mustard productivity. Development of B. carinata-derived lines (CDLs) in Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. nuclear background, carrying genomic segments from B. carinata, are expected to tolerate moisture deficit stress conditions. The present study was, thus, aimed to establish the phenomenon "heterosis" for drought tolerance and water use efficiency by evaluating 105 hybrids developed from intermating 15 CDLs in half diallel fashion. Data on 17 seed yield and yield contributing traits were recorded under two different environments, viz., irrigated and rainfed conditions. Traits under study were found to be governed by both additive and non-additive types of gene action. Average degree of dominance was higher (>2) for yield and yield contributing traits, viz., secondary branches/plant, point to first siliqua on main shoot, total siliquae/plant, 1,000-seed weight, seed yield/plant, biological yield, harvest index, and seed yield/hectare under rainfed conditions, clearly indicating that higher productivity under drought conditions can be realised through the development of hybrids. Out of 15, highly significant general combining ability (GCA) effects for seven CDLs were observed under rainfed condition. Furthermore, nine and six hybrids expressed highly significant specific combining ability (SCA) effects and > 50% heterobeltiosis for yield contributing traits under rainfed and irrigated conditions, respectively. Water use efficiency (WUE) of parental CDLs and hybrids varied from 2.05 to 2.57 kg m(-3) under rainfed, while 1.10 to 1.28 kg m(-3) under irrigated conditions. Hybrids expressed higher WUE than parental lines under both water regimes. Furthermore, selection indices such as drought tolerance index (DTI) and mean relative performance (MRP) were identified to be efficient in the selection of productive CDLs and hybrids under drought conditions. Nine hybrids, identified as highly productive in the present study, can further be exploited for improving the yield of Indian mustard in drought-prone areas. Usefulness of interspecific hybridisation in the development of B. carinata-derived B. juncea lines for improving heterosis and WUE is, thus, well demonstrated through the present study.

AB  - An educational project on biological monitoring of air quality was launched in 2004 to involve about 650 young students (age 6 to 16) from 21 schools of nine municipalities in Tuscany (Central Italy) in active detection of the crucial pollutant ozone with indicator sensitive tobacco seedlings. Results implied the reading of 9,300 raw biological figures and were fortified by the data captured by six photometric analysers. Under the guidance of their teachers, the students had several opportunities to practice with many basic and applied study areas and were initiated into the scientific method in a simple and absorbing manner. Curiosity and involvement were widespread; a sort of emotional and responsible relationship was developed by several pupils. Though primarily an educational exercise, the survey introduced a research element and the regional picture of air pollution that emerged has increased our knowledge of the air quality situation in the area. Biological monitoring of air quality is a powerful tool to improve the awareness and involvement in key topics of environmental education. In addition, it represents a crucial element for improving the awareness of problems and implies the active participation of citizens in the assessment of several indicators of the state of the environment. Its potential as a robust implement in landscape and urban planning is noteworthy.

AB  - It was estimated annually that several thousands of hectares (ha) of land has been lost to desertification and the negative impacts are manifested on the environment and general livelihood of people; reduced capacity to provide for the basic needs such as food and water. Although this is true of many countries in Sub Sahara Africa, yet the spatial pattern of the level of desertification and the areas at risk has not been sufficiently quantified and mapped. This study is aimed at determining and mapping the spatial extent of desertification risk index in the 9 frontline states of Northern Nigeria and to identify areas and population that are at risk given the current condition to enhance mitigation and adaptation strategy plan. We used both aridity and vegetation indices in combination with elevation and urban/settlement population data to determine and mapped the risk of desertification in the nine frontline states. To obtain aridity index we used De Martonne aridity index (lar-DM) equation; this was calculated from the raster layers of mean annual temperature (MAT) and total annual precipitation (TAP) using map algebra. To monitor vegetation conditions we used eMODIS NDVI 10-day maximum-value composite MVC NDVI images at 250m spatial resolution. We created desertification risk index map from spatial overlay of NDVI/vegetation cover, elevation, population and aridity index. The study shows that aridity in the study area increases northward in curvilinear pattern as 75 % (430,650 km(2)) of the region falls into three aridity categories: arid, semi-arid and dry sub humid while the remaining 25% (33,000 km(2)) found in southern Kebbi, Zamfara, Katsina and Bauchi falls under sub humid. Aridity index as proximate of the desertification was however found to be inadequate as the combination of vegetation index produced desertification risk index (DRI) map which has helped to identify "hot spot" these are places where risks to desertification are higher than their surrounding areas. Suggestions such as sound land management, energy substitution strategy are made to combat the menace of desertification with special attention placed on these highly vulnerable "hot spot" areas.

AB  - An integrated research program was initiated to evaluate if the European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis can be used as a robust indicator of the marine environment in Mor Bras, Brittany, France. This program focuses on aspects of the ecology of the shag including its abundance, demography, diet and at-sea distribution measured at three breeding colonies. The annual population growth rate was estimated at 1.01 for the period 1987-2009. The number of breeding pairs (mean: 565) was highly variable from year to year. Part of this interannual variation was explained by variations in sea surface temperature and sea surface height in winter and spring: the number of breeding pairs was negatively related to sea surface temperature and sea surface height. First year, second year and adult survival probabilities were 0.44, 0.76 and 0.81, respectively. Juvenile survival rate varied between colonies, despite the short distances separating these islets. Average productivity was one young fledged per nest, but it varied between years and islets. Density of individuals at sea varied between 1.40 ind.km(-2) during the breeding season and 3.08 ind.km(-2) after the breeding season had ended. Individuals foraged up to 7 km from the nest and performed on average 2.7 foraging trips per day. The average number of dives deeper than 5 m varied from 126 to 400 per day. Mean diving depth, dive duration and time spent at bottom were 13 m, 28 s, and 19 s respectively. Regurgitated pellets were collected regularly. Four fish families (Gadidae, Gobiidae, Atherinidae and Labridae) represented more than 65% of the preys throughout the year, a percentage reaching more than 95% of the prey from May to October. The other fish in the diet were Cottidae, Ammodytidae, and Clupeidae. The diet of the European shag consisted of benthic fish throughout the year, and also included pelagic fish more frequently between June and October. The synchronous variations of productivity between colonies suggest that some common environmental factors affect this demographic parameter at the regional scale. Thus, the European shag has a good potential for being a reliable ecological indicator of the state of this marine environment. Finally, improved knowledge on the foraging ecology of shags will be useful in the process of designing Marine Protected Areas in the Mor Bras to help ensure sustainable management of marine resources and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The objective of this study is to quantify barrier layer development due to tropical cyclone (TC) passage using Argo float observations of temperature and salinity. To accomplish this objective, a climatology of Argo float measurements is developed from 2001 to 2014 for the Atlantic, eastern Pacific, and central Pacific basins. Each Argo float sample consists of a prestorm and poststorm temperature and salinity profile pair. In addition, a no-TC Argo pair dataset is derived for comparison to account for natural ocean state variability and instrument sensitivity. The Atlantic basin shows a statistically significant increase in barrier layer thickness (BLT) and barrier layer potential energy (BLPE) that is largely attributable to an increase of 2.6 m in the post-TC isothermal layer depth (ITLD). The eastern Pacific basin shows no significant changes to any barrier layer characteristic, likely due to a shallow and highly stratified pycnocline. However, the near-surface layer freshens in the upper 30 m after TC passage, which increases static stability. Finally, the central Pacific has a statistically significant freshening in the upper 20-30 m that increases upper-ocean stratification by similar to 35%. The mechanisms responsible for increases in BLPE vary between the Atlantic and both Pacific basins; the Atlantic is sensitive to ITLD deepening, while the Pacific basins show near-surface freshening to be more important in barrier layer development. In addition, Argo data subsets are used to investigate the physical relationships between the barrier layer and TC intensity, TC translation speed, radial distance from TC center, and time after TC passage.

AB  - For more than two decades, wetland restoration has been successfully applied in Denmark as a tool to protect watercourses from elevated nutrient inputs from agriculture, but little is known about how the flora and fauna respond to restoration. The main objective of this study was therefore to: (1) examine plant community characteristics in 10 wetland sites in the River Odense Kratholm catchment, restored between 2001 and 2011 by re-meandering the stream and disconnecting the tile drains, and (2) explore whether the effects of restoration on plant community characteristics change with the age of the restoration. Specifically, we hypothesised that plant community composition, species richness and diversity would improve with the age of the restoration and eventually approach the state of natural wetland vegetation. We found that the prevailing plant communities could be characterised as humid grasslands, moist fallow fields and improved grasslands, whereas the abundance of natural wetland plant communities (e.g., rich fens, fen-sedge beds and humid grasslands) was lower in both the recently restored as well as in older restored wetlands. Additionally, species richness and diversity did not seem to improve with the age of the restoration. We suggest that the continued high nutrient input at the restored sites in combination with restricted dispersal of wetland plant species may hamper the recovery of natural plant communities and that the sites therefore may stay botanically poor for many decades.

AB  - The development of suitable reference states for ecosystem-based management requires documentation of changes in structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, including assessment of the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down processes as drivers of change. We used monitoring data available from St Helena Bay, the most productive bay and an important nursery area situated on the west coast of South Africa, during 1950-2010 to reveal changes in the abiotic and biotic components. St Helena Bay in the 1950s showed similarities to 2000-2010 in terms of wind patterns, hydrology and phytoplankton. Upwelling, oxygen and nutrient concentrations in subthermocline water displayed pronounced decadal-scale variability. Primary production in St Helena Bay is variable, but consistently higher than that on the adjacent Namaqua shelf. Zooplankton size composition and biomass in August have changed markedly since the 1950s. During 2001-2010, mesozooplankton biomass in autumn was considerably lower than in summer, probably due to predation by small pelagic fish. Pelagic fish catch patterns and distributions have altered dramatically. Conservation measures, implemented to reverse past negative human impact, have benefitted marine mammals, the abundance of which has increased in the area, but additional conservation measures are necessary to reverse the decline in African penguins Spheniscus demersus. St Helena Bay shows a muted response to long-term change in the southern Benguela, with marked decadal variability but no clear long-term trend in oceanography and biogeochemistry. Changes in ecosystem boundary conditions and fishing pressure cannot be ignored as important drivers of change in the southern Benguela since the 1950s.

AB  - During summer 2018, 29 specimens of bleak (Alburnus alburnus (Linnaeus, 1758)) from Maritsa River were collected and examined with standard techniques for parasites. Helminth parasites were recorded in 24 bleak specimens (82.75%) from Maritsa River. Five species of parasites were identified: one trematode species (Allocreadium isoporum (Looss, 1984)), two cestode species (Caryophyllaeus brachycollis Janiszewska, 1951, Ligula intestinalis (Linnaeus, 1758)); one acantocephalan species (Pomphorhynchus laevis (Muller, 1776)) and one nematode species (Rhabdochona denudat. (Dujardin, 1845; Raillet, 1916). The analysis of the dominant structure of the found parasite species is presented to the component and infracommunities level. In the component community of Alburnus alburnus from Maritsa River C. brachycollis, P. laevis and, R. denudat. are corespecies. L. intestinalisis component parasite species and A. isoporum is accidental parasite species for the helminth communities of bleak. The infracommunities data was used to be fixed principal biotic indices. Bioindicator significance of established parasite species was discussed for ecological evaluation of the state of the studied freshwater ecosystem. New data for the helminths and helminth communities of bleak from Maritsa River are presented.

AB  - The three juvenile phases of the spiny lobster Panulirus argus (algal phase: 5-15 mm carapace length, CL; postalgal phase: 15-45 mm CL, and subadults: 4580 mm CL) occur in the reef lagoon at Puerto Morelos, Mexico. The algal phase abounds in this lagoon, which is covered by extensive seagrass-algal meadows, but the density of postalgal and subadult juveniles is low, owing to the scarcity of crevice-type shelters suitable for these phases. The feeding ecology of the three juvenile phases was investigated to examine whether spatial or temporal differences in food intake, diet composition, or nutritional condition occurred among phases and could partially account for the low abundance of the larger juveniles. Juveniles were collected by divers at night, from January to November 1995, throughout the mid-lagoon and back-reef zones. Percent stomach fullness, relative weight of the digestive gland (RWDG, an index of nutritional condition), percent frequency of occurrence and percent volume of food categories in the diet were compared between sexes, juvenile phases, molt stages (postmolt, intermolt, premolt), seasons, and sampling zones (mid-lagoon and back-reef zones). Significant differences in stomach fullness occurred only among molt stages, mainly because postmolt individuals had emptier stomachs. The main food categories in all juvenile phases were crustaceans (mostly hermit crabs and brachyurans) and gastropods, but the food spectrum was wide, including many other animal taxa as well as plant matter. In June 1995, the epibenthic macrofauna was sampled in five sites in the lagoon that differed in their amount of vegetation. The most abundant taxa in all sites were decapods and gastropods, but density and diversity measures showed that the distribution of these potential prey taxa for juvenile P. argus was rather patchy. Diet overlap in juvenile lobsters was high between sexes, juvenile phases, sampling zones, seasons, and molting stages, indicating that all juveniles fed on the same general food categories throughout time. The only factor that affected the RWDG was the juvenile phase. RWDG was significantly lower in subadults than in algal and postalgal phases, suggesting a poorer nutritional condition in the largest juveniles. This may be related to the scarcity of suitable shelters for large juveniles throughout the lagoon, which may preclude subadults from exploiting food resources in areas of the lagoon where shelter is limited.

AB  - We investigated how multiple-crop forestry has influenced the magnitude and variability of soil and plant phosphorus (P) fertility and site disturbance. Kinleith Forest, on Mamaku Plateau, covers >100,000 ha and comprises mainly plantation Pinus radiata. Three study areas in the forest were chosen to represent natural state (native forest), first crop of P. radiata (24 years growth), and second crop of P. radiata (4 years growth of second crop). The adjacent areas have similar relief and climate, and the soils are all the same age, being predominantly Andic Haplohumods developed in 1770 calendar-year-old non-welded tephra (Taupo Ignimbrite, ca. 0.5-0.8 m in thickness) and overlying a buried paleosol on earlier tephric material.
   Soil properties were compared using a random geometric sampling scheme stratified in a 40-m grid. Soil samples (020 cm) were taken at 1.5, 4.5 and 13 m spatial intervals in random directions away from each primary node, providing 192 sample sites for each study area. Additionally at selected sites, samples of the current year's foliage from the upper crowns were collected, the thickness of Taupo Ignimbrite (i.e. depth to buried paleosol) was recorded by angering, and site disturbance was assessed using a new six-point scale based on change relative to a modal soil profile. Geostatistics and geographical information systems (GIS) were used to assess variability and effects of forest management on the measured properties. Soil Bray-2 P concentrations were below guidelines for satisfactory growth (12 mg kg(-1)) at all sites, and no differences were recorded between the different management areas. However, the amount of within-site variability in Bray-2 P increased with the number of crops. Foliar P concentrations were only marginally deficient in both the first and second crops, indicating that P is currently not significantly limiting growth. The lack of difference in foliar P between first and second crops indicates no crop-to-crop decline in foliar P status and suggests that no site P fertility decline has occurred. The soils have an unusual ability to continue releasing P through successive sequential extractions in the Bray-2 P test, indicating a strong buffering capacity, and this may explain the apparent lack of deficiency even with Bray-2 P values of < 12 mg kg(-1). The site disturbance index increased and the spatial distribution of P data became increasingly variable with crop rotation.

AB  - The Grain for Green (GFG) Project in China is currently the largest environmental rehabilitation project aimed at turning low-yielding farm land to forests and pastures. Such conversion of land use type also promotes remediation of the polluted environment. Soil microbes reflect soil function and are therefore considered an essential component of ecosystem restoration. To evaluate the environmental effects of converting atrazine polluted farmland to secondary forest, we determined soil chemical properties, soil bacterial communities and their responses to three types of land use (primary forest, PF; secondary forest, SF; farm land, FL) in Wuying, China. Our results showed that soil organic matter significantly decreases in the order PF > SF > FL. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene 454 pyrosequencing revealed that the soil bacterial diversity level remained unchanged. However between FL and the two forested sites, we observed an increase of Actinobacteria, beta-proteobacteria and Firmicutes; and a decrease of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, while in SF the bacterial community structure was similar to PF. We conclude that reforestation permits bacterial community, resetting from FL back to a state that resembles natural conditions. In addition, 20 years of natural attenuation degraded soil atrazine residues in SF but traces remained in the soil. Reforestation generally resulted in favorable ecological impacts on soil quality and the bacterial community compared with active farm fields. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article considers the conditions for the reproduction of fish in the waters of the Volgograd reservoir of the villages Akhmat and Zolotoe, such as level and temperature regimes, as well as production processes (the rate of gross photosynthesis, the rate of respiration of the plankton community, net primary production, which can serve as indicators of the state of the natural food base). According to the results of the fry survey in 2020, the conditions for the fish reproduction in the waters of the Volgograd reservoir of villages Akhmat and Zolotoe should be recognized as very unfavorable, which could be predicted by the dynamics of the level and temperature regimes. Black Sea sprat (Clupeonella cultriventris (Nordmann, 1840), as in previous years, is reproduced in the water area of the village of Zolotoe and is not reproduced in the water area of the village of Akhmat. The high food capacity of the studied water areas has a noticeable effect on the efficiency of reproduction of certain fish species in years with a more favorable level regime but is not able to compensate for the damage caused to the reproduction of fish by a particularly unfavorable regime of the water level in general.

AB  - Phytoplankton, at the base of the marine food web, represent a fundamental food source in coral reef ecosystems. The timing (phenology) and magnitude of the phytoplankton biomass are major determinants of trophic interactions. The Red Sea is one of the warmest and most saline basins in the world, characterized by an arid tropical climate regulated by the monsoon. These extreme conditions are particularly challenging for marine life. Phytoplankton phenological indices provide objective and quantitative metrics to characterize phytoplankton seasonality. The indices i.e. timings of initiation, peak, termination and duration are estimated here using 15 years (1997-2012) of remote sensing ocean-color data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative project (OC-CCI) in the entire Red Sea basin. The OC-CCI product, comprising merged and bias-corrected observations from three independent ocean-color sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS), and processed using the POLYMER algorithm (MERIS period), shows a significant increase in chlorophyll data coverage, especially in the southern Red Sea during the months of summer NW monsoon. In open and reef-bound coastal waters, the performance of OC-CCI chlorophyll data is shown to be comparable with the performance of other standard chlorophyll products for the global oceans. These features have permitted us to investigate phytoplankton phenology in the entire Red Sea basin, and during both winter SE monsoon and summer NW monsoon periods. The phenological indices are estimated in the four open water provinces of the basin, and further examined at six coral reef complexes of particular socio-economic importance in the Red Sea, including Siyal Islands, Shams El Sheikh, Al Wajh bank, Thuwal reefs, Al Lith reefs and Farasan Islands. Most of the open and deeper waters of the basin show an apparent higher chlorophyll concentration and longer duration of phytoplankton growth during the winter period (relative to the summer phytoplankton growth period). In contrast, most of the reef-bound coastal waters display equal or higher peak chlorophyll concentrations and equal or longer duration of phytoplankton growth during the summer period (relative to the winter phytoplankton growth period). The ecological and biological significance of the phytoplankton seasonal characteristics are discussed in context of ecosystem state assessment, and particularly to support further understanding of the structure and functioning of coral reef ecosystems in the Red Sea.

AB  - The rapid pearl farming industry causes environmental pollution to aquatic ecosystems. However, fish-mussel systems with highly productive, profitable and environment-friendly characteristics are appropriate aquaculture practices under the current polluted state of the environment in China Phytoplankton are excellent indicators and play indispensable roles in maintaining the stability of a freshwater ecosystem. Therefore, samples were seasonally collected determine the seasonal phytoplankton community dynamics and potential driving factors in three subtropical reservoirs with integrated fish-mussel aquaculture. All water physicochemical parameters varied seasonally, and water quality had a trend of eutrophication. A total of 189 species were identified, among which Chlorophyta (83 species) dominated in species richness. Cyanophyta, in particular remained to be highly abundant (57.53% of the total seasonal biomass). The NMDS analysis indicated that summer was an independent branch. The CCA analysis and Spearman rank correlation analysis suggested that water temperature might be the main abiotic factor. Furthermore, pH, conductivity, DO, chlorophyll, TC and TN also significantly affected the community The aquaculture enhanced the similarity in community structure which have happened due to predation pressure. The present study also identified the potential influences caused by the integrated fish-mussel aquaculture on phytoplankton seasonal succession, bringing some guidance to protect the reservoir ecosystem.

AB  - Biomonitoring programs are often required to assess streams for which assessment tools have not been developed. For example, low-gradient streams (slope a parts per thousand currency sign1%) comprise 20-30% of stream miles in California and are of particular interest to watershed managers, yet most sampling methods and bioassessment indices in the state were developed in high-gradient systems. This study evaluated the performance of three sampling methods [targeted riffle composite (TRC), reach-wide benthos (RWB), and the margin-center-margin modification of RWB (MCM)] and two indices [the Southern California Index of Biotic Integrity (SCIBI) and the ratio of observed to expected taxa (O/E)] in low-gradient streams in California for application in this habitat type. Performance was evaluated in terms of efficacy (i.e., ability to collect enough individuals for index calculation), comparability (i.e., similarity of assemblages and index scores), sensitivity (i.e., responsiveness to disturbance), and precision (i.e., ability to detect small differences in index scores). The sampling methods varied in the degree to which they targeted macroinvertebrate-rich microhabitats, such as riffles and vegetated margins, which may be naturally scarce in low-gradient streams. The RWB method failed to collect sufficient numbers of individuals (i.e., a parts per thousand yen450) to calculate the SCIBI in 28 of 45 samples and often collected fewer than 100 individuals, suggesting it is inappropriate for low-gradient streams in California; failures for the other methods were less common (TRC, 16 samples; MCM, 11 samples). Within-site precision, measured as the minimum detectable difference (MDD) was poor but similar across methods for the SCIBI (ranging from 19 to 22). However, RWB had the lowest MDD for O/E scores (0.20 versus 0.24 and 0.28 for MCM and TRC, respectively). Mantel correlations showed that assemblages were more similar within sites among methods than within methods among sites, suggesting that the sampling methods were collecting similar assemblages of organisms. Statistically significant disagreements among methods were not detected, although O/E scores were higher for RWB samples than TRC. Index scores suggested impairment at all sites in the study. Although index scores did not respond strongly to several measurements of disturbance in the watershed, percent agriculture showed a significant, negative relationship with O/E scores.

AB  - Thallium (Tl) was introduced into Haplic Chernozem in the amounts of 3, 30, and 300 mg/kg, and biological indicators were observed at 10, 30, and 90 days after incubation in the laboratory experiment. An increase in biological activities; i.e., the total number of bacteria, Azotobacter spp. abundance, enzymes (catalase, dehydrogenases), and phytotoxic indicators (germination rate of radish) after 30 days of Tl exposure were noted. The total number of bacteria and Azotobacter spp. abundance, enzyme activity, and phytotoxicity were more sensitive (16-76%) and informative (12-65%) indicators compared to the control, respectively. Integral biological indicators of soil state (IIBS) noted at 10, 30, and 90 days decreased at a dose of 30 and 300 mg/kg by 13-43% in relation to the control. An increase in Tl concentration and duration of exposure (up to 90 days) inhibited biological properties and caused ecotoxicological effects, respectively. We concluded that the use of individual indicators served as an indicator of the state of the soil.

AB  - Immobilization of wastes in cement-based matrices is being increasingly used, particularly in the case of elements of medium and low activity. Therefore, characterization of the system in relation to the release of ionic wastes through the cement, and consequently the determination of their diffusion coefficients, becomes of strategic importance, Nowadays, diffusion coefficients of some radioactive elements (mainly of Cs+) can be found in the literature, obtained by natural diffusion tests that are very time-consuming. In the present paper the calculation Of steady-state diffusion coefficients of Cs+, Sr2+, CO2+ and Fe3+ through concrete has been done by migration experiments. The mutual influence of the diffusion coefficients has also been studied, and transference numbers of the different ions have been calculated. The results have been compared with those obtained by natural diffusion tests, having found for Cs+ and Sr2+ that there is a very good accordance between diffusion and migration tests. In contrast for Co2+ and Fe3+ the accordance is not so good, because at migration working conditions they are able to form complex compounds. In consequence, migration tests are reliable for obtaining diffusion coefficients of different elements through concrete, always faking into account the nature of the species that are present at working conditions.

AB  - Ecosystems close to a critical threshold lose resilience, in the sense that perturbations can more easily push them into an alternative state. Recently, it has been proposed that such loss of resilience may be detected from elevated autocorrelation and variance in the fluctuations of the state of an ecosystem due to critical slowing down; the underlying generic phenomenon that occurs at critical thresholds. Here we explore the robustness of autocorrelation and variance as indicators of imminent critical transitions. We show both analytically and in simulations that variance may sometimes decrease close to a transition. This can happen when environmental factors fluctuate stochastically and the ecosystem becomes less sensitive to these factors near the threshold, or when critical slowing down reduces the ecosystem's capacity to follow high-frequency fluctuations in the environment. In addition, when available data is limited, variance can be systematically underestimated due to the prevalence of low frequencies close to a transition. By contrast, autocorrelation always increases toward critical transitions in our analyses. To exemplify this point, we provide cases of rising autocorrelation and increasing or decreasing variance in time series prior to past climate transitions.

AB  - Modern manufacturing of printed wiring boards (PWBs) involves extensive use of various hazardous chemicals in different manufacturing steps such as board preparation, circuit design transfer, etching and plating processes. Two complementary environmental screening methods developed by the U.S. EPA, namely: (i) the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) and (ii) Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI), are used to quantify geographic and chemical environmental impacts in the U.S. PWB manufacturing industry based on Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data. Although the release weight percentages of industrial chemicals such as methanol, glycol ethers and dimethylformamide comprise the larger fraction of reported air and water emissions, results indicate that lead, copper and their compounds' releases correspond to the highest environmental impact from toxicity potentials and risk-screening scores. Combining these results with further knowledge of PWB manufacturing, select alternative chemical processes and materials for pollution prevention are discussed. Examples of effective pollution prevention options in the PWB industry include spent etchant recovery technologies, and process and material substitutions. In addition, geographic assessment of environmental burden highlights states where promotion of pollution prevention strategies and emissions regulations can have the greatest effect to curb the PWB industry's toxic release impacts.

AB  - Paleoecological records indicate that subalpine forests in western North America have been resilient in response to multiple influences, including severe droughts, insect outbreaks, and widely varying fire regimes, over many millennia. One hypothesis for explaining this ecosystem resilience centers on the disruption of forest dynamics by frequent disturbance and climatic variability, and the resulting development of non-steady-state regimes dominated by early-successional conifers with broad climatic tolerances, such as lodgepole pine (Plaits contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex Wats.). To evaluate this hypothesis, we independently reconstructed the vegetation, fire, and effective-moisture histories of a small, forested watershed at 2890 in elevation in southeastern Wyoming, USA, using sedimentary pollen and charcoal counts in conjunction with sedimentary lake-level indicators. The data indicate that prominent vegetation shifts (from sagebrush steppe to spruce fir parkland at ca. 10.7 ka and spruce fir parkland to pine-dominated forest at ca. 8.5 ka ika stands for thousands of years before the present, defined as AD 1950]) coincided with changes in effective moisture. However, after lodgepole pine forests established at ca. 8.5 ka, similar hydroclimatic changes did not produce detectable vegetation responses. Fire history data show that other aspects of the ecosystem were responsive to changes in effective moisture at centennial timescales with prolonged fire-free episodes coinciding with periods of low effective moisture ca. 7.2-5.6 and 3.7-1.6 ka. Throughout our record, the ratio of ecosystem perturbation time (i.e., fire frequency and changes in effective moisture) to recovery time (assuming 200-600-year successional processes) falls within estimates of the ratio for non-steady state ecosystems. Frequent perturbations, therefore, may have prevented this ecosystem from reaching compositional equilibrium with the varied climatic conditions over the past 8.5 ka. Equilibrium states could have included more abundant spruce (Picea spp.) and fir (Abies spp.) than presently observed "based on.brief increases in pollen abundances of these taxa during prolonged dry, fire-free intervals. Our results show that, although current climate changes favor widespread disturbance in Rocky Mountain forests, the composition of these ecosystems could be highly resilient and recover through successional dynamics over the next few decades to centuries.

AB  - The Clean Air Regulatory Agenda (CARA) Mercury Science Program was developed to provide scientific information to support regulatory activities and accountability pertaining to atmospheric emissions of mercury in Canada. The first phase of the science program, entitled "Setting-the-Baseline'', sought to achieve the following: identify key indicators of the state-of-the-Canadian environment with respect to the transport, fate and effects of mercury; define these indicators; and, understand the processes that relate these indicators to anthropogenic emissions of mercury. To achieve these outcomes, a consultative process was used to identify the scientific needs of the agenda for mercury; understand Canada's scientific capacity; and, develop a plan to fulfill these scientific needs. The science plan that emerged from this process was structured around the themes of atmospheric monitoring, landscape-based risk assessment, ecological risk assessment, ecosystem modeling, and trends. Implementation of the science plan necessitated a multi-disciplinary and extensively partnered program. To date, the CARA Mercury Science Program is producing coordinated science at the national-scale that aims to directly assess the effectiveness of the CARA for mercury and for many of Canada's other mercury-related policies.

AB  - The implementation of environmental flow regimes offers a promising means to protect and restore riverine, wetland and estuarine ecosystems, their critical environmental services and cultural/societal values. This Special Issue expands the scope of environmental flows and water science in theory and practice, offering 20 papers from academics, agency researchers and non-governmental organisations, each with fresh perspectives on the science and management of environmental water allocations. Contributions confront the grand challenge for environmental flows and water management in the Anthropocenethe urgent need for innovations that will help to sustain the innate resilience of social-ecological systems under dynamic and uncertain environmental and societal futures. Basin-scale and regional assessments of flow requirements mark a necessary advance in environmental water science in the face of rapid changes in water-resource management activities worldwide (e.g. increases in dams, diversions, retention and reuse). Techniques for regional-scale hydrological and ecohydrological modelling support ecological risk assessment and identification of priority flow management and river restoration actions. Changing flood-drought cycles, long-term climatic shifts and associated effects on hydrological, thermal and water quality regimes add enormous uncertainty to the prediction of future ecological outcomes, regardless of environmental water allocations. An improved capacity to predict the trajectories of ecological change in rivers degraded by legacies of past impact interacting with current conditions and future climate change is essential. Otherwise, we risk unrealistic expectations from restoration of river and estuarine flow regimes. A more robust, dynamic and predictive approach to environmental water science is emerging. It encourages the measurement of process rates (e.g. birth rate, colonisation rate) and species traits (e.g. physiological requirements, morphological adaptations) as well as ecosystem states (e.g. species richness, assemblage structure), as the variables representing ecological responses to flow variability and environmental water allocations. Another necessary development is the incorporation of other environmental variables such as water temperature and sedimentary processes in flow-ecological response models. Based on contributions to this Special Issue, several recent compilations and the wider literature, we identify six major scientific challenges for further exploration, and seven themes for advancing the management of environmental water. We see the emerging frontier of environmental flows and water science as urgent and challenging, with numerous opportunities for reinvigorated science and methodological innovation in the expanding enterprise of environmental water linked to ecological sustainability and social well-being.

AB  - Mechanisms responsible for the high species richness of disturbance-prone floras remain speculative. After fire, speciose shrublands in Australia possess mosaics of microsites that vary widely in seedling density and species richness and provide an ideal context in which to test a) the self-regulation hypothesis that species survive and grow better as they become rarer in the mix, and b) the synergistic hypothesis that species perform relatively better at increasing levels of competition under poorer growing conditions. Both processes should serve to promote species co-occurrence at the local scale. We planted germinants of 10 native shrub species in nutrient-poor sands in 30 cm (high density) and 40 cm (low density) square, buried but open-bottomed, boxes. Each box simulated a field-type microsite, containing one individual (solitary), or 49 individuals with each species contributing three (5% of the total, rare), five (10%, equal), 25 (51%, dominant) or 49 (100%, monoculture) seedlings. Best performance per plant (gauged as % survival x shoot mass per survivor) occurred among all ten species when solitary in the box. When grown in the presence of other plants, mixtures of species performed better on a 1) per plant, and 2) whole microsite, basis than monocultures at both densities, and 3) when rare rather than dominant in the mix, conforming with the self-regulation hypothesis, all independent of species identity. Expected niche differentiation of soil-based resources among species mixes would explain increased fitness per plant with decreasing abundance per species. Overall performance (performance per plant x absolute number of survivors per microsite) was maximized when all species were moderately rare (10% of initial numbers among 10 species) in the mix. Under good (low density) and poor (high density) growing conditions, increasing competition (indexed as total shoot mass) from the dominant species in the mix, led to a gradual fall and merging of shoot mass of the remaining nine species at these two densities, but species richness did not change. This outcome provides only limited support for the synergistic model of species coexistence (species richness should have declined at a decreasing rate) but is consistent with the concept of self-regulation. We conclude that mosaics of microsite types maintain biodiversity of speciose, disturbance-prone ecosystems through both isolating mechanisms (in seed-poor microsites with negligible competition) and compensatory self-regulation mechanisms (in species-rich microsites with intense competition).

AB  - Plastic pollution is recognized as a severe anthropogenic issue in the coastal and marine ecosystems across the world. Unprecedented and continuous accumulation of growing plastic contaminants into any respective aquatic ecosystem by the anthropogenic sources causes direct and/or indirect interruption to ecosystem structure, functions, and consequently, services and values. Land-based and sea-based sources are the primary sources of these contaminants in various modes that enter the ocean. In this review paper, we focused on highlighting different aspects related to plastic pollution in coastal and marine environments. Plastic pollutants are distributed in the ecosystems in different forms, with different size variations as megaplastic, macroplastic, mesoplastic, and microplastic. Microplastics in primary and secondary forms reveal a widespread distribution in the water, sediment, and biota of the marine and coastal habitats. The microplastic level of different coastal and marine ecosystems nearly ranged from 0.001-140 particles/m(3) in water and 0.2-8766 particles/m(3) in sediments at different aquatic environments over the world. The microplastic accumulation rate of coastal and marine organisms varied at 0.1-15,033 counts. Accordingly, plastic pollution creates several kinds of negative consequences combined with ecological and socio-economic effects. Entanglement, toxicological effects via ingestion of plastics, suffocation, starvation, dispersal, and rafting of organisms, provision of new habitats, and introduction of invasive species are significant ecological effects with growing threats to biodiversity and trophic relationships. Degradation (changes in the ecosystem state) and modifications of marine systems are associated with loss of ecosystem services and values. Consequently, this emerging contaminant affects the socio-economic aspects through negative impacts on tourism, fishery, shipping, and human health. Preventing accumulation sources of plastic pollutants, 3Rs (Reduce Recycle-Reuse), awareness & capacity building, and producer/manufacturer responsibility are practical approaches toward addressing the issue of plastic pollution. Existing and adopted policies, legislations, regulations, and initiatives at global, regional, and national level play a vital role in reducing plastic debris in the marine and coastal zones. Development of proposals/solutions on key research gaps can open a novel pathway to address this environmental issue in an effective scientific manner. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the current status of plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem to make aware people of a plastic-free, healthy blue ocean in the near future.

AB  - Screening is one of the most critical stages in environmental impact assessment (EIA). However, there is no consensus about best approaches to screen development proposals, particularly in large territories with multiple jurisdictions. This study explored the challenges of harmonizing EIA screening criteria across jurisdictions, using Brazilian states as the empirical context. It set out to answer the following question: what would be the screening decisions of approved development projects if they had been licensed in different states? This study selected four cases of projects that had obtained environmental licenses in the state of Minas Gerais, and, based on their data, simulated license applications in other three states in south-eastern Brazil. Interviews helped to determine likely screening decisions. Screening approaches, while similar, varied significantly in terms of choices of threshold criteria across the four states. With the exception of one project type, the projects would face very different EIA requirements in the other jurisdictions. Such differences seem to stem more from political choices than from geographical idiosyncrasies. Implications for policy-making regarding harmonization are discussed.

AB  - Anthropogenic eutrophication can initiate vast and persistent ecosystem state changes in lakes. Such changes may be characterized by increased phytoplankton taxa variability, which can affect the effectiveness and time of lake recovery mechanisms. Lake Morat in Switzerland has undergone intense eutrophication in the twentieth century (phosphorous concentrations up to 150 mu g L-1) caused by excessive nutrient loadings from agricultural intensification and urbanization. Phosphorous reduction measures since 1986, such as the ban of phosphates in detergents and decreased use of fertilizers in agriculture, have resulted in total phosphorous concentrations up to 20 mu g L-1 today. Despite this drastic reduction of total phosphorous, total biomass production stays high. We investigate historical changes in the phytoplankton community during the eutrophication and re-oligotrophication periods by comparing historical limnological data with sediment pigment concentrations measured by HPLC and other geochemical proxies in a radiodated sediment core. For the last 90 years, we identified four major trophic state changes in Lake Morat. The first period (AD 1924-1937) is characterized by low pigment concentrations and nutrient inputs, with good oxygen conditions. This section represents trophic conditions before the intensive eutrophication phase. The second period (AD 1937-1970) revealed an abrupt increase in pigment concentrations with higher primary production, cyanobacteria dominance and reduced oxygen levels. Oscillaxanthin indicated a Planktothrix rubescens dominance (AD 1954-1970) with concentrations up to 800 nmol g(-1) OM. Their decline after AD 1970 suggests the initiation of an intense eutrophication phase (AD 1970-1983) associated with the dominance of other cyanobacteria species, higher total phosphorous inputs, and intense anoxia. In the restoration period (AD 1983-2014), there was a shift in the phototrophic community from cyanobacteria to green algae dominance, yet some cyanobacteria species remain present. Rapid phytoplankton community changes were identified in the studied period, yet overall primary production response was low. Limnological data revealed a delay of phosphorous reduction due to phosphorous recycling from the sediments. The observation of complex lake ecosystem reactions to prolonged eutrophication and subsequent re-oligotrophication, as shown by the paleolimnological and limnological data in this study, emphasize the importance of careful lake management to revert eutrophication back to historical reference biomass values.

AB  - Data mining-the discovery of previously unknown information from a large collection of individual data sources-is becoming increasingly popular for scientific data archives. We describe an approach to data mining that uses spatial, temporal. and type constraints to obtain a broad list of data that are potentially related to it data set of interest. Tree- and spline-based multivariate regression and classification techniques are then used to identify functional relationships between the data. Expert knowledge is used to constrain and guide the model building and evaluation process.
   We demonstrate the approach by identifying relationships between indicators in a state of the Antarctic environment reporting database. Analyses of the fuel usage of electrical generators and boilers at Australia's Davis station yielded fuel usage dependencies on air temperature and wind speed that were in good accordance with known physical processes. The phenomenon of periodic haul-outs of large numbers of leopard seals on Macquarie Island was related to anomalies in regional sea ice cover and sea surface temperature.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to introduce the impact of fishing activity on a marine ecosystem. The fishing activity is considered not only through annual harvest but also through a second component, called the degree of protection of the fishery environment. This characterizes the environmental impact of fishing. A stochastic dynamic programming problem is presented in infinite horizon, where a sole owner seeks to maximize a discounted expected profit. The main hypothesis states that the stock-recruitment relationship is stochastic and that both components of the fishing activity have an impact on the probability law of the state of the fishery environment. The optimal fishing policy is obtained and compared with standard models. This optimal policy has the following properties: is not a constant escapement policy and indicates an element of self-protection by the fishery manager. The paper ends with a discussion on the existence of degrees of protection of the fishery environment that take into account the environmental conservation and preservation of economic activity.

AB  - Ants and dung beetles are focal indicators of change in several ecological processes and successional vegetation stages in Mediterranean landscapes. Despite relatively good knowledge of local species distributions, there are few data on their distributions at different scales. In the present study, the influence of multiscale landscape structure was examined using both ants and dung beetles to identify species that can serve as indicators and detectors of changes in vegetation structure. Multiscale analysis is necessary to explore the different roles of indicator and detector species for use as tools in studies focused on monitoring ecological changes. The study area was the Caballeros National Park, in the center of the Iberian Peninsula. This site was selected because it is a good setting to evaluate the effects of typical vegetation mosaics on Mediterranean species at different scales. In this study, dung beetles and ants were trapped for one year. A multiscale analysis was designed using three different vegetation habitats (forest, scrubland and grassland) and landscape matrices (woodland, scrubland and grassland). Among dung beetles, 23 indicator species (IndVal values higher than 70%) were found at different scales of analysis. In addition, 20 dung beetle species were characterized as detector species (IndVal values between 45 and 70%) for the three different levels analyzed. Similar to the dung beetles, the ants had different species assemblages at various habitats and landscape levels; however, no indicator ant species were found in this study. All species with significant IndVal values (n =8) were identified as detector species. Thus, ant and dung beetle assemblages were influenced in different ways by vegetation structure. Both groups showed strong individual species responses to different Mediterranean landscape conditions and vegetation types. Further, both insect groups showed a great number of detector species, which can be useful in ecosystem management because they have varying degrees of preference and sensitivity for different ecological states (such as successional vegetation stages). The diverse indicator and detector species identified in this work could be useful tools for the detection of landscape structure changes at both levels habitat patches and landscape matrix. However, a generalisation of the results at landscape scale should be taken with precaution, but they encourage to study more regions and similar landscapes. The use of more than one indicator group in the analysis confirms the importance of selecting groups with different sensitivities at varying spatial scales as well as different ecosystem functions. This strategy allows the establishment of a clear baseline with which to analyze future direct and indirect impacts of management in Mediterranean protected areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We propose a coherent regression model building framework to construct fish-based indices. More specifically, we concentrate on the selection of an optimal set of metrics which remains a difficult problem. The paper departs from the observation that an index of biotic integrity (IBI) is analogous to a diagnostic model in medicine assessing the health condition of a patient from a series of biomarkers. In the same vein, an IBI is a diagnostic model predicting the ecosystem condition of a site from a set of (scored) metrics. Metrics are community attributes sensitive to anthropogenic pressure and their scores express the "distance to target" to a reference condition. In a medical context, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are commonly used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of laboratory tests. An ROC curve plots the sensitivity of a test (Se; the capacity to detect a disease or degradation) as a function of its false positive fraction (FPF) which is the complement of the specificity (Sp = 1 - FPF; the capacity to recognise a healthy person or a reference condition). The ROC curve represents the strength of the index to discriminate between degraded and reference sites. Higher curves correspond to stronger tests as then a higher sensitivity can be combined with a lower false positive fraction. Hence, it is intuitively clear to use summary statistics of the ROC curve as criteria to optimise medical tests or biotic indices. In this paper, we illustrate the value of this modelling framework with a case study in the Zeeschelde estuary in Belgium. In essence, a "traditional" IBI is an average of metrics scoring relevant properties of the ecosystem. We demonstrate this average score model (AVG) is a special member of the more flexible predictive logistic model (PLM) family. The selection of a set of metrics becomes equivalent to variable selection in statistical model building. We apply model building techniques as best subsets regression to facilitate the search for an optimal suite of metrics from a candidate set and use cross-validation to avoid overfitting. The results show that a few metrics suffice to discriminate between most-impacted and least-impacted sites. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As it is known, deforestation is a serious socio-environmental issue on a global scale. With indicators that far exceed the global disruptive Latin American and national averages, Salta is one of the most heavily deforested provinces in Argentina. Based on official departmental statistics, scholarly bibliography and journalistic information, this paper seeks to demonstrate that, over the period 1998-2016, the deforestation of the native forest in Salta has constituted a form of expropriation accumulation based on two procedures: deforestation, on the one hand, as a mechanism for destroying pre-capitalist forms of production, land expropriation, expulsion of peasants and aborigines, and increased rural violence and, on the other hand, environmental policies such as mechanisms for the commodification of nature, private appropriation of public resources, and promotion of illegal clearing. Results show loss of 1.4 million hectares of forest areas in Salta to free lands up for the expansion of the agricultural and cattle frontier, and between 2007 and 2016 almost 40% of the cut was illegal. With an epicentre in four departments, this process would imply high levels of socio-environmental conflict, clear state connivance with capital interests, and systemic use of fraud, violence and illegality.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that Steamboat Creek in Nevada is highly contaminated with mercury, with aqueous mercury concentrations more than two orders of magnitude greater than nearby mountain streams. One objective of this study was to determine if the new Spreadsheet-based Ecological Risk Assessment for the Fate of Mercury (SERAFM) model could be calibrated to the concentrations of unfiltered and dissolved total mercury, and unfiltered and dissolved MeHg in the water column for a reach on SBC and a related constructed wetland mesocosm for different seasons and residence times. SERAFM is a new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency steady state, single segment, mass balance mercury model that has been applied to lakes, and this study also examined the model's applicability for modeling an arid flowing water environment in different seasons. The average combined error between observed and model-estimated mercury concentrations was 12% and 17% for the reach and mesocosm, respectively. Some recommendations are proposed that may allow SERAFM to better model flowing systems.

AB  - Thermodynamic indicators, including eco-exergy and structural eco-exergy, have been widely applied to lake ecosystem health assessment in recent decades. In this paper, the index system, including phytoplankton biomass, microzooplankton biomass, trophic state index (TSI), eco-exergy, structural eco-exergy and ecological buffer capacity to total phosphorus for phytoplankton, were applied to assess the health states of fourteen typical water areas in the plant-dominated Baiyangdian Lake. Different types of organisms, including zooplankton, benthonic animals and macrophytes with various denotative meanings, were differentiated to some extent and the latest weighting factors, were used in the eco-exergy and structural eco-exergy calculations for a better characterization of health state. The results showed that only the water area in site 4, with relatively high eco-exergy, structural eco-exergy, ecological buffer capacity and low phytoplankton biomass, microzooplankton biomass and TSI, is in healthy state. Health states of the other water areas were all deteriorated at various degrees due to the human disturbances. The health states of the northeast and southeast water areas were better than those of the northern, central and southern water areas with aquaculture and villages and western water areas close to the Fu River. For the plant-dominated Baiyangdian Lake, combining eco-exergy with structural eco-exergy could better characterize the health state of ecosystem with macrophytes hypermorphosis and meanwhile based on the distinguishing of various organism components, specifically benthonic animals, to some extent for eco-exergy and structural eco-exergy calculations, spatial variations of health state obtained better description, which indicated eco-exergy and structural eco-exergy were the robust indicators for ecosystem health assessment of the plant-dominated lake.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are exceptionally threatened habitats and suffer biodiversity losses that exceed those in any other ecosystem. Small waterbodies have been typically neglected and excluded from conservation strategies, even though they are essential for maintaining freshwater biodiversity. Dragonflies are considered effective surrogates of the diversity of other taxa and bioindicators of the state of aquatic environments. This study compares, in an intensified farmland landscape of western Spain, the capacity of farm ponds to maintain dragonfly diversity by comparing the Odonata communities of the four type of aquatic systems (river, stream, reservoir and farm pond) present in this region, in which the extant of permanent water bodies is scarce. The results showed higher diversity and abundance values in farm ponds than in any other aquatic system, agreeing with previous studies. Also, farm ponds harbour species from every other aquatic system, thereby occupying an intermediate position in the MDS, which demonstrated their potential value to act as stepping stones. Nevertheless, investigation of the dragonfly community composition revealed a generally low degree of ecological integrity of the studied systems, which are negatively impacted by agricultural and livestock farming intensification. These findings support the role of farm ponds in the maintenance of dragonfly diversity in the study area and emphasise the need of a specific legislation to regulate and protect them.

AB  - The Bay of La Paz (BLPZ), located in the southwestern Gulf of California, is a region of significant biological productivity and strong environmental variability that remains to be understood. In particular, the spatial signature of different El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions and their impact on the ecology of the bay remains puzzling because of contrasting field observations. In this context, the available satellite-derived data on surface chlorophyll (ChlSAT), sea surface temperature (SST) derived from the MODIS-Aqua sensor, together with surface wind intensity (WI) derived from reanalysis datasets from the period 2003-2018 were analyzed to identify the influence of local and remote forcing over the interannual variability of chlorophyll pigment concentration in BLPZ using WI, SST, and the Oceanic El Nino Index (ONI) as environmental factors. Significant relationships between environmental factors and ChlSAT were found using exponential models, with the higher slopes and correlations during La Nina events. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was used to extract the principal mode of the ChlSAT and SST interannual variability. The first mode (EOF1) accounted for 64% and 89% of the ChlSAT and the SST interannual variance, respectively, showing a strong gradient along the coast of the bay. The corresponding amplitude of the ChlSAT mode was significantly correlated with the independent variables PC1SST, ONI, and WI anomalies (R-SST = - 0.60, R-ONI = - 0.57, and R-WI = 0.44, P < 0.001). Monthly time series of ChlSAT anomalies along the coast where examined as a function of each independent variable using a multiple linear regression analysis (LRA), which revealed that during the 2005 to 2013 period, high peaks of positive ChlSAT anomalies in the central and southern coast were related to cold ENSO events and favorable wind forcing, which smoothed the effect of weak and moderate El Nino episodes. This period of high biological productivity was only interrupted by the strong and long 2015-2016 El Nino event. Since late 2013, the ChlSAT and the WI anomalies showed a sharp drop to negative anomaly values, which may be the result of complex interactions of physical and biological processes observed during strong warm ENSO events, showing one peak of persistent warm SST anomalies via a weakening of the wind intensity (i.e., from atmospheric teleconnection) and a second one due to the oceanic connection. It is confirmed that BLPZ maintains high pigment concentration levels, comparable to those reported on the mainland coast of GC, where only strong warm ENSO episodes cause changes in chlorophyll concentration.

AB  - Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP), an indicator of ecosystems' ability to capture and convert solar energy, is critical to evaluate and manage ecosystem carbon balance index including rangelands. Measuring ANPP over a large area is difficult at it varies with different factors including climate and anthropogenic, while satellite-based information shows strong opportunity. The aim of this study was to estimate the ANPP of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) using Landsat-8 imagery over the rangelands of HirNeur from Ardabil Province, Iran as a case study area. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images were collected on 9th June 2017 aligning with the field sampling of PFTs ANPP. Eleven sampling sites with 10 plots at each site (locations recorded with a Global Positioning System, GPS) were selected along a transect with elevation gradient and the ANPP of PFTs were recorded. Twenty-two vegetation indices were calculated from the Landsat-8 imagery and the index values were extracted for the sampling plots. Correlation between derived indices and field collected ANPP data were calculated. Predictive relationships between PFTs and total ANPP and satellite indices were developed using a 3rd-order polynomial model and the model was used to map the whole study area. The best estimation of PFTs and total ANPP was obtained using the Vegetation Index (VI3) for grasses (R-2 =0.47), Iron Oxide (IO) for forbs (R-2=0.51), and Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI) for shrubs (R-2= 0.50). The Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) was the best estimator for the total ANPP (R-2=0.49). The overall accuracies of the maps were acceptable (MAE, MDE, RMSE <0.5). Results showed a difference when using PFTs for ANPP estimation in comparison with direct ANPP estimation. Thus, direct estimation of ANPP from the satellite based indices would be more accurate. This study also showed promising capabilities of the indices based on PFTs and total ANPP for estimating aboveground biomass, supply-demand balance and carbon balance at the study area and elsewhere with similar ecological conditions. This study also showed opportunity to select the most appropriate vegetation indices for the estimation of PFTs and the total ANPP. (C) 2020 The Society for Range Management.

TI  - Factors determining the conditions of distribution and quantitative characteristics of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi in the North Caspian
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - An analysis of the hydrochemical characteristics of the aquatic environment, species composition, abundance, and biomass of phyto-, zoo-, and bacterioplankton, and the changes in their indexes of biological diversity was carried out. In addition, the expeditionary and satellite data on chlorophyll a were analyzed to find out the relationship between these characteristics and the pattern of distribution of the invader ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (Agassiz) in the North Caspian Sea. It was shown that Mnemiopsis leidyi is a threat to the ecosystem of the North Caspian Sea only in its southwestern part, where it lives in accordance with the temperature from the latter half of July or the beginning of August probably to the beginning or end of November, and where it can display great outbursts of abundance. In this area, Mnemiopsis leidyi can substantially affect the ecosystem, especially if a great amount of its individuals is driven far northward with water of a salinity greater than 4.3parts per thousand. The area of the northeastern part of the Caspian Sea is not favorable for the viability of Mnemiopsis leidyi. The studies in the area where Mnemiopsis leidyi lives showed that its development results in a complete structural and functional reconstruction of the ecosystem, which, in turn, causes changes in the production-destruction processes. Mnemiopsis leidyi can live and reproduce in areas with high concentrations of zooplankton, which results in a dramatic reduction of the abundance, biomass, and species diversity of the forage zooplankton, including meroplankton. In turn, the decrease in the abundance of zooplankters-phytophages causes an increase in the quantitative characteristics of phytoplankton, its structure, and biodiversity. The products of Mnemiopsis leidyi activity utilized by zooplankton affect the content of nutrients and other hydrochemical parameters of the aquatic environment. Therefore, due to the feeding on herbivorous zooplankton, the excretion of nutrients, and the secretion of mucous, Mnemiopsis leidyi indirectly regulates the dynamics of phytoplankton, chlorophyll, and microplankton during the summer period. Summarizing the data obtained, we can conclude that, in the North Caspian, in the areas where the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi creates aggregates, it impacts, in one way or another, all levels of the ecosystem, creating "cascade" effect. On the one hand, this occurs from the bottom to the top over the trophic levels of the ecosystem, namely, from the increase in the contents of nutrients, which stimulates the phytoplankton growth and, then, feeding on zooplankton as forage organisms for plankton-eating fishes (Clupeonella genus) resulting in the drop in their stocks, to predatory fish and seals, which feed on plankton-eating fishes. On the other hand, there is some control from the top to the bottom over the trophic levels, namely, the pronounced decrease in the zooplankton abundance causes a decline in the pressure on phytoplankton, which results in the growth of the phytoplankton content together with an increase in the chlorophyll concentration.

AB  - This paper evaluates the trends in pesticide use with special emphasis on the state and progress of environmental toxic-risk-reduction initiatives taken in Japan. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) pesticide-use indicator was used to assess changes in the last 15 years (1985-2000). The total amount of active ingredients used in pesticides increased by 9% between 1985/87 and 1998/00. The change was mainly due to the increase in fungicide use (89%) and the decline in insecticide (7%) and herbicide (42%) use. The change in pesticides used was largely associated with the amount (kg/ha) used in paddy cultivation. The environmental toxicity of herbicides also decreased substantially. Larger numbers of active ingredients were used in pesticides in 1998/00 compared with 1985/87, but the newly added active ingredients are less toxic than those used previously.

AB  - Sediments serve as an indicator of the state of the environment, as they reveal, anthropogenic influences (e.g. industry) over time. The knowledge about the composition of sediments, in particular by the speciation, helps in the assessment of the environmental situation. The speciation of mercury in sediments is still being discussed and continues to pose a great challenge for analytical chemists. Despite a broad number of publications in this area, there is no gold-standard about the speciation of mercury in sediments. The reason for this is the growing interest in new, better methods for the speciation of mercury, which increases the number of publications and the uncertainty among the analysts. Therefore, the methodology of mercury speciation in sediments requires improvement and would benefit from a standardized approach. The goal of this review is to give an overview of the existing methods and to discuss the issues of methodology. Discussed parts in this review article include: (1) available reference material, (2) the methodology of extraction, (3) enrichment procedures, (4) separation and (5) detection.

AB  - Atmospherically-transported trace metals can play an important role in biogeochemical cycles in the Mediterranean Sea. However, although the magnitude of trace metal air to sea fluxes is initially dependent on the metal concentrations in the air, it is the ''chemical character'' of the aerosol which constrains the fate of the metals in sea water; for example, the solubility of trace metals is considerably greater from anthropogenic than from crustal components. To a first approximation the chemical composition of the Mediterranean particulate aerosol is controlled by the extent to which an anthropogenic-rich ''background'' material, having a mainly European origin, is perturbed by mixing with crustal components having a desert origin. These perturbations offer an environmentally meaningful index which can be used to define the ''chemical character'' of the Mediterranean particulate aerosol in terms of the manner in which trace metals are partitioned between the anthropogenic and crustal components.
   This ''chemical character'' concept was assessed using: a) a total of 83 particulate aerosols collected on a W --> E transect across the Mediterranean Sea and surrounding regions; and b) particulate aerosol populations from a number of adjacent coastal seas. The crustal component in the samples was assumed to have the composition of the average crust and trace metals in excess of their crustal metal:Al ratios were assigned to a European aerosol ''background'' component (EABC). It was found that the average Zn:Cu, Zn:Ni, Zn:Cr and Zn:Mn ratios in the EABC indicate that it has a composition which is generally similar to the average anthropogenic background emissions of trace metals over Europe.
   The extent to which the EABC is affected by mixing with crustal material in the particulate aerosols was estimated using enrichment factors in which Al is employed as the source indicator; thus, EF(crst) = (C(xp)/C(Alp))/(C(XC)/C(Alc)), in which C(XP) and C(Alp) are the concentrations of an element x and Al, respectively, in the aerosol, and C(XC)c and C(Alc) are their concentrations in average crustal material. Elements which have EF(crust) values < 10 in a particulate aerosol are assumed to have a significant crustal source and are termed non-enriched elements (NEEs), and those which have EF(crust) > 10 are assumed to have a significant non-crustal source and are termed anomalously enriched elements (AEEs).
   For a particulate aerosol composed of crustal and anthropogenic components the EF(crust) values of the AEEs will be reduced as the proportions of crustal material increase. When this is expressed in the form of an EF diagram, in which the EF(crust) values of a trace metal in a particulate aerosol population are plotted against the concentrations of Al, the particulate aerosols from the atmosphere of the Mediterranean Sea and surrounding regions can be described in terms of the extent to which the EABC is mixed with, and diluted by, crust-rich components. Under certain conditions the ''mixing relationship'' is distorted by relatively large inputs of either: a) crust-rich components, or b) urban-rich material having a local origin. However, the overall ''chemical character'' of the aerosols can be assessed on the basis of the EF(crust) values of the AEEs Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni and Cr.

AB  - The Warta River (795 km long) is the largest, right side tributary of the Odra (Oder) River. The study presents results from one of the best-documented long-term monitoring projects in Poland based on four terms of electro-fishing: 1963-66, 1986-88, 1996-98 and 2011-12, conducted in the upper Warta. The Warta River underwent human-induced modifications typical for most European lowland rivers (damming, regulation, water pollution), of which the most destructive for fish was point-source water pollution. In the late 1980s, pollution reached its highest level and stopped increasing as the former political system collapsed and many industrial plants went bankrupt. Surprisingly, recovered fish assemblages were not recorded during the sampling in 1996-98, but in 2011-12. This is why we believe that in large degraded rivers, it takes about 10-20 years before a considerable improvement in fish fauna can be observed. Ichthyofauna recovered to a good status, but was qualitatively different compared to the good status observed in the 1960s. On the one hand, in 2011-12, high species richness and high assemblage diversity were observed, and many species, including seven rheophils, were more common than earlier. On the other hand, the populations of catadromous eel and anadromous vimba have not recovered, and these species were absent in the 2011-12 samples. Because water quality has improved, the most important factor seems to be the impact of the Jeziorsko dam reservoir which is located downstream of the study area and has no fish pass.
   The above patterns were recognised in this paper with a Kohonen artificial neural network, which is a tool methodically correct for analysing complex non-linear relations. Additionally, indicator species analysis allowed for the identification of significant associations of taxa with specific environmental states and was helpful in determination of ecological statuses of the river stretches. We therefore recommend the combined use of Kohonen artificial neural networks and indicator species analysis in long-term monitoring analyses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - At present, more than ever, the question of the interaction of man and nature is acute. Large-scale deforestation, soil pollution, the discharge of hazardous chemicals into the hydrosphere and emissions of toxic gases into the atmosphere, as well as radioactive pollution, lead to the development of global environmental ones. Together, all of the above leads to the depletion of natural resources and the extinction of living organisms. Due to the aggravation of environmental safety problems throughout the world, conducting internal environmental audits at enterprises is becoming increasingly important. Environmental internal audit involves the involvement of the company in continuous monitoring of the state of the environment and measurement of its impact. It requires competent functioning and interaction among themselves at the enterprise of an audit and accounting system that would fully take into account all environmental factors and impacts, as well as be able to generate easily transmitted and adaptable information and indicators. In turn, in order to organize these two processes and reduce the environmental impact, an environmental management system is required, including, inter alia, just an internal environmental audit. In this regard, it is important to develop a procedure for conducting an internal audit of operations to ensure the environmental safety of business entities. This article outlines the issues of forming the technology of internal audit in the environmental aspect.

AB  - Methods and indicators are needed to assess the urban ecosystem health status, amongst which energy and material metabolism should be integrated to enhance understanding of ecological patterns and processes of urban ecosystems. Therefore, emergy synthesis combining energetics with systems ecology is applied to assess systematically the health status of urban ecosystems. Combining ecosystem health levels with spatial geographical information of different land use subsystems, the spatial distribution of urban ecosystem health is obtained, which is helpful for urban ecological regulation and spatial optimization. Taking the situation of Guangzhou, China in 2005 as a case study, the relative health states based on emergy indicators and set pair analysis is evaluated. Results show that the health levels of the cultivated land, as well as areas with middle and low density buildings are relatively positive, while that of high density building and traffic areas are relatively weak. Through analysis of different land use subsystems, required factors of a healthy ecosystem are summarized, including moderate economic productivity but without much exploitation and disturbance, reasonable structure of energy and resources usage, medium resilience under pressure, moderate ecosystem service provisioning, and small environmental impact on surroundings. The spatial distribution of urban ecosystem health states is also obtained, such that the northern part of Guangzhou is defined as the conservation area, the middle and southern parts are defined as the maintenance area, while the south central and south western parts are defined as the key regulation area where a suitable scheme should be implemented to control the population density and resolve the concomitant problems. Moreover, the impact power of different indicators on the final health status is classified into five levels when combining the indicator weights with the main assessment factors of urban ecosystem health, which is useful for defining the regulation priority amongst a few indicators.

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyse the growth of a sample of 31 nonadult individuals buried in an unusual way in Valle da Gafaria (Lagos, Portugal) between the 15th and 17th centuries. The archaeological and historical context of the skeletal collection (N=158), the morphological traits of the skulls, and the presence of intentionally modified teeth in some individuals led to the conclusion that they were African slaves. The study of past populations' growth has been an essential component of the bioanthropological investigations because it is a good indicator of the health state and environment conditions in which human populations have lived. Attending to the hypothesis that differences between skeletal and dental age estimations are indicative of growth delay, it is pertinent to understand if these enslaved nonadult individuals were exposed to harsh environmental conditions. Dental age was estimated on the basis of dental development, that is, dental calcification and the sequence of formation and eruption of teeth. Skeletal age was evaluated in accordance to the long bones lengths. Non-specific stress indicators, namely, cribra orbitalia, cribra humeralis, cribra femoralis, porotic hyperostosis, and enamel hypoplasia, were considered as markers of physiological disturbances. The age estimates obtained by the two dental methods were consistent in 79.2% of the individuals. On the other hand, the estimates obtained by osteometric and dental methods were consistent in 75.9% (osteometric vs. sequence of formation and eruption of teeth) and 65.2% (osteometric vs. dental calcification), the osteometric providing younger ages. The relatively low concordance between the age estimations was corroborated by the Cohen's Kappa coefficients. These results along with the high frequencies of cribra orbitalia (87.0%), cribra femoralis (85.7%), cribra humeralis (44.4%), porotic hyperostosis (43.3%), and enamel hypoplasia (70.0%) make evident the difficulties experienced by these individuals during their short lives.

AB  - This paper considers the role which selfish, moral and social incentives and pressures play in explaining the extent to which stated choices over pro-environment behaviours vary across individuals. The empirical context is choices over household waste contracts and recycling actions in Poland. A theoretical model is used to show how cost-based motives and the desire for a positive self and social image combine to determine the utility from alternative choices of recycling behaviour. We then describe a discrete choice experiment designed to empirically investigate the effects such drivers have on stated choices. A hybrid logit model is used to link statements over attitudes to recycling to choices, dealing with a potential endogeneity problem caused by the joint effects of un-observables on attitudes and choices. We find that a substantial share of our respondents prefer to sort their waste at home rather than in a central sorting facility. This preference is associated with a moral/intrinsic motivation, involving a belief that sorting at home is more thorough than central sorting.

AB  - Nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminants that are chemical mixtures often contain compounds that are solids in their pure states. In the environment, weathering processes cause shifts in multicomponent NAPL composition, thereby enriching the NAPL in the less soluble compounds which may result in their eventual solidification. In this paper, we review the thermodynamic theory governing solid-liquid phase equilibria for the multicomponent NAPLs, and we present experimental observations of such phase equilibria for binary, ternary, and quaternary mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). If the NAPL phase behaves as an ideal solution and if the solid precipitate is pure, then a compound's mole fraction solubility limit in the NAPL phase equals its solid-liquid reference fugacity ratio. This value is a constant at the temperature of the system. If the NAPL phase is a non-ideal solvent or if the solid is a solid solution, prediction of NAPL solidification in the environment is considerably more difficult. Experimental results indicate that for compounds such as naphthalene and acenaphthene, the solid-liquid reference fugacity ratio serves as a good indicator of the solubility limits in the NAPL phase. For phenanthrene, the solids that form when this compound exceeds its solubility limit are solid solutions that consistently include large portions of 2-methylnaphthalene. These results suggest that the independent behavior implied by ideal solubility theory may not be an accurate descriptor of NAPL solidification phenomena for all PAH-containing NAPLs.

AB  - Scarcity of natural resources and productive land is a global issue affecting the provision of goods and services at the country scale. This is particularly true for small regions with highly developed economies such as Luxembourg, which usually balance the chronic unavailability of resources (in particular with regard to fossil fuels) with an increasing demand of imported raw materials, energy and manufactured commodities. Based on historical time-series analysis (from 1995 to 2009), this paper determines the state of natural capital (NC) utilization in Luxembourg and estimates its ecological deficit (ED). Accordingly, solar energy demand (SED) and ecological footprint (EF) for Luxembourg have been initially calculated based on a recently developed country-specific environmentally extended input-output model. Thereafter, these indicators have been compared to the corresponding annual trends of potential NC (estimated using the emergy concept) and biocapacity, respectively. Results show that the trends in ED and in the use of NC in Luxembourg have not increased substantially during the years surveyed. However, the estimates also highlight that the NC of Luxembourg is directly and indirectly overused by a factor higher than 20, while circa 9 additional 'Luxembourg states' would be ideally necessary to satisfy the current land's requirements of the country and thus balance the impact induced by the EF. An in-depth analysis of the methodological advantages and limitations behind our modelling approach has been performed to validate our findings and propose a road map to improve the environmental accounting for NC and biocapacity in Luxembourg.

AB  - Opsanus beta is a permanent species in the Alvarado Lagoon System (ALS), Veracruz, and eventhough it is not of economic importance, it might be actively involved in the energy transfer of the system. Currently, there is no information about the reproductive and ecological characteristics of this common fish, so this work aimed to evaluate those aspects, and to contribute with some ecological features. For this, a total of six sampling sites were selected and studied from April 2008 to December 2012. Per site, we determined fish seasonality, feeding, sex ratio, gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic and condition factors for both sexes, as well as the fecundity and length-weight relationships. We also considered some environmental parameters such as temperature, water temperature, depth, salinity and pH. Our results on the environmental parameters analysis did not show significant differences for the study period; besides, salinity data confirmed an oligohaline environment, and the rest of the physico-chemical parameters, varied in accordance with the climatic pattern in the area. We captured a total of 519 fishes, 311 (59.9 %) males and 208 (41.1 %) females; the proportion of males resulted favorable against females throughout the study. The standard length found along the study period showed that the average was higher in males than in females. The trophic spectrum was composed of 13 food items, principally crustaceans, molluscs and fishes; in addition, cannibalism was observed over young individuals during March and April. The most advanced stages of gonadal maturation were recorded from November to March for males, and from November to February in females; generally, the Gonadosomatic index (IGS) recorded the highest values from November to April. The Hepatosomatic Index (IHS) and the Condition Factor (FC) presented an inverse relationship with the Gonadosomatic index (IGS). The fecundity of this species ranged from 96 to 428 oocytes per female. The weight-length relationship by sexes and seasons, showed a higher growth rate for males than for females, and an allometric growth type. The biological and ecological information of O. beta in ALS evidenced the importance of this species and its ecological role in the structure and dynamics of these aquatic communities. This species may be used as a model for future proposals dealing with the management and sustainable use of this ecosystem.

AB  - Ecological indicators have widespread appeal to scientists, environmental managers, and the general public. Indicators have long been used to detect changes in nature, but the scientific maturation in indicator development primarily has occurred in the past 40 years. Currently, indicators are mainly used to assess the condition of the environment, as early-warning signals of ecological problems, and as barometers for trends in ecological resources. Use of ecological indicators requires clearly stated objectives; the recognition of spatial and temporal scales; assessments of statistical variability, precision, and accuracy; linkages with specific stressors; and coupling with economic and social indicators. Legislatively mandated use of ecological indicators occurs in many countries worldwide and is included in international accords. As scientific advancements and innovation in the development and use of ecological indicators continue through applications of molecular biology, computer technology such as geographic information systems, data management such as bioinformatics, and remote sensing, our ability to apply ecological indicators to detect signals of environmental change will be substantially enhanced.

AB  - Much work had been undertaken on tracking change in the condition of marine pelagic ecosystems and on identifying regime shifts. However, it is also necessary to relate change to states of good ecosystem health or what the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) calls "Good Environmental Status" (GES). Drawing on existing scientific and legislative principles, including those of OSPAR's "Strategy to Combat Eutrophication," we propose a framework for assessing the status of what the MSFD calls the "pelagic habitat" in temperate coastal seas. The framework uses knowledge of local ecohydrodynamic conditions, especially those relating to the stratification and optical environment, to guide expectations of what would be recognized as healthy in terms of ecosystem "organization" and "vigor." We apply this framework to the seasonally stratified regime of the Western Irish Sea, drawing on published and new work on stratification, nutrient, and phytoplankton seasonal cycles, zooplankton, and the implications of plankton community structure and production for higher trophic levels. We conclude that, despite human pressures including nutrient enrichment, and the food-web effects of fisheries, the pelagic ecosystem here is in GES, and hence may be used as a reference for the "Plankton Index" method of tracking change in state space in seasonally stratified waters.

AB  - Reference conditions are a key concept in the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The WFD stipulates that the ecological status of a given water body shall be assessed by quantifying the deviation from a set of reference conditions that represent the stable state of an ecosystem in the absence of significant human disturbance. This concept is subject to criticism from several authors, particularly because underlying ecological concepts are weak and the distinction between natural variability and the effects of anthropogenic activities on ecosystem function will become increasingly artificial. In this paper, a sociologist and an aquatic ecologist examine the origin, successes and limits of the reference conditions concept and raise important questions about applying this concept in practice. We argue that this concept fitted specific needs from different institutions and stakeholders which promoted the WFD. Monitoring practices using this concept require some adaptations. Setting goals for restoration based on reference conditions is more problematic. A more adaptive management approach would be wiser. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article presents the results of lichenological studies at the territories of Meshchersky National Park (Klepiky district and Ryazan district of the Ryazan Region, Russia) and Meshchera National Park (Gus-Khrustalny district of the Vladimir Region, Russia). Both Protected Areas represent an entire natural-anthropogenic area created in 1992 to preserve the unique forests and wetlands of the Meshchera Lowland, and to restore forest-marsh territories damaged by draining and long-term extraction of peat. Both the national parks are located in the centre of the Meshchera Lowland, in the basin of the River Pra (left-side tributary of the River Oka), and its tributaries-the River Buzha and the River Pol. In 2008-2018, we studied the lichen diversity using the traditional route method with more detailed studies within 64 sample plots. The following habitat types were inspected: pine forests, mixed forests and small-leaved forests, floodplain oak forest, swamps, meadows and heaths, shores of water bodies, and anthropogenic biotopes. Material of previous studies was also included in the analysis. An annotated list included 199 lichen species and eight non-lichenised fungus-related species which are traditionally counted in lichen lists. They belong to 88 genera and 43 families. The similarity of the lichen lists of the two national parks is 0.63 according to the Sorensen-Dice index. Cladonia bacilliformis, Lecania naegelii, Peltigera polydactylon, Porpidia crustulata, Pycnora praestabilis, and Xylopsora caradocensis were new species for the Vladimir region. Cladonia bacilliformis, C. cervicornis, C. floerkeana, and Stictis mollis were new species for the Ryazan region. Cetraria ericetorum, Cladonia bacilliformis, C. cervicornis, C. floerkeana, Peltigera extenuata, Stictis mollis were new species for the Meshchersky National Park. Chaenotheca furfuracea, Cladonia bacilliformis, Lecania naegelii, Peltigera polydactylon, Porpidia crustulata, Pycnora praestabilis, Xylopsora caradocensis were new for the Meshchera National Park. Acrocordia gemmata, Bacidia rubella, Chaenotheca stemonea, Chaenothecopsis pusiola, and Cladonia parasitica were considered as indicators of old-growth and undisturbed forests. Four rare species (Bryoria fuscescens, B. nadvornikiana, Cetraria ericetorum, and Peltigera extenuata) are listed in the Red Data Book of the Ryazan region. The following 19 species are rare for the centre of European Russia: Absconditella delutula, Acarospora versicolor, Arthonia fusca, Bacidia friesii, Biatora albohyalina, Cladonia sulphurina, Lecania suavis, Lecanora fuscescens, Micarea erratica, Microcalicium ahlneri, Ochrolechia androgyna, Porpidia soredizodes, Rhizocarpon reductum, Stictis mollis, Thelocarpon laureri, Thelloma ocellatum, Toninia athallina, Trapelia placodioides, and Xanthoparmelia stenophylla. In total, the species richness of lichen biotas in both national parks is equivalent to that in the Oka State Nature Reserve (208 species).

AB  - A carbon paste electrode for drotaverine hydrochloride (DvCl) was prepared and fully characterized in terms of composition, life span, usable pH range, response time and temperature. The electrode was applied to the potentiometric determination of drota-veriniumions in pharmaceutical preparations and biological fluids in steady state and flow injection conditions (FIA). The electrode is based on a mixture of two ion exchangers, namely, drotaverinium-silicotungestate and drotaverinium-tetraphenylborate dissolved in tricresyl phosphate as pasting liquid. The modified electrode showed a near-Nernstian slope of 59.34 +/- 2mV over the concentration range of 5.0 x 10(-7) - 1.0 x 10(-2) M. The electrode exhibits good selectivity for DvCl with respect to a large number of inorganic cations, organic cations, sugars and amino acids. Potentiometric titrations of DvCl with several titrants have been monitored using this modified carbon paste electrode as an end-point indicator electrode. The proposed electrode offers the advantages of simplicity, accuracy, automation feasibility and applicability to turbid and colored samples.

AB  - An essential tension can be found between researchers interested in ecological validity and those concerned with maintaining experimental control. Research in the human neurosciences often involves the use of simple and static stimuli lacking many of the potentially important aspects of real world activities and interactions. While this research is valuable, there is a growing interest in the human neurosciences to use cues about target states in the real world via multimodal scenarios that involve visual, semantic, and prosodic information. These scenarios should include dynamic stimuli presented concurrently or serially in a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carried out by perceivers over time. Furthermore, there is growing interest in contextually embedded stimuli that can constrain participant interpretations of cues about a target's internal states. Virtual reality environments proffer assessment paradigms that combine the experimental control of laboratory measures with emotionally engaging background narratives to enhance affective experience and social interactions. The present review highlights the potential of virtual reality environments for enhanced ecological validity in the clinical, affective, and social neurosciences.

AB  - The Southern California Bight (SCB) is a unique ecological and economic resource, home to some of the most productive coastal ecosystems, but also some of largest pollutant inputs in the United States. Historically, environmental monitoring of the coastal environment has been temporally intensive, but spatially focused on narrow areas closest to regulated discharges, providing a potentially biased perspective of overall coastal sediment quality. Beginning in 1994 and conducted approximately every five years thereafter, nearly 100 regulated, regulatory, non-governmental or academic organizations join forces to implement the SCB Regional Marine Monitoring Program (the Bight Program). The most recent Bight program sampled nearly 400 locations, from the head of tide in coastal estuaries to offshore basins 1000min depth, using a probabilistic survey design and measuring multiple indicators of sediment quality including chemistry, toxicity, and infauna. The three indicators were scored using regionally-developed assessment tools, and then combined for an integrated assessment of sediment quality. Results showed that the vast majority of SCB sediments do not have impacted sediment quality, but that not all habitats are in equally good condition. Most of the continental shelf is not impacted, despite the discharge of very large volumes (109 L/day) of treated wastewater discharges. In contrast, up to 50% of the area in estuaries and 45% of the area in marinas have impacted sediment quality. These generally quiescent waterbodies receive pollutant inputs from the region's extensively urbanized watersheds and high density of boating activities. Despite the relatively large extent of impacted sediment quality in embayments, sediment quality has been steadily improving in this habitat over the last decade based on surveys dating back to the 1998. The Bight Program has affected management actions in the region by focusing current efforts in habitats most impacted by poor sediment quality, and highlighting the improvements from previous management actions.

AB  - A study was taken in a 1566 ha watershed situated in the Capivara River basin, municipality of Botucatu, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. This environment is fragile and can be subjected to different forms of negative impacts, among them soil erosion by water. The main objective of the research was to develop a methodology for the assessment of soil erosion fragility at the various different watershed positions, using the geographic information system ILWIS version 3.3 for Windows. An impact model was created to generate the soil's erosion fragility plan, based on four indicators of fragility to water erosion: land use and cover, slope, percentage of soil fine sand and accumulated water flow. Thematic plans were generated in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. First, all the variables, except land use and cover, were described by continuous numerical plans in a raster structure. The land use and cover plan was also represented by numerical values associated with the weights attributed to each class, starting from a pairwise comparison matrix and using the analytical hierarchy process. A final field check was done to record evidence of erosive processes in the areas indicated as presenting the highest levels of fragility, i.e., sites with steep slopes, high percentage of soil fine sand, tendency to accumulate surface water flow, and sites of pastureland. The methodology used in the environmental problems diagnosis of the study area can be employed at places with similar relief, soil and climatic conditions.

AB  - Parc Natural s'Albufera de Mallorca is an internationally recognised resting area for a wide array of migratory birds, and like most wetlands it has many other ecological functions and socio-economic values. In the catchment, in which the wetland is situated, expanding tourism and intensification of agriculture place much pressure on a limited amount of freshwater. The freshwater supply to the wetland decreased due to water-extraction mainly driven by intensification of agriculture in the catchment. As a result saltwater intrusion increased since 1983-1985. This had considerable impacts on the ecological integrity of the wetland as reflected by changes in the state of the aquatic ecosystem. The distribution of submerged plants, less tolerant of salinity, declined or disappeared, while the distribution of species, known to prefer high salinity increased. As a contribution to the development of monitoring programs and management strategies that address both socio-economic and natural water demand, this article will formulate ecological criteria to assess the natural water demand by selection of (bio) indicators within the aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - A short (50-cm-long) sediment core from Ebinur Lake in arid central Asia has been analyzed for various environmental proxies, including organic matter content, delta C-13 in organic matter, magnetic susceptibility, heavy metal contents, and stable isotopic compositions of bulk carbonate (delta O-18 and delta C-13). The results reveal that the evolutionary stages inferred from environmental indicators have an asynchronous nature. If the asynchrony of periodic changes in multi-environmental proxies is ignored, important information may be lost, especially regarding anthropogenic influences. On the basis of magnetic susceptibility and heavy metal contents, human activities appear to have resulted in increases in surface erosion and measurable heavy-metal accumulation from the mid-1960s, whereas the organic matter contents, which display an obvious shift in the late 1930s, correlate with regional climate. However, the changes in the stable isotopes of bulk carbonate are mainly controlled by the isotopic composition of the host water which is generally consistent with the lake level. From the late 1870s to the 1960s, the lake was in a natural evolutionary state. From the 1960s to the mid-2000s, the runoff feeding Ebinur Lake dropped rapidly, in association with a sharp increase in agricultural development. Finally, beginning in the early twenty-first century, the climate became wetter than during the earlier two stages, and as agricultural water demand decreased, surface runoff once again increased. It is noted that, although the different proxies respond differently to climate changes and human activities, any analysis of environmental evolution should consider them each individually, in order to fully understand the complex interactions between climate and human influence.

AB  - The Scots pine is often used in the biomonitoring of forests. Studies on the chemical composition plus variability of its needles morphological structure allow for an assessment of the state of environmental pollution. However, in their natural populations, the response of individual trees to stress differs. This study reports on the influence of long-term soil contamination with trace elements on the morphology of the needles, its possible relation to the differentiation of the genetic pool, and their implications for biomonitoring. In the natural and self-renewable pine stand growing near the point polluter (zinc smelter, Upper Silesia, Poland), two categories of trees are observed with respect to their health status: pollution-tolerant (T) and pollution-sensitive (S). A detailed analysis of the trace element content of the needles reveals that the concentration of Cd, Zn, Pb, and Cu in the needles is significantly higher in S as compared to T individuals. The metal accumulation pattern decidedly follows the sequence Pb > Cd > Cu > Zn. An analysis of the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of the needles reveals that sensitive trees showed an FA index ten times higher in comparison to tolerant ones. Moreover, the high differences between these S and T tree groups are also observed in the basic genetic diversity parameters investigated by an analysis of DNA simple sequence repeats (SSR). The concentration of trace elements in pine needles, distinct in sensitive and tolerant trees and in connection with their morphological and genetic characteristics, may reflect an adaptation process. The level of Mg and Fe content in the needles could be a physiological-toxicological index for evaluating trace element "lethality" expressed as Mg and Fe mineral-survival strategies. The example of differences described in this Scots pine population should be taken into consideration in ecotoxicological research to better interpret the obtained results.

AB  - States of ecological maturity and temporal trends of drylands in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia north of 28 degrees N are reported for 1998-2008. The input data were Normalized Difference Vegetation Index databases and corresponding climate fields, at a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of one month. States convey opposing dynamics of human exploitation and ecological succession. They were identified synchronically for the full period by comparing each location to all other locations in the study area under equivalent aridity. Rain Use Efficiency (RUE) at two temporal scales was used to estimate proxies for biomass and turnover rate. Biomass trends were determined for every location by stepwise regression using time and aridity as predictors. This enabled human-induced degradation to be separated from simple responses to interannual climate variation. Some relevant findings include large areas of degraded land, albeit improving over time or fluctuating with climate, but rarely degrading further; smaller, but significant areas of mature and reference vegetation in most climate zones; very low overall active degradation rates throughout the area during the decade observed; biomass accumulation over time exceeding depletion in most zones; and negative feedback between land states and trends suggesting overall landscape persistence. Semiarid zones were found to be the most vulnerable. Those results can be disaggregated by country or province. The combination with existing land cover maps and national forest inventories leads to the information required by the two progress indicators associated with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification strategic objective to improve the conditions of ecosystems and with the Sustainable Development Goal Target 15.3 to achieve land degradation neutrality. Beyond that, the results are also useful as a basis for land management and restoration.

AB  - Reservoirs hold a detailed record of the changes in the input of sediments and nutrients over decades to centuries. Paleolimnological multi-proxy analysis makes it possible to reconstruct baseline conditions to infer early evidence of environmental change. Our study aims to reconstruct historical human impacts derived from urban development on the San Roque reservoir (Cordoba, Argentina) related to the centennial dynamics of sedimentary and eutrophication processes.
   A paleolimnological record, dated by Pb-210 and Cs-137, made it possible to identify two stages during the environmental evolution of the San Roque reservoir. Physical processes, such as fluvial discharge and water level variation, dominantly ruled stage 1 (Unit C) during the initial infilling of the reservoir. Nutrient load and eutrophication processes controlled stage 2 (Units B and A). Stage 1 (77-55 cm; AD 1921 to 1965) occurred before and after the second dam was built and while the level of water increased by approximate to + 8 m; it displayed a high variation in mean grain size and maximum values of magnetic susceptibility. Stage 2 (AD 1965-2017) records a new reservoir base level and the maintenance of high water levels and comparatively more stable conditions. Regarding the eutrophication process throughout stage 2, three sub-stages were defined: a) Sub-stage I (AD 1965-1985) is a period of incipient eutrophication; b) Sub-stage II (AD 1985-2005) is an interval of increase of eutrophication as shown by the increase in several organic proxies related to the abundance of phytoplankton. Echinenone, zeaxanthin and myxoxanthophyll indicate that cyanobacteria increased concentration by three-to four-fold in comparison with the previous sub-stage. c) Sub-stage III (AD 2005-2017) shows the transition to a hypereutrophic state. Diatomea (fuco and diato), dinophyceae (diadino), chlorophyta (lut) and cryptophyta (alto) groups show a comparatively higher contribution.
   Our results mostly highlight that during the last century the main drivers of changes in the environmental state of the San Roque reservoir were trophic, fluvial and hydrometeorological. These results might provide tools for anticipating future scenarios for water management plans under increasing anthropic pressure.

AB  - Armeria arenaria (Pers.) Schult. is a rare littoral species of siliceous Provence (France), growing in a haloresistant plant community. Within protected areas, the habitats of Armeria arenaria are Situated in vulnerable zones where paths for tourists are often installed. Our study focuses oil the ecology and the viability of a population of Armeria arenaria situated in the protected site of cap Lardier and cap Taillat (Var, France). It was based oil an exhaustive cartography of Armeria arenaria denies (sub-populations) and oil demographic structure assessment. The results show that the viability of the denies of Armeria arenaria depends on fine soil and trampling. The latter generates a ground erosion and a strong mortality, even if the maintenance of large size individuals is still possible. The demographic structure could be used as an indicator of the state of conservation of the littoral flora in face of disturbance by human trampling. The floristic releves include ruderal species within the plant community associated with Armeria arenaria, showing the disturbance of this littoral zone.

AB  - The article proves a particular bias in the agricultural land use for assessing the ecological and economic efficiency of only cost indicators. The methodology for evaluating the ecological and economic efficiency of agricultural land use by the energy content of foods is considered. The purpose of the article is to consider the methodology and justification of the practical significance of assessing the environmental and economic efficiency of the agricultural land use by the energy content of products. The article presents the initial data for correlation-regression analysis on the average performance of agricultural producers of Ukraine to determine the weight of each indicator. We used land statistical collections, National reports on the state of the environment in Ukraine for the period 2012-2018. The analysis was carried out based on the average performance indicators of agricultural producers of Ukraine to determine the weight of factors and leverage on the ecological and economic efficiency of agricultural land use. The output of a unit of land in relative terms through exchange energy is not only a kind of indicator, a criterion for the efficient use of agricultural land but also a criterion for the effectiveness of all production activities of agricultural producers, a particular district, and even regions. The main advantage of the proposed approach is the focus on achieving the ultimate goal of agricultural production, which allows us to recommend it for extended use in assessing the ecological and economic efficiency of agricultural land use.

AB  - In order to develop an optical model to map the extent of coastal waters, the authors analyzed variations in bio-optical constituents and submarine optical properties along a transect from the nutrient-enriched coastal bay, Himmerfjarden, out into the open Baltic Sea. The model is a simple implementation of the "ecosystem approach,'' because the optical constituents are proxies for important components of ecosystem state. Yellow substance or colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is often a marker for terrestrial freshwater or decay processes in the littoral zone. Phytoplankton pigments, especially chlorophyll a, are used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass that may be stimulated by fluvial or coastal inputs of anthropogenic nutrients. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) is placed in suspension by tidal or wind-wave stirring of shallow seabeds, and is therefore an indicator for physical forcing. It is the thesis of this article that such constituents, and the optical properties that they control, can be used to provide an ecological definition of the extent of the coastal zone. The spatial distribution of the observations was analyzed using a steady-state model that assumes diffusional transport of bio-optical variables along an axis perpendicular to the coast. According to the model, the resulting distribution along this axis can be described as a low-order polynomial (of order 1-3) when moving from a "source'' associated with land to the open-sea "sink.'' Order 1 implies conservative mixing, and the higher orders imply significant biological or chemical processes within the gradient. The analysis of the transect data confirmed that the trend of each optical component could be described well using a low-order polynomial. Multiple regression analysis was then used to weigh the contribution of each optical component to the spectral attenuation coefficient K-d(490) along the transect. The results showed that in this Swedish Baltic case study, the inorganic fraction of the SPM may be used to distinguish between coastal and open-sea waters, as it showed a clear break between coastal and open-sea waters. Alternative models may be needed for coastal waters in which fronts interrupt the continuity of mixing.

AB  - The indicator properties of zooplankton assemblages in a coastal lagoon were evaluated, by means of canonical correspondence analysis, along environmental gradients of trophic state and marine influence caused by anthropogenic impact. Changes in zooplankton species composition were significant indicators of environmental heterogeneity patterns. Species diversity was insensitive to eutrophication but decreased with increasing marine influence. The rotifer species Brachionus plicatilis and Synchaeta bicornis as well as cirriped nauplii were good indicators of mesohaline conditions. The rotifer species Asplanchna brightwelli, Brachionus angularis, Brachionus falcatus, Filinia terminalis, and Polyarthra remata were good indicators of eutrophic conditions. The other species investigated were good indicators of oligohaline and mesotrophic conditions. The rotifer genus Brachionus proved to be a better indicator organism for these environmental gradients than the entire zooplankton assemblage. Hence, this taxon can be considered a target taxon for more intensive monitoring and conservation planning. The method used here to assess the indicator properties of species assemblages and to select target taxa can be widely applied in any aquatic ecosystems to any group of organisms, spatial and temporal scales, and environmental gradients.

AB  - Lists of invasive alien species (IAS) are essential for preventing, controlling, and reporting on the state of biological invasions. However, these lists suffer from a range of errors, with serious consequences for their use in science, policy, and management. Here we (1) collated and classified errors in IAS listing using a taxonomy of uncertainty; and (2) estimated the size of these errors using data from a completed listing exercise, with the purpose of better understanding, communicating, and dealing with them. Ten errors were identified. Most result from a lack of knowledge or measurement error (epistemic uncertainty), although two were a result of context dependence and vagueness (linguistic uncertainty). Estimates of the size of the effects of these errors were substantial in a number of cases and unknown in others. Most errors, and those with the largest estimated effect, result in underestimates of IAS numbers. However, there are a number of errors where the size and direction of the effect remains poorly understood.
   The effect of differences in opinion between specialists is potentially large, particularly for data-poor taxa and regions, and does not have a clearly directional or consistent effect on the size and composition of IAS lists. Five tactics emerged as important for reducing uncertainty in IAS lists, and while uncertainty will never be removed entirely, these approaches will significantly improve the transparency, repeatability, and comparability of IAS lists. Understanding the errors and uncertainties that occur during the process of listing invasive species, as well as the potential size and nature of their effects on IAS lists, is key to improving the value of these lists for governments, management agencies, and conservationists. Such understanding is increasingly important given positive trends in biological invasion and the associated risks to biodiversity and biosecurity.

AB  - Ecological soil-screening levels (Eco-SSLs) were developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for the purposes of setting conservative soil screening values that can be used to eliminate the need for further ecological assessment for specific analytes at a given site. Ecological soil-screening levels for wildlife represent a simplified dietary exposure model solved in terms of soil concentrations to produce exposure equal to a no-observed-adverse-effect toxicity reference value (TRV). Sensitivity analyses were performed for 6 avian and mammalian model species, and 16 metals/metalloids for which Eco-SSLs have been developed. The relative influence of model parameters was expressed as the absolute value of the range of variation observed in the resulting soil concentration when exposure is equal to the TRV. Rank analysis of variance was used to identify parameters with greatest influence on model output. For both birds and mammals, soil ingestion displayed the broadest overall range (variability), although TRVs consistently had the greatest influence on calculated soil concentrations; bioavailability in food was consistently the least influential parameter, although an important site-specific variable. Relative importance of parameters differed by trophic group. Soil ingestion ranked 2nd for carnivores and herbivores, but was 4th for invertivores. Different patterns were exhibited, depending on which parameter, trophic group, and analyte combination was considered. The approach for TRV selection was also examined in detail, with Cu as the representative analyte. The underlying assumption that generic body-weight-normalized TRVs can be used to derive protective levels for any species is not supported by the data. Whereas the use of site-, species-, and analyte-specific exposure parameters is recommended to reduce variation in exposure estimates (soil protection level), improvement of TRVs is more problematic.

AB  - Environmental education in modern world is becoming an essential element in the harmonious development of society, and each individual in particular. Ecological problems lead to irreversible processes that negatively affect the whole world, therefore, environmental awareness and conscious consumption must be developed already at the college age. The purpose of the article is to study the experience of organizing students' activities in environmental communities to develop an environmental culture and responsibility towards the environment. University is stated to be actively developing in the Ecological Movement field and supports the principles of the "Green" Universities Association in Russia. The article shows a part of students' survey conducted to identify the level of environmental culture development, the level of consumption awareness; and environmental awareness. The survey was organized in 2016 (before the active students' involvement in environmental activities) and in 2017 and 2018 (after the students' environmental movements development). The article considers the results of students' environmental projects. Discussions, interactive and information technologies that were actively used contributed to the students' activities improvement. Large-scale discussions were held among all participants to solve common issues. Partially, the discussions were organized with the help of electronic means. As part of the university environmental activities, students made projects that were subsequently presented at the university competition. The analysis of the environmental projects presentations conducted over several years has shown that the number of projects has increased significantly and has reached the regional and national level. The research found the environmental indicators growth from 2016 to 2018.

AB  - Roughly 90% of butterfly species live in the tropics. Despite this, we know very little about tropical butterfly ecology particularly when compared to temperate butterfly systems. The relative scarcity of data on tropical butterfly populations hampers our ability to effectively conserve them. In this review we summarize recurring themes from ecological research on tropical butterflies to serve as a framework for understanding their conservation. Key themes include: (1) the tropics represent the evolutionary origins of butterfly diversity, (2) while some tropical butterflies exhibit relatively stable population dynamics, longer-lived adult stages, and more continuous age-specific reproduction compared to temperate zone species, the generality of these patterns is debatable, and (3) complex species interactions (e.g. mimicry, parasitism and predation) can have significantly greater influences on ecological and evolutionary processes in tropical butterflies than in temperate ones. This state of ecological knowledge, combined with scarce resources, has traditionally constrained tropical butterfly conservation efforts to habitat level approaches, unlike the species- and population-specific approaches familiar in North America and Europe. Consequently, much conservation research on butterflies in the tropics has focused on the relationship between habitat quality (e.g. forest fragmentation) and butterfly diversity, though predictive patterns even in this regard remain elusive. We argue that with the increasing threats of habitat destruction, fragmentation and climate change, it is necessary to move beyond this diversity and habitat relationship if we are to improve predictive capabilities when evaluating anthropogenic impacts on tropical butterfly communities. Tropical butterflies are more than just useful indicator species. They represent some of the most spectacular and visually appealing organisms in the world and play many vital roles in tropical ecosystems. We hope that this synthesis will lay the groundwork for future ecological studies of tropical butterfly populations, species, communities and conservation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Remote sensing of near-surface hydrological conditions within northern peatlands has the potential to provide important large-scale hydrological information regarding ecological and carbon-balance processes occurring within such systems. This article details how field knowledge of the spectral properties of Sphagnum spp., airborne remote sensing data and a range of image analysis approaches, may be combined to provide a suitable proxy for near-surface wetness. Co-incident field and airborne remote sensing data were acquired in May and September 2002 over an important UK raised bog (Cors Fochno). A combination of laboratory-tested NIR and SWIR water-based and biophysical spectral reflectance indices were applied to field and airborne reflectance spectra of Sphagnum pulchrum to elucidate changes in near-surface moisture conditions. Field results showed significant correlations between water-based indices (moisture stress index (MSI) and floating water band indices (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)))) and measures of both near-surface volumetric moisture content (VMC) and water-table position. Spectral indices formulated from the NIR (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)) proved to be the most useful for indicating near-surface wetness across the widest range of moisture conditions because of their ability to penetrate deeper into the Sphagnum canopy. Correlations between a biophysical index based upon chlorophyll content and both hydrological measures were not significant, possibly due to relatively high levels of surface wetness at the field site in both May and September. S. pulchrum lawns were successfully located and mapped from airborne imagery using the mixed tuned match filtering (MTMF) algorithm. Importantly, MSI derived from airborne data was significantly correlated with both field moisture and the water-table position. Relationships between measures of near-surface wetness and the MSI for naturally heterogeneous canopies were, however, found to be weaker for airborne imagery than for associated field data. This is likely to be a result of the formulation of the MSI itself and the possible preferential detection of "wetter" pixels within the imagery. This effectively reduced the ability of MSI to detect subtle changes in near-surface wetness under high moisture conditions, but would not impede the use of the index under drier conditions. Results from the field data suggest that indices formulated from the NIR may be more suitable for detailed estimations of near-surface and surface wetness at the landscape-scale although reliable hyperspectral data are required to test fully the performance of such indices. The relative merits of using such an approach to determine near-surface hydrological conditions across entire peatland complexes are also discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological modernization (EM) is a contested idea. Most accounts agree EM entails significant state commitment to environmental protection that accommodates environmental values to neoliberal economic growth, emphasizing the use of market mechanisms rather than command-and-control policies. Most analysts believe that less industrialized countries (LICs) have fewer capacities and incentives to adopt and pursue EM policies. We examine this assumption with a focus on the Latin American region and an emphasis on domestic efforts to increase environmental governance capacities. As mostly upper-middle and middle-income resource extractive countries whose governments have acceded to multilateral environmental conventions and adopted some form of environmental governance, Latin America presents key cases of LICs attempting to incorporate environmental values in national governance while heavily invested in neoliberal approaches to economic development. We compare Chile, Brazil, and Mexico along six environmental capacity indicators to appraise domestic performance in the areas of economic development, environmental concern, and public participation, institutional development, and green production. We find that the region is gaining capacity to address environmental challenges, but deepening these environmental gains depends on addressing core problems of poverty and inequality. Environmental capacity is also constrained by trade dependency on a limited number of markets and reliance on the export of primary commodities.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that increasing levels of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), may influence weight gain and thus may play a role in rising trends in obesity and diabetes. We conducted an ecological study to examine the associations between CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and changes in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes in the United States. County-level data on CO2 emissions, prevalence of obesity and diagnosed diabetes, other sociodemographic factors and neighborhood characteristics related to urbanicity, and fine particles (PM2.5) between 2004 and 2008 were obtained from the Vulcan Project, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and American Community Survey. Linear mixed effect modeling of 3019 counties for the associations between average CO2 emissions and changes in diabetes and obesity prevalence between 2004 and 2008 was performed. The average obesity and diabetes prevalence increased between 2004 and 2008 by 3.65% (SD: 1.88%) and 1.65% (SD: 1.70%), respectively. A marginally significant positive association between CO2 emission and changes in obesity prevalence was found with adjustment for sociodemographic factors, indicators of urbanicity and spatial autocorrelation (p-trend = 0.06). The association became weaker and nonsignificant with further adjustment for PM2.5 (p-trend = 0.17). There was a significant positive association between CO2 emission and changes in diabetes prevalence before controlling for PM2.5 (p-trend = 0.05) but the association became null after controlling for PM2.5 (p-trend = 0.49), suggesting that PM2.5 is a critical confounder in the association between CO2 emission and changes in diabetes prevalence. This study does not support the hypothesis that CO2 emissions, a leading driver of climate change, may be linked to increasing trends in obesity and diabetes, though there was an indication of possible link between CO2 and obesity.

AB  - Metabolomics is the systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints of low molecular weight endogenous metabolites or metabolite profiles in a biological sample. Metabolites that are important indicators of physiological or pathological states can provide information for the identification of early and differential markers for disease and help to understand its occurrence and progression. Analysis of these key biomarkers has become an important role to monitor the state of biological organisms and is a widely used diagnostic tool for disease. Metabolomic analyses are propelling the field of medical diagnostics forward at unprecedented rates because of its ability to reliably identify metabolites that are at the metabolic level in concentration. These advancements have benefited biomarker research to the point where saliva is now recognized as an excellent diagnostic medium for the detection of disease. Saliva contains a large array of metabolites, many of which can be informative for the detection of diseases. Salivary diagnostics offer an easy, inexpensive, safe, and noninvasive approach for disease detection. Discovery of salivary biomarkers that could be used to scrutinize health and disease surveillance has addressed its diagnostic value for clinical applications. Availability of emerging metabolomic techniques gives optimism that saliva can eventually be placed as a biomedium for clinical diagnostics. Comprehensive salivary metabolome will be an important resource for researchers who are studying metabolite chemistry, especially in the fields of salivary diagnostics, and will be helpful for analyzing and hence identifying corresponding disease-related salivary biomarkers. This review presents an overview of the value of saliva as a credible diagnostic tool, the discovery of salivary biomarkers, and the development of salivary diagnostics now and in the future. In particular, proof of principle has been demonstrated for salivary biomarker research.

AB  - A survey to assess the status of the Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum) in Texas was conducted in 1992. Museum specimen records were compiled to assess historical distribution and abundance, and 100 sites across the state with adequate historical records were selected to be surveyed for current presence and abundance of the species. Interviews were conducted with local residents concerning potential correlative factors to horned lizard occurrence, and an extensive database compiled from two sighting surveys distributed statewide was also used for the same purpose. Horned lizards, or evidence of their occurrence, were detected at 48 of the survey sites. These results are discussed in relation to current and historic land-use, pesticide use, and the invasion of the Red Imported Fire Ant (Solenopsis invicta). The future of the Texas horned lizard as a component of the natural heritage of the state is discussed. Phrynosoma cornutum serves as an excellent indicator of the general environmental health of terrestrial ecosystems in Texas.

AB  - In recent years fluorescence microscopy has become a widely used tool for tissue imaging and spectroscopy. Optical techniques, based on both linear and non-linear excitation, have been broadly applied to imaging and characterization of biological tissues. Among fluorescence techniques used in tissue imaging applications, in recent years two and three-photon excited fluorescence have gained increased importance because of their high-resolution deep tissue imaging capability inside optically turbid samples. The main limitation of steady-state fluorescence imaging techniques consists in providing only morphological information; functional information is not detectable without technical improvements. A spectroscopic approach, based on lifetime measurement of tissue fluorescence, can provide functional information about tissue conditions, including its environment, red-ox state, and pH, and hence physiological characterization of the tissue under investigation. Measurement of the fluorescence lifetime is a very important issue for characterizing a biological tissue. Deviation of this property from a control value can be taken as an indicator of disorder and/or malignancy in diseased tissues. Even if much work on this topic has still to be done, including the interpretation of fluorescence lifetime data, we believe that this methodology will gain increasing importance in the field of biophotonics. In this paper, we review methodologies, potentials and results obtained by using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy for the investigation of biological tissues.

AB  - The assessment of the rate of eutrophization of waters was carried out based on macrozoobenthos, i.e. organisms adapted to life in bottom sediments. They are considered as an important element of water ecosystems. They participate in organic matter circulation, and are a common food source for fish. Simultaneously, for the past few years in Poland, they have been used to determine water quality with the application of biotic indicators and indexes, i.e. TBI (Trent Biotic Index), BMWP-PL (Biological Monitoring Working Party adapted to Polish conditions), EPT (Ephemeroptera - mayflies, Plecoptera - stoneflies, Trichoptera - caddisflies), as well as the S saprobe index. In addition to determining the ecological status of waters, also the numbers, concentration, and biomass of the determined taxa were analyzed in the scope of this survey.
   The research was carried out on 8 October 2009. Six streams were analyzed, namely: the Niezdobna River, the Lipnicki Creek, the Wilczkowski Creek, the Radacki Canal, the Small Trzesiecki Canal, and the Miasto Canal. On each of the streams, a research site was established, where four qualitative and one quantitative sample was taken.
   In the scope of the research, the total of 30 samples were obtained, with 4187 individuals of macrozoobenthos identified. Organisms belonging to the following taxa were numerous: Bivalvia - mussels, Coleoptera - beetles, Crustacea - crustaceans, Diptera - flies, Ephemeroptera - mayflies, Gastropoda - snails, Hirudinea - leeches, Oligochaeta - earthworms, and Trichoptera - caddisflies. The highest numbers were observed for the Wilczkowski Creek, and the lowest in the case of the Miasto Canal. The highest biomass was determined for the Niezdobna River, and the minimal biomass for the Lipnicki Creek. The ecological status of the streams studied varied between good and satisfactory, depending on the stream and indicator. The best result was obtained for the Niezdobna River, the Lipnicki Creek, and the Small Trzesiecki Canal. Unsatisfactory ecological status was determined for the Miasto Canal and the Wilczkowski Creek.
   Water quality is of utmost importance for the accurate progress of the undertaken methods of the technical reclamation of the lake. The works aim at improving the ecological status of the lake, and increasing its natural values. This is bound to be difficult to achieve if the lake's tributaries introduce too large amounts of pollutants. Simultaneously, the lake cannot have negative influence on the rivers flowing out of the lake. Otherwise it is doubtful that they contribute to the attractiveness of the urban park.

AB  - Change is a constant in Australia's rangelands. Appropriate management of this change requires a sound knowledge of drivers (e.g. climate variability, livestock grazing), their impacts on natural resources (state and trend), socio-economic outcomes, and how these feed back through learning and adaptive management to affect drivers and their impacts. Information is required at scales from enterprise to national, with regional and broader level information serving to influence rangelands governance through institutional arrangements, policy and funding programs. The Australian Collaborative Rangelands Information System (ACRIS) collates and analyses data from national sources and from its State and Territory jurisdictional partners to track and understand change at regional to national scales. ACRIS has recently reported changes between 1992 and 2005 in several biophysical and socio-economic themes at bioregional resolution. This paper describes the processes used to collate and analyse the often disparate data, to synthesise information across data types and to integrate emergent higher order information across drivers, impacts and outcomes to provide more complete understanding of change. Data gaps and inconsistencies were a major challenge, and we illustrate how some of these issues were addressed by using indicators to report changes in biodiversity. ACRIS now needs to foster increased coordinated monitoring activity and develop its reporting capacity to become the valued information system for Australia's rangelands. We propose that future improvements will be best structured within a hierarchically nested framework that provides consistent overarching data at national scale relevant to the variety of rangeland values (e.g. change in ground cover) but focuses on regionally-relevant ecosystem services, and their appropriate measures, at the regional scale. A key challenge is to implement consistent and systematic methods for monitoring biodiversity within this hierarchical framework, given limited institutional resources. Finally, ACRIS needs to develop a dynamic web-based delivery system to enable more frequent and flexible reporting of interpreted change than is possible through periodic published reports.

AB  - The ecosystem services provision is constantly under threat by anthropogenic pressures, especially which is mainly related to land use changes. A solution proposed to address these issues is the implementation of spatial characteristics of land uses and ecological compensation (based on Payment for Ecosystem Services) programs. In this study, we developed a framework for analyzing the spatial characteristics of land uses and calculating ecological compensation from 2000 to 2015 in Sichuan Province, China. We firstly examined the utility of lacunarity analysis for detecting spatial characteristic scales of pattern of land uses. Due to large-scale and regular distribution, the spatial heterogeneity of cropland, woodland and grassland were higher than that of water body, construction land and unused land. We then investigated changes in ecosystem services in response to land use change through assignment of per unit area ecosystem service value method. The total ecosystem service value is about 10,780 billion yuan.year(-1), and the woodland and grassland ecosystems contributed more to the total ecosystem service value. The critical areas (with higher ecosystem service value) for management purpose were identified depending on the heterogeneity of use services learned from spatially explicit measures. Considering the changed relationship between social and economic indicators and ecosystem service value based on spatial visualization and analysis, we finally constructed a quantitative estimate model for ecological compensation taking city (state) as study unit, and determined standard value so as to evaluate ecological compensation from 2000 to 2015. Spatial differences of the ecological compensation were significant among all the cities (states). The average payment standards of ecological compensation based on the population, ecological compensation based on city (state) area, and corrected ecological compensation were - 117.10 billion yuan, 4.41E-13 billion yuan, and - 58.55 billion yuan, respectively. The negative values suggested that the stake-holders of Sichuan Province should pay for ecological compensation, and the positive value meant the residents in the Sichuan Province can obtain the amount of ecological compensation. This proposed innovative framework provides a better understanding of spatial characteristic scales of land uses and enables evaluation of the ecological integrity of landscapes. It also fills up the gap in the field of quantitative evaluation of regional ecological compensation and provides a feasible way to reconcile the conflicts among benefits in the economic, social and ecological sectors.

TI  - The state of Ohio's urban environment: Geographic patterns and recent trends
T2  - OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - The urban environment in Ohio has changed dramatically over the last thirty years, with areas of improvement and areas of degradation. This paper seeks to inventory the state of Ohio's environment in terms of a set of key environmental indicators: conversion of open spaces, changes in farmland acreage, loss of wildlife habitat, number of endangered plant species, brownfields, air pollutants, and lake quality. We attempt to accomplish two broad objectives in this paper. First, we look at the geographic pattern of these environmental quality indicators, paying particular attention to the major metropolitan areas. Second, we examine how these aspects of environmental quality have changed over the past two or three decades, noting areas of progress and of deterioration. Overall we find that air quality in Ohio has clearly improved, although Ohio lags behind other states. The expansion of urbanization has resulted in environmental degradation especially in regard to declining wetland acreage, farmland, and wildlife habitat. Water quality and parkland acreage show no clear change in either direction. We find throughout a need for more comprehensive data on these environmental indicators, so that policy makers can understand what needs to be accomplished.

AB  - Currently, atmospheric pollution is one of the main causes of premature mortality in the world. The problem is especially relevant for economically underdeveloped countries, in particular Ukraine, the economy of which has been developing for a long time in an extensive way. The complicated socio-ecological situation in the territory of the country is due, first of all, to insufficient financing of the medical industry and environmental protection, outdated technologies in industries, etc. The purpose of the study is to assess the environmental risks of atmospheric air pollution in industrialized regions of Ukraine. Kharkiv and Dnipro regions, which are part of the Donetsk-Prydnistrovsky economic macro-district, a powerful center of metallurgy and machine-building of the national level, were selected for the study. As part of the study, the ambient air condition was assessed from the point of view of sanitary-hygienic norms in compliance with state environmental standards as well as the risks of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects from atmospheric pollution. Regional monitoring data on average annual concentrations of common pollutants and heavy metals in the atmospheric air of the cities of Kharkiv and Dnipro regions were used in calculations, averaged over the period from 2014 to 2016. The results of calculations have shown that the total non-carcinogenic risk from atmospheric air pollution in all studied cities exceeds the permissible level: Dnipro - 19.8 HQ; Kamianske - 23.3 HQ; Kryviy Rig - 19.3 HQ; Kharkiv - 11.9 HQ. The pollutants: PM2.5, copper, formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide, manganese and phenol mostly contribute to the greatest non-carcinogenic risk. The dominance of these chemicals and elements in the structure of pollution in the studied cities leads to high probability of development of harmful effects in the respiratory organs - 11.1 to 22.3 HQ; cardiovascular system - 2.9 to 12.3 HQ; immune system - 1.7 to 4.7 HQ; eyes - 0.8 to 4 HQ; central nervous system - 1,4 to 4,6 HQ. The risk of carcinogenic effects is calculated for substances with proven carcinogenic effects: formaldehyde, nickel, cadmium, lead and chromium. The obtained carcinogenic risk from atmospheric air pollution within the studied cities falls into two categories: conventionally acceptable level of risk and acceptable level of risk. The greatest carcinogenic danger is from pollution of atmospheric air by chromium. Contribution of chromium to total carcinogenic risk ranges from 53.6 to 90.6%. Taking into account the obtained results, it is expedient to include the assessment of the risks to the population's health in the system of monitoring and control of the environment in Ukraine.

AB  - Human activity in the last century has led to a significant increase in nitrogen (N) emissions and atmospheric deposition. This N deposition has reached a level that has caused or is likely to cause alterations to the structure and function of many ecosystems across the United States. One approach for quantifying the deposition of pollution that would be harmful to ecosystems is the determination of critical loads. A critical load is defined as the input of a pollutant below which no detrimental ecological effects occur over the long-term according to present knowledge.
   The objectives of this project were to synthesize current research relating atmospheric N deposition to effects on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in the United States, and to estimate associated empirical N critical loads. The receptors considered included freshwater diatoms, mycorrhizal fungi, lichens, bryophytes, herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees. Ecosystem impacts included: (1) biogeochemical responses and (2) individual species, population, and community responses. Biogeochemical responses included increased N mineralization and nitrification (and N availability for plant and microbial uptake), increased gaseous N losses (ammonia volatilization, nitric and nitrous oxide from nitrification and denitrification), and increased N leaching. Individual species, population, and community responses included increased tissue N, physiological and nutrient imbalances, increased growth, altered root : shoot ratios, increased susceptibility to secondary stresses, altered fire regime, shifts in competitive interactions and community composition, changes in species richness and other measures of biodiversity, and increases in invasive species.
   The range of critical loads for nutrient N reported for U.S. ecoregions, inland surface waters, and freshwater wetlands is 1-39 kg N-ha(-1).yr(-1), spanning the range of N deposition observed over most of the country. The empirical critical loads for N tend to increase in the following sequence for different life forms: diatoms, lichens and bryophytes, mycorrhizal fungi, herbaceous plants and shrubs, and trees.
   The critical load approach is an ecosystem assessment tool with great potential to simplify complex scientific information and communicate effectively with the policy community and the public. This synthesis represents the first comprehensive assessment of empirical critical loads of N for major ecoregions across the United States.

AB  - To meet the challenges of preventing and reversing adverse effects of land use on ecosystems, management actions need to be founded on strong evidence. We used the pressure-state-impact (PSI) framework to assess evidence of land-use effects on New Zealand freshwater ecosystems. The evidence consisted of published quantitative and categorical associations linking land-use pressures to state changes and ecological impacts in rivers, lakes and aquifers. There was substantial evidence of land-use effects, particularly where land use/land cover (LULC) classes were used as pressure variables. Proportions of catchment area in urban and pastoral LULC were consistently, positively correlated with contaminant levels in water bodies and negatively correlated with ecological-health indicators. Other consistent PSI associations included positive correlations between cattle stocking rates and river contaminant levels, increased fine sediment and decreased ecological-health scores in rivers following forest harvest, and increased river contaminant levels at sites with stock access. Despite these consistent associations, the evidence base has four general shortcomings that should be addressed: (1) inadequate integration of data and models that link land use and contaminant loss to state changes and impacts in freshwater ecosystems; (2) weak inferences based on LULC; (3) reliance on categorical PSI associations; (4) gaps in reported PSI associations.

AB  - Urban green spaces play an important role in improving the quality of life and sustainability in cities and require careful empirical evaluation. This study looked into the contradiction of native species being underrepresented in urban environments in Brazilian Amazon cities, compared to exotic species that have been introduced. It also sought to determine whether there is floristic similarity between the States' urban environments, and if so, what effect geographic distance has on this process; and what implications the States' urbanization gradient has for floristic density of urban afforestation, taking into account the realities of cities infrastructure. A floristic matrix comprising information about the origin of the species and quantitative data was developed using data from scholarly journals and a comprehensive literature study. The floristic consistency of urban vegetation was tested between surveys using dendrograms, indicator species and ordination analyzes. A total of 1333 species were found, of which 59 % were classified as exotic. The floristic profile of urban afforestation among States was characterized by a high richness of the Fabaceae family and by a high representativeness of Moquilea tomentosa, Mangifera indica and Ficus benjamina species. Native species had the lowest tree density values in the urban gradient examined, ranging from 2.2 +/- 0.36 tree/ha to 0.19 +/- 0.03 tree/ha. Based on the results from the NonMetric Multidimensional Scale (NMDS) ordination technique together with the cluster analysis, it was confirmed that the greatest floristic similarities were found among municipalities in the States located geographically closer together. It is concluded that floristic richness proportionally decreases with the expansion of metropolitan cities. These findings suggest that the urban afforestation in Amazonian cities, are not spatially or ecologically uniform. This information can help to make future decisions regarding the correct planning of species to be introduced into urban spaces in cities.

TI  - Exergy analysis of the environmental impact of paving material manufacture

AB  - Exergy analysis permits accurate measurement of the degradation of matter and energy using a single concept. A macroscopic exergy accounting method is proposed and applied to assess the environmental impact of road covering material manufacturing. Cement concrete and asphalt covers are examined. From the manufacturing process mass balances and exergy analyses conducted primarily by Szargut and his co-workers, the net exergy consumption for each type of paving material is calculated. This exergy consumption broadly reflects the minimum work required to reform the raw materials and restore the environment to its initial state. This minimum work may serve as a thermodynamic measure of the environmental impact of an entire manufacturing process, from the resource drawn from the environment to the finished product. In the two cases under study, the environmental impact depends on the type, thickness and manufacturing process of the paving material. An older technology, such as the manufacture of cement concrete using the wet process, appears disadvantageous, as is the production of asphalt cover which is manufactured during the fall. The proposed exergy indicator permits ranking of the materials according to their overall long-term impact on the environment.

AB  - Desertification control and scientific evaluation of desert ecosystem sustainability are important issues for countries along the Silk Road Economic Belt. Fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) is used as a quantitative indicator to describe the vegetation coverage of desert ecosystems. Although satellite remote sensing technology has been widely used to retrieve FVC at the regional and global scale, the authenticity evaluation of the inversion results has been flawed. To gain insight into the composition, structure and changes of desert vegetation, it is important to assess the accuracy of FVC and explore the relationship between FVC and meteorological factors. Therefore, we adopted unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing (UAVRS) technology to verify the inversion results and analyse the practicability of MODIS-NDVI (where NDVI = normalized difference vegetation index) products in desert areas. To provide a new method for the estimation of vegetation coverage in the natural state, the relationships between vegetation coverage and four meteorological factors, namely, land surface temperature, temperature, precipitation and evaporation were analysed. The results showed that using the original MODIS-NDVI data product with a spatial resolution of 250 m to invert vegetation coverage is practical in desert areas (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.83, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.052, normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) = 42.94%, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.007) but underestimates vegetation coverage in the study area. MODIS-NDVI data products are different from the real NDVI in the study area. Correcting MODIS-NDVI data products can effectively improve the accuracy of the inversion. When extracting vegetation coverage in this area, the scale has little effect on the results. There is a significant correlation between precipitation, evaporation and FVC in the area, but the interaction of temperature and land surface temperature with precipitation and evaporation also has a considerable impact on FVC, and evaporation has a substantial impact on FVC values inverted from MODIS-NDVI data (FVCM), When exploring the relationship between vegetation coverage and meteorological elements, if vegetation coverage is retrieved from MODIS-NDVI data products or MODIS-NDVI data, when considering temperature and precipitation, the effect of evaporation should also be considered. In addition, meteorological factors can be used to predict FVC (R-2 = 0.7364, RMSE = 0.0623), which provides a new method for estimating FVC in areas with less manual intervention.

AB  - The state and prospects of the transformation of the rental policy of Ukraine are assessed and recommendations are proposed for improving rental relations through the introduction of innovative tools for regulating collaboration relations in the extracting industry. The paper suggests a mechanism for interaction of all members of the society in the formation and distribution of rental income from the extraction of natural resources by creating collaborative alliances between the state, extractive enterprises and regions. The conducted researches showed that collaborative alliances in nature management are the most acceptable and promising organizational form through which it is possible to coordinate the interests of all participants in the formation and distribution and redistribution of rental income. With the help of the questionnaire and the Delphi method from 2015 until 2017, research was conducted on the possibility of creating a collaborative alliance in environmental management in the "state-region-enterprise" system, certain shortcomings and advantages for all participants in the collaboration alliances (state-region-extractive enterprise) and identified socio-ecological and economic risks in the formation and functioning of collaborative alliances in the use of natural resources, which may not contribute to the harmonization of the interests of its participants. A risk management system has been established in the operation of collaborative alliances in the use of natural resources, which includes a subsystem for identification, measurement, support (control and monitoring of risks). The coefficient of concordance of M. Kendall and B. Smith was determined in assessing the probability of occurrence of negative consequences. In order to formalize the identified risks in the operation of collaborative alliances in nature management, a scientific and methodical approach to ranking social, economic and environmental risks in the creation of collaborative alliances using the Fuzzy Logic method was developed, based on considering the indicators of the stability of collaborative relationships in determining the most significant risks and their interdependencies. The ways of minimizing the occurrence of negative risks in the functioning of collaborative alliances in the system "state-region-enterprise" on the withdrawal of rent income in the fuel extraction industry are suggested. Studies have shown that today, in the context of the transformation of rental policy and socio-economic relations, state administration must form social values of society through environmental use and consumption of resources and to implement a saving policy regarding the extraction of natural resources in Ukraine.
   In the implementation of the collaborative alliance in the system "state-region-enterprise" interests of its parties can be considered regarding the redistribution of rental income from the extraction of natural resources, considering personal and social responsibility in the extraction of natural resources and the protection of the environment. At the same time, the risks identified and assessed correctly in the formation and functioning of the collaborative alliances in the "stateregion-enterprise" system will help to optimize the distribution of natural resource rent from the extraction of natural resources in order to compensate, hedge and save them for future generations. Thus, it can be concluded that the collaboration between the state and extractive enterprises and local communities is not only possible, but also necessary for the effective functioning of the state's ecological and economic system. At the same time, fuel-extracting companies can operate under coopetition conditions, creating additional incentives for the development of enterprises, minimizing risks and generating innovative ideas.

AB  - Many freshwaters in base-poor upland areas of Britain continue to be affected by acidification as a result of deposition of air pollutants, and agricultural and forestry practices. The effects of land use and annual liming on stream chemistry, diatoms and salmon populations were investigated over eight years in the upper catchment of the River Wye, Wales, United Kingdom. Variations in water chemistry, diatom species composition and diversity, and in the index Diatom Acidification Metric (DAM) were compared between different types of land cover and flow conditions, and before and after applications of lime. Two methods of liming, hydrological source (catchment) liming and sand liming (in-stream liming), were used to reduce stream acidity. Electrofishing was carried out for several years before and after liming to monitor the recovery of salmon populations.
   Prior to liming, water chemistry differed between stream sub-catchments with differing land use. ANC, Ca concentrations and pH were lower, and Al concentrations were higher, in areas with conifers and acid grassland than in areas with improved grassland and broadleaf woodland. After liming pH increased, but the effects differed between sites and were dependent upon pH levels before any liming began, flow conditions, and the method of liming. An increase in pH during high flows was evident at many sites where acid episodes had occurred prior to liming.
   Diatom species richness and diversity were low, many sites supporting only 10-15 species. Correlations of richness and diversity with water chemistry were not significant but there was a tendency for low pH sites to support very few species. Species richness was highest in areas adjoining broadleaf woodland and improved grassland, and lowest in areas adjoining conifer plantations.
   Diatom species composition changed after liming and depended on the type of dominant land cover in the catchment areas and the method of liming. Species tolerant of low pH, in particular Eunotia exigua, became less abundant and were replaced by acid-sensitive species, predominantly Achnanthidium minutissimum. DAM index values and ecological quality ratios (EQR), which were both lower in conifer and acid grassland areas before liming than elsewhere, improved after liming and in many areas the ecological status class of limed streams became good or high. The change to diatom assemblages with predominantly acid-sensitive species after liming correlated with increasing numbers of juvenile salmon and their expansion upstream to sites that had lacked fish prior to liming.

AB  - Temporal trends of exergy, specific exergy, biodiversity (species richness and heterogeneity) and an indicator of stress of the macrofaunal assemblage (W statistics) were compared along a gradient of disturbance in the Valli di Comacchio. Data were gathered at four reference sites, characterized by different disturbance levels, and spanned to a six-year period (1996-2002). Biodiversity parameters fluctuated through space and time as commonly observed in estuarine and lagoonal habitats; higher biodiversity values and less pronounced fluctuations were detected at the minimally disturbed site, while lower values of these indicators and wider fluctuations were observed at the other sites along the disturbance gradient. Exergy and specific exergy were higher at the minimally disturbed site, but all temporal trends exhibited a zigzag pattern, being characterized both by very high and very low values. A different result was obtained when comparing the trends of specific exergy with disturbance expressed by the W statistics: at the four sites a close correlation resulted, with exergy and specific exergy well in phase with the W statistics trend. While exergy, at least in the studied environment, does not seem comparable with biodiversity, it appeared to be capable of elucidating the disturbance state of the ecosystem, and therefore may constitute a suitable system-oriented characteristic, and a good indicator of ecosystem integrity.

AB  - Mononchida nematode populations were analysed in parallel with stages of natural forest dynamics in a nature reserve within the state forest of Fontainebleau (La Tillaie, France). Changes in the relative abundance of species and morphometric variability of Clarkus papillatus provided additional information about the differentiation of sites on acid mull humus. Especially in clearings, the role of the herbaceous layer and dead fallen wood was demonstrated by the improvement of the humus form. Furthermore, although not typically representative of successional stages of forest development, Mononchida indicate the existence of changes of environmental conditions. These changes relate especially to a gradual differentiation between two groups of sites, one represented by the bare ground in clearing (located within the mature stage), growth and mature stages, and the other associated with the senescent stage and the clearing located near this site. Differences illustrated by the two types of clearing indicate the important role of windthrows in the forest regeneration process.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated significant alterations in the species composition of grasslands in Central Europe over the past decades due to multiple drivers of anthropogenic environmental change. Most such studies deal with dry, acidic, wet or alpine grassland types, while little is known about changes in mesic grasslands, particularly in urban areas. To investigate the effects of anthmpogenic environmental change on such grasslands, we resurveyed a selection of plots in the city of Zurich (Switzerland) approximately 25 years after their original recording. First, we checked whether 241 extensively used mesic grasslands (belonging to the Arrhenathereialia elatioris) in the city were still grasslands, and whether their management had changed. Then we resurveyed a representative subset of 30 quasi-permanent plots of 50 m(2). We tested whether biodiversity metrics, mean ecological indicator values, community weighted means (CWMs) of functional traits or the presence of individual vascular plant species had changed. We found that 15% of the original grasslands had been lost due to changes in land use during this period. Of the remaining grasslands, most of the former meadows were still mown, while many of the former pastures had been transformed into meadows. Measures of alpha diversity had not changed significantly for the 30 plots. However, species composition now indicated nutrient poorer. less base-rich and less ruderal site conditions, while CWMs of specific leaf area (SLA) had decreased and that of seed mass increased. In stands that were managed by mowing in both periods there was practically no change, while there was a pronounced change in those that had been transformed from grazing to mowing. In general, five species showed a significant increase and 16 species a significant decrease in frequency, with no obvious ecological difference between winners and losers. Alien species were rare in both periods and showed hardly any trend, except Veronica persica, which became rarer. In conclusion, more extensively used grasslands have survived to date than would be anticipated in such a rapidly growing city as Zurich. Their quality has hardly changed during the past quarter century, and if changes occurred, they are rather attributable to the intentional change of management from grazing to mowing. The relatively good ecological state of these urban grasslands might be due to a lower agricultural land use pressure than outside urban areas, as well as a constant management of many of these grasslands with a conservation focus. By maintaining these grasslands in their current state, they may have the potential to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in urban areas.

AB  - The focus of land use modeling in life cycle impact assessment has been mainly on taxonomic measures of biodiversity, namely species richness (SR). However, increasing availability of trait data for species has led to the use of functional diversity (FD) as a promising metric to reflect the distinctiveness of species; this paper proposes the use of an FD index to calculate characterization factors (CFs) for land use impacts. Furthermore, we compare the results of the CFs to current practice and assess the increase in complexity introduced by the use of the new indicator.
   The model proposed is based on data compiled by previous regional meta-analysis on SR and FD, in different land use types in the Americas. The taxonomic groups included were mammals, birds, and plants. Within each study, calculated values for FD for different land use types were compared with the natural or close-to-natural state, taken as the reference situation. FD values among different land uses were standardized, and CFs were calculated. The final results were then analyzed and compared by analysis of variance and post hoc tests. A sensitivity analysis was also applied to verify the influence on the choice of the reference state.
   The results show that significant differences exist between CFs for SR and FD metrics. Across all taxa, CFs differ significantly between land use types. The results support the use of CF for FD, as a complement to current practice. Distinct CFs should be applied for at least six groups of land use categories. The choice of reference land use type did not significantly alter the results but can be a source of variability. A sensitivity analysis evaluating the impact of alternate land use types as reference types found only few significant changes on the results.
   Given the results, we believe the use of CFs based on FD can help on the establishment of possible links between species loss and key ecosystem functions, i.e., on the association between the midpoint indicator (e.g., biodiversity loss) and the damage caused to ecosystem quality, in terms of functions lost. Basing CFs on FD is not without challenges. Such indices are data hungry (requiring species composition and traits) require more complex calculations than current common practice, including decisions on the choice of a method to calculate FD and the selection of traits.

AB  - The goals of this study were to: (1) measure atrazine and metolachlor concentrations during both high and low use periods in the Chesapeake Bay's mainstem/major tributaries, smaller tributaries and representative small agricultural streams during 1995 and 1996; (2) compare these exposure data with toxicity benchmarks for each herbicide to predict ecological risk and (3) use in-stream fish community data collected in the streams to provide supportive data for ecological risk characterization. Spatially, atrazine (<0.10-98 mu g/L) and metolachlor (< 0.10-68 mu g/L) concentrations were highest in the streams, followed by the small tributaries (< 0.10-11 mu g/L atrazine; < 0.10-8.6 mu g/L metolachlor) with the lowest concentration in the mainstem Bay/larger tributaries (< 0.10-0.22 mu g/L atrazine; < 0.10-0.24 mu g/L metolachlor). Temporally, concentrations of both herbicides were greatest in all three types of habitats in the late spring and early summer. Concentrations of atrazine and metolachlor were very low or non-detectable in all habitats sampled from early August to mid-April. Toxicity benchmarks of 20 mu g/L for atrazine based on an ecological No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) for microcosm/mesocosm studies and an acute 10th percentile of 53 mu g/L for metolachlor (protection of ninety % of the species) based on laboratory toxicity data were selected to assess annual and seasonal ecological risk. Both of these toxicity benchmarks were conservative estimates of ecological risk designed to protect the trophic group (plants) most sensitive to these herbicides. Based on a comparison of these toxicity benchmarks with two years of exposure data, the ecological risk from both atrazine and metolachlor exposure in the mainstem Chesapeake Bay/large tributaries, small tributaries and representative agriculturally dominated streams was generally judged to be low. During one 72-h stream rain event in 1995, the atrazine toxicity benchmark (20 mu g/L) was exceeded during part of the event. However, long-term permanent ecological effects are not expected based on the documented recovery potential of the most sensitive trophic group (plant communities) to the concentrations of atrazine reported and the transient nature of the atrazine pulses. Fish communities at the stream sites receiving the highest concentrations of both herbicides were judged to be healthy based on an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) developed for Maryland's coastal plain.

AB  - The use of East African freshwater wetlands for agriculture has increased in recent decades, raising concerns about potential impacts on wetlands and the long-term sustainability of such land use trends. WET-health is an indicator-based rapid wetland assessment approach developed in South Africa. It allows determining the conditions of wetlands in four assessment modules (hydrology, geomorphology, vegetation, and water quality) by observing the degree of deviation of a wetland from its anticipated natural reference state. We tested the transferability of the WET-health concept for East African inland valley swamps and floodplain wetlands based on 114 assessment units at four study sites. Due to large wetland areas and different environmental settings in East Africa, we modified the original approach using a random selection of assessment units and an assessment scheme based on disturbance types (Appendices A and B). Estimated WET-health impact scores were matched with biophysical and socioeconomic variables using a generalized linear mixed model. Land use included largely undisturbed wetland units occurring side by side with seasonally cropped or grazed units, and drained, permanently cultivated units. A strong differentiation of impact scores between the four assessment modules was apparent with highest scores for vegetation and lowest scores for geomorphology. Vegetation and water quality responded most sensitively to land use changes. The magnitude of wetland disturbance is predominantly determined by management factors such as land use intensity, soil tillage, drainage intensity, and the application of agrochemicals and influences vegetation attributes and the provision of ecosystem services. The proposed modification of WET-health enables users to assess large wetland areas during relatively short periods of time. While further studies will be required, WET-health appears to be a promising concept to be applied to wetlands in East Africa and possibly beyond. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over 2500 airports worldwide provide critical infrastructure that supports 4 billion annual passengers. To meet changes in capacity and post-COVID-19 passenger processing, airport infrastructure such as terminal buildings, airfields, and ground service equipment require substantial upgrades. Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but that estimate excludes airport construction and operation. Metrics that assess an airport's sustainability, in addition to environmental impacts that are sometimes unaccounted for (e.g. water consumption), are necessary for a more complete environmental accounting of the entire aviation sector. This review synthesizes the current state of environmental sustainability metrics and methods (e.g. life-cycle assessment, Scope GHG emissions) for airports as identified in 108 peer-reviewed journal articles and technical reports. Articles are grouped according to six categories (Energy and Atmosphere, Comfort and Health, Water and Wastewater, Site and Habitat, Material and Resources, Multidimensional) of an existing airport sustainability assessment framework. A case study application of the framework is evaluated for its efficacy in yielding performance objectives. Research interest in airport environmental sustainability is steadily increasing, but there is ample need for more systematic assessment that accounts for a variety of emissions and regional variation. Prominent research themes include analyzing the GHG emissions from airfield pavements and energy management strategies for airport buildings. Research on water conservation, climate change resilience, and waste management is more limited, indicating that airport environmental accounting requires more analysis. A disconnect exists between research efforts and practices implemented by airports. Effective practices such as sourcing low-emission electricity and electrifying ground transportation and gate equipment can in the short term aid airports in moving towards sustainability goals. Future research must emphasize stakeholder involvement, life-cycle assessment, linking environmental impacts with operational outcomes, and global challenges (e.g. resilience, climate change adaptation, mitigation of infectious diseases).

AB  - Poor bean yields in the Cunha region of the Mata Atlantica ecosystem in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, are associated with low agronomic inputs, plant disease, and soil erosion. To identify sustainable farming practices that increase production and maximize biological N-2 fixation (BNF), the effects of soil fertility and plant cultivar on seed yield and root nodule formation were measured under standard agronomic practices. Results from 16 sites showed that fertilizing with lime and molybdenum increased seed yields to 370% for the landrace Serro Azul. In addition to increased yields, plants grown with fertilizer had more nodules. Marked strains of Rhizobium tropici were tested under controlled environments. An indicator strain of Rhizobium containing the gusA marker gene was used. Our results verify that the indicator strain CM-255 GusA(+)Hup(+) had a high capacity to associate with the five bean varieties tested. Fertilization with P, K, S + micronutrients and liming were essential for better nodulation by the indicator strain. Under low fertility conditions, the landrace variety Serro Azul was poorly nodulated, when associated with native strains or with the indicator strain. However, under better soil fertility conditions, nodulation of Serro Azul by the marked Rhizobium strain was increased. The commercial variety Carioca 80SH showed no increase in nodulation (nodule number).

AB  - Metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems is of immense importance. Under various environment circumstances, the metal contents of sediments can enter into the overlying water body leading to severe toxicity. This study aims to determine metal concentrations in sediments of Anzali International Wetland in Iran. Chemical partitioning method is used to determine the portion of anthropogenic pollution and the mobility potential of each metal. The intensity of metal pollution in sediments of the wetland is assessed using three reliable indices. The results of chemical partitioning reveal that cadmium bear the highest risk of being released into the aquatic environment and high amount of manganese in sulfide bond phase implies the initiation of redox state in aquatic environment of the Anzali Wetland. The results of chemical partitioning studies show that Pb, Cd, Mn and As have the highest anthropogenic portion. Cluster analysis also confirms the results of chemical partitioning and indicates that the mentioned metals can be originated from anthropogenic sources. Sediment pollution indices, including, I (geo), I (POLL), and m-ERM-Q reveal that metals are in the range of low to moderate pollution and also show that the highest metal pollution is in the eastern and central parts of the wetland. This can be ascribed to rivers which are the recipient of industrial, agricultural and municipal wastewaters and flow into these parts of the wetland.

AB  - Lakes face multiple anthropogenic pressures that can substantially alter their hydrology. Dams and land use in the watershed (e.g., irrigated agriculture) can modify lake water regimes beyond natural ranges, and changing climate may exacerbate anthropogenic stresses on lake hydrology. However, we lack cost-effective indicators to quantify anthropogenic hydrologic alteration potential in lakes at regional and national extents. We developed a framework to rank lakes by the potential for dams and land use to alter lake hydrology (HydrAP) that can be applied at a national scale. The HydrAP framework principles are that 1) dams are primary drivers of lake hydroalteration, 2) land use activities are secondary drivers that alter watershed hydrology, and 3) topographic relief limits where land use and dams are located on the landscape. We ranked lakes in the United States Environmental Protection Agency National Lakes Assessment (NLA) on a HydrAP scale from zero to seven, where a zero indicates lakes with no potential for anthropogenic hydro-alteration, and a seven indicates large dams and/or intensive land use with high potential to alter lake hydrology. We inferred HydrAP population distributions in the conterminous US (CONUS) using the NLA probabilistic weights. Half of CONUS lakes had moderate to high hydro-alteration potential (HydrAP ranks 3-7), the other half had minimal to no hydro-alteration potential (HydrAP ranks 0-2). HydrAP ranks generally corresponded with natural and man-made lake classes, but >15% of natural lakes had moderate to high HydrAP ranks and-10% of man-made lakes had low HydrAP ranks. The Great Plains, Appalachians, and Coastal Plains had the largest percentages (>50%) of high HydrAP lakes, and the West and Midwest had the lowest percentages (-30%). Water residence time (tau) and water-level change were associated with HydrAP ranks, demonstrating the framework's intended ability to differentiate anthropogenic stressors that can alter lake hydrology. High HydrAP lakes had shorter tau in all ecoregions, but HydrAP relationships with water-level change varied by ecoregion. In the West and Appalachians, high HydrAP lakes experienced excessive water-level declines compared to low-ranked lakes. In contrast, high HydrAP lakes in the Great Plains and Midwest showed stable water levels compared to low-ranked lakes. These differences imply that water management in western and eastern mountainous regions may result in large water-level fluctuations, but water management in central CONUS may promote water-level stabilization. The HydrAP framework, using accessible national datasets can support large-scale lake assessments and be adapted to specific locations where data are available.

AB  - Action 5 of the EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy explicitly mentions that EU member states, with assistance of the Commission, will map and assess the state of ecosystems and ecosystem services in their national territory by 2014. Water represents an important landscape element and contributes to human health and well-being in urban areas. However, in Germany - like in many other European countries - detailed information on the accessibility of urban blue at the household and individual level is missing. This study investigates the accessibility of urban blue by merging geocoded household data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and German census population data (GCD) with geocoded data on urban blue distribution from the European Urban Atlas (EUA) for German major cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants. Accessibility of urban blue is measured as the Euclidean distance between the household and the nearest water-site in meter and calculated as the coverage of waters in a 500 m buffer around the place of living in square meters. Results of the distance analysis show an average distance between the households and the nearest water site of 1,390 m, meaning that 20% of the German urban population lives within a maximum distance of 500 m between the place of residence and the nearest water site. The average blue space provision in German major cities adds up to 3.5 m(2) per capita. Moreover, our findings indicate that individuals with migration background and individuals with nationalities others than German live on average in closer distances to waters while individuals with no migration background, individuals with German nationality and childless households are surrounded by higher coverages of urban blue. The findings provide helpful information for policy and planning to ensure an adequate blue space provision in Germany. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of human disturbance on wildlife is of increasing interest because of the growing use of wildlands by humans for recreation. Few studies have documented the effect of human disturbance on behavior and physiology simultaneously, with no studies existing for any turtle species. Turtles are one of the most endangered taxonomic groups and many are of conservation concern, including the yellow-blotched sawback (Graptemys flavimaculata), a freshwater turtle of the Pascagoula River system, Mississippi, USA. We studied G. flavimaculata individual- and population-level basking behavior, while also documenting the effects of human disturbance on basking behavior at recreationally disturbed and control sites. We also assessed the physiological response of turtles to human disturbance by measuring heterophil/lymphocyte levels (H:L; higher levels indicate increased stress) and shell condition of captured turtles at the 2 sites. At the individual level, disturbed turtles at the recreationally disturbed site basked for significantly shorter durations than undisturbed turtles at the same site and undisturbed turtles at the control site; disturbed turtles at the control site basked longer than all groups possibly because the few instances of disturbances all occurred during a time of year when basking durations were longest. At the population level, we detected significantly lesser basking percentages at the recreationally disturbed site relative to the control site, possibly because of natural differences among the sites (i.e., a more stable thermal environment) or because of the higher level of human disturbance. At the recreationally disturbed site, more disturbances occurred on weekend and weekend bordering days relative to weekdays, and larger and slower boats disturbed significantly greater percentages of basking turtles compared to smaller and faster watercraft. Further, turtles from the disturbed site had significantly higher H:L levels relative to the undisturbed site, and an index of shell condition was significantly poorer at the disturbed site. Boating records indicate that the impact of recreational boating at the disturbed site likely has grown over the last 22 years because of an increase in the number and size of boats using the river; this trend will likely continue unless restrictions are enacted by managers and/or state entities to limit the number and size of boats that access the river.

AB  - To contribute to the development and evaluation of a practical and cost-effective in vivo testing system for endocrine disruption (specifically environmental estrogens), the effects of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) were assessed in a gonadal recrudescence assay with the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Mature male and female fathead minnows were kept first at 15degreesC on a 8 h light/ 16 h dark regime and then transferred to 25degreesC and a 16 h light/8 h dark regime to induce gonadal recrudescence. They were then exposed to various nominal concentrations of the synthetic estrogen EE2 (0, 0.1, 1, 3, 10, 100 ng/L). After 3 weeks of chemical exposure, effects on plasma vitellogenin (VTG), secondary sex characteristics, gonad growth (gonadosomatic index; GSI), and condition factor were assessed. Additionally, the effects on liver and gonad tissue morphology were investigated by means of light (LM) and electron microscopy (EM). Reproductive output (egg production) and fertilization rate were measured during a subsequent 3-week period in breeding adults maintained in clean water. Exposure to EE2 resulted in a significant decrease in GSI, condition factor, and number of batches of eggs and their fertilization rate at EE2 exposure concentrations between 10 and 100 ng/L. A reduction in the extent of parenchymatic areas in ovaries and ultrastructural changes in the livers of females could be detected at EE2 concentrations greater than or equal to3 ng/L. The lowest observed effective concentration (LOEC) of EE2 for plasma VTG induction in both sexes and for ultrastructural changes in the testes and livers was I ng/L. A significant increase in the mean number of eggs spawned per pair occurred at EE2 exposure doses of 0.1 and 1 ng/L. However, at higher EE2 concentrations, a dose-dependent decrease in the mean number of eggs per pair was apparent. Therefore, the LOEC for a biological effect of EE2 in the fathead minnow using the selected endpoints in the recrudescence assay was 1 ng/L for biomarkers such as plasma VTG and number of tubercles, and 0.1 ng/L for an increased number of eggs spawned per pair.

AB  - The Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) and Forest Inventory and Analyses (FIA) programs are integrated biological monitoring systems that use nationally standardized methods to evaluate and report on the health and sustainability of forest ecosystems in the United States. Many of the anticipated changes in forest ecosystems from climate change were also issues addressed in sections of FHM's National Technical Report 1991 to 1998. The integrated FHM and FIA monitoring systems are currently establishing baseline conditions (status and change) in most States for many of the expected effects, and are projected to have full implementation for all States and Territories in 2003. These monitoring systems utilize a broad suite of indicators of key ecosystem components and processes that are responsive to many biotic and abiotic stressors, including those anticipated from climate change. These programs will contribute essential information for many decades for many of the anticipated changes in forest ecosystem from increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, changing climatic scenarios, and extreme weather events that are probable in the next 30 to 100 years.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is considered a main cause of the global biodiversity crisis. Particularly, the presence of linear transport infrastructures is one of the main causes of habitat fragmentation and its effects represent a threat to the diversity and richness of habitats and to the dispersal capacity of species. This study assesses the state of fragmentation of Natura 2000 habitats (LIC and ZEPA) on Mallorca (Balearic Islands) and analyses its relationship with the presence of road infrastructures, through application of different physiographic and morphometric indicators. The analysis shows a higher degree of fragmentation in the Natura 2000 habitats located in north of Mallorca and the western sector of the Tramuntana mountain range. Those are also more vulnerable to external disturbance, due to a higher proportion of edge habitat in relation to interior habitat. The average use of roads that intersect with protected areas is 5500 vehicles per day. However, the main affectations caused by traffic are concentrated in specific sectors of the Tramuntana range and in the north of the island (Pollenca bay, Alcudia bay and Arta) where the average use is higher than 10.000 vehicles per day.

AB  - Within an integrated ecosystem approach, it is preferable to evaluate the effects of pollution of surface waters through research on the organisms of fish. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of a set of water quality indicators on the homeostasis of fish, in order to determine the response of a hydro-ecosystem to the impact of human activity. Fish samples were obtained from control catches in 16 control sites located in the rivers of Rivne Oblast which differ in intensity of anthropogenic load. The researchers observed that increased concentrations of phosphates and suspended substances, heavy metals, iron, fluorides and nitrogen compounds have violated the environmental state of the examined hydro-ecosystems. Parameters of the morphological homeostasis were assessed by the levels of the fluctuating asymmetry of the meristic signs of fish. The scientists recorded significant impairments (within IV points of body stability) in case of roach and bleak in the majority of the control sites. We carried out the analysis of cytogenetic parameters of fish homeostasis using a micronuclear test of blood erythrocytes. The investigation revealed a significant excess of spontaneous mutagenesis (1.1-1.7 times) in such species as roach, bleak and perch, and this is certainly a clear indicator of unfavourable ecological conditions of the water environment in seven areas of hydro-ecosystems. Given the results of the analysis, the authors found that different ecological groups of fish have their own complex and multifactorial processes of morphological and cytogenetic homeostasis formation. Furthermore, the regression dependences set out in the paper indicated the decisive impact of the oxygen regime of the water environment (COD, BOD5, O-2), pollutants (Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+), and substances of biogenic group (NH4+, NO2-, PO4-) upon fish homeostasis. differences in scope of homeostasis characteristics of different fish species were complemented by the differences in the composition of the regression equations. In particular, in case of species that had signs of homeostasis violation, the equation consisted of a greater number of members. The dependences for morphological and cytogenetic homeostasis of bleak and roach appeared to multifactorial. This finding suggests that these species are sensitive local indicators of the water environment both at early and late stages of ontogeny. Finally, as an outcome of the research we obtained prognostic forms of the relationship between water quality indicators and fish homeostasis that may form the basis of an environmental assessment method in which fish characteristics are used to assess the health of hydro-ecosystems.

AB  - Given high-level commitments to reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010, there is a pressing need to develop simple and practical indicators to monitor progress. In this context, a biodiversity intactness index (BII) was recently proposed, which provides an overall indicator suitable for policy makers. The index links data on land use with expert assessments of how this impacts the population densities of well-understood taxonomic groups to estimate current population sizes relative to premodern times. However, when calculated for southern Africa, the resulting BII of 84% suggests a far more positive picture of the state of wild nature than do other large-scale estimates. Here, we argue that this discrepancy is in part an artefact of the coarseness of the land degradation data used to calculate the BII, and that the overall BII for southern Africa is probably much lower than 84%. In particular, based on two relatively inexpensive, ground-truthed studies of areas not generally regarded as exceptional in terms of their degradation status, we demonstrate that Scholes and Biggs might have seriously underestimated the extent of land degradation. These differences have substantial bearing on BII scores. Urgent attention should be given to the further development of cost-effective ground-truthing methods for quantifying the extent of land degradation in order to provide reliable estimates of biodiversity loss, both in southern Africa and more widely.

AB  - Coastal dune ecosystems have been severely degraded as a result of excessive natural resource exploitation, urbanisation, industrial growth, and worldwide tourism. Coastal management often requires the use of vulnerability indices to facilitate the decision-making process. The main objective of this study was to develop a Mediterranean dune vulnerability index (MDVI) for sandy coasts, starting from the existing dune vulnerability index (DVI) proposed by Garcia-Mora et al. (2001) related to the oceanic coasts. Given that the Mediterranean sandy coasts are quite different from the Atlantic coasts, several adjustments and integrations were introduced. Our proposed index is based on the following five main group of factors: geomorphological conditions of the dune systems (GCD), marine influence (MI), aeolian effect (AE), vegetation condition (VC), and human effect (HE), for a total of 51 variables derived (and adapted) from the bibliography or proposed for the first time in this study. For each coastal site, a total vulnerability index, ranging from 0 (very low vulnerability) to I (very high vulnerability), was calculated as the unweighted average of the five partial vulnerability indices. Index computation was applied to 23 coastal dune systems of two different contexts in Italy, i.e. peninsular and continental island territories representative of the W-Mediterranean Basin, in order to compare the dune systems with different geomorphology, shoreline dynamics, and human pressure. In particular, our research addressed the following two questions: (1) Which variables are the most critical for the Italian coastal systems? (2) How can the coastal dune vulnerability index be used to develop appropriate strategies of conservation and management for these ecosystems? Cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling separated the peninsular from the insular sites, both of which were characterised by low to moderate values of vulnerability (0.32 < MDVI < 0.49). The most critical factors for the coastal systems examined in this study were marine negative influence, low stabilising ability of vegetation, and human disturbance. Hence, coastal managers are encouraged to plan specific management actions such as protection of foredunes from marine factors (particularly erosion), to promote dune formation with the reintroduction of native dune builder species and to minimise human pressure where vulnerability depends on these variables.

AB  - In times of global change, we must closely monitor the state of the planet in order to understand the full complexity of these changes. In fact, each of the Earth's subsystems - i.e., the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere - can be analyzed from a multitude of data streams. However, since it is very hard to jointly interpret multiple monitoring data streams in parallel, one often aims for some summarizing indicator. Climate indices, for example, summarize the state of atmospheric circulation in a region. Although such approaches are also used in other fields of science, they are rarely used to describe land surface dynamics. Here, we propose a robust method to create global indicators for the terrestrial biosphere using principal component analysis based on a high-dimensional set of relevant global data streams. The concept was tested using 12 explanatory variables representing the biophysical state of ecosystems and land-atmosphere fluxes of water, energy, and carbon fluxes. We find that three indicators account for 82% of the variance of the selected biosphere variables in space and time across the globe. While the first indicator summarizes productivity patterns, the second indicator summarizes variables representing water and energy availability. The third indicator represents mostly changes in surface albedo. Anomalies in the indicators clearly identify extreme events, such as the Amazon droughts (2005 and 2010) and the Russian heat wave (2010). The anomalies also allow us to interpret the impacts of these events. The indicators can also be used to detect and quantify changes in seasonal dynamics. Here we report, for instance, increasing seasonal amplitudes of productivity in agricultural areas and arctic regions. We assume that this generic approach has great potential for the analysis of land surface dynamics from observational or model data.

AB  - The morphological and physiological parameters of woody plants vitality under conditions of the environmental oil pollution are analyzed. The inhibition of investigated plants' leaves growth, the appearance of necrotic lesions and a decrease in the buffer stability of the assimilation organs' internal environment of trees under the influence of oil contamination are revealed. It has been established that Acer platanoides L. has the least buffering potential of leaves among all tree species, which are widely represented in natural and anthropogenic-modified ecosystems and grow under the conditions of the Bytkiv-Babchens'ke oil deposit. After artificial acidification of the homogeneous leaves of Acer platanoides, taken from the zone of the oil deposit influence and the background territory, the displacement of the acidity index was 3.32 and 2.96, respectively. All tree species under oil contamination conditions are marked by an increase of the leaves' internal environment acidity comparing with the background area.
   Under oil deposit influence Acer platanoides is marked by the presence of the greatest lesions number of the leaf blades-the degree of necrosis is 4.19. The degree of leaf necrosis under the influence of oil pollution of the environment increases in the following row of investigated plants: Salix caprea L. -> Betula pendula Roth. -> Populus tremula L. -> Fagus sylvatica L. -> Populus pyramidalis L.. Acer platanoides L.
   The destroying of the trees leaf tissue in stressful growth conditions indicates the weakening of the protective properties of the species, reveals their sensitivity to oil pollution. The appearance of necrosis of the "fish skeleton" type in Fagus sylvatica and Acer platanoides is established, which affects 11 and 23% of leaves of these species. The decrease in the leaves' area of Populus tremula, Fagus sylvatica and Populus pyramidalis is fixed at 55, 40, 20%, respectively.
   The greatest value of the fluctuating leaf asymmetry coefficient is characteristic for Fagus sylvatica and Acer platanoides-0,09. Salix caprea and Betula pendula are identified as the most resistant species to the oil pollution and should be implemented in greening of the technogenically-transformed areas. These species are characterized by high phytoremediation ability and are effective phytomeliorants of the environment.
   Fagus sylvatica and Acer platanoides are sensitive and informative phytoindicators of the ecological state of the oil-contaminated environment. These species are recommended for use in fitomonitoring studies to evaluate the quality of the environment. Populus tremula and Populus pyramidalis are characterized by the average vitality among the studied tree species.

AB  - Narrow-leafed lupin is a major grain crop in southern Australia. Its freely branching growth habit is often seen as a limitation to grain yield, so genotypes with restricted branching are being investigated. Since agronomic recommendations for lupins have been developed with conventional, normal branching cultivars, agronomy, particularly population density, may need adjustment for restricted branching types. Here we report a study of population density requirements of 3 restricted branching genotypes that cover the range of variation available in degree of branching restriction, and a normal branching cultivar, Merrit, which is widely grown and has good general adaptation. The experiments were performed during 3 growing seasons at a number of sites throughout Western Australia. Data were analysed using recently developed statistical techniques, including spatial analysis to reduce error variation and a smoothing spline to minimise assumptions made about the form of the response to density. Generally, responsiveness to density was similar for all genotypes, as were optimal densities, which, with only one exception, were achieved at 35-57 plants/m(2). At higher densities there were fewer pods per plant and seeds per pod but heavier seeds; these effects were similar for all genotypes except in the case of pods per plant, which was reduced more by high density in the restricted branching types. Apart from yield, other advantages of high density were taller plants, larger grain, and slightly higher grain protein concentration.
   Yields were highly correlated with shoot dry mass, but not with harvest index. Shoot dry mass tended to be lower in restricted branching genotypes, but harvest indices were similar. However, for yield, shoot mass, and especially harvest index, interactions between genotype and environment were generally highly significant. These results indicate that the restricted branching genotypes currently available do not have wide suitability, but in environments where harvest index in normal branching lupins is poor or unstable and yield is not as strongly limited by growth, they could provide higher or more stable yields. Further work is required to identify 'niche' environments.
   Grain from restricted branching genotypes was generally less variable in size and had higher concentrations of P, K, S, Mg, and Mn, whereas some genotypes also had higher Ca, Cu, Na, and protein. Some of these changes in grain quality might be related to grain filling earlier in the season, under less stressful conditions and with less competition from concurrent vegetative growth than in normal branching genotypes.

AB  - Point and non-point source pollution to aquatic systems pose many challenges in maintaining ecosystem integrity. Aquatic sediments in many rivers, lakes, and harbors have been directly or indirectly contaminated by various types of chemical compounds. The Portland Harbor, a representative example of a contaminated sediment study, has played a key role in economic development of the City of Portland and the State of Oregon (USA) for decades. In addition, it has been a valuable resource for recreation, fishing, and navigation. Because of its current contamination, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed the harbor onto the National Priorities List by its designation as a federal superfund site. Therefore, this paper aims at demonstrating a unique forensic analysis and genetic source partitioning model that would help characterize the extent of organic contamination and build up an ultimate sampling scheme to be adopted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and EPA to aid in the final phase of feasibility study and remedial investigation of the harbor. Several sediment samples, collected from the Portland Harbor, are analyzed, characterized, and fingerprinted in terms of their hydrocarbon (HC) organic molecular marker (MM) signatures in this study. The distributions, chemical structures, and applicability of such MMs in determining characteristic group(s) representative for the study area are discussed and evaluated in this paper using the HC multi-tracer environmental forensic MM approach. Homologous long chain n-alkanes (C-16-C-38), carbon preference index (CPI), unresolved complex mixtures (UCM), and MMs such as pristane, phytane, tricyclic (C-19-C-29) and tetracyclic (C-24, C-28 and C-29) terpanes, 17 alpha(H), 21 beta(H)-hopanes (C-27-C-35), 5 alpha(H), 14 beta(H), 17 beta(H)-steranes (C-27-C-29) with a minor amounts of 5 alpha(H), 14 alpha(H), 17 alpha(H)-steranes and 13 alpha(H), 17 beta(H)-diasteranes are found to be the most suitable indicators to differentiate between petroleum hydrocarbon- from non-petroleum hydrocarbon-containing sediment particles. In contrast, high temperature thermogenic/pyrolytic-derived compounds are indicated by a specific group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This group, ranging from phenanthrene to dibenzo(ae)pyrene with different alkyl-substituted PAH series, is considered to be combustion products from fossil fuel. Extended Q-mode factor analysis and linear programming technique are also performed to: (a) examine the variations in the hydrocarbon MM data set, (b) group the data into specific associations (i.e., end-members), and (c) find statistically significant clusters in the data set to help assess and identify the various hydrocarbon pollution sources and original compositions reflecting aquatic sediment impact to the Portland Harbor.

AB  - The distribution of periphytic algae communities depends on various factors such as type of substrate, level of disturbance, nutrient availability and light. According to the prediction that impacts of anthropogenic activity provide changes in environmental characteristics, making impacted Palm swamps related to environmental changes such as deforestation and higher loads of nutrients via allochthonous, the hypothesis tested was: impacted Palm swamps have higher richness, density, biomass and biovolume of epiphytic algae. We evaluated the distribution and structure of epiphytic algae communities in 23 Palm swamps of Goias State under different environmental impacts. The community structure attributes here analyzed were composition, richness, density, biomass and biovolume. This study revealed the importance of the environment on the distribution and structuration of algal communities, relating the higher values of richness, biomass and biovolume with impacted environments. Acidic waters and high concentration of silica were important factors in this study. Altogether 200 taxa were identified, and the zygnemaphycea was the group most representative in richness and biovolume, whereas the diatoms, in density of studied epiphyton. Impacted Palm swamps in agricultural area presented two indicator species, Gomphonema lagenula Kutzing and Oedogonium sp, both related to mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions for total nitrogen concentrations of these environments.

AB  - Many different methods of synthesizing and analyzing environmental monitoring data exist. Given the diversity of current environmental monitoring projects, and the large number of scientists and policy-makers involved, there is a critical need for a universal format that both summarizes data sets and indicates any potential need for management action. Control charts, originally developed for industrial applications, represent one way of doing this. Control charts indicate when a system is going 'out of control' by plotting through time some measure of a stochastic process with reference to its expected value. Control charts can be constructed for many different types of indicators, whether univariate or multivariate. Control charts are simple to interpret, and can easily be updated whenever additional data become available. The relative risks of Type I (i.e., concluding meaningful change has occurred when actually it has not) and Type 11 (i.e., concluding meaningful change has not occurred when in fact it has) errors are intuitive and easily adjusted, and one may define a threshold for action at any desired level. Control charts may often be more informative than traditional statistical analyses such as regressions or parameter estimation with confidence intervals. The primary challenge in most situations will be determining a stable or baseline state for the ecological indicator in question.

AB  - Because of their high ecological relevance, algae are often used in environmental monitoring of freshwater ecosystems. They are used to assess the state of the environment, and can be used to estimate the diversity and productivity of the ecosystem. Chlorophyll a is the most commonly used indicator where no taxonomic information is obtained. In this two-year study, algae were monitored in small lotic waterbodies using a high precision method of evaluating algal pigments: delayed fluorescence (DF). The method allows quantifying algae and differentiating algal groups using pigments unique to each algal group. DF correlated strongly with biovolume (derived from cell count) data (r(2) = 0.94) and could therefore be recommended as a biomonitoring tool. In addition, seasonal dynamics in both the attached and suspended algal communities were studied. Both algal fractions displayed seasonal variations with either a single peak in biomass in summer (type 1), or with two peaks in biomass in spring and fall (type 2). Green algae dominated type 1 patterned communities whereas diatoms dominated type 2 patterned communities. Spatial synchronicity between sampling sites and waterbodies was observed within the studied watershed. Sampling time rather than spatial site selection was found to be a key factor in the study of algal communities in lotic bodies of water.

AB  - In the paper, we mainly investigate why China's local governments tend to undermine the rule of central government in restriction of land transfer for energy-intensive industries (Ells). Built on the standard political economic literature, we hypothesise that political promotion incentive for the local secretary (measured by age and tenure), the de facto "first-in-command" official, regarding rapid economic development, which is encouraged by the existing cadre evaluation system, lead to poor performance of local government in terms of energy and the environment. The empirical results state that being closer to the age of 57 and having spent more than 4 years in office significantly enhance the secretary's promotion incentive, which in turn spurs the local government to provide more land for EII projects, even at the expense of environmental degradation, and the results hold across several robustness tests. Thus, we suggest that more weight be given to environment-related indicators in the cadre evaluation system, and the newly introduced lifelong accounting system for the ecological environment should be implemented effectively.

AB  - We present a method for combining individual indicator results into a comprehensive diagnostic of fishing impacts on fish populations and communities. A conceptual framework for interpreting combined trends in a set of simple indicators is proposed, relying beforehand on qualitative expectations anchored in ecological theory. The initial state of the community is first assessed using published information. Which combinations of trends are acceptable or undesirable is decided, depending on the initial status. The indicators are then calculated from a time-series and their time trends are estimated as the slopes of linear models. Finally, the test results are combined within the predefined framework, providing a diagnostic on the dynamics of fishing impacts on populations and communities. The method is demonstrated for nine coastal and shelf-sea fish communities monitored by French surveys. Most communities were persistently or increasingly impacted by fishing. In addition, climate change seems to have contributed to changes in East Atlantic communities.

AB  - Fecal pollution remains a challenge for water quality managers at Great Lakes and inland recreational beaches. The fecal indicator of choice at these beaches is typically Escherichia coli (E. coli), determined by culture-based methods that require over 18 h to obtain results. Researchers at the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have developed a rapid E. coli qPCR methodology (EPA Draft Method C) that can provide same-day results for improving public health protection with demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and data acceptance criteria. However, limited information is currently available to compare the occurrence of E. coli determined by cultivation and by EPA Draft Method C (Method C). This study provides a large-scale data collection effort to compare the occurrence of E. coli determined by these alternative methods at more than 100 Michigan recreational beach and other sites using the complete set of quantitative data pairings and selected subsets of the data and sites meeting various eligibility requirements. Simple linear regression analyses of composite (pooled) data indicated a correlation between results of the E. coli monitoring approaches for each of the multi-site datasets as evidenced by Pearson R-squared values ranging from 0.452 to 0.641. Theoretical Method C threshold values, expressed as mean log10 target gene copies per reaction, that corresponded to an established E. coli culture method water quality standard of 300 MPN or CFU /100 mL varied only from 1.817 to 1.908 for the different datasets using this model. Different modeling and derivation approaches that incorporated within and betweensite variability in the estimates also gave Method C threshold values in this range but only when relatively wellcorrelated datasets were used to minimize the error. A hypothetical exercise to evaluate the frequency of water impairments based on theoretical qPCR thresholds corresponding to the E. coli water quality standard for culture methods suggested that the methods may provide the same beach notification outcomes over 90% of the time with Method C results differing from culture method results that indicated acceptable and unacceptable water quality at overall rates of 1.9% and 6.6%, respectively. Results from this study provide useful information about the relationships between E. coli determined by culture and qPCR methods across many diverse freshwater sites and should facilitate efforts to implement qPCR-based E. coli detection for rapid recreational water quality monitoring on a large scale in the State of Michigan.

AB  - The water quality of reservoirs is one of the key factors in the operation and water quality management of reservoirs. Dissolved oxygen (DO) in water column is essential for microorganisms and a significant indicator of the state of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, two artificial neural network (ANN) models including back propagation neural network (BPNN) and adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) approaches and multilinear regression (MLR) model were developed to estimate the DO concentration in the Feitsui Reservoir of northern Taiwan. The input variables of the neural network are determined as water temperature, pH, conductivity, turbidity, suspended solids, total hardness, total alkalinity, and ammonium nitrogen. The performance of the ANN models and MLR model was assessed through the mean absolute error, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient computed from the measured and model-simulated DO values. The results reveal that ANN estimation performances were superior to those of MLR. Comparing to the BPNN and ANFIS models through the performance criteria, the ANFIS model is better than the BPNN model for predicting the DO values. Study results show that the neural network particularly using ANFIS model is able to predict the DO concentrations with reasonable accuracy, suggesting that the neural network is a valuable tool for reservoir management in Taiwan.

AB  - Cycling index is an important ecological indicator used in ecosystem analysis. The higher the cycling in an ecosystem, the higher the utilization of mass and energy within the system before it is lost due to respiration and other factors. For a stock-flow type ecosystem model at steady state, Finn's cycling index (FCI) can be computed using simple matrix algebra. However, it is difficult to measure how well this index represents the actual cycling occurring in the system. in this paper, we study cycling in ecological networks using an individual based approach (particle tracking algorithm). This new simulation method provides access to the pathway data of individual particles that flow in the system, therefore one can quantify cycling using this pathway data quite literally We used particle tracking simulations (PTS) to compute a cycling index using Finn's idea of flux based cycling.

AB  - River regulation and water resource development have resulted in significant deterioration in aquatic ecosystems worldwide, including reductions in wetland extent, changed flow regimes, and declines in biodiversity. The impacts on the composition and distribution of waterbird assemblages has not been studied previously at the scale of a major river basin. We investigated the relationship between waterbird assemblage composition and ecosystem health across the 21 catchments of the Murray-Darling Basin in south-east Australia, which contains major wetlands that have been adversely affected by river regulation and over-allocation of water for irrigation. We allocated 51,000 surveys of 96 waterbird species, obtained from the New Atlas of Australian Birds database, to 117 one-degree grid squares for multivariate statistical analysis (MVA). Hierarchical clustering showed five main groups of squares reflecting strong biogeographic gradients. Pronounced spatial autocorrelation in the waterbird assemblage data was found. Unequal survey effort across grid squares and varying taxonomic scope also hindered conventional MVA and interpretation. To circumvent these constraints, survey data were recompiled at the half-degree square resolution after removing surveys with few waterbird records, leaving 17,448 surveys of 80 species. A novel sequential approach of multivariate regression of distance matrices, ordination of Bray-Curtis residuals, and post hoc correlation of the independent variable was used to test the hypothesis that assemblage composition varies systematically with Catchment Condition, after controlling for spatial autocorrelation, biogeographic trends and unequal survey effort. Ordination of the residuals of the half-degree square Bray Curtis association matrix revealed a strong relationship between a nine-point index of Catchment Condition and waterbird assemblage composition. The colonial nesting waterbird guild (egrets, herons, ibis and spoonbills), was uniquely identified as being aligned with catchments in moderate to good condition. Waterbird assemblage composition shows significant spatial variation throughout the Murray-Darling Basin, influenced by the hydrological and ecological condition of catchments as well as by natural biogeographic factors. The least degraded catchments offer the best habitat for the colonially nesting waterbird guild, the group most adversely affected historically by river regulation and water diversions. These catchments require protection from water resource development if such habitat is to be maintained. Our results support the conservation objective of improving wetland health in degraded catchments through delivering environmental flows to ensure breeding and population maintenance of colonial nesting waterbirds.

KW  - UNITED-STATES
KW  - ENERGY
AB  - We examine trends from 1970 to the mid 1990's of some variables related to development and sustainability for Costa Rica, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United States: first, by calculating energy and agricultural efficiencies over time, second, by examining the environmental impacts of economic activities, and third, by estimating ecological footprints. We find that many "optimistic" arguments about sustainability have been misleading, and that there is little or no indication that we are becoming any more sustainable or even efficient. Total quality-corrected energy consumption has increased for all five countries and the renewable energy portion is decreasing. The efficiency of turning energy into both agricultural production and GDP has declined for all countries except for the US. In general, there is a remarkable linearity between resource use and economic and agricultural production over all countries and all years, suggesting severe biophysical constraints to sustainable objectives. On the other hand, per capita ecological footprints have decreased somewhat in Costa Rica, Mexico, and the United States, while national ecological footprints have tended to remain constant except for Korea. While there has been a reduction of specific pollutants in the United States, some of this has been achieved by exporting heavy manufacturing industries. We conclude that continued population and economic growth in each country is likely to make the achievement of any kind of 'sustainability' increasingly unlikely. Sustainability, if that is desirable, requires a very different approach than what we have undertaken to date.

AB  - A national-level land degradation risk monitoring system identified an important grazing area in central northern Namibia as an area at risk of environmental change. A time series analysis of primary indicators used for this monitoring system for the period 1971-2001 shows that increase in livestock pressure and high rainfall variability are potential threats. The study presented here compares these national-level results with those obtained by interviewing local farmers about their perceptions of past and present states of the environment in the grazing area. A majority of interviewees claim that grazing resources have decreased and deforestation has taken place since they first arrived. Increased livestock numbers and decreasing rainfall were thought to be major factors leading to perceived environmental changes. These perceptions support conclusions from national monitoring. The interviews reveal a more complex picture indicating that decreasing availability of grazing outside the study area, improved road access to the area, provision of permanent access to water, fencing of large areas of the commons, and prolonged dryness, in combination with non-adaptive land management, are major factors causing environmental changes. It is suggested that local knowledge contributes a sound basis for development and assessment of national monitoring initiatives. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fisheries is regarded a significant impact to the marine environment, and the management of fisheries under maritime environmental policies will be an important task for the future. A relative ecological risk model is applied to define risk components of gain and loss in relationship to 7 demersal fishing m tiers for the seafloor ecosystem in the German EEZ. Four scenarios are evaluated against the policy goals from European maritime policies. It is shown that two measures combined in an integrative assessment, i.e. effort reduction to MSY and areal closures, are likely to meet requirements from. 3 environmental policies, i.e. the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Habitats Directive, and the Common Fisheries Policy. Sustainability in terms of maximum sustainable yield for fisheries is likely to provide only partial improvement of the environmental status of the marine ecosystem. The implementation into the pressure-state-response framework of environmental management is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are associated with faecal pollution of water, linked to swimmer-associated gastroenteritis and demonstrate a wide range of antibiotic resistance. The Coomera River is a main water source for the Pimpama-Coomera watershed and is located in South East Queensland, Australia, which is used intensively for agriculture and recreational purposes. This study investigated the diversity of E. faecalis and E. faecium using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and associated antibiotic resistance profiles.
   Results: Total enterococcal counts (cfu/ml) for three/six sampling sites were above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommended level during rainfall periods and fall into categories B and C of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines (with a 1-10% gastrointestinal illness risk). E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates were grouped into 29 and 23 SNP profiles (validated by MLST analysis) respectively. This study showed the high diversity of E. faecalis and E. faecium over a period of two years and both human-related and human-specific SNP profiles were identified. 81.8% of E. faecalis and 70.21% of E. faecium SNP profiles were associated with genotypic and phenotypic antibiotic resistance. Gentamicin resistance was higher in E. faecalis (47% resistant) and harboured the aac(6')-aph(2') gene. Ciprofloxacin resistance was more common in E. faecium (12.7% resistant) and gyrA gene mutations were detected in these isolates. Tetracycline resistance was less common in both species while tet(L) and tet(M) genes were more prevalent. Ampicillin resistance was only found in E. faecium isolates with mutations in the pbp5 gene. Vancomycin resistance was not detected in any of the isolates. We found that antibiotic resistance profiles further sub-divided the SNP profiles of both E. faecalis and E. faecium.
   Conclusions: The distribution of E. faecalis and E. faecium genotypes is highly diverse in the Coomera River. The SNP genotyping method is rapid and robust and can be applied to study the diversity of E. faecalis and E. faecium in waterways. It can also be used to test for human-related and human-specific enterococci in water. The resolving power can be increased by including antibiotic-resistant profiles which can be used as a possible source tracking tool. This warrants further investigation.

AB  - In today's world, complex global business environment is in a state of continuous change. Therefore, business organizations are looking for an innovative way to optimize and to support the performance of their business processes to meet out their market share in order to maintain a competitive edge. Usually, business processes are monitored in near real-time using Key Performance Indicators (KPI). KPI is in turn calculated from metrics from business processes. In the case of business outsourcing, the KPI calculation from the metrics of business process is to be carried out cutting across the inter-organizations boundaries and spanning multiple domains. This process poses several challenges in the computation of the KPIs. Some of these challenges include uncertainty in metric values, just-in-time KPI computation and scalability. To address the above challenges of business organizations, a four-tier Complex business Activity Monitoring system with Event Processing (CAMEP) is proposed. The performance evaluation of the proposed system is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CAMEP method by comparing with the existing BAM approaches. The proposed CAMEP is also analysed using the ANOVA and T test.

AB  - The significance of national differences in family formations has been addressed through the social policy debate over women's position in different welfare state regimes. However, the nature and effects of sub-national family geographies remains under-researched. In this paper we use census mapping to describe regional and local differences in partnering and parenting within Britain. We develop an index of the 'Motherhood Employment Effect' to indicate different geographical levels of adherence to the 'traditional' male breadwinner/female homemaker family, and use a 'Family Conventionality' index to describe geographical differences in the social evaluation of marriage. The geography of family formations thus described does not follow the better known 'north-south' or 'urban-rural' geographies of economic performance and prosperity. We use the example of Lancashire and Yorkshire to explore further the socio-economic associations of this family geography, employing additional indicators of 'household conventionality' and 'family restructuring'. Finally, we speculate as to how this relatively unfamiliar family geography may be related to the existence of regional gender cultures, and briefly outline some implications for social policy.

AB  - The rationale behind most car-following (CF) models is the possibility to appraise and formalize how drivers naturally follow each other. Characterizing and parametrizing Normative Driving Behavior (NDB) became major goals, especially during the last 25 years. Most CF models assumed driver propensity for constant, safe distance is axiomatic. This paper challenges the idea of safety distance as the main parameter defining a unique (or natural) NDB. Instead, it states drivers can adapt to reactive and proactive car following. Drawing on recent CF models close to the Nagoya paradigm and on other phenomena (e.g., wave movement in Nature), we conceived car following by Driving to keep Inertia (DI) as an alternative to Driving to keep Distance (DD). On a driving simulator, three studies (N = 113) based on a repeated-measures experimental design explored the efficiency of these elementary techniques by measuring individual driver performance (e.g., accelerations, decelerations, average speed, distance to leader). Drivers easily grasped and applied either technique and easily switched back and forth between the two. As an overall indicator, all the studies revealed DI trips use about 20% less fuel than DD trips do.

KW  - coastal state indicators
AB  - This paper examines the potential of coastal video systems as a tool to aid effective coastal zone management. The results presented in this contribution are derived from a large-scale international European research programme, the Coast View project. This research focuses on the derivation of simple parameters or coastal state indicators' from oblique video images, which can assist in monitoring and managing the coastal environment. Coastal state indicators (CSIs) can be defined as: "A reduced set of issue-related parameters that can simply, adequately and quantitatively describe the dynamic-state and evolutionary trends of a coastal system". A consortium of scientists and national-scale coastal zone managers were formed in order to define a set of CSIs that were clearly aligned with specific coastal management problems. It is shown that potentially CSIs can have a positive impact on management areas such as coastal protection, navigation, recreation and ecosystem protection. Video stations were installed at four morphologically dissimilar field sites, each with their own set of coastal management problems. These sites were used to ground truth and test the utility of video-derived CSIs for coastal zone management. A methodology is presented for clearly associating CSIs with strategic management objectives, setting clear benchmarks beyond which action is required and providing an assessment stage that appraises the result of the action taken. An example case study is presented illustrating how video-derived CSIs can potentially satisfy the strategic objectives set by coastal managers. The example presented here shows how video-derived estimates of the Momentary Coastline (MCL) position can be used to provide cost-effective estimates of shoreline change with higher temporal and spatial resolution than existing survey methods.

AB  - Large old trees and decaying logs are key-retained structures for the retention forestry approach, but quantitative estimations of the role of fallen logs in the overall diversity and composition of forest vascular species are few and controversial. Particularly for mesic deciduous forests only a small number of such estimates are known. Our study aimed to partly fill this gap using data collected in the Reserve Kaluzhskie Zaseki where large Quercus robur individuals of more than 300 years old and fallen logs are frequent. We found 44 fallen oak logs supporting vascular plants within a 200-ha forest tract. The vegetation in plots of 1 m2 located on the fallen logs and on the forest floor adjacent to the logs was surveyed together with vegetation in fifteen 10 ? 10 m plots randomly placed in patches without large fallen logs. NMDS and PERMANOVA were applied to examine differences in composition between fallen logs and forest floor. Generalized linear models were used to examine the relationships between environmental variables and species richness. Additive diversity partitioning was performed to examine differences in species richness and to estimate the contribution of the fallen logs to the general diversity in vascular species. In total, 71 vascular plant species in 108 1 m2-plots were identified. Twenty-five and 16 species were detected only on fallen logs and on the forest floor, respectively. More than 60% of the studied logs were in early stages of decomposition; their mean diameter was 75.4 ? 25.6 cm. Fallen logs significantly affected species richness and composition in terms of both woody seedlings and herbaceous species. The diameter of logs significantly and positively affected species diversity and composition. Large logs with cracked bark at the first two stages of decay were places of successful vascular plant establishment and growth. The abundance and frequency of tree seedlings were higher on the logs than on the forest floor and seven out of ten tree species appeared to be significant indicator species for the log-plots. Illumination varied over the observed sites and directly influenced the richness of herbaceous species and the overall species composition, but had no effect on woody species richness. We conclude that retention of large fallen logs can be an effective tool for maintaining and restoring the vascular species richness and composition in mesic broad-leaved forests.

AB  - Gamma ray spectrometric technique has been used to determine activity concentrations of some primordial radionuclides in the naturally occurring uranium, actinium and thorium series and of non-series K-40 in soil samples collected from five major towns in Oyo State, Southwestern Nigeria. Activity concentration determination was done using a high purity germanium (HPGe) detector. It ranged from 85.83 +/- 4.04 Bq kg(-1) to 1,850.60 +/- 36.83 Bq kg(-1) for K-40; 5.23 +/- 0.34 Bq kg(-1) to 198.31 +/- 4.10 Bq kg(-1) for Tl-208 (indicator for Th-232) and 7.82 +/- 0.42 Bq kg(-1) to 64.65 +/- 2.00 Bq kg(-1) for Bi-214 (indicator for U-238). The outdoor absorbed dose rate in air due to each of the primordial radionuclides was calculated from the mean values of the activity concentration in each sample. Values ranged from 3.60 +/- 0.17 nGy h(-1) to 77.73 +/- 1.55 nGy h(-1) for K-40, 3.48 +/- 0.23 nGy h(-1) to 132.07 +/- 2.73 nGy h(-1) for Tl-208 and 3.35 +/- 0.21 nGy h(-1) to 27.73 +/- 0.86 nGy h(-1) for Bi-214. The absorbed dose rate in air was the highest for rocky areas, while the lowest value came from non-rocky, non-industrialized areas. The estimated annual outdoor effective dose equivalents for the two rocky areas were 385.76Sv y(-1) and 221.28Sv y(-1). The estimated annual outdoor effective dose equivalents for the two industrialized areas were 64.05Sv y(-1) and 47.65Sv y(-1). The value for non-rocky, non-industrialized areas was 19.19Sv y(-1). The average value for the study area was 147.59Sv y(-1). The estimated collective effective dose equivalent for the area was 9.77 x 10(2) man-Sv y(-1). The expected number of people in the study area at risk of incurring cancer per year as a result of radioactivity in the soil was estimated to be 11; this value represents approximately 7% of the estimated 160 people for 18 Nigerian cities, approximately 69% of 16 people estimated for oil producing areas of Nigeria and less than the United States Environmental Protection Agency regulatory limit of 1 cancer case to 10,000 people. Also, this result shows that local variability of natural radionuclides in soil depends on local geology of the area. The incidence number was 2.4 people per million.

AB  - The simultaneous presence of natural and anthropogenic stressors in aquatic ecosystems can challenge the identification of factors causing decline in fish populations. These stressors include chemical mixtures and natural abiotic and biotic factors such as water temperature and parasitism. Effects of cumulative stressors may vary from antagonism to synergism at the organismal or population levels and may not be predicted from exposure to individual stressors. This study aimed to evaluate the combined effects of chronic exposure to cadmium (Cd) and elevated water temperature (23 degrees C) or parasite infection in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using a multi-level biological approach, including RNA-sequencing. Fish were exposed to diet-borne Cd (6 mu g Cd/g wet feed), individually and in combination with thermal (23 degrees C) or parasitic stressors, for 28 days. The parasite challenge consisted of a single exposure to glochidia (larvae) of the freshwater mussel (Strophitus undulatus), which encysts in fish gills, fins and skin. Results indicated lower fish length, weight, and relative growth rate in fish exposed to a higher water temperature (23 degrees C). Body condition and hepatosomatic index of trout were, however, higher in the 23 degrees C temperature treatment compared to the control fish kept at 15 degrees C. Exposure to thermal stress or parasitism did not influence tissue Cd bioaccumulation. More than 700 genes were differentially transcribed in fish exposed to the individual thermal stress treatment. However, neither Cd exposure nor parasite infection affected the number of differentially transcribed genes, compared to controls. The highest number of differentially transcribed genes (969 genes) was observed in trout exposed to combined Cd and high temperature stressors; these genes were mainly related to stress response, protein folding, calcium metabolism, bone growth, energy metabolism, and immune system; functions overlapped with responses found in fish solely exposed to higher water temperature. Only 40 genes were differentially transcribed when fish were exposed to Cd and glochidia and were related to the immune system, apoptosis process, energy metabolism and malignant tumor. These results suggest that dietary Cd may exacerbate the temperature stress and, to a lesser extent, parasitic infection stress on trout transcriptomic responses. Changes in the concentrations of liver ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase, heat shock protein 70 and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances coupled to changes in the activities of cellular glutathione S-transferase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were also observed at the cellular level. This study may help understand effects of freshwater fish exposure to cumulative stressors in a changing environment.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the state of the environment in Sosnowiec (southern Poland) based on the ratio of air pollution tolerance index (APTI) and the determination of concentrations of selected metals in soil and plant material. The study was conducted in ten stands: five of them were identified as 'polluted' and five as 'clean' stands. The metal content was evaluated by the atomic absorption method. For APTI calculation, analysis of total chlorophyll concentration and relative water content, the pH of the extract from the leaves was used. Analysis of the bioaccumulation of metals in the leaves revealed excessive concentrations of Pb (32.4 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (129.78 mg kg(-1)) at the KWK (coal mine) and Las (forest) stands. Higher capacity accumulation of Pb and Fe was characteristic for Plantago lanceolata. The permitted content of Pb (762.6 mg kg(-1)) in the soil samples collected at the Cedler stand was exceeded. Elevated levels, higher than the permissible concentration of Cd, were documented in soil samples from most stands within the city. In soil samples collected at the Cedler stand, Cd concentration was almost 15 times higher than acceptable for soil (4 mg kg(-1)). Based on the scope of the APTI 4.4-9.42 index obtained for the studied species, they should be considered sensitive plants. All selected species can be used as bioindicators for environmental pollution.

AB  - Globalization and globalization processes that have been particularly noticeable in the last few decades have made an impact on the transfer of power centres and have significantly changed the geopolitical picture of the world. In order to affect globalization, its impact must be measured, but the first precondition is to understand globalization in order to be able to properly measure it at all. Measuring a complex phenomenon such as globalization requires the inclusion of a number of elements on which measuring will be based, such as measuring the social, economic, political and ecological dimensions of globalization. Certain elements of globalization are harder to measure because the indicators involved in each element are not entirely appropriate. Economic globalization is mostly made up of economic indicators that are unequivocal and comparable, while social or political globalization is determined by indicators that depend on economic strength and state development. Globalization processes have significantly influenced the economy of the Republic of Croatia as well as the state of the environment. The aim of the paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the globalization trends within the Croatian economy as well as a comparison between the Croatian economy and the economies of neighbouring countries that have had a similar transition path based on the composite globalization index. In this paper, a regression analysis of individual elements within the composite globalization index was conducted.

AB  - There is a need for long-term data on N2O emission in Central Europe to provide a thorough understanding of the variability of the emission processes as affected by different biotic and abiotic drivers. It could be helpful for national greenhouse gas inventories and also for revealing potential ways of mitigation. In order to describe temporal variability of soil N2O emission under varying key conditions, a field experiment was carried out at a cropland site on loamy and clay loamy Chernozems in Central Hungary. Dynamics of N2O emissions were observed bi-weekly during a two-year-long study (November 2017-November 2019) using a static closed chamber-gas chromatographic method. Additional variables, including soil water content, soil temperature, leaf area index, vegetation index and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 were also measured. Besides, a laboratory pot experiment was conducted focusing on the role of soil water content, N fertilizer, and plant presence on soil N2O emissions. Average field N2O emissions during the study period varied between 0.27 and 29.94 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) with the largest emission peaks measured following the freeze-thaw cycle during wintertime. Additional N2O emission peaks were observed following applications of N fertilizer and at high soil water content. Significant positive correlations were found between field N2O emission and both soil water content and vegetation index. In contrast, a negative relationship was found between N2O emission and soil temperature. Similar pattern was observed in the pot experiment with a significant positive correlation between N2O emissions and soil water content when neither soil nitrate content nor temperature were limiting for microbial denitrification. In addition, a significant correlation between N2O emission and fertilizer rate was revealed at the soil water content higher than 30% both in bare and planted soil. However, variations in soil N2O emission among the treatments were not significantly correlated with plant presence, but a partial positive effect was observed when the soil water content was higher than 30% and samples were treated with 150 kg ha(-1) N. Based on the measured N2O emission from both field and lab experiments and its relationship with the different drivers, it can be concluded that soil N2O emission was strongly influenced by soil water content and N fertilizer rates and plant presence could moderately modify these responses.

AB  - Humid tropical forests support large stocks of surface soil carbon (C) that exhibit high spatial variability over scales of meters to landscapes (km). Reactive minerals and organo-metal complexes are known to contribute to C accumulation in these ecosystems, although potential interactions with environmental factors such as oxygen (O-2) availability have received much less attention. Reducing conditions can potentially contribute to C accumulation, yet anaerobic metabolic processes such as iron (Fe) reduction can also drive substantial C losses. We tested whether these factors could explain variation in soil C (0-10 and 10-20 cm depths) over multiple spatial scales in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico, using reduced iron (Fe(II)) concentrations as an index of reducing conditions across sites differing in vegetation, topographic position, and/or climate. Fine root biomass and Fe(II) were the best overall correlates of site (n = 6) mean C concentrations and stocks from 0 to 20 cm depth (r = 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). Litterfall decreased as reducing conditions, total and dead fine root biomass, and soil C increased among sites, suggesting that decomposition rates rather than C inputs regulated soil C content at the landscape scale. Strong relationships between Fe(II) and dead fine root biomass suggest that reducing conditions suppressed particulate organic matter decomposition. The optimal mixed-effects regression model for individual soil samples (n = 149) showed that aluminum (Al) and Fe in citrate/ascorbate and oxalate extractions, Fe(II), fine root biomass, and interactions between Fe(II) and Al explained most of the variation in C concentrations (pseudo R-2 = 0.82). The optimal model of C stocks was similar but did not include fine root biomass (pseudo R-2 = 0.62). In these models, soil C concentrations and stocks increased with citrate/ascorbate-extractable Al and oxalate-extractable Fe. However, soil C decreased with citrate/ascorbate-extractable Fe, an index of Fe susceptible to anaerobic microbial reduction. At the site scale (n = 6), ratios of citrate/ascorbate to oxalate-extractable Fe consistently decreased across a landscape O-2 gradient as C increased. We suggest that the impact of reducing conditions on organic matter decomposition and the presence of organo-metal complexes and C sorption by short-range order Fe and Al contribute to C accumulation, whereas the availability of an Fe pool to sustain anaerobic respiration in soil microsites partially attenuates soil C accumulation in these ecosystems.

AB  - We critically reassess a conceptual model here, dealing with the potential effect of plant diversity on climate-vegetation feedback, and we provide an improved version adjusted to plant types that prevailed during the African Humid Period (AHP). Our work contributes to the understanding of the timing and abruptness of vegetation decline at the end of the AHP, investigated by various working groups during the past 2 decades using a wide range of model and palaeo-proxy reconstruction approaches. While some studies indicated an abrupt collapse of vegetation at the end of the AHP, others suggested a gradual decline. Claussen et al. (2013) introduced a new aspect in the discussion, proposing that plant diversity in terms of moisture requirements could affect the strength of climate-vegetation feedback. In a conceptual model study, the authors illustrated that high plant diversity could stabilize an ecosystem, whereas a reduction in plant diversity might allow for an abrupt regime shift under gradually changing environmental conditions.
   In the light of recently published pollen data and the current state of ecological literature, the conceptual model by Claussen et al. (2013) reproduces the main features of different plant types interacting together with climate, but it does not capture the reconstructed diversity of AHP vegetation. Especially tropical gallery forest taxa, indirectly linked to local precipitation, are not appropriately represented.
   With a new model version adjusted to AHP vegetation, we can simulate a diverse mosaic-like environment as reconstructed from pollen, and we observe a stabilizing effect of high functional diversity on vegetation cover and precipitation. Sensitivity studies with different combinations of plant types highlight the importance of plant composition on system stability, and the stabilizing or destabilizing potential a single plant type may inherit.
   The model's simplicity limits its application; however, it provides a useful tool to study the roles of real plant types in an ecosystem and their combined climate-vegetation feedback under changing precipitation regimes.

AB  - Anthropogenic increase of fine sediment loading is one of the main pressures for rivers worldwide. Particularly, Alpine streams are increasingly facing this issue due to sediment flushing operations from hydropower reservoirs, aimed at recovering storage for preserving electricity generation. Although Controlled Sediment Flushing Operations (CSFOs) are becoming increasingly frequent, ecological indicators to adequately assess and monitor their impact on the stream ecosystem have been poorly developed. In this work, we aimed to perform a screening of currently available biomonitoring tools to evaluate the CSFO effects on the riverine biota and adequately assess its recovery, starting from the recognition of the main ecological mechanisms triggered by the mentioned activities on benthic macroinvertebrate communities. We used two independent datasets concerning two reservoirs in the central Italian Alps to investigate the temporal effects of CSFOs repeated for four consecutive years (case-study I), and the impact of a single CSFO at a seasonal scale through a before/after-control/impact approach (case-study II). Initially, we quantified the CSFO impact on the richness and beta-diversity of macroinvertebrate communities by combining multivariate and univariate statistical techniques. Then, we compared the performance of the Siltation Index for LoTic EcoSystems (SILTES), recently developed for detecting siltation impact in Alpine streams, with that of the generic index currently adopted to assess the ecological status (sensu Water Framework Directive) of the Italian rivers, and of another sediment-specific index, but developed for a different bio-geographical area. The analysis of the two case-studies demonstrated that the nestedness (i.e. taxa loss) is the primary source of biological impairment caused by CSFOs. Moreover, we found that SILTES was more effective than the other indices because of its strong correlation with the nestedness, and since it properly discriminated impaired and pristine conditions, at both multi-annual and seasonal scale. In the first case-study, a threshold in the temporal trend of this index was detected, indicating a recovery within three months. In the second one, SILTES showed a recovery to pre-event seasonal values after nine months from the CSFO, due to larger and more persistent sediment deposition. This study demonstrates that SILTES could be adopted as a benchmark to improve the management of CSFOs from an ecological viewpoint. Our findings can be extended to the management of other sediment-related activities affecting mountainous streams worldwide, and, more generally, the adopted approach can be replicated for developing new ecological tools to manage other disturbances to river environments.

AB  - Monitoring and reporting on the state of nature gained increasing importance in the European Union with the implementation of the Habitats Directive and the Natura 2000 network. Reporting habitat conservation status requires detailed knowledge on many aspects of habitats at different spatial levels. Remote sensing is recognised as a powerful tool to acquire synoptic data on habitats, but to date, its use for Natura 2000 monitoring and reporting is still very limited. One reason for this appears to be the knowledge gap between the nature conservation agencies and the remote sensing community. We conducted a review of legal monitoring and reporting requirements on Natura 2000 habitats, looked into the current use of remote sensing in habitat reporting, and consulted monitoring experts in nature conservation administrations to find out about their attitude and expectations towards remote sensing. In this paper, we disclose and summarise the real data needs behind the legal requirements for Natura 2000 habitat monitoring and reporting, analyse opportunities and constraints for remote sensing, and highlight bottlenecks and pathways to resolve them. Monitoring experts are not unwilling to use remote sensing data, but they are unsure of whether remote sensing can suit their needs in a cost-effective way. They look upon remote sensing as a one-way process of data deliverance and fail to see the importance of their active cooperation. Based on our findings, we argue that the integration of remote sensing into Natura 2000 habitat monitoring could benefit from (1) harmonising and standardising approaches, (2) focusing on data at hand to develop readily useful products, (3) a proper validation of both traditional and remote sensing methods, and (4) an enhanced sharing and exchange of ideas and results between the different research communities involved.

AB  - Aim Land-use history can be an important determinant of ecosystem characteristics, even in landscapes that outwardly appear 'natural'. In New England, like much of the eastern United States, the natural reforestation of agricultural lands over the past 150 years has created a predominantly forested landscape. Understanding the physiographical and historical factors controlling forest structure and composition is a major challenge to ecologists, conservationists and land managers.
   Location We studied the forest structure and composition of Petersham, Massachusetts, which is located in the Central Upland physiographical province of New England. Like much of New England, Petersham was largely cleared for agriculture by the mid-1800s, but most of the agricultural fields were abandoned and naturally reforested in the late-1800s and early 1900s. The modern landscape is > 90% forested by a mosaic of primary and secondary woodlands.
   Methods At seventy-four randomly selected 0.04-ha plots, we measured the abundances of all vascular plants in the overstory and understory and nine physiographical and historical variables.
   Results Species richness was primarily related to landform: species-rich communities occurred in poorly drained basins and species-poor communities occurred on well-drained glacial outwash. Distributions of the sixty-nine most common species were associated with ( in order of importance) landform, past land use and elevation. Many species were restricted to specific physiographical conditions, but no species were restricted to specific past land uses. Nine plant associations identified by two-way indicator species analysis were associated with elevation, landform, soil texture and past land use. Ordination by canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the vegetation reflected two principal gradients: a physiographical gradient, defined by landform and soil texture, and a land-use gradient.
   Main conclusions These analyses suggest the following ranking of factors controlling forest structure and composition in this landscape at this time: landform > agricultural history > elevation > hurricane = fire = logging. Even in this physically heterogenous landscape, land-use history continues to play an important role in shaping forest vegetation 100-150 years after agricultural abandonment and reforestation.

AB  - The relevance of the research consists in the need to search for invention of accurate and informative indicator for ecological monitoring.
   The aim of the research is to study the features of chemical elements accumulation in annual rings of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) of different areas of growth; evaluate the information content and accuracy of the annual rings of trees as an indicator of the environment state.
   Object: annual rings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.).
   Methods: selection of ordinary pine cores; natural drying, separation of samples into time intervals, grinding of cores; quantitative instrumental neutron-activation method of analysis (28 chemical elements) for all samples; processing and analysis of empirical data by statistical methods.
   Results. Chemical elemental composition of annual rings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was determined. The samples were selected in three regions of Russia: Tomsk region, Kemerovo region and the Republic of Buryatia. Comparison of chemical elemental composition of annual tree rings of different regions helped to see geochemical features of each territory separately. Specific elements for the Tomsk region tree were: Rb (0,5 mg/kg), Cs (0,01 mg/kg), Ba (3 mg/kg), Ce (0,02 mg/kg) and other. For wood of Kemerovo region: Fe (34 mg/kg), Cr (1 mg/kg), Sb (0,002 mg/kg), As (0,01 mg/kg), La (0,01 mg/kg), U (0,004 mg/kg) and other. For wood from the Republic of Buryatia: Br (1 mg/kg), Sr (7 mg/kg), Ag (0,04 mg/kg), Au (0,001 mg/kg), Th (0,001 mg/kg) and other. Thus, the dendrogeochemical method of research can be used to assess the geochemical situation of the territory by the level of accumulation of chemical elements in the annual rings of the tree. The dynamics of chemical elements entering the annual rings allow us to study the history of transformation of chemical elemental composition of the environment. Thus, iron and chromium trends for Pinus sylvestris of Kemerovo region reflect the development of ferrous metallurgy, and trends As, Ag, Cs, Sb, U, Sm, Th and Br - the development of the coal industry in the region. Trends in alkali metals Rb, Cs, radioactive U and rare earth elements Nd, Sm, Eu showed the intensity of the impact in different time intervals of the nuclear fuel cycle and other alleged sources on the environment of the Tomsk region. Dendrochemical monitoring can be used for studying local and global environmental changes and allows reconstructing the history of past contamination.

AB  - Animals are often kept in conditions with low environmental complexity and for long periods in barren artificial environments. This has been shown to lead to poor welfare in many species of animals. We assessed the emotional responses of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus L., maintained for different intervals in a barren or enriched environment. Four groups of fish were tested individually for emotionality by inserting a novel object in the glass aquarium to assess behavioural responses, such as indicators of fear and exploratory behaviours. Fish kept for 7 weeks in barren environments showed behavioural indicators of fear in response to the novel object test performed in each isolated fish. Enriched environment increased the time investigating a novel object. The reduced time spent performing behaviours that indicate fear during the novel object test in fish kept in an enriched environment shows that the responses were a consequence of lack of stimuli, not necessarily social isolation. More complex environments improve the affective states and welfare of tilapia.& nbsp; (C)& nbsp;2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main aim of this research is to describe the current state of informal environmental education in several selected organizations and institutions in Poland. This work accommodates a tool for testing the quality of environmental education developed by the Swiss Foundation for Environmental Education and SILVIVA Foundation consisting of two checklists and a manual. The quality improvement criteria presented in the tool cover 150 indicators. This tool allows for a detailed self-assessment of the organization and the course of its environmental education. The checklists and instruction manual were sent to 67 people from various organizations. 18 people from 15 organizations and institutions dealing with informal environmental education took part in the survey (27% return rate). Research covered selected entities engaged in informal education: the State Forests, municipal forests, national parks, landscape park and Forest Research Institute. The selected centers from all over the country have various infrastructural background, and represent different organizational forms, sources of funding and educational programs. These centers offer a wide range of methods, not only traditional teaching methods like lectures, but also interactive ones. The respondents provided good and very good assessments in areas relating to 'choice and quality of content', 'implementation' and 'portfolio of offers', while the lowest assessments was granted to 'reflections and quality awareness', 'assessment of offers and services and further development' and 'evaluation of education'. A lack of useful feedback from the participants was reported.

AB  - Ongoing global changes can make unprecedented alterations in the state of some natural resources and their ecosystems services (ESs), especially in mountain agricultural landscapes. Considering the risk suggested by the Millennium Ecosystems Assessment, this study collected descriptive (qualitative) data in Nepalese mountain farming communities through field observation, group discussion, and personal interview, and investigated changing conditions of ESs of various natural resources in agricultural landscapes and their repercussions on mountain communities. The results showed that global changes induced new resources and institutions for mountain farming practices and altered important socioecological processes determining ESs. They have contributed to reductions in natural hazards and climate change and improvements in recreational and waste management services in mountain farming landscapes. Biodiversity status changes of the external factors in the agricultural landscapes are mixed: reasonably enriched plant species diversity and wildlife habitat, and seriously degraded or extinct indigenous species and genetic diversity. One of the serious negative changes is they have contributed to extinction of locally adaptable natural capitals and community heritages that had been developed through century-long socioecological processes and passed through extreme climatic variabilities and other environmental stresses at numerous times. The study determined that some recently emerging local biotic conditions result mainly from changes in the condition of water resources, not from changes in climatic conditions. The external factors also hampered human input into soil formation in degraded lands, soil quality, soil-water conservation and local knowledge systems. Overall, the effects of the changes found mixed on human and environment health. This multiple natural resources-based study has contested some arguments and conclusions of popular literatures.

AB  - The "Driving force - Pressure - State - Impact Response" modeling framework is adopted to consider. the formation mechanisms of environmental risks and the requirements of ecological environment protection. Moreover, a systematical index system and evaluation model for the measurement of the coastal ecological security level is put forward in this paper to assess the state of coastal ecological environment security. The results show that the security level of the Tianjin coastal ecological environment exhibits an overall downward trend, with the coastal ecological environment security value (E) falling from 0.7491 in 2005 (in good condition) to 0.2773 in 2010 (in a poor state), and the value will continue to decline into a bad state in the next decade. The increasing use of coastal areas, growing population and increasing emissions of pollutants into the sea are the primary phenomena leading to environmental degradation of coastal ecosystems, which further leads to the degeneration of the ecological and environmental conditions of the coastal zone in Tianjin. The inshore marine ecosystem is always in the sub-healthy and unhealthy state, which has affected the balance of the marine ecosystem and led to poor biomes structure. At present, the marine ecosystem conservation actions, including pollution control, monitoring and surveillance system and emergency management mechanism, are not enough to offset the impacts on the marine ecosystem caused by driving force and pressure changes. It is necessary to establish a coordinated integration management system for the land and sea and an ecological compensation mechanism.

AB  - The extraction of bitumen in areas of northeastern Alberta (Canada) has been associated with the release of complex mixtures of metals, metalloids, and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) to the environment. To mitigate effects on ecosystems, Canadian legislation mandates that disturbed areas be reclaimed to an ecologically sustainable state after active operations. However, as part of reclamation activities, exposure to, and effects on wildlife living in these areas is not generally assessed. To support successful reclamation, the development of efficient methods to assess exposure and health effects in potentially exposed wildlife is required. In the present study, we investigated the usefulness of two native mammalian species (deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus, and meadow vole Microtus pennsylvanicus) as sentinels of oil sands related contaminants by examining biomarkers of exposure and indicators of biological costs. Tissue residues of 31 metals and metalloids in kidneys and muscle, activity of the hepatic detoxification enzyme EROD (as a biomarker of exposure to organic contaminants), body condition, and the relative mass of liver, kidney, spleen, and testes were compared in animals from one reclaimed area and a reference site. Deer mice from the reclaimed site had higher renal levels of Co, Se and Tl compared to animals from the reference site, which was associated with reduced body condition. Lower testis mass was another feature that distinguished mice from the reclaimed site in comparison to those from the reference site. One mouse and one vole from the reclaimed site also showed increased hepatic EROD activity. In marked contrast, no changes were evident for these variables in meadow voles. Our results show that deer mouse is a sensitive sentinel species and that the biomarkers and indicators used here are efficient means to detect local contamination and associated biological effects in native mammals inhabiting reclaimed areas on active oil sands mine sites. These field-derived findings can be used by risk assessors to fill possible data gaps for mammalian wildlife in science-based environmental risk assessments for oil and gas projects.

AB  - Ecosystem regime shifts are regarded as abrupt global transitions from one stable state to an alternative stable state, induced by slow environmental changes or by global disturbances. Spatially extended ecosystems, however, can also respond to local disturbances by the formation of small domains of the alternative state. Such a response can lead to gradual regime shifts involving front propagation and the coalescence of alternative-state domains. When one of the states is spatially patterned, a multitude of intermediate stable states appears, giving rise to step-like gradual shifts with extended pauses at these states. Using a minimal model, we study gradual state transitions and show that they precede abrupt transitions. We propose indicators to probe gradual regime shifts, and suggest that a combination of abrupt-shift indicators and gradual-shift indicators might be needed to unambiguously identify regime shifts. Our results are particularly relevant to desertification in drylands where transitions to bare soil take place from spotted vegetation, and the degradation process appears to involve step-like events of local vegetation mortality caused by repeated droughts.

AB  - The management of contaminated sites requires the investigation of different involved aspects (from socioeconomic to risk and technological issues) and the presentation of useful and condensed information to decision makers. For this purpose, indices are more and more recognized as effective and valuable tools. This paper presents specific indices created within the DEcision Support sYstem for REhabilitation of contaminated sites (DESYRE).
   DESYRE is a software which aids decision making for the rehabilitation of a large contaminated site (i.e., megasite) by the creation and comparison of different rehabilitation alternatives. The software is composed of six modules, each dealing with a specific aspect of the remediation process, ending with the decision module. In this module, scenarios (i.e., suitable solutions for the rehabilitation of the contaminated site including selected land use, socioeconomic benefits, remediation costs, time span, environmental impacts, technology set/s, and residual risk) are created and evaluated by means of suitable indices. Nine indices cover the socioeconomic, risk, technological, cost, time, and environmental impact aspects. Mathematical algorithms are used to calculate these indices by taking into account data collected during the analytical steps of the DESYRE system and elaborated through the support of the spatial analysis, which is embedded in the system.
   The case study of Porto Marghera, Venice, Italy is presented in order to document the effectiveness of developed indices in evaluating management solutions and presenting options to decision makers. For the purpose of this study, three different scenarios for the remediation of a part of the site of Porto Marghera (approximately 530 ha) are developed and compared. The three scenarios consider the industrial land use and deal with the contamination in soil caused by inorganic and organic compounds. The scenarios mainly differ for the number of the included remediation technologies and for the spatial distribution of the technologies on the considered area.
   Indices results allow the user to more easily evaluate the advantages and limits of each scenario in order to select the most appropriate one. For instance, the risk indices allow the user to identify scenarios with good performance in reducing the extension of risk areas and the risk magnitude. Equally, the technological indices support the achievement of efficient remedial solutions characterized by a limited number of technologies, applied to extended areas and with high performance. The environmental impact index allows users to estimate the wider effects on the environment of the selected solutions, while the socioeconomic index is the result of social and economic investigations of the regional and local conditions, which ends with the identification of the best land use (e.g., the industrial one for the Porto Marghera area).
   The proposed nine DESYRE indices provide more complete information to investigate suitable management solutions. DESYRE indices facilitate the definition of a consensus among stakeholders and the achievement of a widely shared solution for contaminated site management, even at larger sites, such as Porto Marghera.
   Further improvements to the system may be adopted, e.g., the possibility to aggregate results of the different assessments into one synthetic index per scenario or the inclusion of a Group Decision Making procedure.

AB  - The consequences of unsustainable human activities on the environment are often delayed, when it is too late to compensate. New approaches are based on the use of "spatial statistics" of leading indicators to measure the "critical slowing down" in a degraded ecosystem, when it is reaching to a tipping point. This research predicts the tipping points in the ecosystem of Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) based on spatial statistics. By Remote Sensing (RS) indicators, their effectiveness in assessing the state of the ecosystem was evaluated in a 16-years period (2002-2017). Seven spectral indicators (NDVI, NDWIv,NDWIw,NDSI,SRDI, NMDI and MVWR) were extracted from ten MODIS images. Ability of the indicators to identify critical point in time-series was investigated by five spatial statistic methods (Moran's-I, Getis-Ord-Gi, Gearys-C, variance, and skewness). The results showed that Moran's-I is more successful in predicting the ecosystem tipping point(s) in comparison with other methods. In addition, the ability to predict ecosystem trends by the autocorrelation of MVWR is higher than other indicators. According to results, the tipping points of LUB occurred in the years of 2008 to 2010 and 2015. For further studies, it is recommended to use radar indicators for identifying tipping points of the similar vulnerable ecosystems.

AB  - Flow structures and thermal aspects of buoyancy-driven flow occurring in the presence of protruded heater inside a square enclosure are investigated under different thermal boundary conditions of the enclosure for two common fluids (of Prandtl numbers Pr = 0.71 and 6.9) at various Rayleigh numbers (Ra = 10(3)-10(6)) numerically. The study is conducted considering a single heater as well as a set of two identical heaters located symmetrically on the bottom wall of the enclosure. Results reveals that the heat transfer, energy flow and fluid flow are markedly dependent on the heater aspect ratio, Ra, Pr and thermal boundary condition. Although with the single heater symmetric trends of fluid and heat flow are observed, the strong asymmetric flow features are found in case of the double heaters for Pr = 6.9 at higher Ra. Some interesting energy and fluid flow patterns are evolved depending upon the values of heater aspect ratio, interspatial heater distance and enclosure's boundary condition. The visualization of mass and energy transports are properly appreciated using streamfunction and heatfunction. Total fluid flow inside the enclosure is analyzed by applying a novel approach based on streamfunctions of thermally induced vortices, which is also used to formulate a new streamfunction based symmetry indicator. It is seen that, with the increase in heater height although the total flow decreases, a consistent trend of increasing heat transfer is observed. The nature of steady-state solutions for the cavity is also analyzed by gradually increasing and decreasing Ra. Symmetry breaking bifurcation has been identified for Pr = 6.9. The bifurcation characteristics changes from supercritical to subcritical bifurcation depending upon thermal boundary conditions of the enclosure.

AB  - Anthropogenic alterations to global ecosystems necessitate management action to conserve or restore biodiversity and ecosystem services. A major advancement in ecosystem management was the development of multimetric indices of biotic integrity (MMIBI) used to guide development of, and measure progress towards, restoration. goals. Despite considerable refinement of MMIBI applications over the past three decades, a central challenge remains concerning the method of selecting ecological indicators for inclusion in MMIBI. We quantitatively compared MMIBI metric assembly processes across four sub-regions for fish assemblages in western Tennessee, USA to assess relative performance of three metric selection approaches. Metric selection methods we assessed included "filter gradient" using a multi-step approach to filter candidate metrics down to only the most reproducible and responsive, "indirect gradient" using a correlative unconstrained ordination approach, and "direct gradient" involving an automated constrained ordination approach. For each method, we calculated MMIBI using the selected metrics and compared their precision (i.e., stability across multiple samples), responsiveness (i.e., discrimination between most-and least-altered sites), and sensitivity (i.e., ability to detect landscape alterations). We found metric selection using the filter gradient approach produced MMIBI that were most responsive across all four sub-regions, while the indirect gradient approach produced the most sensitive and precise MMIBI for three of four sub-regions. The direct gradient metric selection approach produced the most sensitive MMIBI only for a single sub-region with a relatively short gradient in landscape alterations. These results reveal a tradeoff between filter and indirect gradient selection methods in which filter gradient metric selection provides high MMIBI responsiveness, but at the cost of increased number of steps and reduced precision and sensitivity. The "middle of the road", indirect gradient metric selection approach produced precise and sensitive MMIBI, but at the cost of reduced responsiveness. These findings highlight the necessity to pair well developed ecosystem management goals with MMIBI application, and provide a road map for the most appropriate assembly process for managers developing MMIBI. For example, identification of least-and most-altered sites might best be accomplished with MMIBI developed using the filter gradient approach, but assessing the factors contributing to alteration and precisely measuring progress towards restoration endpoints might best be accomplished with MMIBI developed using the indirect gradient approach. Restoration and management actions guided by MMIBI will become increasingly prevalent with increased future alteration to global ecosystems, and this work provides important insight into how technological and quantitative advances will improve application of ecological indicators.

AB  - Large- scale corporate projects, particularly those in extractive industries or hydropower development, have a history from early in the twentieth century of creating negative environmental, social, and health impacts on communities proximal to their operations. In many instances, especially for hydropower projects, the forced resettlement of entire communities was a feature in which local cultures and core human rights were severely impacted. These projects triggered an activist opposition that progressively expanded and became influential at both the host community level and with multilateral financial institutions. In parallel to, and spurred by, this activism, a shift occurred in 1969 with the passage of the National Environmental Policy Act in the United States, which required Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for certain types of industrial and infrastructure projects. Over the last four decades, there has been a global movement to develop a formal legal/regulatory EIA process for large industrial and infrastructure projects. In addition, social, health, and human rights impact assessments, with associated mitigation plans, were sequentially initiated and have increasingly influenced project design and relations among companies, host governments, and locally impacted communities. Often, beneficial community-level social, economic, and health programs have voluntarily been put in place by companies. These flagship programs can serve as benchmarks for community-corporate-government partnerships in the future. Here, we present examples of such positive phenomena and also focus attention on a myriad of challenges that still lie ahead.

AB  - The first National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA) was conducted in 2011 by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and its federal and state partners, using a survey design that allowed inference of results to national and regional scales. Vegetation, algae, soil, water chemistry, and hydrologic data were collected at each of 1138 locations across the conterminous United States (US). Ecological condition was assessed in relation to a disturbance gradient anchored by least disturbed (reference) and most disturbed sites identified using chemical, physical, and biological disturbance indices based on site-level data. A vegetation multimetric index (VMMI) was developed as an indicator of condition, and included four metrics: a floristic quality assessment index, relative importance of native plants, number of disturbance-tolerant plant species, and relative cover of native monocots. Potential stressors to wetland condition were identified and incorporated into two indicators of vegetation alteration, four indicators of hydrologic alteration, a soil heavy metal index, and a nonnative plant indicator and were used to quantify national and regional stressor extent, and the associated relative and attributable risk. Approximately 48 +/- 6% of the national wetland area was found to be in good condition and 32 +/- 6% in poor condition as defined by the VMMI. Across the conterminous US, approximately 20% of wetland area had high or very high stressor levels related to nonnative plants. Vegetation removal, hardening, and ditching stressors had the greatest extent of wetland area with high stressor levels, affecting 23-27% of the wetland area in the NWCA sampled population. The results from the 2016 NWCA will build on those from the 2011 assessment and initiate the ability to report on trends in addition to status. The data and tools produced by the NWCA can be used by others to further our knowledge of wetlands in the conterminous US.

AB  - Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important indicator reflecting the healthy state of aquatic ecosystems. The balance between oxygen supply and consuming in the water body is significantly influenced by physical and chemical parameters. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of multiple linear regression (MLR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector machine (SVM) for the prediction of DO concentration based on multiple water quality parameters. The data set included 969 samples collected from rivers in China and the 16 predicted variables involved physical factors, nutrients, organic substances, and metal ions, which would affect the DO concentrations directly or indirectly by influencing the water-air exchange, the growth of water plants, and the lives of aquatic animals. The models optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were calibrated and tested, with nearly 80% and 20% data, respectively. The results showed that the PSO-BPNN and PSO-SVM had better predicted performances than linear regression methods. All of the evaluated criteria, including coefficient of determination, mean squared error, and absolute relative errors suggested that the PSO-SVM model was superior to the MLR and PSO-BPNN for DO prediction in the rivers of China with limited knowledge of other information.

AB  - Reproduction, liveweight and wool production are reported for 4 cohorts of 377 Trangie Fertility x Dorset (TD) and 261 Booroola x Dorset (BD) ewes over 6 years. The ED ewes were 3-4 kg lighter (P<0.001) and had a higher ovulation rate prior to joining in February-March (2.37 +/- 0.03 v. 1.65 +/- 0.03) than TD ewes. This resulted in a higher litter size (2.07 +/- 0.03 v. 1.66 +/- 0.04) and number of lambs born per ewe joined (1.92 +/- 0.04 v. 1.56 +/- 0.04) for the BD ewes. Lamb survival was lower from BD than TD ewes (0.71 +/- 0.02 v. 0.85 +/- 0.02), so that the 2 ewe strains weaned the same number of lambs. The growth rate of lambs was lower from the BD ewes and overall they weaned 3.8 kg less (P<0.001) weight of lamb than TD ewes. Chill (index of environmental conditions at lambing), litter size and average birth weight of lambs in the litter (linear and quadratic) affected (P<0.001) lamb survival. At moderate levels of chill there was little difference in survival of single and twin lambs from BD and TD dams when birth weight was 4-5 kg, but survival declined more rapidly for progeny of BD ewes at lower birth weight. Under severe lambing conditions survival was depressed more for lambs born from BD ewes than TD ewes.
   Almost all ewes expressed oestrus over the 3, 6-week periods, December-January, January-February and March (joining). There was significant variation (P<0.001) in incidence of oestrus due to year and age (linear and non-linear), but not liveweight at joining, and there was little difference between ewe strains. Similarly, for post-lambing oestrus (to fit 8-monthly joining) and post-lambing anoestrous interval, there was little difference between strains, but year and age were highly significant (P<0.001). BD ewes had a lower (P<0.001) greasy fleece weight (3.76 v. 3.86 kg), than TD ewes.
   BD ewes were classified as either carriers (F+) or non-carriers (++) of the Fec(B) gene, which was significant (P<0.001) for ovulation rate (+1.14 ovulations), litter size (+0.8 lambs), lamb survival (-18%), lambs born per ewe joined (+0.64 lambs) and total weight of lamb born per ewe joined (0.5 kg, P<0.01). The effect of the Fec(B) gene was nonsignificant for lamb survival when litter size and lamb birth weight (P<0.001) were included in the model.
   Repeatability estimates based on over 3 records per ewe were about 0.2 for lambs born, weight of lamb born, lambs weaned and weight of lamb weaned per ewe joined. Component traits ranged from 0.27 for litter size to 0.10 for lamb survival, with fertility intermediate (0.15). Creasy fleece weight (0.72) and ovulation rate (0.41) had high repeatabilities with post-lambing anoestrous interval being low (0.11). Repeatability for ovulation rate was reduced to 0.34 when F+ ewes were excluded.

AB  - Reliable and inexpensive indicators of ecosystem function are essential for accurately monitoring and describing ecosystem integrity. Currently, most state and federal assessments of aquatic ecological integrity rely on structural indicators and assume tight coupling of structure and function. We used fluorescent composition of dissolved organic matter as a metric for certain ecosystem functions and compared the resulting index of autochthonous microbial dissolved organic matter (DOM) to macroinvertebrate indicators and classifications of water quality attainment reported by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (Maine DEP) at 142 stream sites. We observed that metrics of sensitive insect orders such as relative Plecoptera generic richness, relative Ephemeroptera abundance, and generic richness of EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) were negatively correlated with higher values of metrics based on autochthonous microbial DOM sources. At the same time we observed an increase in the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index with increasing microbial DOM. We compared the abundance of this microbial DOM component to Maine DEP measured attainment classes and found that microbial DOM generally separated sites with high biological integrity from sites where the biotic community was highly degraded. This highlights that measures of biogeochemical ecosystem function complement measures of structure in biological assessments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sampling protocols (different sampling gears used in different habitats) often vary among invertebrate studies. Several questions commonly arise: Which invertebrate attributes differ between pools and riffles? Are pool and riffle invertebrate assemblages differentially sensitive to the influences of human society? Can qualitative samples provide as much discriminating ability as quantitative samples? How can we best evaluate the status (biological condition) of the resident biota? We examined three sampling protocols: replicate Hess samples taken in pools, replicate Surber samples taken in riffles, and one qualitative sample from all habitats. Differences between Hess and Surber samples probably reflect differences in organisms found in pool and riffle habitats, whereas the qualitative protocol differed from the others in both habitats sampled and sampling effort. We determined differences among protocols for 18 attributes of invertebrate assemblages using data from yearly benthic samples (1986-1989) in three Tennessee River tributaries: Clinch, Powell, and Sequatchie rivers. Conditions differed among those rivers as reflected by fish assemblages (using the index of biotic integrity-IBI).
   We found distinct differences among the protocols and among many of the attributes selected for evaluation. Ten attributes either did not differ (stonefly and intolerant snail and mussel taxa richnesses, dominance, and proportions of omnivores, gatherers, grazers, and predators), or exhibited consistent differences (proportions of filterers, shredders, and chironomids), between riffles and pools. Of these ten attributes, six (stonefly taxa richness, dominance, and proportions of chironomids, filterers, omnivores, and predators) exhibited trends that coincided with our expectations based on fish assemblage condition. Eight attributes exhibited spatial and/or temporal trends that differed between riffles and pools (total, mayfly, caddisfly, and sediment-surface taxa richnesses, proportions of Corbicula, detritivores, and oligochaetes, and total abundance). When interyear differences among protocols were detected, trends among sites in pools, but not riffles, matched our expectations based on the biological condition of the fish assemblages (exception-the proportion of detritivores). Thus, monitoring programs may reach conclusions that are biased if biological condition is assessed with many commonly used attributes (e.g., total and mayfly taxa richnesses) and sampling is restricted to only one habitat. None of the taxa richness attributes (e.g., total and mayfly) distinguished differences among rivers in the multihabitat, qualitative protocol even though taxa counts were generally higher than in samples from either pools or riffles. Consequently, unreplicated, qualitative sampling may not have sufficient statistical power to detect subtle differences among streams. Replicated, quantitative sampling in both riffles and pools interpreted through a variety of biological attributes provides the strongest assessment of biological condition based on invertebrates.

AB  - A probabilistic-based groundwater model is developed to address the spatio-temporal distribution of the severity and duration of groundwater droughts for an aquifer having high groundwater fluctuations over space and time. Many studies were performed in the past to analyse the groundwater drought using various hydrological and meteorological indices. However, the study of joint probability distribution of groundwater drought risk and return period remains as a research gap in past literatures. Hence, in the current study this gap was fulfilled by developing a DSS module that calculates Groundwater Drought Risk (GDR) and Environmental Hazard Index (EHI) based on the probability distribution method. Thereafter, the return period of drought event both in terms of severity and duration was calculated by the Copula method. The model is developed for Sina basin, which is in the state of Maharashtra (India). The groundwater levels from 133 wells distributed spatially over the basin are selected to estimate the groundwater drought status for the period 1990-2009. Standardised Water Index is used for quantifying the groundwater droughts over the basin and found a continuous decline in the groundwater level over the time. Hence, a tool has been formulated for the assessment of risk imposed by the over mining of groundwater resources in the Sina basin. The decisive tool works on the principle of reliability analysis, which accounts for the calculation of GDR and EHI for Mild, Moderate, Severe and Extreme drought bands for each well. The risk obtained is assessed for its severity and duration based on a joint probability Copula module. The results showed that mild and moderate drought conditions prevails in the entire basin for the period 1990-2009. From the data set, a 25.2% increase in groundwater resistance is observed from mild to moderate drought band and a 25% increase is observed from severe to extreme drought band in the selected time period. The GDR for severe and extreme bands is affecting localised regions with high intensity. Based on the EHI values, the Beed region in the northeastern region of the Sina basin is very vulnerable to external stresses and requires immediate attention. The return period of severity and duration of different drought events are analysed by the Copula model and the results show that majority of the drought events in the mild and moderate bands are occurring below 2 years. These results examine the present groundwater drought situation in Sina basin and by properly managing the groundwater resource, the obtained risk can be minimised and many wells can be conserved by carefully addressing its EHI. This paper identifies and highlights hotspots in various time horizons and shows that if continuous abstraction persists, it likely accelerates the groundwater in absence of proper management plans. This model analysed the present groundwater drought scenario of the Sina basin and the results will be helpful for the policymakers for preparing better management strategies for the sustainable development of groundwater.

AB  - Systematic conservation planning, a widely used approach to identify priority lands and waters, uses efficient, defensible, and transparent methods aimed at conserving biodiversity and ecological systems. Limited financial resources and competing land uses can be major impediments to conservation; therefore, participation of diverse stakeholders in the planning process is advantageous to help address broad-scale threats and challenges of the 21st century. Although a broad extent is needed to identify core areas and corridors for fish and wildlife populations, a finescale resolution is needed to manage for multiple, interconnected ecosystems. Here, we developed a conservation plan using a systematic approach to promote landscape-level conservation within the extent of the South Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative. Our objective was to identify the highest-ranked 30% of lands and waters within the South Atlantic deemed necessary to conserve ecological and cultural integrity for the 10 primary ecosystems of the southeastern United States. These environments varied from terrestrial, freshwater aquatic, and marine. The planning process was driven by indicators of ecosystem integrity at a 4-ha resolution. We used the program Zonation and 28 indicators to optimize the identification of lands and waters to meet the stated objective. A novel part of our study was the prioritization of multiple ecosystems, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. The evaluation of indicator representation within prioritizations was a useful method to show where improvements could be made; some indicators dictated hotspots, some had a limited extent and were well represented, and others had a limited effect. Overall, we demonstrate that a broad-scale (408,276 km(2) of terrestrial and 411,239 km(2) of marine environments) conservation plan can be realized at a fine-scale resolution, which will allow implementation of the regional plan at a local level relevant to decision making.

AB  - Seabirds and other land-breeding marine predators are considered to be useful and practical indicators of the state of marine ecosystems because of their dependence on marine prey and the accessibility of their populations at breeding colonies. Historical counts of breeding populations of these higher-order marine predators are one of few data sources available for inferring past change in marine ecosystems. However, historical abundance estimates derived from these population counts may be subject to unrecognised bias and uncertainty because of variable attendance of birds at breeding colonies and variable timing of past population surveys. We retrospectively accounted for detection bias in historical abundance estimates of the colonial, land-breeding Adelie penguin through an analysis of 222 historical abundance estimates from 81 breeding sites in east Antarctica. The published abundance estimates were de-constructed to retrieve the raw count data and then re-constructed by applying contemporary adjustment factors obtained from remotely operating time-lapse cameras. The re-construction process incorporated spatial and temporal variation in phenology and attendance by using data from cameras deployed at multiple sites over multiple years and propagating this uncertainty through to the final revised abundance estimates. Our re-constructed abundance estimates were consistently higher and more uncertain than published estimates. The re-constructed estimates alter the conclusions reached for some sites in east Antarctica in recent assessments of long-term Adelie penguin population change. Our approach is applicable to abundance data for a wide range of colonial, land-breeding marine species including other penguin species, flying seabirds and marine mammals.

AB  - The article is devoted to the problems of study of medical and ecological risks of the territory taking into account the state of the environment.
   At present, the study of health and environmental risks in Ukraine and its regions is relevant today, given the current demographic situation and the dynamics of morbidity among the population. In connection with this, geographic studies of the medical and enviromnental risks of the territory acquire special significance.
   The research uses general scientific methods, among them traditional (synthesis, analysis, comparisons, methods of induction, deduction, observation, abstraction, generalization) and modern (system analysis and synthesis). The most commonly used and universal is the systematic method, since medical and geographical research is inherently complex.
   In determining the medical-ecological risk of the territory among a complex of natural indicators and anthropogenic factors of environmental impact, we included a specific violation of the quality of the environment in the north of the Rivne Oblast after the Chernobyl disaster.
   The results of the study suggest a high correlation between soil contamination by radionuclides of territories (especially the northern ones) in the Eastern part of the Southwest region of Ukraine and the incidence of endocrine diseases in the regions concerned.
   The theoretical value of the obtained results is to deepen theoretical knowledge about the existing interconnections in the system "environment - health of the population".
   The practical value of the results of the study is to apply the method of express assessment of the medical and geographical condition of the territory for the development of plans for the development of the region in accordance with the minimization of health and environmental risks for the population.

TI  - Condition of the Mid-Atlantic Estuaries: Production of a state of the environment report
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
LA  - English
CP  - 1st Symposium on the Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment Program (MAIA)
AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has released a report entitled Condition of the Mid-Atlantic Estuaries. That report summarizes the findings of several studies conducted by federal and state agencies and academic institutions in Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Estuary, and the coastal bays of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, and simultaneously addresses two distinct audiences: environmental managers and the general public. This paper documents the process of preparing the Estuaries Report, emphasizing the lessons learned in merging information from a wide-variety of sources and in reporting the results to multiple audiences. The major difficulties in preparing the report included: 1) choosing a format and topics that adequately addressed both environmental managers and the public, 2) resolving spatial and temporal disparities in the assembled data sets, and 3) establishing threshold values that distinguished between acceptable and unacceptable conditions in indicators. Our solutions to these challenges and alternatives are discussed. We conclude that a small team of knowledgeable scientists can effectively merge the information of diverse sources into a document that is useful to both environmental managers and the interested public. However, considerable interaction between the team and other scientists was necessary to resolve ambiguities and assure relevancy and accuracy. These findings support the proposition that the vast sources of existing environmental information can be easily and effectively used to assess the ecological condition across large regions.

AB  - Soil nematode abundance, community composition and biomass were determined in the Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station, North China, in order to evaluate the effects of tillage system (conventional tillage and no-tillage) and residue management (0, 50% and 100% wheat residue incorporation/coverage) on the nematode communities. Two kinds of indicators (descriptive and evaluative) were categorized. Of the descriptive indicators, residue management had a significant effect on the total nematode abundance, biomass and trophic groups except for bacterivores. Of the evaluative indicators, Shannon diversity (H'), generic richness (GR), nematode channel ratio (NCR) and enrichment index (El) significantly increased with increasing residue quantity, whereas dominance (lambda), basal index (BI) and channel index (CI) exhibited an opposite trend. Significant tillage effects were observed on the trophic diversity (TD), EI, CI and carbon production (P). The responses of nematodes to tillage and residue were genus-dependent. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that tillage explained 4.9% and 15.4%, and residue management explained 5.2% and 13.1% of the variations in soil nematode abundance and biomass, respectively. Different metabolic footprint characteristics of the food web were demonstrated graphically by enrichment and structure footprints. The evaluative indicators, such as EI and CI, were sensitive to both tillage and residue management. The descriptive indicators could be used to obtain an intuitive answer to the effect of residue management and the evaluative indicators were more comprehensive for interpreting the structure and function of the soil food web under different tillage and residue management regimes.

AB  - The Humid Pampa, center-east of Argentina, is the most important socio-economical area of the country. Several shallow lakes have been the focus of many studies due to the significant changes in their trophic status related to human activities and to global warming recorded since the beginning of the twentieth century. Although chironomids have been used extensively in paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental research, they are rarely used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions of the Pampean shallow lakes. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the knowledge of the chironmids' community composition and distribution in the Pampa region, and to relate their distribution to selected climatic and limnological variables. The ultimate goal is to retrieve new ecological information for future paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate reconstructions by using chironomid-based inference models. In this study, chironomids head capsules were collected from surface sediments from 17 shallow lakes of the Humid Pampa. Our analyses indicate that the chironomid assemblages reflect the decreasing NE-SW rainfall gradient of the region as well as the land use intensity, which in turn affects the aquatic ecosystems, in terms of lake productivity. Some chironomids are associated with brackish conditions (e.g., Chironomus, Ablabesmyia, Tanytarsini D2). Additionally the occurrence of assemblages of detritivore taxa such as Goeldochironomus, Chironomus, Polypedilum, and Dicrotendipes reflect the natural eutrophic state of Pampean shallow lakes, whereas assemblages mostly dominated by Coelotanypus, Procladius, and Chironomus are indicative of hypertrophic conditions, which are usually the result of human activity. This is the first study of chironomids from surface sediments from the central temperate plains of Argentina, and our records extend the ecological information of the Diptera in temperate areas. Although more studies are necessary to fully understand the main factors determining the chironomid fauna distribution in the Pampa region, we conclude that chironomids are potentially good proxies for paleoproductivity and salinity reconstructions of Pampean shallow lakes.

AB  - Drought is a common characteristic of the African Sahel whose agricultural productivity has been notoriously varying and declining as a result of this natural hazard. In this study, reasonably adequate climatic and food crop data for Sudan have been used to illustrate a straightforward method for assessing the recent past and within-season drought risk to sorghum and millet yields in Eastern Sahel. A drought risk index (DRI), which incorporates the drought occurrence frequency, duration, severity and areal extent in addition to the coping capacity and the production level, has been able to capture the large-scale droughts that induced crop failure and famines in the region during the recent history. Over 1970-2006, the drought risk was manifest in 15-21 years for sorghum and in 12-20 years for millet. In these particular years, the index is capable of explaining similar to 52-69% and similar to 32-66% of the variations in the regional states' yields of the two major food crops, respectively. There is a co-existence between the drought risk years and the warm events of El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The results indicate clearly that drought conditions are capable of putting the crop yield at risk of suppression. On the state scale, the highest drought risk predominates in Northern Darfur on the average. Maximum DRI values of 47% for sorghum and 48% for millet occurred during the peak drought decade of the 1980s in the western part of the Eastern Sahel region. It is not hard to trace the low drought risk values for Gezira within the arid region to a large extent back to practised adaptation measure in the form of irrigation. On the regional scale, the maximum DRI was recorded in 1984 as 21% and 26% respectively for sorghum and millet. Generally, lower relation between millet yield and DRI, though significant, dominates in the western part of Sahelian Sudan, likely due to the inherent adaptation of the crop to such adverse growing conditions. In view of the regional agricultural expansion, even the average irrigation coping capacity of sorghum farming dropped from 8.0% in the early 1970s to around 6.0% in the first half of the 2000s. The model is also shown to enable short-term prediction by informing knowledge of pre-harvest quantities of crop yield from easily accessible data. The outcome of this study thus assists in providing a basis for drought mitigation and planning of benefit to authorities in agriculture. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The observation of the signs of nature throughout human existence has benefited the construction of empirical knowledge about the climate. The aim of this study is to describe social aspects, to characterize the local knowledge related on meteorological forecast indicators from the knowledge of small farmers living in the surroundings of the Duas Bocas Biological Reserve, Cariacica county, state of Espirito Santo (ES), southeastern Brazil, located in the Two Bocas River Hydrographic Basin. Fifty semi structured ethnographic interviews were carried out, besides the application of the participant and direct observations; and used a field diary. Local farmers are mostly males (n = 41), have been farming in the region for at least 40 years, and have a low level of education with incomplete primary education. The main cultivation in the region are banana, coffee and manioc. Summer is the season with the highest agricultural production due to high temperatures and high rainfall. Most local farmers (n = 41; 82%) trust on the ethnoclimatological prediction derived from traditional knowledge. Atmospheric dynamics, fauna behavior and celestial bodies were the main indicators of rain. Ethnoclimatological knowledge is important in the maintenance of the agricultural practice in the studied region, since the success of the harvest depends on this local knowledge.

AB  - The problem of excessive use of fossil fuels is a serious problem in many countries. The desire to obtain relatively cheap energy by burning mainly coal often wins over the need to maintain a good state of the environment. In recent years, Poland has been catching up with economic development in relation to the countries that were members of the EU before 2004. Despite the good economic indicators that Poland has achieved in recent years, much remains to be done to ensure sustainable low-carbon development. Expenditures on the development of innovative technologies that would contribute to reducing excessive emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere are not sufficient. The article presents the determinants of innovative activity in Poland and indicates the main problems associated with the implementation of sustainable low-carbon development. The article also presents the perspectives of low-carbon development in Poland in relation to the innovation potential, with particular emphasis on renewable energy sources, and indicates the main factors that may contribute to a faster departure from inefficient technologies of energy production based on fossil fuels. The purpose of the article is to analyse the conditions associated with low-carbon development in Poland, with particular emphasis on the energy sector. The article refers to the most important issues related to the development of renewable energy sources and indicates low-carbon development perspectives in Poland.

AB  - The growing need to analyse the present state of ecosystems and predict their rate of change has triggered a demand to explore species environment relationships for assessing alterations under anthropogenic influence. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the definition of different types of water bodies which are of relevance when assessing their ecological status. The main aim of this study was to define of the types of Portuguese reservoirs located in the North and Centre of Portugal and to assess their ecological status using phytoplankton as water quality indicators. In this study, sampling was carried out in 34 reservoirs during four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter), through a period of 8 years (1996-2004).
   Two groups of reservoirs could be distinguished, from the multivariate statistical analysis based on environmental variables and on phytoplankton assemblages: G1, lowland reservoirs located in the main rivers (Douro and Tagus), with a very low residence time, characterized by higher water mineral content (hardness and conductivity), higher concentrations of nutrients (namely, nitrates), dominated by Bacillariophyta and Chlorophyta and characterized by the presence of tolerant of poor environmental conditions species, mainly associated with meso and eutrophic states of water bodies; G2, deeper high altitude reservoirs, largely located in tributaries, with high residence time, presenting a specific species composition under reference conditions, with higher species richness. The transition from deeper and colder reservoirs (reference sites) to shallow and warmer reservoirs (impaired sites), was evident in G2, contrarily to G1, and was mostly positively correlated to organic pollution and mineral gradients. The results presented here are fundamental for the development of a routine for monitoring ecological status according to the WFD. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The exotic grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) has been Used for almost a half a century in he United States as a biological agent to control and manage aquatic plants. This long-lived generalist herbivore consumes large amounts of vegetation and call considerably alter habitat and impact aquatic communities. We conducted a literature review to determine whether previous studies adequately addressed ecological impacts of grass carp and their underlying mechanisms. Our goal was to identify strengths and limitations of: ecological assessment in the literature and suggest a trajectory of future research. The review yielded 1,924 citations Oil grass carp; however, data on ecological interactions were limited, and most research emphasized the biology Of grass carp or eradication of aquatic plants rather than ecological mechanisms responsible for ecosystem-wide impacts. Very few studies addressed effects on habitat complexity or community-structuring Processes. We provide a comprehensive tabulated overview of feeding preferences and environmental impacts of grass carp. We argue that ecology is paramount to evaluating grass carp impacts and thorough understanding of these impacts is essential for the appropriate management of aquatic communities. Current knowledge is not sufficient to accurately predict long-term effects Of grass carp oil freshwater ecosystems. We advise a more cautious approach to developing guidelines tor grass carp use.

AB  - Diatom assemblages attached to the leaves of the submerged macrophyte Vallisneria aethiopica in the shallow waters of the Sanyati Basin in Lake Kariba were analysed to assess their response to human impact. Human activities occurring within approximately 500 m of the shoreline were assessed at ten sampling sites along the shores of the basin. Eleven human activity factors were assessed and scored on a scale of 0 (not occurring at the site), 1 (low), 2 (medium) and 3 (high). Based on these 11 factors, we obtained a total score for the sites, which were then categorized as either having no human disturbance (0), low human disturbance (1-11), medium human disturbance (12-22) or high levels of human disturbance (23-33). Three sites were categorized as having no human disturbance, one had low disturbance and six had medium level human disturbance. A total of 9993 diatoms belonging to 40 genera were identified. The most abundant genera were Achnanthidium and Gomphonema, which made up 23.4 and 42.9% of the total diatom count, respectively. Achnanthidium dominated in remote areas with minimal human activities, while Gomphonema was more abundant in areas adjacent to increased human activities. The relative abundances of Achnanthidium, Denticula, Pinnularia, Rhopalodia and Stauroneis were negatively and significantly correlated, while that of Gomphonema was positively and significantly correlated to the human disturbance score (Spearman correlation, P < 0.05). Although the number of genera, the Shannon Diversity Index and evenness did not differ significantly among sites (ANOVA, P > 0.05), the lowest levels of these descriptors of community assemblage occurred at sites located near areas with relatively high human activities. The abundances of Achnanthes, Cymbella, Denticula, Encyonema and Pinnularia, Bacillaria and Mastogloia, Diatoma and Navicula and Eunotia and Mastogloia significantly decreased with increasing levels of total phosphorous, nitrate-nitrogen (N), ammonium-N and water turbidity, respectively (Spearman correlation, P < 0.05). Of the16 diatom index of biotic integrity (DIBI) metrics, 11 were significantly correlated with at least one of the environmental variables, while nine metrics were significantly correlated with the composite DIBI. Among the environmental variables the disturbance score was the only one that was significantly correlated with the DIBI. We conclude that although there is need for further work, periphytic diatoms associated with V. aethiopica may potentially be useful in assessing ecological conditions or the impact of human activities within the shallow marginal waters of Lake Kariba.

AB  - Sustainability has become an increasingly significant issue, although practical implementation remains difficult. In Italy, promoting sustainability is particularly problematic at the provincial and municipal level, where the lack of resources and expertise, and the effects of uncoordinated policies make it difficult to achieve minimum requirements to make sustainable policies operational. One essential requirement is knowledge of baseline environmental conditions in each municipality. In the province of Reggio Emilia (Northern Italy) Legambiente, an environmental association, launched an initiative called 'Ecopaese' aimed at gathering data on environmental conditions and stimulating local administrations to implement sustainable policies. To this end, the state of the environment in the 45 municipalities within the province has been monitored using 25 indicators. Their values have been used to rank the municipalities by multiple criteria analysis (MCA). The results of this comparative approach provide information about the level of sustainability attained in the province as a whole as well as in the single municipalities. It is hoped that it will provide the basis for direct action plans at the provincial level by identifying areas for remedial action, as recommended by Agenda 21, the declaration adopted by many countries attending the Rio Summit in 1992.

AB  - Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and alternative systems, often called post-lithium-ion batteries (PLIBs), appear poised to revolutionize the world's energy infrastructure. Within this paper, we examine LIB and PLIB cathode active materials (CAMs) on metrics of supply risk and environmental impact. We collect data related to each metric through sources including the USGS, European Commission, and LCA databases, transforming them into "risk indicators" with a uniform scale. We then compile these indicators to allow for analysis of each for both technologies and component metals. We examine historic trends and current data, additionally utilizing simulations in order to predict possible future development. We also utilize the CellEst cost model in order to provide analysis of cost and performance alongside supply risk and environmental impact, allowing for a comprehensive view of examined technologies. Several key findings include: cobalt and lithium not only have high supply risk, their supply risk is increasing; nickel, while having a lower supply risk than cobalt, has a higher environmental impact; and PLIB technologies generally have lower supply risk and, at least before cell processing, environmental impact than LIB technologies.

AB  - Simple Summary With the advantages of easy culture, body transparency, and high sensitivity to chemical pollution, water fleas have been recognized as a good model for ecotoxicity studies. In this paper, we established ImageJ-based methods to measure cardiovascular performance by evaluating the heart rate and blood flow velocity in three water fleas for the first time. Among the three water fleas,Daphnia magnawas identified as having the most robust heartbeat and blood flow rate and is therefore suitable for ecotoxicity assessment. Many important parameters like heart rate, blood flow rate, stroke volume, ejection fraction, fractional shortening, cardiac output heartbeat regularity can be extracted from videotaping and mathematical calculation. In utilizing those physiological parameters, the potential impacts of ambient water temperature and pesticide pollution on water fleas can be precisely measured. Water fleas are a good model for ecotoxicity studies, and were proposed for this purpose by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, due to their easy culture, body transparency, and high sensitivity to chemical pollution. Cardiovascular function parameters are usually used as an indicator of toxicity evaluation. However, due to the nature of the heart and blood flow, and the speed of the heartbeat, it is difficult to perform precise heartbeat and blood flow measurements with a low level of bias. In addition, the other cardiovascular parameters, including stroke volume, cardiac output, fractional shortening, and ejection fraction, have seldom been carefully addressed in previous studies. In this paper, high-speed videography and ImageJ-based methods were adopted to analyze cardiovascular function in water fleas. The heartbeat and blood flow for three water flea species,Daphnia magna,Daphnia silimis, andMoinasp., were captured by high-speed videography and analyzed using open-source ImageJ software. We found the heartbeat is species-dependent but not size-dependent in water fleas. Among the three water fleas tested,D. magnawas identified as having the most robust heartbeat and blood flow rate, and is therefore suitable for the ecotoxicity test. Moreover, by calculating the diameter of the heart, we succeeded in measuring other cardiovascular parameters.D. magnawere challenged with temperature changes and a pesticide (imidacloprid) to analyze variations in its cardiovascular function. We found that the heartbeat ofD. magnawas temperature-dependent, since the heartbeat was increasing with temperature. A similar result was shown in the cardiac output parameter. We also observed that the heartbeat, cardiac output, and heartbeat regularity are significantly reduced when exposed to imidacloprid at a low dose of 1 ppb (parts per billion). The blood flow rate, stroke volume, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening, on the contrary, did not display significant changes. In conclusion, in this study, we report a simple, highly accurate, and cost-effective method to perform physiological and toxicological assessments in water fleas.

AB  - The incorporation of a comprehensive crop module in land surface models offers the possibility to study the effect of agricultural land use and land management changes on the terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. It may help to improve the simulation of biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes on regional and global scales in the framework of climate and land use change. In this study, the performance of the crop module of the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) was evaluated at point scale with site-specific field data focusing on the simulation of seasonal and inter-annual variations in crop growth, planting and harvesting cycles, and crop yields, as well as water, energy, and carbon fluxes. In order to better represent agricultural sites, the model was modified by (1) implementing the winter wheat subroutines following Lu et al. (2017) in CLM5; (2) implementing plant-specific parameters for sugar beet, potatoes, and winter wheat, thereby adding the two crop functional types (CFTs) for sugar beet and potatoes to the list of actively managed crops in CLM5; and (3) introducing a cover-cropping subroutine that allows multiple crop types on the same column within 1 year. The latter modification allows the simulation of cropping during winter months before usual cash crop planting begins in spring, which is an agricultural management technique with a long history that is regaining popularity as it reduces erosion and improves soil health and carbon storage and is commonly used in the regions evaluated in this study. We compared simulation re- sults with field data and found that both the new crop-specific parameterization and the winter wheat subroutines led to a significant simulation improvement in terms of energy fluxes (root-mean-square error, RMSE, reduction for latent and sensible heat by up to 57 % and 59 %, respectively), leaf area index (LAI), net ecosystem exchange, and crop yield (up to 87 % improvement in winter wheat yield prediction) compared with default model results. The cover-cropping subroutine yielded a substantial improvement in representation of field conditions after harvest of the main cash crop (winter season) in terms of LAI magnitudes, seasonal cycle of LAI, and latent heat flux (reduction of wintertime RMSE for latent heat flux by 42 %). Our modifications significantly improved model simulations and should therefore be applied in future studies with CLM5 to improve regional yield predictions and to better understand large-scale impacts of agricultural management on carbon, water, and energy fluxes.

AB  - Though the environmental conditions of the Weddell Sea region and Dronning Maud Land are still relatively stable compared to the fast-changing Antarctic Peninsula, we may suspect pronounced effects of global climate change for the near future (Thompson et al., 2011). Reducing the uncertainties in climate change modeling requires a better understanding of the aerosol optical properties, and for this we need accurate data on the aerosol refractive index (RI). Due to the remoteness of Antarctica only very few RI data are available from this region (Hogan et al., 1979; Virkkula et al., 2006; Shepherd et al., 2018). We calculate the real refractive index of natural atmospheric aerosols from number size distribution measurements at the German coastal Antarctic station Neumayer III. Given the high average scattering albedo of 0.992 (Weller et al., 2013), we assumed that the imaginary part of the RI is zero. Our method uses the overlapping size range (particle diameter D between 120 and 340 nm) of a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), which sizes the particles by their electrical mobility, and a laser aerosol spectrometer (LAS), which sizes the particles by their optical scattering signal at the 633 nm wavelength.
   Based on almost a complete year of measurement, the average effective refractive index (RIeff, as we call our retrieved RI because of the used assumptions) for the dry aerosol particles turned out to be 1.44 with a standard deviation of 0.08, in a good agreement with the RI value of 1.47, which we derived from the chemical composition of bulk aerosol sampling measurements. At Neumayer the aerosol shows a pronounced seasonal pattern in both number concentration and chemical composition. Despite this, the variability of the monthly averaged RIeff values remained between 1.40 and 1.50. Compared to the annual mean, two austral winter months (July and September) showed slightly but significantly increased values (1.50 and 1.47, respectively). The size dependency of the RIeff could be determined from time-averaged LAS and SMPS number size distributions measured between December 2017 and January 2018. Here we calculated RIeff for four different particle size ranges and observed a slight decrease from 1.47 (D range 116-168 nm) to 1.37 (D range 346-478 nm).
   We find no significant dependence of the derived RIeff values on the wind direction. Thus we conclude that RIeff is largely independent of the general weather situation, roughly classified as (i) advection of marine boundary layer air masses during easterly winds caused by passing cyclones in contrast to (ii) air mass transport from continental Antarctica under southern katabatic winds. Neumayer, the only relevant contamination source, is located 1.5 km north of the air chemistry observatory, where the measurements were performed. Given that northerly winds are almost absent, the potential impact of local contamination is minimized in general. Indeed our data show no impact of local contamination on RIeff. Just in one case a temporary high-contamination episode with diesel engines operating right next to the measurement site resulted in an unusual high RIeff of 1.59, probably caused by the high black carbon content of the exhaust fumes.
   To conclude, our study revealed largely constant RIeff values throughout the year without any sign of seasonality. Therefore, it seems reasonable to use a single, constant RIeff value of 1.44 for modeling optical properties of natural, coastal Antarctic sub-micrometer aerosol.

AB  - Modern multifunctional forest management needs indicators showing the state of forest environment. Commonly used solution is monitoring of the abundance of species with specific environmental requirements. This paper analyses the possibility of use of the biggest European woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) as forest management quality indicator. The black woodpecker resides in all types of forest sites. The species prefers big thick trees as a nest trees, its cavities were mainly made in birches Betula sp. in Western and Southern Europe, Scots pines Pinus sylvestris in Middle and Eastern Europe and aspens Populus tremula in Northern Europe. The black woodpecker, excavating large-sized breeding cavities, is defined as a key species due to the creation of breeding sites for large secondary cavity-nesters. Because of the breeding requirements, black woodpecker can also be treated as an umbrella species for organisms associated with old trees. The way of feeding of that species shows a strong connection with the availability of dead wood. The black woodpecker is a sedentary species, which means that it is highly depended on the structure of the forest and quickly responds to changes caused by forest management. Because of the habitat requirements and relationships with other species, as well as the wide geographical range, it is a good indicator species for multifunctional suitable forest management. It can also act as a keystone species for secondary cavity nesters and umbrella species for organisms associated with old, dying trees.

AB  - Soil biological, chemical, and physical properties can be important for monitoring soil quality under one of the most spectacular vegetation formation on Atlantic Forest Biome, the Araucaria Forest. Our aim was to identify a set of soil variables capable of discriminating between disturbed, reforested, and native Araucaria forest soils such that these variables could be used to monitor forest recovery and maintenance. Soil samples were collected at dry and rainy season under the three forest types in two state parks at Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Soil biological, chemical, and physical properties were evaluated to verify their potential to differentiate the forest types, and discriminant analysis was performed to identify the variables that most contribute to the differentiation. Most of physical and chemical variables were sensitive to forest disturbance level, but few biological variables were significantly different when comparing native, reforested, and disturbed forests. Despite more than 20 years following reforestation, the reforested soils were chemically and biologically distinct from native and disturbed forest soils, mainly because of the greater acidity and Al3+ content of reforested soil. Disturbed soils, in contrast, were coarser in texture and contained greater concentrations of extractable P. Although biological properties are generally highly sensitive to disturbance and amelioration efforts, the most important soil variables to discriminate forest types in both seasons included Al3+, Mg2+, P, and sand, and only one microbial attribute: the NO2- oxidizers. Therefore, these five variables were the best candidates, of the variables we employed, for monitoring Araucaria forest disturbance and recovery.

AB  - The Openness-Fluid-Crystallized-Intelligence (OFCI) model describes how these different constructs interact over time. One fundamental element in the model is the Environmental Enrichment Hypothesis, which states that more Openness leads to more learning opportunities, thereby fostering fluid intelligence (Gf). Indirectly, this positive influence also has a positive effect on crystallized intelligence (Gc). Despite empirical evidence supporting the model as a whole, little is known with regard to the actual mechanisms underlying environmental enrichment. PIAAC (Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies) data (N = 5465) were used to explore possible behavioral differences that lead to enriched environments for more open people. To this end, we utilized different indicators of reading and calculating behavior. The indicator of Openness used was indeed found to be associated with differences in reading and calculating activities at work and during leisure time. These relations were also shown to be related to the indicator of Gf and indirectly to the indicator of Gc. Theoretical implications and limitations of the study are discussed.

AB  - This paper empirically examines whether environmental values are correlated with economic preferences from behavioral economics and considers possible consequences when independence is assumed. The data for this analysis stem from a large-scale computer-based survey among more than 3700 German citizens. Our indicators for environmental values are based on the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), which is a standard instrument in social and behavioral sciences and increasingly common in economic studies. The econometric analysis with Generalized Poisson regression models reveals strong correlations between two NEP scales and several economic preferences, which are based on established experimental measures. While our variables for altruism (measured in an incentivized dictator game) and positive reciprocity are significantly positively correlated, the indicators for trust and (less robust) negative reciprocity are significantly negatively correlated with the NEP scales, respectively. Only the variables for risk and time preferences (also measured in an incentivized experiment) are not robustly significantly correlated with the NEP scales. These estimation results recommend the additional inclusion of economic preferences in econometric analyses that use a NEP scale as explanatory factor of main interest for environmentally relevant behavior. Based on two empirical examples on stated and revealed environmental donations, it is shown that not considering social preferences, i.e. altruism, trust, and positive and negative reciprocity can lead to strong distortions due to omitted variable biases. The biased estimation of the effect of a NEP scale in this case is additionally illustrated in systematic Monte Carlo experiments with data generation processes from the empirical example with realized environmental donation activities.

AB  - Open woodlands dominated by shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) and oak are historically an important component of the landscape across the southeastern United States. These ecosystems support numerous wildlife species, many of which have declined in recent years as the amount and condition of their habitat have declined. Land managers and private landowners need guidance on how to efficiently and accurately quantify the condition and wildlife habitat value of the pine stands that they manage. Here we provide a set of rapid assessment metrics, based on NatureServe's ecological integrity assessment (EIA) method, to (a) identify exemplary tracts that provide the best habitat for key wildlife species, and (b) monitor restoration efforts to assess progress toward the improved quality of existing tracts. To ensure an ecologically appropriate scaling of metrics, we distinguished six types of shortleaf pine-oak woodland: A.-Interior Highlands shortleaf pine-oak (including A.1-shortleaf pine-oak forest and woodlands; A.2-shortleaf pine-bluestem woodlands); B-montane longleaf pine-shortleaf pine woodlands; C-southern Appalachian pine-oak woodlands; D-West Gulf coastal plain shortleaf pine-oak woodlands; and E-southeast coastal plain and Piedmont shortleaf pine-oak woodlands. We relied on a narrative conceptual model and peer review-based indicator selection to identify a core set of 15 stand-level metrics (two were optional). Individual assessment points (thresholds) and ratings (Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor) were developed that were sensitive to the distinct attributes of each of the five shortleaf pine-oak and Appalachian pine-oak types. Values for the metrics can all be collected using rapid field methods, such as using basal area prisms and ocular (visual) estimates of cover. Protocols for the consistent application of these EIA methods are provided. A case study is presented from the Cherokee National Forest in Tennessee. These methods provide improved and rapid EIA metrics for all shortleaf pine-oak ecosystems in the southeastern US to help guide conservation-minded landowners in assessing the biodiversity and priority wildlife values of shortleaf pine-oak and southern Appalachian pine-oak ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding the effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and stability is challenging, espe-cially in high latitude regions that are predicted to experience the largest increases in ambient temperature. Global warming is likely to be a key driver of ecosystem change in freshwater lakes. Increased temperature can positively or negatively affect lake community composition through the loss of cold adapted taxa and the arrival of temperate or eurytopic taxa. Here, we analyse the likely effects of temperature-induced changes in taxonomic richness and compositional turnover of environmentally sensitive chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae) across three regions northern North America, Norway, and Russia using existing datasets. Structural parameters (beta diversity, compositional disorder, and network skewness) were applied to model-simulated and empirical chironomid datasets across a large spatial temperature gradient. The analyses of empirical datasets showed changes in community structure across temperature gradients, suggesting varying states of ecosystem stability or instability. The comparison with null models enabled assessment as to whether these stresses agreed with expected patterns due to covarying summer temperature conditions or whether they deviated from expectations suggesting additional stress on the ecosystems. For all three regions, lakes in the mid-temperature range showed most evidence of relative ecosystem stability, with greater beta diversity, compositional disorder, and skewness, unanticipated by the modelled simulations. This is most likely due to more diverse habitats across the ecotone boundaries and additional factors that can influence ecosystem structures. Thus, we show that structural changes typical for ecosystem stability can be detected through changes in community structure across temperature gradients. This is important for understanding how lakes may change under current and future climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to improve people's awareness for the value of forest ecosystem services of protecting the ecosystem, and provide the basis for forestry management. The study has evaluated regulation service value of forest ecosystem services by using approaches such as shadow engineering method and benefit transfer method, etc. in Zhalantun city of eastern monsoon climate zone, Great Khingan Range. It could provide abundant timber and forest by-products for human beings etc., and also effectively play ecosystem services, and maintain environmental conditions for the survival of humans and support the global ecological balancelike water and soil conservation, and maintain the biodiversity. The results showed that the total value of forest ecosystem services was 342.641 billion RMB in Zhalantun city, according to the researching results. The order of ecological benefits value was: carbon fixation and oxygen release (2572.15x10(8) Yuan)>soil conservation (605.39x10(8) Yuan)>water conservation (150.85x10(8)Yuan) > forest agricultural protection (98.02x10(8) Yuan). The highest value of ecosystem services were carbon fixation and oxygen release, soil conservation, accounting for 75.07%, 17.67% of the total value, respectively, and their total value of ecosystem services accounting for 92.74% for the total value. The value of solid carbon and release oxygen per unit area was 317300 Yuan per hectare annual. The elm of carbon fixation and oxygen release value in the unit area, which was biggest, was 4.1181 million Yuan per hectare annual, and the second aspen was 944800 Yuan per hectare annual. The dahurian larch was smaller, which was 223400 Yuan per hectare annual. The soil conservation value per unit area was 45900 Yuan per hectare annual, with betula davurica highest soil conservation value per unit area (64400 Yuan per hectare annual), followed by oak (60500 Yuan per hectare annual), aspen was minimum(27100 Yuan per hectare annual). The water conservation value per unit area was 12700 Yuan per hectare annual, with betula davurica highest water conservation value per unit area (24100 Yuan per hectare annual), followed by willow (19300 Yuan per hectare annual), poplar was minimum(4400 Yuan per hectare annual). The output value of maize was increased by 57.46 billion Yuan annual, which accounted for 58.6% of the annual output of various crops. The minimum amount of cereal with the least amount of output was 0.62 billion Yuan annual, 0.6 percent of the annual output of various crops. The forest ecosystem services have not been fully utilized in Zhalantun, like soil conservation, water conservation and forest agricultural protection, etc. It was suggested that the soil erosion caused by the local forest and grassland degradation was serious and the biological diversity index and grain yield decreased significantly. Therefore, the government of Zhalantun should strengthen the protection of ecological resources, construct water and soil erosion controlling and dynamic monitoring based on small watershed as a unit, transform slope farmland, build farmland shelterbelts, establish accountability system for the protection of cultivated land, improve the compensation system for land requisition, and ensure not suitable for cultivation in an orderly way and improve the quality of arable land. It should plant more forest category, which can generate large value of forest ecosystem service. The rational management and optimize the use of local forest resources has important significance.

AB  - Project developers face stringent environmental assessments and project approvals at multiple tiers of government. In order to streamline approvals, the Australian government is executing its strategic One Stop Shop (OSS) policy to integrate environmental approvals at the state-territory tier of government. This study crowdsourced diverse public opinion to develop an understanding of the required regulatory changes, and problems and pitfalls, associated with the OSS policy. Regime theory was used to frame the research and show that robust and repeatable approvals processing, convergent regulations and laws, open access to environmental data, and a single national list of threatened species may pave the way for improved approvals. In addition, OSS approvals assurance will be a critical factor if the policy prescription is to succeed. Stakeholders also expressed heightened concerns over weakened federal environmental approvals oversight and standards enforcement, increased approval uncertainty and limited efficiency improvements. The study commended closer federal and state-territory collaboration and co-operation, use of third-party facilitation of approvals processing and an enhanced guidance for community engagement and social impact analyses as aids for policy implementation.

AB  - The objective of the SWATCH21 project is to improve our understanding of eco-hydrologic services at the catchment level, and biodiversity at the river scale. Six research questions are proposed: (i) How can we improve the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling? (ii) What is the role of glacier and snow in modifying the hydrological services? (iii) How can we best assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and tools? (iv) What will be the impact of the main hydrologic changes on species diversity in rivers? (v) Can we meet the targets of multi-sectorial river-related policies under different climate and landuse forecasting scenarios? (vi) How detailed do ES data and models need to be to answer relevant policy questions? The above questions are tackled through an integrated framework to access, share, process, model, and deliberate on hydrologic ecosystems services. State-of-the-art models have been selected, and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services. Initial results from a first SWAT model of Switzerland and Species Distribution Models are presented. Expected outputs from various climate and land use change scenarios include rivers' hydrology, predicted biodiversity, and the assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services (e.g. water resources), regulating services (e.g. nutrient, sediment and flood water retention), and cultural services (e.g. biodiversity, recreation). The expected outcome of the project is to improve integrated evidence-based water policy in the future through the analysis of tradeoffs and synergies between services.

AB  - Urban ecosystem is plagued with complexities and uncertainties due to the interconnections among multiple subsystems, as well as human and environment interventions. In this study, a hybrid AHP-FMADM method through coupling fuzzy multiple attribute decision-making (FMADM) with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is developed to evaluate urban ecological security (UES). AHP-FMADM has advantages in (i) reflecting interactive relationships among multiple attributes in UES, (ii) dealing with uncertainties expressed as imprecise linguistic terms and judgments, and (iii) achieving the ranking of alternatives based on pairwise comparison. Then. AHP-FMADM is applied to assessing the ecological security of Guangzhou from 2005 to 2015, where an urban ecological security evaluation indicator system is constructed based on the pressure-state-response conceptual model. A number of scenarios with different weight assignment modes are examined. Results indicate that the overall ecological security of the study city is gradually improved. Urban environment indicators contributes more to the ecological security level than social and economic indicators. However, although ecological security state and response level increase significantly, the ecological pressure has increased since 2012, which may result in a decline of ecological security. Compared to the traditional fuzzy synthetic analysis (FSA) approach with weighted sum operator, AHP-FMADM cannot only reduce the effect of the attributes with low importance and increase that with high importance, but also help decision makers determine alternative adaptation options and management schemes based on their preferences. These findings reveal that indicators with high importance degree need to be efficiently adjusted for decision makers to maintain ecological security, such as increase water reuse ratio and control the rapid growth of the population.

AB  - In 2007 the United States National Research Council (NRC) published a vision for toxicity testing in the 21st century that emphasized the use of in vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) methods and predictive models as an alternative to in vivo animal testing. In the present study we examine the state of the science of HTS and the progress that has been made in implementing and expanding on the NRC vision, as well as challenges to implementation that remain. Overall, significant progress has been made with regard to the availability of HTS data, aggregation of chemical property and toxicity information into online databases, and the development of various models and frameworks to support extrapolation of HTS data. However, HTS data and associated predictive models have not yet been widely applied in risk assessment. Major barriers include the disconnect between the endpoints measured in HTS assays and the assessment endpoints considered in risk assessments as well as the rapid pace at which new tools and models are evolving in contrast with the slow pace at which regulatory structures change. Nonetheless, there are opportunities for environmental scientists and policymakers alike to take an impactful role in the ongoing development and implementation of the NRC vision. Six specific areas for scientific coordination and/or policy engagement are identified. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:12-26. Published 2018 Wiley Periodicals Inc. on behalf of SETAC.

AB  - Quantification of vegetation cover from pollen analysis has been a goal of palynologists since the advent of the method in 1916 by the great Lennart von Post. Pollen-based research projects are becoming increasingly ambitious in scale, and the emergence of spatially extensive open-access datasets, advanced methods and computer power has facilitated sub-continental analysis of Holocene pollen data. This paper presents results of one such study, focussing on the Mediterranean basin. Pollen data from 105 fossil sequences have been extracted from the European Pollen database, harmonised by both taxonomy and chronologies, and subjected to a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method to synthesise the dataset into 16 main groupings. A particular focus of analysis was to describe the common transitions from one group to another to understand pathways of Holocene vegetation change in the Mediterranean. Two pollen-based indices of human impact (OJC: Oleaceae, Juglans, Castanea; API: anthropogenic pollen indicators) have been used to infer the degree of human modification of vegetation within each pollen grouping. Pollen-inferred cluster groups that are interpreted as representing more natural vegetation states show a restricted number of pathways of change. A set of cluster groups were identified that closely resemble anthropogenically-disturbed vegetation, and might be considered anthromes (anthopogenic biomes). These clusters show a very wide set of potential pathways, implying that all potential vegetation communities identified through this analysis have been altered in response to land exploitation and transformation by human societies in combination with other factors, such as climatic change. Future work to explain these ecosystem pathways will require developing complementary datasets from the social sciences and humanities (archaeology and historical sources), along with synthesis of the climatic records from the region.

AB  - The assessments of water and sediment qualities are considered as the best indicators for monitoring eutrophication in water ecosystems. Viroi Lake, in Gjirolcastra district (south part of Albania) was selected to evaluate eutrophication conditions during the years 2011-2013. The water and sediment samples were collected for quality evaluation. The following physico-chemical indicators of water: pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, nitrates (N-NO3-), nitrites (N-NO2-), ammonium (N-NH4+), total phosphor (TP), and the presence of microorganisms as Fecal sp. were estimated. Also, the texture, pH, CEC, carbonates (CaCO3), total nitrogen, total phosphor and humus of sediment samples were assessed. Furthermore, the concentration of heavy metals, such as Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Cd, were measured in sediment samples, as sensitive indicators of water ecosystems. Background values of heavy metals, given as 90th percentile, were used to evaluate the sediment pollution from heavy metals.
   Based on the obtained results, this ecosystem presented a trophic degree from oligotrophy to eutrophy. Microbiological analyses showed that Viroi Lake was polluted with microorganisms (fecal streptococci and fecal conforms). The sediments can be classified, using sediment quality guideline (SQG) of USEPA, as non-polluted or heavily polluted according to the occurrence of specific heavy metals.

AB  - When a disaster strikes, it is important to allocate limited disaster relief resources to those in need. This paper considers the allocation of resources in humanitarian logistics using three critical performance indicators: efficiency, effectiveness and equity. Three separate costs are considered to represent these metrics, namely, the accessibility-based delivery cost, the starting state-based deprivation cost, and the terminal penalty cost. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming model with multiple objectives and multiple periods is proposed. A Qlearning algorithm, a type of reinforcement learning method, is developed to address the complex optimization problem. The principles of the proposed algorithm, including the learning agent and its actions, the environment and its states, and reward functions, are presented in detail. The parameter settings of the proposed algorithm are also discussed in the experimental section. In addition, the solution quality of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of the exact dynamic programming method and a heuristic algorithm. The experimental results show that the efficiency of the algorithm is better than that of the dynamic programming method and the accuracy of the algorithm is higher than that of the heuristic algorithm. Moreover, the Q-learning algorithm provides close to or even optimal solutions to the resource allocation problem by adjusting the value of the training episode K in practical applications.

AB  - [1] Well-defined vegetation patterns are a widespread feature of dryland landscapes, where spotted, banded, or other organized systems of vegetation patches are bordered by bare soil. A number of different mechanisms have been invoked to explain the emergence of these patterns and to associate their geometrical features to the driving ( biotic and abiotic) processes. A commonly accepted theory of pattern formation is based on the interplay between mechanisms of short-range facilitation and long-range competition with surrounding vegetation. Recently associated with the emergence of vegetation patterns, these short- and long-range interactions have been seldom interpreted as a means for plants to enhance their chances of survival in arid environments. Here we develop a simplistic facilitation-competition model to show how these spatial interactions increase the productivity of dryland ecosystems. Stable (sparsely) vegetated states are shown to occur even in systems in which unvegetated conditions are the only stable state of the local dynamics (i.e., in the absence of spatial interaction). Pattern emergence is also interpreted as an easily detectable sign of the occurrence of highly effective resource allocation and use due to spatial interactions. Moreover, the resilience of vegetated states is qualitatively related to pattern geometry.

AB  - Understanding how microbial communities change with environmental degradation and restoration may offer new insights into the understudied ecology that connects humans, microbiota, and the natural world. Immunomodulatory microbial diversity and 'Old Friends' are thought to be supplemented from biodiverse natural environments, yet deficient in anthropogenically disturbed or degraded environments. However, few studies have compared the microbiomes of natural vs. human-altered environments and there is little knowledge of which microbial taxa are representative of ecological restoration-i.e. the assisted recovery of degraded ecosystems typically towards a more natural, biodiverse state. Here we use novel bootstrap-style resampling of site-level soil bacterial 16S rRNA gene environmental DNA data to identify genus-level indicators of restoration from a 10-year grassy eucalypt woodland restoration chronosequence at Mt Bold, South Australia. We found two key indicator groups emerged: 'opportunistic taxa' that decreased in relative abundance with restoration and more stable and specialist, 'niche-adapted taxa' that increased. We validated these results, finding seven of the top ten opportunists and eight of the top ten niche-adapted taxa displayed consistent differential abundance patterns between human-altered vs. natural samples elsewhere across Australia. Extending this, we propose a two-dimensional mapping for ecosystem condition based on the proportions of these divergent indicator groups. We also show that restoring a more biodiverse ecosystem at Mt Bold has increased the potentially immune-boosting environmental microbial diversity. Furthermore, environmental opportunists including the pathogen-containing genera Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, Legionella and Pseudomonas associated with disturbed ecosystems. Our approach is generalizable with potential to inform DNA-based methods for ecosystem assessment and help target environmental interventions that may promote microbiota-mediated human health gains.

AB  - Complex dynamic ecosystems are important natural capital assets. We investigate how Swedish national policy has approached these assets in its work on environmental indicators. In particular, we are interested in whether or not the indicators address ecosystem performance. We discuss our inventory of Swedish indicators in the context of ecosystem services, such as source and sink functions, and the capacity of ecosystems to sustain these functions for human wellbeing. We find that effective indicators have been developed to reflect energy and material flows within society and how human activities put pressure on the environment. The part of natural capital that concerns living systems is reflected in several of the Swedish indicators in a progressive fashion, but indicators that capture the dynamic capacity of ecosystems in sustaining the flow of source and sink functions need to be further developed. We provide examples of recent developments that have started to address such indicators in the context of ecosystem resilience and environmental change, and discuss directions for their further development. We stress the importance of monitoring ecosystem resilience and performance to avoid undesirable state shifts and building ecological knowledge and understanding of this capacity into environmental indicators and their associated management institutions.

AB  - Augmentative biological control concerns the periodical release of natural enemies. In commercial augmentative biological control, natural enemies are mass-reared in biofactories for release in large numbers to obtain an immediate control of pests. The history of commercial mass production of natural enemies spans a period of roughly 120 years. It has been a successful, environmentally and economically sound alternative for chemical pest control in crops like fruit orchards, maize, cotton, sugar cane, soybean, vineyards and greenhouses. Currently, augmentative biological control is in a critical phase, even though during the past decades it has moved from a cottage industry to professional production. Many efficient species of natural enemies have been discovered and 230 are commercially available today. The industry developed quality control guidelines, mass production, shipment and release methods as well as adequate guidance for farmers. However, augmentative biological control is applied on a frustratingly small acreage. Trends in research and application are reviewed, causes explaining the limited uptake are discussed and ways to increase application of augmentative biological control are explored.

AB  - Multiple indicators of water quality, sediment quality, and biological condition were used to assess the status of ecological condition of National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS) sites in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia relative to a suite of corresponding scoring criteria. All measurements were made in subtidal aquatic habitats. Calculated scores were integrated into an overall index of habitat quality and used to make comparisons among the various NERR and non-NERR estuaries throughout the region. Sediment quality scores varied considerably among NERR sites, but in most cases were similar between individual NERR and non-NERR sites in corresponding states. Water quality and biological condition indicators scored consistently higher for NERRs versus non-NERR sites. Overall habitat quality scores also were consistently higher for NERRS sites, suggesting that these areas are on par with if not in slightly better condition ecologically than neighboring nonNERR estuaries.

AB  - A series of different nuclear sources associated with the nuclear weapon and fuel cycles have contributed to the release of radioactive particles to the environment. Following nuclear weapon tests, safety tests, conventional destruction of weapons, reactor explosions and fires, a major fraction of released refractory radionuclides such as uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) were present as entities ranging from sub microns to fragments. Furthermore, radioactive particles and colloids have been released from reprocessing facilities and civil reactors, from radioactive waste dumped at sea, and from NORM sites. Thus, whenever refractory radionuclides are released to the environment following nuclear events, radioactive particles should be expected.
   Results from many years of research have shown that particle characteristics such as elemental composition depend on the source, while characteristics such as particle size distribution, structure, and oxidation state influencing ecosystem transfer depend also on the release scenarios. When radioactive particles are deposited in the environment, weathering processes occur and associated radionuclides are subsequently mobilized, changing the apparent Kd. Thus, particles retained in soils or sediments are unevenly distributed, and dissolution of radionuclides from particles may be partial. For areas affected by particle contamination, the inventories can therefore be underestimated, and impact and risk assessments may suffer from unacceptable large uncertainties if radioactive particles are ignored. To integrate radioactive particles into environmental impact assessments, key challenges include the linking of particle characteristics to specific sources, to ecosystem transfer, and to uptake and retention in biological systems. To elucidate these issues, the EC-funded COMET and RATE projects and the IAEA Coordinated Research Program on particles have revisited selected contaminated sites and archive samples. This COMET position paper summarizes new knowledge on key sources that have contributed to particle releases, including particle characteristics based on advanced techniques, with emphasis on particle weathering processes as well as on heterogeneities in biological samples to evaluate potential uptake and retention of radioactive particles.

AB  - Ichneumonoidea is air important group in terrestrial ecosystems, although its community structure in tropical agricultural environments is unknown. Consequently, a characterization of ichneumonoid communities was done in an agricultural environment consisting of a cultivated area with and without surrounding vegetation in the state of Yucatan, Mexico. The characterization helped to understand how Ichneumonoidea diversity changes in the vegetation structure adjacent a crop. Three sampling sites were established: nine experimental plots in open area with continual agricultural use without surrounding vegetation (NSV), nine experimental plots with surrounding vegetation in a remaining patch (WSV), and nine plots inside of secondary vegetation of a remaining 7-yr-old patch (SV). Ichneumonoidea specimens were collected with Malaise and yellow pan traps. A total of 1,715 specimens were collected, divided into 40 subfamilies, resulting in 138 genera and 480 species. Of these, Braconidae accounted for 1,115 specimens from 21 subfamilies, 84 genera, and 342 species, whereas Ichneumonidae was represented by 600 individuals from 19 subfamilies with 54 genera and 142 species. Braconidae had higher species richness, abundance, and diversity than Ichneumonidae. Both families exhibited higher diversity in the treatment with surrounding vegetation. Koinobiont species were most common in both families. We suggest that vegetation structure and spatial distribution seem to have greater effect on community structure. Our results suggest that Ichneumonoidea could be a better indicator of the degree of disturbance than of environmental preservation.

AB  - Nematodes represent an important group of animals in the decomposer food web, because of high diversities, abundances and functional roles supporting ecological processes, such as decomposition. They have been relatively well studied in numerous ecosystems, but have rather skipped attention in sea turtle nests at sandy shores, where a massive supply of nutrients is taking place after turtle egg hatching. Being excellent indicators of ecological functioning, we hypothesized that nematode community characteristics could be indicative of the ecological/functional state of sea turtle nests as affected by hatching characteristics (e.g. number of eggs, hatching success rate etc.). In our study, conducted in Zakynthos (Greece), we perform a pioneer in-depth analyses of nematode communities in Caretta caretta nests after egg hatching. We further explore whether turtle reproductive success, measured through a number of metrics reflecting stages and portion of alive/dead hatchlings, are linked to nematode community characteristics. We found 14 different nematode genera in total. Our analyses demonstrate that nematodes play a critical role in functionality and energy flow in sandy shore ecosystems and that sea turtle nests present an ephemeral micro-habitat hosting communities with specific characteristics. These include rather high nematode abundances and communities in early successional stages with a simple trophic structure, almost exclusively dominated by bacterivore nematodes (mostly opportunistic/c-p 1) and without top-down control. Variables either showing success or failure of hatching explained a large amount of variability of nematode community characteristics, supporting our hypothesis. The nematode Metabolic Footprint was strongly associated with the amount of dead hatchlings concentrated in the turtle nest. Nematode taxonomic diversity and richness were closely associated with an increased hatching success rate at nest level. Our findings can offer a base for developing a framework for comprehensive and standardized assessments of sea turtle nests that could ensure comparability of results over spatial or temporal scales in monitoring projects. Further research might show how increased diversity of nematode communities could be achieved so to improve reproduction output and success of loggerhead sea turtles.

AB  - The ecological system conformed by the islands of Tenerife and La Gomera (Canary Islands) is characterized though the trophic network. The indicators obtained by the Ecopath model show a stressed and still developing ecosystem, probably related to inadequate management of the fisheries that takes place in this area, focused on high trophic level species. The Ecosim and Ecospace modules have been used to provide comparative assessment of three management scenarios addressed to evaluate the impact of fishing, both professional and recreational, on the marine ecosystem, as well as the spatial evolution of the fishing effort in a projection period going from 2021 to 2030, that can be applied in decision-making and planning in the short and medium term. In all the simulated scenarios, a drastic reduction in the biomass of pelagic species was observed, including the trophic guild of pelagic sharks that the model identifies as key species for the correct functioning of this marine ecosystem. Despite the existing information gaps, the results seem to confirm that the intense exploitation to which some functional groups have been subjected in the past has left its mark on the ecosystem, requiring a significant fishing effort reduction to attempt a recovery of the stocks. It is strongly recommended the implementation of a recreational fishing data collection system with less uncertainty, due to its significant role in the state of this ecological system.

AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the trophic structure and energy flow in a lentic ecosystem in South Korea. Physicochemical water conditions were evaluated along with the reservoir ecosystem health using a multimetric IBI model. Nutrient analyses of the reservoir showed a nutrient rich and hypereutrophic system. Guild analysis revealed that tolerant and omnivorous species dominated the ecosystem. Tolerant fish, as a proportion of the number of individuals, were associated (R-2 > 0.90, p < 0.01) with TN and TP, the key indicators of trophic state in lentic ecosystems. The mean Reservoir Ecosystem Health Assessment (REHA) score was 19.3 during the study, which was judged as in 'fair to poor' condition. A trophic analysis of the reservoir estimated by the ECOPATH model shows that most activity in terms of energy flow occurred in the lower part of the trophic web, where there was intensive use of primary producers as a food source. Consequently, of the 10 consumer groups, nine fell within trophic levels <2.8. Trophic levels (TL) estimated from the weighted average of prey trophic levels varied from 1.0 for phytoplankton, macrophytes, and detritus to 3.25 for the top predator, Pseudobagrus fulvidraco. Our integrated approach to trophic network analysis may provide a key tool for determining the effects of nutrient influx on energy flow pathways in lentic ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Indicators based on broad functional characteristics, which group plankton taxa into "lifeforms", summarize changes across a high number of taxa in a way that reflects changes in community functioning and are used to inform policy assessments. Key questions remain, however, as to what extent plankton taxa within these lifeforms share responses to environmental change. Addressing this knowledge gap can provide additional information on the influence of environmental drivers, including climate change, on plankton communities. Here, we use a multi-decadal plankton time series to examine the extent to which taxa within lifeforms share responses to sea surface temperature (SST) change. At the North Sea scale, the individual taxa responses within the dinoflagellate lifeform are skewed towards a negative response to increasing SST, consolidating previous findings that dinoflagellate abundance is decreasing with ocean warming. The individual taxa responses within the zooplankton lifeforms, however, varied, suggesting that lifeform traits are less of a factor determining response to SST for zooplankton than for phytoplankton. The lifeform level of grouping taxa, therefore, is useful for communicating change in the state and functioning of ecosystems, but finer taxonomically resolved data are essential for determining the drivers of plankton community change, including climate influences, during formal assessments.

AB  - Heritage conservation and management of landscapes is evident in many recent European policies and national reports on the state of the environment. To assist in the management of heritage resources, we present a landscape approach to the identification of localities with a high probability of possessing cultural heritage interests. The low proportion of sites registered in Norway (an estimated 20%) combined with current rates of damage gives the location of archaeological sites and their vulnerability to land use change high priority. To optimise use of the results for landscape planning, the study describes analysis at two hierarchical scales: (1) the regional level-where the aim was to locate combinations of environmental resources suitable for human use-for application in strategic planning; and (2) the landscape level-where identifying and delimiting cultural environments for local planning was the aim. This paper focuses on one type of archaeological site, Bronze and Iron Age grave mounds. The project used geographic information systems (GIS) for the analysis and mapping of landscape characteristics that indicate zones with a high probability of possessing cultural heritage interest. These zones covered ca. 12% of the forested areas of the region yet captured 94% of the registered grave mounds. New fieldwork confirmed the presence of new sites in the zones identified. Results have increased our understanding of archaeological site location in Norway and the close links between landscape ecology and archaeology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vaccinium myrtillus L. is an important component for forming phyto-environment in boreal forest ecosystems, in which it develops various consortium connections. Being a mycorrhizal species, V. myrtillus improves nutrition and stimulates the growth of plants of all layers, supporting inter- and intra-specific connections of different layers of forest communities. In order to estimate the environment-forming role of V. myrtillus in ecosystems it is essential to acquire data on quantitative presence of the species in plant communities composition and on ecological-phytocoenotic peculiarities within its range. The aim of the study is to define phytocoenotic parameters and ecological conditions of V. myrtillus habitats within the southern taiga part of its range (Kirov region).
   We collected the material during the growing seasons of 2009-2015 and made 110 geobotanical descriptions according to common geobotanical methods (Methods of studies., 2002). Ecological conditions were estimated based on species compositions in communities using 10 ecological scales by Dmitry Tsyganov (1983). The ecological discomfort index was determined for each habitat (Klimenko, 2012). Common methods of soil analyses were used for different biotopes of the studied species (Arinushkina, 1962). Hemeroby was determined by the species composition in plant communities, in which every species has individual human impact tolerance spectre (Frank and Klotz, 1990).
   V. myrtillus acts as a dominant or codominant of the herbaceous-shrub synfolium of boreal coniferous and mixed forest communities with 30-70% cover. It is accompanied by the following species: Vaccinium vitis-idaea L., Rubus saxatilis L., Juncus filiformis L., Calamagrostis epigeios (L.) Roth., Thelypteris palustris Schot, Melampyrum sylvaticum L., and Majanthemum bifolium (L.) F. Schmidt. The species is found on gley and gleyic podzolic soils, mostly sabulous, rarely-sandy; and on peaty-gley and sod-podzolic soils (See Table 1). Bilberry is common on high acidity soils with pH varying from 2.54 to 4.93. The concentration of organic carbon in bilberry forest litter varies from 5.71 to 69.2% (See Fig. 1).
   V. myrtillus is a mesobiont species whose average ecologic valency coefficient reaches 55%. In the investigated coenopopulations, the species achieves 8.15 to 50.10% of its potential capabilities regarding the studied factors. V. myrtillus is a hemieurybiont by climatic factors (0.58 points). It achieves its maximum on ombroclimatic scale (44.5%). According to climatic scales, ecological conditions of the studied habitats occupy the central position of all possible. The generalized spectrum of soil scales shows the species as a mesobiont (It-0.45). This allows widening V. myrtillus soil humidity scale 1.27 point left and soil moisture variability scale 0.80 points right. On other scales, the environmental position of the studied coenopopulations are within the data given by Dmitry Tsyganov for the species (See Table 2 and Fig. 2).
   The discomfort index is also given to estimate habitat ecological conditions. Based on phytoindication data and according to the discomfort index, we defined that the most favorable conditions of edapho- and climatopes for V. myrtillus are formed in sphagnum phytocoenoses. The least favorable conditions were noted in bilberry pine and bilberry-pleurocarpous moss pine-spruce forest types.
   The study of hemeroby showed that oligo-mesohemerob species (highly sensitive to anthropogenic factors) prevail in all V. myrtillus coenopopulations, i.e. 41%. A-hemerob, a-euhemerob and polyhemerob species were not noted in any of the studied CPs (See Table 3 and Fig. 3). This proves that the species is of low resistance to anthropogenic influence and can survive moderate intensity human impact. The studied plant communities with V. myrtillus are low-hemerobic. The paper contains 3 Figures, 3 Tables and 46 References.

AB  - Despite the enormous advances in medicine, brain tumours are still among the lesser-known types of tumours and carry the worst prognoses. Transition metals are believed to play an essential role in carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine differences in the average oxidation state and trends in the changes in the chemical environment of iron and zinc contained in healthy and neoplastic tissues of the human brain. For this purpose, X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy was used, which enables the study of disordered matter. The samples were taken intraoperatively and then immediately frozen to slow down chemical processes. Sixteen tumour samples with various malignancy grades were studied as well as one control sample. For each sample four to eight spectra were recorded, with a shift between them not greater than 0.2 eV. In all of the samples, iron occurred in compounds with both Fe2+ and Fe3+. However, the ratio of Fe(II) to Fe(III) content in the tissue visibly increased with the tumour malignancy grade. The change in the oxidation state of iron did not correlate with the hypoxia level of the tissues. Analysis of EXAFS spectra of zinc atoms showed that the chemical environment of zinc atoms differed with the tumour malignancy grade. Additionally, cryogenic conditions were found to produce positive results in studies of biological samples, whose form under such conditions is close to their native state, without preparation-caused artefacts.

AB  - State water quality agencies are custodians of water quality management programs under the Clean Water Act of which the protection and restoration of biological integrity in surface waters is an integral goal. However, an inappropriate reliance on chemical/physical stressor and exposure data or administrative indicators in place of the direct measurement of ecological response has led to an incomplete foundation for water resource management. As point sources have declined in significance, the consequences of this flawed foundation for dealing with the major limitations to biological integrity (nonpoint sources, habitat degradation) have become more apparent. The use of biocriteria in Ohio, for example, resulted in the identification of 50% more impairment than a water chemistry approach alone and other inconsistencies of a flawed monitoring foundation are illustrated in the national 305(b) report statistics on waters monitored, aquatic life use attainment, and habitat degradation. Biological criteria (biocriteria) incorporates the broader concept of water resource integrity to supplement the roles of chemical and toxicological approaches and reduces the likelihood of making overly optimistic estimates of aquatic life condition. A carefully conceived ambient monitoring approach comprised of biological, chemical, and physical measures ensures all relevant stressors to water resource integrity are identified and that the efficacy of administrative actions can be directly measured with environmental results. New multimetric indices, such as the IBI, ICI, and BIBI represent a significant advancement in aquatic resource characterization that have allowed the inclusion of biological information into many States water quality management programs. Ohio adopted numerical biocriteria in the Ohio water quality standards regulations in May 1990 and, through multiple aquatic life uses that reflect a continuum of biological condition, represents a tiered approach to water resource management. Biocriteria provide the impetus and opportunity to recognize and account for natural, ecological variability in the environment, something which previously was been lacking in state water quality management programs. The upper Great Miami River in Ohio illustrates a case study where bioassessment data documented the efficacy of efforts to permit, fund, and construct municipal treatment systems in restoring aquatic life. In contrast, in the Mahoning River similar administrative actions were inadequate to restore aquatic life in an environment with severe sediment contamination and impacts from combined sewer overflows. A biocriteria-based goal of restoring 75% of aquatic life uses by the year 2000 in Ohio has led to the use of biological data to identify trends and forecast the status and the causes and sources of impairment to Ohio streams, an effort that should affect the strategic focus of our water resource management efforts. A biocriteria-based approach has profoundly influenced strategic planning and priority setting, water quality based permitting, water quality standards, basic monitoring and reporting, nonpoint source assessment, and problem discovery within Ohio EPA.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are facing unprecedented threats. Baseline information about the state of ecosystems is needed to address these threats. Ecosystem assessments can be completed over varying scales through different methodologies or a combination of them. Despite these many technologies, most marine environments lack comprehensive habitat assessments. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) provide an opportunity to conduct small-to meso scale ecological surveying without some of the constraints of commonly used methodologies such as scuba. The development of cost-effective models of ROVs broadens the accessibility of this technology to many different user groups. We applied the Trident ROV as part of a community-based research project to conduct marine conservation planning around the Tl'ches archipelago with the Songhees Nation in Victoria, British Columbia. We had two main objectives: (1) We evaluated the marine ecological data collection capabilities for the Trident OpenROV and (2) our surveys aimed to complete a systematic benthos classification and document the algal community as well as document a baseline of Songhees culturally important species. We also discuss evaluated the ability of the Trident to provide high resolution ecological data to inform a marine use planning process. We found the Trident to be a capable tool to conduct systematic marine surveying despite some limitations such as low maneuverability in moderate to high current environments and dense kelp areas. We were able to document 14 of 25 culturally important species and 28 species of algae and seaweeds. We were also able to identify highly stressed environments suited for future restoration efforts. The application of a mini low cost ROV to inform marine use planning generated high-resolution data that enabled the Songhees Nation to confirm the whole archipelago warrants protection and necessitates the exclusion of non-Indigenous user groups. Documenting and having a permanent record of the substrate, algal cover, and culturally important species composition around the seascape Tl'ches could serve as one reference point for the Songhees Nation to establish a monitoring system.

AB  - The basis for the assessment of ecosystem services (ES) of non-perennial rivers to date has been a comparison of the ES provision among three different hydrological phases: flowing conditions, isolated pools, and dry streambeds. Being of an opinion that this practice might promote an incomplete and hence biased ES assessment, we propose two considerations for the ES assessment of non-perennial rivers. First, the conditions of each hydrological phase can vary based on the nature of multiple aquatic states. Second, the duration, frequency, timing, and magnitude of the aquatic states matter in the ES provision. Different scenarios of flow regime should be compared instead of hydrological phases in ES assessments. Our proposal sheds some light on the complexity of non-perennial rivers and allows for a better understanding of relationships between non-perennial rivers and society. Therefore, it can serve as the basis for the proper and participatory ES assessment, face for trade-offs between ecosystem conservation and resource use and reduce conflicts among stakeholders within river and water management.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive requires European states to monitor the ecological quality of their lakes. Detailed information on the composition and abundance of biological groups such as aquatic plants (macrophytes) and phytoplankton (including chlorophyll a) must be expressed as an ecological quality ratio (EQR), ranging from 1 (close to reference status) to 0 (bad status). Effort is often focused on gathering this detailed information on selected lakes at the expense of more synoptic approaches that could capture a more holistic assessment of a catchment's water quality. This could be rectified if remote sensing can provide predictions of ecological quality for unmonitored lakes. We found that data from Sentinel-2 satellites, based on regression model outputs of observed vs estimated results, successfully predicted the macrophyte EQR (R-2 = 0.77) and the maximum lake depth that macrophytes colonised to (R-2 = 0.80) but average chlorophyll a was less well predicted (R-2 = 0.66). Predictions for a test catchment indicated that results were within one ecological assessment class width of measured values for macrophytes. This approach can potentially estimate status for unmonitored lakes in Ireland, be integrated with results on monitored lakes and used to direct resources where needed at national and catchment scales.

AB  - Identifying key indicator species, their life cycle dynamics and the multiple driving forces they are affected by is an important step in ecosystem-based management. Similarly important is understanding how environmental changes and trophic interactions shape future trajectories of key species with potential implications for ecosystem state and service provision. We here present a statistical modeling framework to assess and quantify cumulative effects on the long-term dynamics of the copepod Pseudocalanus acuspes, a key species in the Baltic Sea. Our model integrates linear and non-linear responses to changes in life stage density, climate and predation pressure as well as stochastic processes. We use the integrated life cycle model to simulate copepod dynamics under a combination of stressor scenarios and to identify conditions under which population responses are potentially mitigated or magnified. Our novel modeling approach reliably captures the historical P. acuspes population dynamics and allows us to identify females in spring and younger copepodites in summer as stages most sensitive to direct and indirect effects of the main environmental stressors, salinity and temperature. Our model simulations furthermore demonstrate that population responses to stressors are dampened through density effects. Multiple stressor interactions were mostly additive except when acting on the same life stage. Here, negative synergistic and positive dampening effects lead to a lower total population size than expected under additive interactions. As a consequence, we found that a favorable increase of oxygen and phosphate conditions together with a reduction in predation pressure by 50% each could counteract the negative effect of a 25% decrease in salinity by only 6%. Ultimately, our simulations suggest that P. acuspes will most certainly decline under a potential freshening of the Baltic Sea and increasing temperatures, which is conditional on the extent of the assumed climate change. Also the planned nutrient reduction strategy and fishery management plan will not necessarily benefit the temporal development of P. acuspes. Moving forward, there is a growing opportunity for using population modeling in cumulative effects assessments. Our modeling framework can help here as simple tool for species with a discrete life cycle to explore stressor interactions and the safe operating space under future climate change.

AB  - Growing concerns about climate change and energy security have fueled a rapid increase in the development of marine renewable energy installations (MREIs). The potential ecological consequences of increased use of these devices emphasizes the need for high quality environmental impact assessment (EIA). We demonstrate that these processes are hampered severely, primarily because ambiguities in the legislation and lack of clear implementation guidance are such that they do not ensure robust assessment of the significance of impacts and cumulative effects. We highlight why the regulatory framework leads to conceptual ambiguities and propose changes which, for the most part, do not require major adjustments to standard practice. We emphasize the importance of determining the degree of confidence in impacts to permit the likelihood as well as magnitude of impacts to be quantified and propose ways in which assessment of population-level impacts could be incorporated into the EIA process. Overall, however, we argue that, instead of trying to ascertain which particular developments are responsible for tipping an already heavily degraded marine environment into an undesirable state, emphasis should be placed on better strategic assessment.

AB  - This article contributes to the accelerating development of methods for sustainability assessment (SA) to support maritime spatial planning (MSP), by proposing an ecosystem services based framework for SA. MSP is generally seen as an important approach to promote a more sustainable use of sea space. However, so far all sustainability concerns are not equally well represented in planning practise; in particular, social sustainability aspects such as social justice and sociocultural values related to human-nature connectedness receive less attention. We first explored concepts and principles related to sustainability assessment and social sustainability in the scientific literature. Based on this, we analysed how far the present approaches to assessments in Baltic Sea EU Member States have been extended from environmental concerns to towards broader sustainability concerns so far. Using current best practise in two pioneering countries (UK and Sweden), we illustrated how social sustainability principles could match with applied social impact criteria, and further, how such criteria can inform an ecosystem services-based impact assessment framework. Based on existing frameworks, including the DPSIR (driving forces, pressures, state, impact, response) environmental assessment framework and the ecosystem service cascade, we propose a sustainability impact assessment framework for MSP (MSP-SA) integrating across sustainability dimensions and including assessment of distributional aspects of marine ecosystem service benefits. Finally, we discuss the applicability and further development of the framework in relation to present day sustainability assessment practise in MSP.

AB  - Despite growing worldwide commitment to large-scale ecosystem restoration, national public policies on restoration are few, and those that exist tend to be vague. Brazil and especially SAo Paulo state stand out. In a pioneering attempt to improve restoration projects and their outcomes, the Secretariat for the Environment of the State of SAo Paulo has enacted a legal instrument to drive planning and to assess whether the goals and targets of mandatory ecological restoration are being achieved. Regardless of the restoration techniques applied, the effectiveness of mandatory or public-funded projects will henceforth be assessed by using three ecological indicators: (1) ground coverage with native vegetation; (2) density of native plants spontaneously regenerating; and (3) number of spontaneously regenerating native plant species. We analyze how this science-based legal framework is expected to promote greater restoration success, improve cost-effectiveness, and help bridge the all-too-familiar knowledge-action gap in environmental policies. Notably, scientists, professionals, public agents, and stakeholders from different institutions have collaborated to advance the refinement and rolling out of this legal instrument. By 2037, it is expected that more than 300,000 restoration projects will be carried out in SAo Paulo state and monitored using this set of indicators. We also suggest that this approach could be usefully applied to the growing number of ecological restoration programs being carried out worldwide, especially in the context of offset policies intended to achieve serious compensation for environmental degradation or loss of biodiversity.

AB  - The paper aims to identify the main innovation activity factors in the Russian regions using econometric analysis. Assessment of the current state of the innovation environment in the Russian Federation reveals that there is a number of problems impeding innovation growth, which affects the country's position in international rankings. The methodological basis of the research includes the theoretical principles of innovation economics, innovation management and regional development.There is a plethora of approaches to modeling the factors of innovative development of countries and regions, as well as to measuring innovation. In the article, we analyze patent activity in Russia's regions and stimulating factors. The information base includes Rosstat panel data for 1999-2015 in 77 subjects of the Russian Federation. To optimize the set of variables of the econometric model, the authors apply a genetic algorithm. We find that factors reflecting human capital, financial performance of enterprises, market competition, ownership and general macroeconomic indicators of regions affect the indicators of patent activity.The research results can be used to formulate recommendations for improving regional innovation policy. In particular, it is reasonable to encourage the management and research staff of organizations to design and introduce innovations, develop venture business, promote active interaction of business with universities and research institutes, as well as strengthen international cooperation.

AB  - The spatial distribution and behavior of limnological variables were studied in a fluvial-lacustrine system, in northern Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Physical (e.g. temperature, transparency), physico-chemical (e.g. pH, conductivity), chemical (e.g. inorganic nutrients, dissolved oxygen, particulate and dissolved organic carbon), biochemical (water-soluble carbohydrates - SCHO, total proteins - TPROT, chlorophyll a - Chl a and carotenoids - CAR) and biological (phytoplankton taxa composition) variables were assessed in water-column. Results from dissolved and particulate phases varied considerably among sampling sites. The studied variables indicated some relationships, in limnetic zone, between inorganic compounds and organic products (biochemical). In comparison to lake and outflow (channel) waters, the main inflow (stream) body water was characterized by lower concentrations of particulate biochemical variables and higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic-N. Gross biochemical composition of POC and DOC indicated spatial variation in the fluvial-lacustrine system with the minor participation of TPROT-C (total protein carbon) and SCHO-C (water-soluble carbohydrate carbon) in the center of the lake. At the horizontal space of the lacustrine system, at the ends of the lake, it was also observed a shift between the relative participation of TPROT-C and SCHO-C in POC. Ecophysiological state and nature of particulate matter were also evaluated through photosynthetic pigment concentrations, light microscope analysis, (C:N)a, C:Chl a, SCHO:TPROT, TPROT:Chl a and SCHO:Chl a ratios. Spatial variations were recognized in the fluvial-lacustrine system and were linked to a variety of factors such as the nature (detrital vs. living plankton algae) and origin (allochthonous vs. autochthonous) of the suspended particulate matter, hydrological characteristic of the environments (lotic vs. lentic), phytoplankton metabolical responses induced by nitrogen deficiencies, and wind stress. Additionally, based on the present concentrations of Chl a and the high proportion of the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (similar to 90%) in Cima Lake phytoplankton composition we point out that the lacustrine system has suffered profound limnological changes from the last 10 years.

AB  - In 2014, China adjusted its "city categorization standard." The newly defined megalopolises and metropolises are under unprecedented pressure from various eco-environmental problems, making them suitable representatives for exploring the state of urban ecosystem health. In this study, we establish a two-layer indicator system to assess the urban ecosystem health and choose 33 indicators grouped into social, economic, transportation, facility, land, and management subsystems, with the aim of correlating human activities with the structure, vigor, resilience, and health of the urban ecosystem. We integrate subjective and objective methods to determine weights at different levels through the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), the analytic hierarchy process, and information entropy. In particular, we develop a spatial TOPSIS technique by introducing a Euclidean-distance-based weight to rank the health of the cities' ecosystem in terms of the spatial effects among these cities. The results reveal that megalopolises such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou have superior social and economic subsystems, whereas other megacities have advantages in transportation, facility, land, and management subsystems. From 2005 to 2010, the gaps among these cities in terms of urban ecosystem health significantly reduced regardless of the weight determination method. Not all indicators involved can help realize a better urban ecosystem. Nevertheless, they provide a reference point for making specific regulations to control human activity and improve eco-environmental management. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tools that may be used to characterize the state of aquatic ecosystems and the impacts associated to pesticides are currently requested for the monitoring of ecosystems. Chemical analysis alone is not sufficient for such purposes and biomonitoring is essential. Many bioindicators based on diatoms are commonly used to assess the quality of aquatic environments but have not been developed to specifically address the impacts of pesticides. It is therefore crucial to develop dedicated tools. Our research aimed at performing a field study (analysis of monitoring network data) in order to evaluate the responses of different metrics towards pesticide pressure.
   For diatom communities, toxic pressure associated to pesticides, especially herbicides, had a weak effect on species composition and on the various tested metrics. Nutrient and organic matter concentrations (and also typology) are the main influencing factors. When trophic and saprobic levels are controlled, it is possible to identify the effects of herbicides on some metrics. The only responding metric is the abundance of the "high profile" guild, which corresponds to taxa presenting an important contact surface with water flow. Its abundance decreases when herbicide toxic pressure increases. It could therefore be used to assess the impact of herbicides on diatom communities, but in a framework where confounding factors variability (e.g., nutrients, organic matter, river order) is reduced.

AB  - 1. Community indicators are used to assess the state of ecological communities and to guide management. They are usually calculated from monitoring data, often collected annually. Since any given community indicator provides a univariate summary of complex multivariate phenomena, different changes in the community may lead to the same response in the indicator. Sampling variation can also mask ecologically important trends.
   2. This study addresses these challenges for community indicators, with a focus on the large fish indicator (LFI), internationally used to report status of marine fish communities. The LFI expresses 'large' fish biomass as a proportion of total fish biomass and is calculated from species-size-abundance data collected on trawl surveys. We develop new methods to decompose the contributions of species, sampling locations and season to trends over time in the LFI, and highlight consequences for assessment and management.
   3. Our results showed that both species and locations made divergent contributions to overall trends in the LFI indicator, with contributions differing by several orders of magnitude and in sign. Only small proportions of species and locations drove overall LFI trends, and their contributions changed with season (spring and autumn surveys). To assess significance of component trends, a resampling method was developed. Our method can be generalized and applied to many other community indicators based on survey data.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our new method for decomposing community indicators and generating confidence intervals makes it possible to extract much more information on what drives a 'headline' indicator, providing a solution to challenges arising from multiple possible interpretations of changes in the indicator and from sampling variation. Analysis of the effects of indicator components on headline indicator values is recommended, because the results allow assessors and managers to identify and interpret how divergent factors (e.g. species, sampling locations and seasons) contribute to the headline indicator value.

AB  - The use of face masks outside the health care facility dates back a century ago. However, face masks use noticeably soared due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. As a result, an unprecedented influx of discarded face masks is ending up in the environment. This review paper delves into face masks in the environment using the DPSIR (driving forces, pressures, states, impacts, and responses) framework to simplify and communicate the environmental indicators. Firstly, the historical, and briefly the economic trajectory of face masks are discussed. Secondly, the main driving forces of face masks use with an emphasis on public health are explored. Then, the pressures exerted by efforts to fulfill the human needs (driving forces) are investigated. In turn, the state of the environment due to the influx of masks along with the impacts are examined. Furthermore, the upstream, and downstream societal responses to mitigate the environmental damages of the driving forces, pressures, states, and impacts are reviewed. In summary, it has been shown from this review that the COVID-19 pandemic has been causing a surge in face mask usage, which translates to face masks pollution in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. This implies proper usage and disposal of face masks is paramount to the quality of human health and the environment, respectively. Moreover, further research on eco-friendly face masks is indispensable to mitigating the environmental damages occurring due to the mass use of surgical masks worldwide.

AB  - Environmental concerns regarding the potential contamination of soil, surface and ground water due to the presence of soluble metal species in the ash pond leachate is of great importance. Serial batch leaching was carried out simulating the rainwater condition of the study area to understand the behaviour of elements during leaching. The leachates were analysed for the elements Al, Ca, K, Mg, Na, P, S, Si, As, Ba, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ti, V, Pb, Zn, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Cd by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). It was found that Cd, Co, Cr and Ni did not leach from the ash while Cu and Pb concentrations were insignificant in the leachate regardless of liquid to solid (L/S) ratio. Most of the elements showed maximum concentrations at lower US ratio and then decreased with increasing US. The total cumulative concentrations of As, Mn and Mo were found to be higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended values for drinking water while the concentrations of Fe, Mn and As exceeded the maximum allowable concentrations prescribed by the United States 0 p Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The pre and the post leached ash samples were analysed for morphology, specific surface area and mineralogical changes. Analysis of post-leached fly ash indicated changes in the specific surface area and morphology but no change in mineralogy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The importance of coastal protection increases with the increase in coastal development. Soft and hard protection measures are the most used techniques; however, hard structures are still preferable. Hard structures are characterized by a long lifetime and high stability in rough sea states. Many innovative, environmentally friendly hard coastal protections measured have been proposed and used for specific applications. This research's main objective is to develop and check a new coastal structure, Corrugated Semi-circular Breakwater (CBW). This structure is modified from the Semi-circular Breakwater (SCBW), one of the hard protections used in Japan and China, to increase its efficiency in coastal protection and electricity generation. A comparative study between CBW and SCBW is carried out physically in a two dimensions wide wave flume with dimensions 1.2*1.2*40 m and numerically using the Flow-3D model. The study checked the effect of the structures in merged, semi-merged, and submerged conditions and increased structure permeability. The reflection, transmission, and dissipation coefficients are used as the efficiency indicators. The results show that CBW is more efficient in wave dissipation, current velocity reductions, and bed stability than SCBW. It is recommended to use the CBW as a submerged protected structure within the recreational coastal areas. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

AB  - This paper presents a "policy-informed" life cycle assessment of a cross-border electricity supply chain that links the impact of each unit process to its governing policy framework. An assessment method is developed and applied to the California Mexico energy exchange as a unique case study. CO2-equivalent emissions impacts, water withdrawals, and air quality impacts associated with California's imports of electricity from Mexican combined-cycle facilities fueled by natural gas from the U.S. Southwest are estimated, and U.S. and Mexican state and federal environmental regulations are examined to assess well-to-wire consistency of energy policies. Results indicate most of the water withdrawn per kWh exported to California occurs in Baja California, most of the air quality impacts accrue in the U.S. Southwest, and emissions of CO2-equivalents are more evenly divided between the two regions. California energy policy design addresses generation-phase CO2 emissions, but not upstream CO2-eq emissions of methane during the fuel cycle. Water and air quality impacts are not regulated consistently due to varying U.S. state policies and a lack of stringent federal regulation of unconventional gas development. Considering local impacts and the regulatory context where they occur provides essential qualitative information for functional-unit-based measures of life cycle impact and is necessary for a more complete environmental impact assessment.

AB  - The Mexico City Metropolitan Zone (MCMZ) presents important emissions of hazardous air pollutants. It is well documented that the MCMZ suffers a critical air pollution problem due to high ozone and particulate matter concentrations. However, toxic air pollutants such as benzene and toluene have not been considered. Benzene has accumulated sufficient evidence as a human carcinogen, and the ratio benzene/toluene is an excellent indicator to evaluate control strategies efficiency.
   In order to evaluate the levels of these two air toxic pollutants in the MCMZ, ambient air samples were collected in canisters and analyzed with a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector, according to procedures described in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) method TO-15. Quality assurance was performed collecting duplicate samples which were analyzed in replicate to quantify the precision of air-quality measurements.
   Three different sites located in the Southwestern area in the MCMZ were selected for the sampling: the University campus, a gas station, and a vertical condominium area, in the same neighborhood, which presents different activities. At these sites, grab air samples were collected during the morning hours (7-8 a.m.), while for the University area, 24 h integrated air samples were collected simultaneously, with grab samples.
   Benzene concentrations (24 h sampling) in the atmosphere around the University campus have similar present levels as in other cities of North America. Mean values in this site were about 1.7 ppb.
   A significant variation exists between the benzene and toluene concentrations in the studied sites, being the more critical values than those registered at the gas station (an average of 25.8 ppb and a maximum of 141 ppb of benzene). There is a fuel regulation for gasoline in Mexico, which allows a maximum of I percent of benzene. However, since more than 60 percent of vehicles do not have catalytic converters (models before 1991) it is expected that most of this benzene be emitted through exhaust pipe. Another strategy being implemented is the use of vapor recovery systems at the gas stations. Vehicles emission control technology must be matched with adequate fuel characteristics in the problem area where it will be implemented, to achieve maximum emission reductions.

KW  - TAXATION
AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) has mobilized economic theory in order to encourage E.U. Member States to reach desirable environmental water pollution levels by conciliating economic and ecological interests. For this purpose, a stringent standard ("good status") has been set. Nevertheless, it will be possible to relax this standard if it appears that total abatement costs required for reaching this "good status" exceed expected environmental benefits. This ambitious policy updates the issue of the abatement costs and environmental benefits assessment. Concerning the costs, a full discrimination of the abatement effort minimizes the total cost when the impact of polluters changes spatially, while a uniform effort can reach a pollution target in flexible ways. In this case, the increase of the degree of discrimination of the abatement effort is required only if it generates significant positive economies. Our theoretical and empirical results have shown that the discrimination advantage becomes insignificant for either very demanding or very little demanding ecological standards and varies according to the polluters' profile. In the case of "intermediate" standards, efficiency gains become negligible with a restricted number of effort "levels".

AB  - Humans gain multiple health benefits through contact with the green and blue parts of the world. However, many people do not have access to such places, including more than two million adults who are incarcerated. Building on studies that have shown positive emotional and mood effects when inmates in solitary confinement were exposed to nature videos featuring nonhuman built environments in their cellblocks, we measured physiological effects of interventions of nature visual imagery and sounds (from forests, mountains, streams, and ocean) on incarcerated adult males. We documented the following: (1) stimuli from nature media were able to decrease stress levels as measured by cortisol and galvanic skin response levels of stress or proxies for stress levels, (2) mode of delivery (audio vs. visual) differentially influenced some aspects of stress indicators, (3) exposure to nature stimuli evoked interest in learning more about the depicted habitats, and (4) different habitats elicited different responses. Participants reported, through written surveys, feeling more calm, less anxious, and less depressed after viewing nature videos and/or listening to nature sounds and stated little or no preference for visual versus audio stimuli. This type of intervention shows promise as fulfilling the goals of correctional administrators and those concerned with human mental and physical health of populations with little or no contact with the benefits of actual nature experiences. Findings from this study provide foundational information for future studies on different correctional populations, and other nature-deprived populations.

AB  - Economic development and the search for competitiveness have become key issues in regions' economic success. However, despite the direct relationship between economic and environmental management, few land-use plans consider the latter aspect, and city managers delegate the responsibility for environmental impacts to state legislation and private initiatives. This myopic search for competitiveness has meant that a holistic view of environmental issues is often not integrated into municipal decision-making processes. Therefore, this study's objective was to determine the relevant direct and indirect relationships of land management and budgetary procedures of municipalities with overall production levels of hazardous waste. To this end, a primary tourist region, Malaga, was examined in terms of how this waste's environmental impacts can affect the region's vital tourism sector. This research used principal component analysis, regression by ordinary least squares, cluster analysis in two stages and a means test to compare the data for the Province of Malaga's subregions.
   The results confirm a positive relationship between municipal expenditure and waste production and highlight the environmental benefits of land use involving environmentally non-aggressive crops. The results also reveal a negative relationship between waste production and financial assets and a direct relationship between unproductive land and the production of hazardous waste. The findings also highlight the necessity of raising awareness about the need for collaboration between different agents, especially in the development of inter-municipal strategies.

AB  - Data collected on zooplankton community composition over longer time periods (> 10 years) are rare. We examined among-lake spatial and temporal trends of zooplankton communities from a monitoring programme undertaken in the Waikato region, New Zealand. A total of 39 lakes were sampled over a period of 12 years, between 2007 and 2019, with varying degrees of temporal effort. We focussed particularly on eight lakes, considered here as 'long-term lakes', where samples were collected with greater regularity (including 5 with 12 years of data). Among lakes, suspended sediment concentrations and indicators of lake trophic state were inferred to be important in determining the zooplankton distributions; as this region is dominated by shallow lakes, the relative importance of suspended sediments was high. Among the long-term lakes, the greatest dissimilarities in zooplankton community composition among years were in Lake Waahi, where the AustralianBoeckella symmetricawas first detected in 2012. That is, the greatest temporal changes to zooplankton composition during the study period were due to the invasion by non-indigenous species, rather than changes in trophic state or other environmental variables; non-native species commonly dominated the individual counts of species through much of 2014 and 2015, with most samples since 2016 being again dominated by native species. Following this lake, the largest and shallowest lakes in the dataset-Whangape and Waikare-exhibited the greatest variability in community composition among years.

AB  - Phosphorus is an essential element for life and, when scarce, this macronutrient is a limiting factor for primary production. Phosphorus (P) is a widely used element in the composition of fertilizers, besides being present in large quantities in domestic effluents. Its accumulation in the springs is related to the proliferation of algae and cyanobacteria. In excess, P is a pollutant that contributes greatly to the eutrophication, development of reduced conditions and deterioration of water bodies. In order to understand how the anthropogenic action affected the accumulation of P in the freshwater reservoir of Salto Grande, Americana City (Sao Paulo State, Brazil), the evaluation of a temporal sedimentary record was carried out. For this purpose, a sediment core collected in the reservoir of Salto Grande was studied. The sediment core recorded the reservoir history since its filling in 1950. The comparison of P concentrations along the core with the population growth curve indicates that the population growth in the surrounding region has had a direct impact on the accumulation of P in the freshwater reservoir of Salto Grande. The eutrophication history of this major continental ecosystem of Sao Paulo State, was reflected by this sewage-derived from loading of P.

AB  - The article examines the hypothesis that the structure of the soil-like body in zero-point of its existence directs the dynamics and trajectory of soil formation. To test the hypothesis at the Dnepropetrovsk State Agricultural and Environmental University science satiation the field experiment was laid out lizymetres, each contain a constructive combination of rock or chornozem-like mass. It is shown that the design of the soil-like body in zero-point of its existence controls the dynamics and trajectory of soil formation. Philip equation was modified to more suitable simulate the infiltration process in tehnozems which allows to accurately describe the water absorption process at the infiltration and filtration stages. The nature of the underlying rocks located at a certain depth impacts significantly on the process of soil formation within the whole soil profile. Underlying rock layer regulates the processes of the tehnozems contact with the environment, as well as determining the intensity profile migration of moisture and dissolved salts. The presence of water resistant biogenic origin aggregates smoothes the varying density clay soils resulting from swelling and shrinkage processes that can maintain stable structure of the pore space. As a result, the soil after reclamation phase gets such features as reduced infiltration rate, but increased level of filtration. Optimal values of sorptivity and filtering corresponds closely with relevant properties of soil that can be investigated using indicators of the soil mechanical impedance. Uniformity preparation and impermeable aggregate structure determines the optimal functional modes of the tehnozemes.

AB  - This work is dedicated to the study of ecological and geochemical state of mountain-stepper landscapes of the OlkhonIsland, LakeBaikal, which are influenced by modern human-caused impact. The main goal of our research is the assessment of the soil pollution level caused by entry of heavy metals into soil cover. We studied the distribution of toxic elements such as Hg, As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, which is based on atomic absorption and X-ray fluorescence methodology. To evaluate the contamination of the soils examined, we appliedgeoecological indices used in ecological-geochemical assessment such as enrichment factor, contamination factor, degree of the contamination and pollution load index were applied. During the research, we made the following conclusions. The tests revealed the elevated contents of Cd, Co, Pb, Ni, Zn in the soils examined. Namely, the degree of the contamination for the mean metal contents in all five profiles (A, B, C, D, E) indicated moderate pollution level of the environment. The pollution load index for all profiles denoted that C profile was heavily polluted; A, B, D and E profiles were moderately polluted. Thus, the obtained primary results indicated the moderate soil pollution level at all profiles in the island. Finally, we emphasise that the increase of the contribution of metals from the anthropogenic sources in soils plays an important role in the environment of the island.

AB  - Currently, a central demand of coastal and marine food web researchers is the search for holistic and functional ecosystem health indicators. Based on concepts directly derived from R. L. Lindeman's work (Lindeman 1942; Ecology 23: 399-418), 6 estuarine food web models were analysed to assess the potential impact of multiple disturbances on the trophic state of food webs. The models described a Zostera noltii meadow and a bare sediment site in the Mondego estuary, Portugal, during 3 distinct time periods corresponding to (1) nutrient enrichment, (2) the implementation of mitigation measures, and (3) after a centenary flood. We tested 4 candidate metrics, directly derived from the trophic-dynamic concepts proposed by Lindeman (1942): food chain length, the detritivory/herbivory ratio, trophic efficiency per trophic level and mean trophic efficiency. Based on this case study, none of the metrics are yet ready to be used per se as operational metrics to quantify and interpret the impact of disturbances on the ecosystem's trophic state. Trophic efficiency appeared to be sensitive to external pressures. However, the mean trophic efficiency of the system might not be sufficient to draw conclusions about the trophic efficiency of the ecosystem: trophic efficiency should be observed at the trophic level in order to better understand cascading effects within food webs.

AB  - In 1995, a study entitled "Does Marriage Matter?" was published by Linda Waite in the journal of Demography, which was concerned with the direction of such causal relationships. While Waite's examination of the causal relationships associated with marriage, and most other analyses of this type, is primarily concerned with the individual level effects of marriage on a variety of outcomes, little is understood concerning the ecological effect of community marriage rates on levels of aggregate well-being. This study aims to contribute to this gap through the implementation of a recent conceptualization of social well-being as a multi-dimensional measure incorporating both biological, operationalized as average life expectancy, and social phenomena, operationalized as, community level crime rates (Raphael, Making the links: what do health promotion, crime prevention, and social development have in common? in 2004). It is important to understand such aggregate level effects in the face of the existing literature, which relies heavily on relational associations which could be subject to ecological fallacy. Analytic techniques incorporate Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis and spatial regression techniques, due to the high existence of spatial autocorrelation often evident in census data, as a way of understanding the effect of the aggregate level marriage rate on the constructed social well being indicator.

AB  - Monitoring results show that restoring river habitats at a site scale does not necessarily lead to an improvement of the biological state. It has been widely stated that neglecting processes acting at the catchment scale Such as diffuse nutrient or sediment Inputs and a low recolonization potential are possible reasons for the relatively small ecological effect of many restoration projects. However, information on the influence of intermediate spatial scales is missing. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of adjacent up- and downstream reaches on a site's ecological quality, as determined by the invertebrate fauna.
   We used invertebrate samples to assess the local ecological quality, land-use data to describe the land-use pressure ill the upstream catchment and hydromorphological data as a proxy for the ecological status of the adjacent up- and downstream reaches. In the stream type investigated, upstream morphology has a significant effect on local ecological status, even when local habitat quality at the sample sites and land-use pressure in the upstream catchment are considered as co-variables in multivariate statistical analysis. This upstream effect is due to a positive effect of near-natural reaches and a negative effect of heavily degraded reaches. The results indicate that upstream morphology is of similar importance to local habitat quality and is especially high in stream reaches with a medium local habitat quality. Since we used the morphological state upstream as a proxy for the ecological quality, we were not able to distinguish abiotic and biotic effects. However, there is some evidence that the upstream influence is at least partly due to biotic effects. We argue that this biotic effect is somewhat different from what is usually meant by recolonization or dispersal and is possibly due to the continuous input of a larger number of individuals.
   We conclude that a third spatial scale-the adjacent upstream reaches several hundred metres to a few kilometres in length-should be considered in stream restoration and management besides local habitat quality and catchment scale processes. This upstream effect might be used to enhance urban streams by restoring upstream rural reaches where the potential for stream restoration is higher. Moreover, the results can be used as a first estimate of the maximum distance between stepping stories or near-natural reaches to enhance the habitat connectivity.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Restless legs syndrome is a common neurologic disorder that is more prevalent in women than in men, and it has been suggested that female hormonesmay be involved in the disorder's pathophysiology.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether women who underwent premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy were at increased risk of restless legs syndrome.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study was performed using data from the Mayo Clinic Cohort Study of Oophorectomy and Aging-2 for a population in Olmsted County, Minnesota. There were 1653 women who underwent premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy before the age of 50 years for a benign indication between 1988 and 2007 and 1653 age-matched women (of same age plus or minus 1 year) in a reference group. Follow-up was conducted until the end of the study period (ie, December 31, 2014). Data were analyzed from January to July 2020.
   EXPOSURES Undergoing bilateral oophorectomy, as shown in medical record documentation.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Diagnosis of restless legs syndrome, as defined using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria, was recorded.
   RESULTS Among 3306 women, the median (interquartile range) age at baseline was 44.0 (40.0-47.0) years. Women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy, compared with women who did not undergo this procedure, had a greater number of chronic conditions at the index date (eg, 300 women [18.1%] vs 171 women [10.3%] with similar to 3 chronic conditions; overall P <.001), were more likely to have obesity (576women [34.8%] vs 442women [27.1%]; overall P <.001), andwere more likely to have a history of anemia of any type (573 women [34.7%] vs 225 women [13.6%]; P <.001), iron deficiency anemia (347women [21.0%] vs 135women [8.2%]; P <.001), and restless legs syndrome before the index date (32 women [1.9%] vs 14 women [0.8%]; P =.008). Women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy prior to natural menopause had a higher risk of restless legs syndrome after the index date compared with women in the reference group (120 diagnoses vs 74 diagnoses), with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.44 (95% CI, 1.08-1.92; P =.01). After stratification by indication for the bilateral oophorectomy, there was an increased risk of restless legs syndrome among women without a benign ovarian condition (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.03-2.25; P =.04) but not among women with a benign condition (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.80-1.96; P =.34). Treatment with estrogen therapy through the age of 46 years in women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy at younger ages was not associated with a difference in risk.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cohort study found that risk of restless legs syndrome was increased among women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy prior to menopause, especially those without a benign ovarian indication.

TI  - The wellbeing implications of a change in the sex-ratio of a population
T2  - SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE
LA  - English
AB  - It is often the case with socio-economic, or development-related, indicators that these are explicitly in the nature of 'wellbeing' or 'illbeing' indicators, such that increases in their values are routinely interpreted as reflecting 'improvements' or 'deteriorations', as the case may be. The sex-ratio of a population is one such indicator: an over-time reduction in the value of this statistic is generally regarded as pointing to a worsening in the relative wellbeing of women. This paper argues that summary real-valued socio-economic measures are largely in the nature of end-state descriptions, and not always completely reliable guides to the processes underlying their realization. This is also true for the sex-ratio measure. The paper points to the utility of decomposing a given change in the sex-ratio of a population into changes in its constituent and determining factors. In particular, the sex-ratio can be seen to be determined by the prior history of sex-ratios at birth and the prior history of the relative survival advantage of females. The magnitude and direction of changes in these determining factors are pointers to the processes that have mediated the change in the aggregate sex-ratio, and therefore pointers to whether the sex-ratio change-independently of the direction of change-may be interpreted in developmentally favourable or unfavourable terms. The issues underlying these considerations are illustrated through the use of relevant demographic data for India.

AB  - Traffic-related air pollutants have been associated with adverse health effects. We hypothesized that exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), elemental carbon (EC, diesel indicator), particulate matter (PM2.5), and a suite of metals declined from 1998 to 2006 in NYC due to policy interventions. PAH levels from personal monitoring of pregnant mothers participating in the Columbia's Center for Children's Environmental Health birth cohort study, and EC, PM2.5, and metal data from five New York State Department of Environmental Conservation stationary monitors were compared across sites and over time (1998-2006). Univariate analysis showed a decrease in personal PAHs exposures from 1998 to 2006 (p < 0.0001). After controlling for environmental tobacco smoke, indoor heat, and cooking, year of personal monitoring remained a predictor of decline in Sigma(8)PAHs (beta = -0.269, p < 0.001). Linear trend analysis also suggested that PM2.5 declined (p = 0.09). Concentrations of EC and most metals measured by stationary site monitors, as measured by ANOVA, did not decline. Across stationary sites, levels of airborne EC and metals varied considerably. By contrast PM2.5 levels were highly intercorrelated (values ranged from 0.725 to 0.922, p < 0.01). Further policy initiatives targeting traffic-related air pollutants may be needed for a greater impact on public health.

AB  - A mass-balance trophic model for Zuari, a monsoon-influenced tropical Indian estuary, was constructed to understand trophic organization, to measure the ecosystem indicators and to assess the state of the ecosystem maturity and stability. Twenty-two functional groups were identified in the model starting from primary producers (trophic level = 1) to top predators (trophic level = 4.7). The estuarine food web is controlled by bottom-up control based on primary producers and detritus. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, clupeids & anchovies and heterotrophic benthos were observed as keystone species in the food web. A higher total system throughput (23333.9 t km(-2) year(-1)), and lower dimensions for recycling capacity (Finn's cycling index: 2.78 %), system omnivory index (0.25), and relative ascendency (39.9 %) were observed. Based on the ecosystem indices, Zuari estuary is relatively small, and developing ecosystem, which is resilient to the external disturbances on the system. This trophic model is the first Ecopath model for tropical monsoonal estuaries and fourth model for the estuaries along the Indian coast. The Zuari estuary model showed resemblance to the sub-tropical and tropical estuarine Ecopath models and differed from estuaries of India and temperate estuaries. This Ecopath model would be also useful for simulating the variations in trophic flows and biomass for functional groups under the impact of fishing and anthropogenic activities on the ecosystem.

AB  - Conservation practices are regularly implemented within agricultural watersheds throughout the United States without evaluating their ecological impacts. Impact assessments documenting how habitat and aquatic biota within streams respond to these practices are needed for evaluating the effects of conservation practices. Numerous sampling protocols have been developed for monitoring streams. However, protocols designed for monitoring studies are not appropriate for impact assessments. We developed guiding principles for designing impact assessments of ecological responses to conservation practices. The guiding principles are as follows: (1) develop the hypothesis first, (2) use replicated experimental designs having controls and treatments, (3) assess the habitat and biological characteristics with quantitative and repeatable sampling methods, (4) use multiple sampling techniques for collecting aquatic organisms, and (5) standardize sampling efforts for aquatic organisms. The guiding principles were applied in designing a study intended to evaluate the influence of herbaceous riparian buffers on channelized headwater streams in central Ohio. Our example highlights that the application of our recommendations will result in impact assessments that are hypothesis-driven and incorporate quantitative methods for the measurement of abiotic and biotic attributes.

AB  - Despite its good environmental track record, the Finnish forest industry nonetheless causes harmful environmental impacts. This paper studies corporate environmental reports within the Finnish forest industry to determine the environmental performance of the industry at large. Fifteen years of environmental reports from the three biggest Finnish forest industry companies are analysed. The majority of these reports focus on inputs needed for production (especially energy) and unwanted outputs (especially air and water emissions) in the industry. The environmental impacts in areas of the industry taking place outside of mills, however, are less often reported and appear to be less important to the companies. This paper makes five contributions to the literature: First, the forest industry's reporting, as a less researched field, is studied in detail. Second, the forest industry's environmental reporting is diverse, comprised of multiple indicators and units of measurement. Third, the energy indicator reporting is both established and diversified. The diversity makes the reports as a weak source of comparison of environmental performance. Fourth, the case companies seldom report the environmental performance of their supply chains. Fifth, while the prior literature has analysed multiple environmental impacts of the forest industry, the case companies report on very few of them. The paper concludes by stating that future environmental reporting should especially address supply chains and multiple environmental impacts caused by the industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: The lifestyle of every human being, to a large extent, determines their health. Whatever young individuals do in their adult lives is extremely important for themselves and the next generations.
   Aim of the research: To investigate the relationship between health-related lifestyle and the quality of life of girls in light of the KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaire.
   Material and methods: The study involved 122 girls with menstrual disorders from rural and urban areas and 240 girls without any health or developmental disorders. It was conducted on patients of the Public Gynaecological Clinic for Girls in Kielce and girls attending primary and middle schools. A diagnostic survey was used including the following research tools: KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaire, authors' survey, body mass index, and Rohrer Index.
   Results: The quality of life and health of girls with menstrual disorders (group I) and girls without any health or development disorders (group II) both from rural and urban areas was assessed. Taking into account variables such as age and the living environment, it was stated that younger girls (13-14 years old) from groups I and II generally perceive their health as worse (p < 0.001). Whereas, among older girls in both groups I and II (15-16 years old), a larger percentage of respondents perceive themselves in a positive way, which results in higher self-assessment in health.
   Conclusions: The application of subjective health indicators in the assessment of quality of life relating to adolescence allows us to determine disease and malpractice in the care of the population in developmental age.

AB  - In an ecosystem-based resource management context, it is crucial to assess the relationships between community structure and ecosystem function and how those relationships change with resource extraction. To elucidate how changes in resource use can affect community structure and ecosystem function, we executed a comparative analysis of two different ecosystems subjected to notable fishing pressure. We contrasted the Northern Adriatic Sea (NAS) and Southern New England (SNE) ecosystems by examining outputs from comparable steady-state models. Both ecosystems have relatively high fishing pressure and a high biomass of benthic invertebrates. The basic structure of the food webs shows differences both in the number and definition of the functional groups, as described in the models. Fisheries, on the contrary, show similarities both in terms of catches and discards. Almost all statistics summarizing the structure and flows showed values three times higher in the SNE than in the NAS ecosystem, but despite this difference the two ecosystems exhibited similar, overall properties. Biomass ratios and the Mixed Trophic Impact (MTI) analysis showed that both ecosystems are dominated by the benthic compartment. Removing the biomass effect, however, shows a clear top-down effect, with a high rank achieved by fishing activities. In general terms, the low mean trophic level of catches and the high primary production required (PPR) values result in a high overexploitation level of the ecosystem. as highlighted by the L index. We conclude by exploring how comparative studies will continue to be valuable as ecosystem-based management is further implemented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The functional grouping concept, which suggests that complexity in ecosystem function can be simplified by grouping species with similar responses, was tested in the Florida scrub habitat. Functional groups were identified based on how species regulate exchange of carbon and water with the atmosphere as indicated by both instantaneous gas exchange measurements and integrated measures of function (%N, delta C-13, delta N-15, C:N ratio) in fire-maintained Florida scrub, which was considered the natural state for scrub habitat. Using cluster analysis, five distinct physiologically based functional groups were identified in the fire-maintained scrub and were determined to be distinct clusters and not just arbitrary divisions in a continuous distribution by the non-parametric multivariate analysis of similarities (ANOSIM; R=0.649, P=0.005). These functional groups were tested for robustness spatially, temporally, and with management regime using ANOSIM. The physiological functional groups remained distinct clusters in this broader array of sites (R=0.794, P=0.001) and were not altered by plot differences, primarily, water table depth (R=-0.115, P=0.893) or by the three different management regimes: prescribed burn, mechanically treated and burned, and fire-suppressed (R=0.0 18, P=0.349). The physiological groupings also remained robust between the two climatically different years, with 1999 being a much wetter year than 2000 (R=-0.027, P=0.725). Easy-to-measure morphological characteristics, if they indicate the same functional groups, would be more practical for scaling and modeling ecosystem processes than detailed gas exchange measurements; therefore, we tested a variety of morphological characteristics as functional indicators. A combination of non-parametric multivariate techniques were used to compare the ability of life form, leaf thickness (LT), and specific leaf area (SLA) classifications to identify the physiologically based functional groups. Life form classifications (ANOSIM; R=0.629, P=0.001) were able to depict the physiological groupings more adequately than either SLA (ANOSIM; R=0.426, P=0.001) or LT (ANOSIM; R=0.344, P=0.001). The ability of life forms to depict the physiological groupings was improved by separating the parasitic Ximenia americana from the shrub category (ANOSIM; R=0.794, P=0.001). Therefore, a life form classification including parasites was determined to be a good indicator of the physiological processes of scrub species and would be a useful method of grouping species for scaling physiological processes to the ecosystem level.

AB  - In order for policy makers to plan effectively for sustainable development, there is a need for measures of welfare that consider changes in the natural capital stock. Current measures based on conventional national accounting are flawed because they are based solely on flow measures and do not account for environmental effects. In this paper, we use an expanded measure of wealth to estimate the value of natural capital for Queensland. The state's stock of natural capital is valued at A$355.6 billion, of which non-timber forest resources account for 45.3%, ecosystem services 20.0%, and mineral resources 17.6%. This figure is a conservative estimate of the true value since some significant components such as the ecological and life-support functions of the environment are excluded. The estimates highlight the relative importance of different forms of natural capital and can be used to draw the attention of policymakers to the need to give adequate weight to the value of such services in decision-making processes.

AB  - At present, to solve the problem of the life quality of the population has become an integral criterion for evaluating the effectiveness and success of the state's socio-economic policy. The appeal to the study of the quality of life among young people in its objective, subjective and person's aspects is determined by the fact that youth as a social group differs from other groups of the population. It is more active, has relevant knowledge and skills, an accelerated adaptation process, greater migration mobility and material needs. It faces the task of self-determination in socio-economic and political changes and the choice of life orientations.
   The aim is to determine the contribution of personal resources to the subjective assessment of the quality of life among representatives of socio-demographic youth groups with different perceptions of self-realization opportunities in living conditions. The research is based on the newly developed conceptual working model of the quality of life by D.A. Leontiev (2020), which integrates objective, subjective and person's factors of environmental assessment.
   The methods used are: the questionnaire "Quality of life and satisfaction", "Life satisfaction scale, "Self-realization satisfaction index in living conditions", questionnaire "Self-organization activity", questionnaire "Differential diagnosis of reflexivity ", "Self-determination of personality and basic beliefs" scale. Sample is 280 people aged 18 to 40 years, including 140 people living in the rural municipality of the North of the Tomsk region (Siberian region), and 140 residents of the city of Tomsk.
   As a result, we have found out that there is some general dissatisfaction with the quality of life, but the representatives of rural youth are less satisfied with the quality of their lives than the representatives of urban working youth. Personal resources are significantly more pronounced in the urban working youth group; many representatives of rural youth have deficits in personal resources. It is revealed that such a personal resource as self-identity can mediate the impact of assessing the opportunities for self-realization in environmental conditions on the quality of life among urban and rural youth. At the same time, we have identified specific personal resources that can serve as mediators in assessing opportunities for self-realization in living conditions and the quality of life among urban and rural youth. However, a small percentage of variance indicates the need to refine the results and include new personal resources in the search for mediators of this relationship. The data revealed in both groups on the mediation nature of assessing the possibility of self-realization in living conditions indicate the importance of creating conditions for self-realization for young people, both in urban and rural living environments.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are influenced by water quality and the surrounding environment, and changes to such ecosystems exert an effect on species. The aim of the present study was to relate the composition/abundance of species of aquatic ferns to both abiotic factors of water quality (total phosphorus and chlorophyll a) and the characteristics of the surrounding environment (rural, urban and vegetation). We analyzed 53 aquatic ecosystems in the state of Paraiba with lentic characteristics, considering total phosphorus and chlorophyll a as well as the classification of land use and occupation in the surrounding areas. We recorded nine species of aquatic ferns, which demonstrated a preference for environments with good water quality (low concentration of chlorophyll a) as well as sensitivity to rural and urban activities. The individual analysis of the species revealed that abiotic factors exerted an influence on the occurrence and abundance of the species. Cyclosorus interruptus (Willd.) H. Ito proved to be resistant to impacted environments, whereas Marsilea sp. and Ceratopteris thalictroides (L.) Brongn proved to be bioindicators of water quality. Our study revealed species considered bioindicators of good water quality and identified changes in the composition/abundance of the species in relation to different land uses.

AB  - Mainstreaming ecosystem services into policy and decision making is dependent on the availability of spatially explicit information on the state and trends of ecosystems and their services. In particular, the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 addresses the need to account for ecosystem services through biophysical mapping and valuation. This paper reviews current mapping methods, identifies current knowledge gaps and provides the elements for a methodological framework for mapping and assessing ecosystems and their services at European scale. Current mapping methodologies go beyond purely land cover based assessments and include the use of primary data of ecosystem services, the use of functional traits to map ecosystem services and the development of models and ecological production functions. Additional research is needed to cover marine ecosystems and to include the resilience of ecosystems to environmental change in spatially explicit assessments. The ecosystem services cascade which connects ecosystems to human wellbeing is argued to provide a suitable, stepwise framework for mapping ecosystem services in order to support EU policies in a more effective way. We demonstrate the use of this framework for mapping using the water purification service as case. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. Recent assessments of progress towards global conservation targets have revealed a paucity of indicators suitable for assessing the changing state of ecosystems. Moreover, land managers and planners are often unable to gain timely access to the maps they need to support their routine decision-making. This deficiency is partly due to a lack of suitable data on ecosystem change, driven mostly by the considerable technical expertise needed to develop ecosystem maps from remote sensing data.
   2. We have developed a free and open-access online remote sensing and environmental modelling application, the Remote Ecosystem Monitoring and Assessment Pipeline (Remap; ), that enables volunteers, managers and scientists with little or no experience in remote sensing to generate classifications (maps) of land cover and land use change over time.
   3. Remap utilizes the geospatial data storage and analysis capacity of Google Earth Engine and requires only spatially resolved training data that define map classes of interest (e.g. ecosystem types). The training data, which can be uploaded or annotated interactively within Remap, are used in a random forest classification of up to 13 publicly available predictor datasets to assign all pixels in a focal region to map classes. Predictor datasets available in Remap represent topographic (e.g. slope, elevation), spectral (archival Landsat image composites) and climatic variables (precipitation, temperature) that are relevant to the distribution of ecosystems and land cover classes.
   4. The ability of Remap to develop and export high-quality classified maps in a very short (<10 min) time frame represents a considerable advance towards globally accessible and free application of remote sensing technology. By enabling access to data and simplifying remote sensing classifications, Remap can catalyse the monitoring of land use and change to support environmental conservation, including developing inventories of biodiversity, identifying hotspots of ecosystem diversity, ecosystem-based spatial conservation planning, mapping ecosystem loss at local scales and supporting environmental education initiatives.

AB  - The territory of Serbia is vulnerable to various types of natural hazards and the risk is not equal across the entire territory, it varies depending on the type of hazard and the expected potential for damage. The first aim of this research was to determine the geographical distributions of the major types of natural hazards. Seismic hazards, landslides, rock falls, floods, torrential floods, excessive erosion, droughts and forest fires are the most significant natural hazards within the territory of Serbia. Areas vulnerable to some of these natural hazards were singled out using analytical maps; their area relative to the total area of Serbia was defined, along with the total surface area that is vulnerable to each type of natural hazard. Upper intensity values for single natural hazards were measured; these values represent the limiting factor for land-use planning at the given level. Based on these analyses, an integral map of the natural hazards of the territory was created using multi-hazard assessment. Hence, a recent state of the natural hazard vulnerabilities of the territory of Serbia was created and then an integral map was made. The integral map showed spatial distribution of the different types of hazards that are considered to be limiting factors for the highest level of land-use planning. The results presented in this article are the first mufti-hazard assessment and the fast version of the integral map of natural hazards distribution in Serbia for land-use planning, which is important both nationally and regionally.

TI  - Intergovernmental influences on the implementation of coastal zone management in the United States: Public shoreline access in the Southeast
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
KW  - BEACH ACCESS
AB  - This article is about factors that influence local government implementation of state coastal policies with specific application to public shoreline access. Although the national government delegates authority for coastal zone management to state governments, local jurisdictions are ultimately responsible for public shoreline access program implementation. Local budgets provide the funds and staff that impact public access development in addition to daily maintenance of public access sites. However, since local governments are creatures of the state, local implementation naturally involves a reciprocal relationship with state governments. Local governments get grants and technical support from state governments while the states get successful state policy implementation at the local level. Previous shoreline public access evaluations only reviewed how well each state agency met federal objectives. Such evaluations gave little attention to local government programs, despite acknowledging that local governments are the "primary implementers of state coastal policies and programs" through the use of land use powers and infrastructure improvements. Understanding; of local government's relationship with state agencies is an essential ingredient for the formulation of public shoreline access programs and to gain insight into national coastal policy success and failure.
   Forty-five local public shoreline access programs were examined in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida. Although no single indicator explained local compliance with state public beach access policy; selected economic, political and demographic variables were statistically associated with compliance. Public officials and others interested in shoreline access need to be aware of how such capacities can influence policy implementation. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Marine aquaculture is an important growing worldwide industry. An ecosystem approach to study the effects of aquaculture on the Aranci Bay (Sardinia, Italy) was implemented by using a trophic mass-balance model in order to estimate the potential effects of finfish aquaculture and, therefore, to identify the species playing a key-role in ecosystem. Additionally, this study was used to evaluate the conflict between top predators and aquaculture. Mass-balance models were built using Ecopath software to characterize and compare the present state of the ecosystem versus a reconstructed past model representing the bay before the start of aquaculture activities. This modelling approach to the study of the fish farm activities in Aranci Bay has shown its appropriateness to describe the modifications induced, at an ecosystem level, by the nutrient loading into the area. increased nutrient loading into the fish farm area may result in greater biological activity and may induce a strong coupling between the pelagic and benthic subsystems. Based on the results, the possible effect of top predators in the fish farm activities is not substantial. Furthermore, the use of mass-balance models can provide important additional information, complementary to the normal environmental assessment impact studies, before starting fish farm activities in an area.

AB  - This paper investigates the use of the vegetative state of natural covers as an indicator of soil moisture conditions at the end of the dry season in order to evaluate the cumulative effect of the hydrological regime. To achieve this, the three major vegetation covers in a mountainous semiarid environment in southern Spain were selected. Temporal and spatial trends of NDVI from Landsat-TM images were computed and related to the different hydrological patterns of variables in the study site, which were obtained with the hydrological WiMMed model. The heterogeneity in the hydrological behavior during the study period (914.5 mm of annual rainfall in the wettest year (2009-2010) and 284.4 mm in the driest year (2004-2005)) was reflected in the annual differences in NDVI values with steady mean NDVI values in coniferous vegetation (0.5-0.6) and more variable values in scrub cover. Both Correlation Analysis and Principal Component Analysis showed correlations among the different states of the vegetation cover, the variables involved in the soil water balance and those related to the snow dynamics of the antecedent year. Exponential fits were obtained between the mean annual soil water content and NDVI values with Pearson r(2) coefficients of over 0.7 in scrub cover. In certain years, the best fits were also found in scrub cover with r(2) values of up to 0.9. These results demonstrate the relationship between soil water content, the vigor of the natural vegetation and the hydrological characteristics of the antecedent year. The expressions obtained may serve to adjust the soil water content at the beginning of a hydrological year and to use the scrub cover as an indicator of the soil water balance in the area for a given year.

AB  - Through its important role in the formation of particulate matter, atmospheric ammonia affects air quality and has implications for human health and life expectancy(1,2). Excess ammonia in the environment also contributes to the acidification and eutrophication of ecosystems(3-5) and to climate change(6). Anthropogenic emissions dominate natural ones and mostly originate from agricultural, domestic and industrial activities(7). However, the total ammonia budget and the attribution of emissions to specific sources remain highly uncertain across different spatial scales(7-9). Here we identify, categorize and quantify the world's ammonia emission hotspots using a high-resolution map of atmospheric ammonia obtained from almost a decade of daily IASI satellite observations. We report 248 hotspots with diameters smaller than 50 kilometres, which we associate with either a single point source or a cluster of agricultural and industrial point sources-with the exception of one hotspot, which can be traced back to a natural source. The state-of-the-art EDGAR emission inventory(10) mostly agrees with satellite-derived emission fluxes within a factor of three for larger regions. However, it does not adequately represent the majority of point sources that we identified and underestimates the emissions of two-thirds of them by at least one order of magnitude. Industrial emitters in particular are often found to be displaced or missing. Our results suggest that it is necessary to completely revisit the emission inventories of anthropogenic ammonia sources and to account for the rapid evolution of such sources over time. This will lead to better health and environmental impact assessments of atmospheric ammonia and the implementation of suitable nitrogen management strategies.

AB  - Three trophic mass-balance models representing coral reef ecosystems along a fishery gradient were compared to evaluate ecosystem effects of fishing. The majority of the biomass estimates came directly from a large-scale visual survey program; therefore, data were collected in the same way for all three models, enhancing comparability. Model outputs-such as net system production, size structure of the community, total throughput, production, consumption, production-to-respiration ratio, and Finn's cycling index and mean path length-indicate that the systems around the unpopulated French Frigate Shoals and along the relatively lightly populated Kona Coast of Hawai'i Island are mature, stable systems with a high efficiency in recycling of biomass. In contrast, model results show that the reef system around the most populated island in the State of Hawai'i, O'ahu, is in a transitional state with reduced ecosystem resilience and appears to be shifting to an algal-dominated system. Evaluation of the candidate indicators for fishing pressure showed that indicators at the community level (e. g., total biomass, community size structure, trophic level of the community) were most robust (i.e., showed the clearest trend) and that multiple indicators are necessary to identify fishing perturbations. These indicators could be used as performance indicators when compared to a baseline for management purposes. This study shows that ecosystem models can be valuable tools in identification of the system state in terms of complexity, stability, and resilience and, therefore, can complement biological metrics currently used by monitoring programs as indicators for coral reef status. Moreover, ecosystem models can improve our understanding of a system's internal structure that can be used to support management in identification of approaches to reverse unfavorable states.

AB  - In this paper, the authors use remote-sensing images to monitor the water quality of reservoirs located in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil. Sentinel-2 MSI TOA Level 1C reflectance images were used to remotely estimate the concentration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), the main indicator of the trophic state of aquatic environments, in five reservoirs in the state of Ceara, Brazil. A three-spectral band retrieval model was calibrated using 171 water samples, collected from November 2015 through July 2018 in 5 reservoirs. For validation, 71 additional samples, collected from August 2018 through December 2019, were used to ensure a robust accuracy assessment. The TOA Level 1C products performed very well, achieving a relative RMSE of 28% and R-2 = 0.80. Data on wind direction and speed, solar radiation and reservoir volume were used to generate a conceptual model to analyze the behavior of chl-a in the surface waters of the Castanhao reservoir. During 2019, the reservoir water quality showed strong variation, with concentration fluctuating from 30 to 95 mu g/L We showed that the end of the dry season is marked by strong eutrophic conditions corresponding to very low water inflows into the reservoir. During the rainy season there is a large decrease in the chl-a concentration following the increase of the lake water storage. During the following dry season, satellite data show a progressive improvement of the trophic state controlled by wind intensity that promotes a better mixing of the reservoir waters and inhibiting the development of most phytoplankton.

AB  - Dissolved O-2 is an important aquatic ecosystem health indicator. Metabolic and gas exchange (G) rates, which control O-2 concentration, are affected by nutrient loading and other environmental factors. Traditionally, aquatic metabolism has been reported as primary production:community respiration (P:R) ratios using diel measurements and interpretations of dissolved O-2 and/or CO2 concentrations, and recently using stable isotopes (delta O-18, Delta P-17) and steady state assumptions. Aquatic ecosystems, such as rivers and ponds, are not at steady state and exhibit diel changes, so steady state approaches are often inappropriate. A dynamic O-2 stable isotope model (photosynthesis-respiration-gas exchange; PoRGy) is presented here, requiring a minimum of parameters to quantify daily averaged P, R, and G rates under transient field conditions. Unlike steady state approaches, PoRGy can address scenarios with 100% O-2 saturation but with delta O-18-O-2 values that are not at air equilibrium. PoRGy successfully accounts for isotopic G when applied to an oxygen isotope equilibration laboratory experiment. PoRGy model results closely matched the diel O-2 and delta O-18-O-2 data from three field sites with different P:R:G ratios and various P, R and G rates. PoRGy provides a new research tool to assess ecosystem health and to pose environmental impact-driven questions. Using daily averaged rates was successful and thus they can be used to compare ecosystems across seasons and landscapes.

AB  - Sustainability was estimated through a Sustainable Capacity Index defined as the combination of three aspects (state of the environment, quality of life of the human population, and pressure applied by human activities), used as a guideline for the differentiation of sustainability situations. We identified five different municipality groups, in terms of sustainability, as well as two thresholds, beyond which sustainable capacity was not present: below the sustainable capacity lower threshold, close to the sustainable capacity threshold, optimum situation, close to the sustainable capacity higher threshold, and above the sustainable capacity higher threshold. In general Mexico was found to be in an apparent balanced situation, in the sense that it is not overweighed around extreme values, the majority of the coastal municipalities falling in the optimum sustainable situation, within the cross comparison, characterized by medium coastal cities. We can conclude that Mexico has reached a critical point where it has to decide about the direction its coastal development has to take, since our results suggest that Mexican's municipalities are half way to sustainability. The ideal situation would be that the optimum situation would maintain its actual low pressure with high state, but could increase its quality of life. This work provided a rapid monitoring and cross comparison tool for an estimation of the sustainable situation of Mexico's coasts, repeatable in time, and in phase with the recent national coastal zone management principles and strategies.

AB  - Excess energy dissipation pathways (heat and fluorescence) were monitored, at leaf level as indicators of plant physiological status, with field spectroscopy techniques on poplar clones subjected to ozone fumigation. Measurements of spectral radiance emerging from a leaf provide a fast, non-destructive method for the assessment of excess energy dissipation: xanthophyll-related heat dissipation was estimated with the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) calculated from a traditional field spectrometer, and steady-state fluorescence (Fs) under natural illumination conditions was estimated by exploiting a variation of the Fraunhofer line-depth principle, where the radiance collected with very high resolution spectrometers (FWHM = 0.13 nm) was spectrally modelled. Both remotely-sensed dissipation pathways responded to fumigation. During a 26-day fumigation experiment, four diurnal cycles of spectral measurements were collected in parallel to meteorological and key physiological variables (active fluorescence, net photosynthesis) and leaf sample collection for pigment extraction. We outline evidence of a link between the remotely-sensed Fs and PRI and leaf physiological status. These results open up new possibilities for assessment of plant stress by means of hyperspectral remote sensing.

AB  - Two landscape evaluation approaches, an integrated model and an ecological analysis method, based on landscape elements and environmental quality, respectively, were used to describe land desertification in the Heihe River Basin of northwestern China, by evaluating the current state of the local ecosystems and environment. Based on national water-quality criteria and fuzzy cluster analysis methods, surface water quality was divided into 5 grades with corresponding evaluation scores (evaluation rating threshold of water pollution), while groundwater quality was divided into 5 grades based on salinity and solute chemistry. For grassland ecosystems, grass yield (biomass) and types were the main indicators used. The soil component was described according to factors including its nutrient content, thickness, texture and degree of desertification, for a total of 11 evaluation indicators. Total vegetation cover is one of the 5 indicators chosen to describe the plant ecosystem. Based on conditions currently prevailing in the study region, evaluation factors such as total output value of agricultural, industrial, forestry and animal husbandry activities, the ratio of irrigation area to farmland area, the mean output return per unit area farmland, the level of education and per capital income were selected among others to characterize the social and economic situation. In total, 32 typical environment evaluation factors were selected, classifying land desertification in the region into four zones.

AB  - Ecosystem-based fishery management requires operating models that are capable of evaluating the effects of a triad of drivers (exploitation, ecological interactions, and the physical environment) on fish populations. We present a simple operating model, AGG-PROD, that takes into account these drivers. AGG-PROD aggregates species into functional groups and applies exploitation rates to these groups, while accounting for the interactions between these groups and the environment. We loosely modeled the Northeast US Large Marine Ecosystem fish community, exploring a range of harvest, ecological interactions (competition and predation), and climate effects scenarios. We examined the independent effects of each of the triad of drivers at their base levels on the 3 main functional groups. We then explored the effects of targeted harvest on specific functional groups as well as different levels of total system harvest, both with and without climate effects. Our results indicate that the triad of drivers can lead to unanticipated, indirect effects on groups of species, and that all 3 should be taken into account by an operating model in a Management Strategy Evaluation context. Harvest tends to affect groups with a slower overall growth rate the most, while groups affected by strong ecological interactions often exhibit strong competitive or predatory release when other groups are reduced in biomass. Climate effects reduce primarily the biomass of groundfishes in our model, indicating the need for more conservative exploitation under future climate projections.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The requirements of stakeholders for the qualitative transformation of the approaches of industrial enterprises - environmental users to introduction of economic activities cause an increase in the role of environmental responsibility as their strategic priority for development. The purpose of the study is to improve the practical tools for calculating and developing strategies for the development of environmental responsibility of industrial enterprises.
   METHODS: In the study, tools for assessing the level of environmental initiative of an industrial enterprise as an integrated indicator of environmental initiative are suggested. It is expressed as the arithmetic mean of ten factors of environmentally proactive behavior of industrial enterprises. To achieve the objectives of the study, methods of criterion-qualitative assessment are suggested, such as expert assessment and survey. The assessment system includes ten factors rated on a 10-point scale and weighted by significance. The integrated indicator of the environmental initiative acquires values within, is a stimulant of environmental responsibility.
   FINDINGS: One justified a scientific and methodological approach to assessing the level of environmental responsibility or the industrial enterprise, including calculation of the corresponding taxonomic indicator with consideration of the quantitative factors of its environmental responsibility and the qualitative and quantitative factors of environmental initiative. This enables the possibility to assess the relevant state of environmental responsibility and determine the volumes for further correction of the ecological strategy for the development of the industrial enterprise.
   CONCLUSION: As a conclusion, practical recommendations are made for the implementation of organizational and economic support of environmental responsibility in the development strategy of an industrial enterprise taking into account the impact of its environmental initiative and environmental duty. The level of environmental responsibility of industrial enterprises taken into account when developing recommendations on adjustment of their environmental strategy of development is determined, which as a whole allowed to form organizational and economic support for environmental responsibility of the enterprises under study. Thus, an enterprise, which only ensures compliance with environmental emission standards (compensation strategy or sufficiency strategy) cannot be characterized by a high level of environmental responsibility. To ensure a high level of environmental responsibility, an industrial enterprise must rely on a proactive strategy or a strategy for sustainable use of nature. (C) 2021 GJESM. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benthic vegetation is arguably one of the most important indicators of the state of marine environment. Assessment of the status of eelgrass (Zostera marina) is commonly done using various remote sensing methods such as aerial photography or satellite images. These methods often fail to capture the true scenario beneath the surface of the water if the water is turbid or the satellite image is masked by cloud cover which makes it impossible to see beneath them. As a second line of defense, researchers have used under water videos (obtained either with scuba,snorkel or other visual observations) to assess the ground truth. Lots of man-hours are spent browsing through many hours of video data manually by an expert and assessing the status (presence/absence) which is a very common practice. Here we propose two methods for detection of eelgrass (presence/absence) from under water videos obtained from Roskilde Fjord in Denmark. We extend these methods to show that it can be used as a proxy to estimate coverage of eelgrass in a given area which match well with an expert's estimation. The benefit of using this method is that it is objective, less biased, cost efficient, robust to noisy environment, does not require pixel-level annotated ground truth images and can be used on existing video transects. This method can also detect rare errors from domain expert's visual estimation.

AB  - This study considers the restoration of the plant cover destroyed by a catastrophic volcano eruption in the south of Kamchatka Peninsula (the Ksudach caldera, Shtyubel cone), with a particular attention to the role of woody plants. It aims to qualitatively estimate (at a qualitative level) the rate of the primary succession development depending on the microrelief and the modern relief-forming processes. The vegetation recovery in the caldera after the Shtyubel cone eruption 109 years ago proceeds slowly and irregularly. It proceeds most slowly on a thick tephra mantle continuously disturbed by water and wind erosion, lahars, debris flows, landslides, etc. Such conditions are most typical of the western part of the caldera dominated by pumice fields with occasional patches of pioneer herbs and dwarf shrubs. Alpine tundra communities with gradually expanding patches of shrub alder develop in the southern, eastern and northeastern parts of the Ksudach caldera. Since 1997 the area of the shrub alder communities has increased by 1.9 times, while the alpine tundra - by 1.3 times only. The woody plants (dwarf shrubs and prostrate shrubs) are of particular importance in the process of the vegetation recovery on pumice fields. We suggest that the bark thickness of woody plants is an integrated indicator, which may serve for estimating the state of ecosystem in the course of the primary succession development on juvenile sediments. The extremely inhospitable environments cause changes in physiological processes in the plant body and in its bark in particular. The results show that woody plants have a "thin" bark and develop some structural-functional arrangements for keeping bark tissues at their minimum. So, the woody plant structure and the rate of changes in plant communities are under control of the geomorphic conditions and primarily - of physicochemical features of the pyroclastic cover.

AB  - In this paper a strategy is proposed to reduce the complexity of the activated sludge model no. 1 (ASM1) which describes the biotransformation processes in a common activated sludge process with N-removal. The key feature of the obtained reduced model is that it combines high predictive value (all state variables keep their biological interpretation) with very low computation time. Therefore, this model is a valuable tool in a risk assessment environment (designed for the evaluation of wastewater treatment plants facing stricter effluent norms) as well as in on-line (MPC) control strategies. The complexity reduction procedure consists of four steps. In the first step representative input/output data sets are generated by simulating the full ASM1 model. In the second step the ASM1 model is rewritten in state space format with linear approximations of the nonlinear (kinetic) terms. In the third step the unknown parameters in the linear terms are identified based on the generated input/output data. To reduce the amount of parameter sets that have to be identified (to cover the full operation range of the plant), a Multi-Model interpolation procedure is introduced as a last step.

AB  - New approaches to choice modeling which aim at increasing model realism through increased model complexity to capture different aspects of human behavior and latent psychological constructs have been increasingly applied in recent transportation research efforts. One of the most recent approaches is the inclusion of happiness or satisfaction indicators which function as measures of utility. In previous work using revealed preference data, adding satisfaction indicators resulted in gains in efficiency.
   This paper explores whether gains in efficiency also hold in a stated preference context of mode choice where the data is more controlled and the satisfaction that is measured includes both satisfaction with a usual commuting mode and expected satisfaction for a non-routine commuting mode. The paper also tests whether gains in efficiency lead to any improvements in prediction accuracy. Finally, the paper also presents a scenario analysis for the prediction of changes in satisfaction as a function of changes in car and bus attributes.
   The results indicate that the addition of satisfaction indicators to the model indeed improve model efficiency in line with other findings from previous research utilizing the same framework. Such findings encourage choice modelers to collect satisfaction indicators in revealed and stated preferences surveys and to subsequently include these indicators in choice models to increase model efficiency. However, the gains in efficiency do not lead to improvements in prediction in the study context probably due to the controlled nature of the stated preference data.

AB  - In commercializing a genetically engineered (GE) crop, agronomic characterization studies that contribute to environmental risk assessment (ERA) may be repeated in different global regions. Likewise, these studies may be done both for single-event GE products and for traditional breeding crosses that combine GE events (breeding stacks). The objectives of this research were to assess the need for de novo agronomic characterization if previously done in another region or for each event in a breeding stack. Data were obtained for the GE maize (Zea mays L.) products MON 89034 (insect protected), NK603 (herbicide tolerant), and the breeding stack MON 89034 x NK603. The field trials were done from 2004 to 2014 in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan, and/or the United States. Sources of environmental diversity among the regions (i.e., countries) included differences in the prevalent climate classes of their sites. Although values for the agronomic characteristics varied among regions, event x region interactions caused <1% of the total variability for each GE product. Within each region, comparisons of GE products and near-isogenic conventional controls were largely nonsignificant. When considering agronomic characteristics, a consistent risk assessment outcome-no evidence of increased potential to become a plant pest-was found in each region and for the single-event products and the breeding stack. The results support ERA policies that provide for (i) acceptance of agronomic characterization data from other regions (data transportability) and (ii) exemption of breeding stacks from agronomic characterization, based on case-by-case assessments of plausible risks.

AB  - Agricultural landscapes in the Mediterranean region may be considered as social-ecological systems that are important for biodiversity conservation whilst contributing to a wide range of ecosystem services. This literature review aims to identify the current state and biases of ecosystem service assessment in agroecosystems within the Mediterranean region, evaluate pressures impacting on agroecosystems and their services, and practices that promote ecosystem service synergies in Mediterranean agroecosystems. A total of 41 papers were selected for analysis from a set of 573 potentially relevant papers. Most of the selected papers focused on supporting, regulating and provisioning services, and mostly assessed ecosystem structure or services in the European Mediterranean context. Literature about benefits and values ascribed to by communities and stakeholders remain limited. Results presented here support the notion of multifunctional Mediterranean agroecosystems and multiple synergies were recorded in this review. Publications dealing with pressures that related to agricultural practices and demographic changes were in the majority and impact on different cropping systems. This review highlights the need to carry out integrated ecosystem service assessments that consider the multiple benefits derived from agroecosystems and which may be used to identify management practices that lead to the improvement of ecosystem services capacities and flows.

AB  - The regularity of the community size-spectrum, i.e., the fact that the total ecosystem biomass contained in logarithmically equal body size intervals remains constant, is a striking characteristic of marine ecosystems. Community size-spectrum models exploit this feature to represent marine ecosystems with two measures: the slope and the intercept (height) of the community spectrum. Size-spectrum models have gain popularity over time to model the properties of fish communities, whether to investigate the impact of fishing, or embedded into end-to-end models to investigate the impact of climate. We review the main features and state of the art developments in the domain of continuous size-spectrum models. The community spectrum emerges from a balance between size-selective predation, growth and biomass dissipation. Further to these basic components, reproduction and various causes of mortality have been introduced in recent studies to increase the model's realism or simply close the mass budget of the spectrum. These different processes affect the stability of the spectrum and affect the predictions of the size-spectrum models. A few models have also introduced a representation of life-history traits in the community size-spectrum. This allows accounting for the diversity of energy pathways in food webs and for the fact that metabolism is both size- and species-specific. The community-level metabolism therefore depends on the species composition of the community. The size-spectrum's regularity at the community level can serve as a conceptual basis for building theories of marine ecosystems' functioning. It is also used as indicator of anthropogenic and natural disturbances. The mechanistic nature of size spectrum models as well as their simple and aggregated representation of complex systems makes them good candidates as a strategic management tool. For instance, for testing the impact of different fishing management actions or for projecting marine ecosystem's states under various climate change scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Appropriate thyroid gland function and thyroid hormone activity are considered crucial to sustain the productive performance in domestic animals (growth, milk or hair fibre production). Changes of blood thyroid hormone concentrations are an indirect measure of the changes in thyroid gland activity and circulating thyroid hormones can be considered as indicators of the metabolic and nutritional status of the animals. Thyroid hormones play a pivotal role in the mechanisms permitting the animals to live and breed in the surrounding environment. Variations in hormone bioactivity allow the animals to adapt their metabolic balance to different environmental conditions, changes in nutrient requirements and availability, and to homeorhetic changes during different physiological stages. This is particularly important in the free-ranging and grazing animals, such as traditionally reared small ruminants, whose main physiological functions (feed intake, reproduction, hair growth) are markedly seasonal. Many investigations dealt with the involvement of thyroid hormones in the expression of endogenous seasonal rhythms such as reproduction and hair growth cycles in fibre-producing (wool, mohair cashmere) sheep and goats. Important knowledge about the pattern of thyroid hormone metabolism and their role in ontogenetic development has been obtained from studies in the ovine foetus and in the newborn. Many endogenous (breed, age, gender, physiological state) and environmental factors (climate, season, with a primary role of nutrition) are able to affect thyroid activity and hormone concentrations in blood, acting at the level of hypothalamus, pituitary and/or thyroid gland, as well as on peripheral monodeiodination. Knowledge on such topics mirror physiological changes and possibly allows the monitoring and manipulation of thyroid physiology, in order to improve animal health, welfare and production.

AB  - The distribution of soil organic carbon (OC) in the landscape shows high variability between landform positions. Soils in depositional sites are characterized by a highly diverse vertical structure and can contain significant amounts of OC over the whole soil profile. However, anthropogenic modifications of the landscape such as land use and artificial drainage can significantly alter the OC balance in a catchment. Here, we analyse the spatial distribution of OC stocks along an agriculturally used catena in a catchment, tributary to the Danube River in the Bavarian Forest in Southern Germany. The combination of geomorphic aspects with highly detailed soil data based on 16 soil profiles along a catena allowed us to closely examine the relationship between soil OC and the factors of landform position, soil inherent properties and grassland vs. cropland land use. We determined bulk density, total carbon (TC) and inorganic carbon (IC) for each soil horizon in order to quantify OC stocks and picture the vertical OC distribution in the soils. Pedogenic oxides were analysed as an indicator for the redox conditions as well as the soil development. Furthermore, we analysed the clay fraction as well as poorly crystalline iron oxides (Feox) as potential binding agents for OC. The persistence of OC in the landform positions could be designated by the proportion of C-14 content of the bulk soil OC. Our data revealed that the amount of OC stored in the topsoil is mostly determined by land use, but subsoil OC stocks highly depend on landform position. Most OC of this catena is stored in the floodplain featuring particularly high amounts of OC in their subsoils. Radiocarbon signatures of the floodplain OC indicated a young C-14 age compared to the footslope subsoils. We assume that these high OC stocks were due to 1.) formerly high input of OC-rich sediments, 2.) preservation of this OC from decomposition due to high water saturation and 3.) current land use (grassland). Dropping of the ground water table due to artificial drainage measures left detectable footprints within a few decades in the depth distribution of pedogenic iron oxides and indicated currently dominant oxic conditions within the uppermost 100 cm of the floodplain soils. We suspect that under these conditions the OC stocks are now vulnerable to OC losses. Even though we found no correlation between Feox and OC, it can be assumed that the interplay between Feox and OC will play a key role for the stabilization of the floodplain OC in the future. Today most floodplains in Central Europe are not in their natural state, but drained and under agricultural land use. Therefore this work points to the necessity of monitoring the OC pools in these landform positions and to consider quick responses when it comes to changes in the hydrologic regime and/or land-use system.

AB  - Coastal plain streams in the southeastern United States supply carbon that supports important coastal ecosystems, but the effects of urbanization on carbon export from these streams have not been extensively studied. This study aimed to determine how urbanization changes coastal plain stream organic matter quality, rates of carbon export, and dissolved oxygen dynamics that have implications for stream ecosystem function. Organic matter quality, organic carbon export, and dissolved oxygen concentrations were measured for multiple years (2009 & 2013-2015) in North Carolina coastal plain streams that spanned a gradient of urbanization. Based on spectral characteristics, dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality appeared to shift from characteristic blackwater in minimally impacted streams to clear streamwater in urban streams due to large reductions in chromophoric DOM concentrations, aromaticity, and molecular weight. Differences in spectral indices and characteristics of dissolved organic carbon export suggest that urbanization reduced natural sources of DOM and provided various urban sources of DOM that were likely more bioavailable. Particulate organic matter in the urban streams was indicative of more labile autochthonous sources than that of the less impacted streams, and rates of particulate carbon export increased and shifted to higher flows with watershed impervious surface cover. Diel variation of dissolved oxygen increased with watershed impervious surface cover, indicating that urbanization and associated changes in carbon and nutrient cycling altered stream function. While the effects of urbanization on carbon export were similar to previous studies in other regions, the unique blackwater state of natural streams and receiving waters in the study area make them especially susceptible to negative ecological impacts from altered carbon and nutrient export. Management actions that conserve or restore natural carbon sources to the stream may help mitigate multiple negative effects of urbanization in southeastern US coastal plain streams.

AB  - Ecosystem-based management implies understanding feedbacks between ecosystems and society. Such understanding can be approached with the Drivers-Pressures-State change-Impacts-Response framework (DPSIR), incorporating stakeholders' preferences for ecosystem services to assess impacts on society. This framework was adapted to six locations in the central coast of Chile, where artisanal fisheries coexist with an increasing influx of tourists, and a set of fisheries management areas alternate with open access areas and a no-take Marine Protected Area (MPA). The ecosystem services in the study area were quantified using biomass and species richness in intertidal and subtidal areas as biological indicators. The demand for ecosystem services was elicited by interviews to the principal groups of users. Our results evidenced decreasing landings and a negative perception of fishermen on temporal trends of catches. The occurrence of recreational fishing was negligible, although the consumption of seafood by tourists was relatively high. Nevertheless, the consumption of organisms associated to the study system was low, which could be linked, amongst other factors, to decreasing catches. The comparison of biological indicators between management regimens provided variable results, but a positive effect of management areas and the MPA on some of the metrics was observed. The prioritising of ecosystem attributes by tourists was highly homogenous across the six locations, with "scenic beauty" consistently selected as the preferred attribute, followed by "diversity". The DPSIR framework illustrated the complex interactions existing in these locations, with weak linkages between society's priorities, existing management objectives and the state of biological communities. Overall, this work improved our knowledge on relations between components of coastal areas in central Chile, of paramount importance to advance towards an ecosystem-based management in the area.

AB  - Headwater streams play a major role for provision of ecosystem services, e.g. drinking water. We investigated a high-altitude headwater catchment of the Kharaa River (including 41 1st-order rivers) to understand the impact of land cover (especially forest cover), environment and human usage on runoff, chemical water quality and macro-invertebrate fauna in a river basin under discontinuous permafrost conditions in an arid, sparsely populated region of Mongolia. To verify our hypotheses that different landuses and environmental impacts in permafrost headwaters influence water quality, we investigated 105 sampling sites, 37 of them at intermittent stream sections without water flow. Discharge was positively impacted by land cover types steppe, grassland and forest and negatively by shrubland, forest burnt by wild fires (indicating a reduction of permafrost) and slope. Water quality was affected by altitude, longitude and latitude, shrub growth and water temperature. Shannon diversity of macroinvertebrates was driven by water temperature, iron content of the water, flow velocity, and subbasin size (adjusted R-2 = 0.54). Sample plots clustered in three groups that differed in water chemistry, macroinvertebrate diversity, species composition and bio-indicators. Our study confirms that steppes and grasslands have a higher contribution to runoff than forests, forest cover has a positive impact on water quality, and diversity of macroinvertebrates is higher in sites with less nutrients and pollutants. The excellent ecological status of the upper reaches of the Kharaa is severely threatened by forest fires and human-induced climate change and urgently needs to be conserved.

AB  - Research on the social bases of environmentalism in the United States has generally found that urban residents are more concerned about the environment than rural residents. Recent research suggests this may no longer be the case, particularly in specific settings or under certain conditions. This paper examines the issue by reviewing recent survey research on rural and urban environmentalism. Tests for significant differences between urban and rural inhabitants of the Southern Ap palachian Ecoregion on cognitive and behavioral dimensions of environmentalism are also conducted using data obtained fi-om 1,239 telephone interviews. Findings are consistent with previous research showing that younger people, those with higher levels of education, and political liberals generally express higher levels of environmentalism. However, no significant rural-urban differences were found on several indicators of environmentalism. A range of conditions that are rapidly changing the character and composition of the region may help to explain why the findings do not conform to the general pattern of rural-urban differences. Overall, it appears that environmentalism has broadened its appeal in rural areas, especially in communities located near national and state parks, wildlife refuges, and other outdoor recreation sites.

AB  - One of the most controversially discussed topics in current biodiversity-ecosystem function research is the transfer of results from experimental and theoretical studies to natural ecosystems. At the same time, monitoring data on biodiversity are requested as key indicators for the state of an ecosystem in most environmental evaluation frameworks. We analyse two monitoring data sets comprising information on abundance and biomass of macrozoobenthos communities in the German Wadden Sea in order to evaluate how much information monitoring data on biodiversity provide concerning ecosystem functioning and what implications this information (or the lack thereof) has for future monitoring programmes. Our results show a positive correlation between number of species of macrozoobenthos and its standing stock. Despite differences in overall biomass and individual size in different functional groups, this correlation remained consistent for different feeding guilds and therefore is likely to be independent of certain species traits. Moreover, functional turnover analyses indicate that increasing species richness is needed to maintain biomass levels over increasing periods of time. Whereas our data thus corroborate predictions from theory, we could not determine any causal relationships, because monitoring data commonly include only vague proxies for very few functional parameters, in our case standing biomass as a proxy for production. As to the use of diversity as an indicator for ecosystem functioning, we advise that management decisions are to be based on verified causal relationships and therefore strongly suggest the general incorporation of unambiguous proxies for functional parameters in the measuring campaigns of monitoring programmes.

AB  - Soil losses affect the physical, chemical and biological soil properties and as a consequence reduce soil productivity. Erosion reduces or eliminates root-explorable soil depth and crop available water, selectively decreases the nutrient and organic matter content, and exposes soil layers with unsuitable characteristics for crop growth. Yield is hence assumed to be a function of root growth, which in turn is a function of the soil environment. In order to evaluate the water erosion impact on soil properties and productivity a study was carried out on a Typic Haplustalfs soil, with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench), located in Chaguaramas in the Central Plains of Venezuela. Four different study locations with the same soil type, with slopes ranging from 3% to 6% and with different levels of erosion were selected: Chaguaramas I (slightly eroded), Chaguaramas 11, (moderately eroded), Chaguaramas III (moderately eroded), and Chaguaramas IV (severely eroded). A sorghum-livestock farming system was introduced 30 years ago. Secondary tillage with a disc harrow (without mulch on the topsoil) was applied for seedbed preparation. Fertilizers and pesticides were applied uniformly over the entire fields. Soil samples from each horizon were analysed for particle size distribution, water retention, bulk density, pH and organic matter content. The relative production potential was estimated using the Productivity Index developed by Pierce et al. [Pierce, F.C., W.E. Larson, R.H. Dowdy and W.A. Graham. 1983. Productivity of soils: assessing long-term changes due to erosion. Journal of Soil and Water Conservation. 38 39-44.], and adapted to the methodology proposed by Delgado [Delgado F. 2003. Soil physical properties on Venezuelan steeplands: applications to conservation planning. The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics. College oil Soil Physics. 11 pp.] for Venezuelan soil conditions. The Productivity Index (PI) could estimate the tolerable rate of soil productivity loss. A soil erosion risk was assessed by the Erosion Risk Index (ERI) taking into account the soil hydrological characteristics (infiltration-runoff ratio), rainfall aggressiveness and topography (slope). The Productivity Index (PI) and the Erosion Risk Index (ERI) were used to classify the lands for soil conservation priorities, for conservation requirements and for alternative land uses. The results showed that: (a) the Productivity Index (PI) decreased with increasing level of erosion, (b) the Productivity Index (PI) was mainly affected by changes in available water storage capacity, bulk density and pH, (c) the erosion risk (ERI) was strongly affected by slope gradient and rainfall aggressiveness, (d) the areas were classified as critical lands and super-critical lands, with high to very high soil conservation requirements, depending on the level of soil erosion.

AB  - Megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis) is a commercially important European flatfish which population assessment requires reliable age and growth information. An extensive sampling of nearly 10000 otoliths over 25 years has been collected during annual bottom trawl surveys in southern Bay of Biscay and Galician waters. Samples were aged and yearly age-length-keys (ALKs) were built. A matrix of abundance indices by age and year was obtained after applying each ALK to their respective length distribution. The current age estimation criterion using otoliths of megrim was corroborated by tracking year-class abundance indices in the surveys. The strength of the year-classes was well tracked and significant correlations between abundance of consecutive age-groups from the same cohort were obtained. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated for the time-series (Lt = 56 [1-e((-0.12(t+1.82))]), and the growth performance indices estimated were within the range previously found for megrim in Bay of Biscay and nearby waters. These new parameters are representative of the growth of the Atlantic Iberian megrim stock (ICES Div. 8.c and 9.a) and can be used as a proxy of annual direct ageing in the assessment of this stock. Findings indicate that growth and mortality of the year-classes may influence population size/age structure of megrim. Abundant year-classes of megrim reach small mean lengths at the first fully recruited age 1, showing high mortality in the following older age-groups of the year-classes, and vice versa in the scarce year-classes. These results, together with the evidence of the inverse relationship between abundance and mean length by age of the year-classes, have showed, for the first time, evidence of density-dependent growth and mortality in the juvenile stage of megrim. The higher or smaller mean size and abundance of a year-class of megrim is determined by processes that take place in their first life stages and is maintained throughout the older age-groups of the year-class. The existence in consecutive years of cohorts showing small (1990s), or high (2000s) mean lengths-at-age, seems to indicate that growth in the first life stages may be conditioned by multiannual events in which occur favorable environmental and feeding conditions. Abundance is the most significant factor explaining the growth of age 1, whereas the climate index, used as environmental proxy, represented low relevance, and the fishing effort has no explanatory effect.

AB  - Mite biodiversity and distribution in Malaysia is currently understudied. Most previous works on Malaysian Acari have focused on pest organisms of medical, veterinary, and agricultural concern, with a few recent studies centered on mites in forensic contexts. Previous literatures have targeted collection sites in forest reserves and/or mountains in either Peninsular or Malaysian Borneo, though the state of Sarawak had the least publications related to mite species descriptions despite having the highest number of nature parks of any state in the country. Most publications focused on the three states Selangor, Pahang and Sabah. Most of the mite species reported were from mammals (66.3%), with fewer species from birds (21.7%), arthropods (11.2%), and reptiles (0.8%). We believe that further work on the systematic documentation of mite species throughout Malaysia is necessary as it could generate useful tools, such as the use of mites as biogeographical markers or as forensic indicators.Therefore, this review catalogs mite species that have been documented in or on animal hosts in Malaysia and serves as a foundation for future work.

AB  - Introduction. Park areas perform conservational and recreational functions in an urban environment that is under the influence of intense man-made load.
   Problem Statement. The global decline in air quality, the augmentation of toxic emissions and industrial wastes, require constant monitoring of the environment, which must be focused primarily on biotic parameters.
   Purpose. Estimation of the man-made pollution of park ecosystems of Kyiv according to the spectral characteristics of leaves of the bioindicator species Taraxacum officinale F.H. Wigg., and the content of heavy metals in them and in the soils.
   Materials and Methods. Spectrophotometry method for studying the spectral characteristics of T. officinale leaves; induction-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method for measuring the content of Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn, Ni, Cr in leaves and soils from localities; statistical methods.
   Results. The average level of correlations (0.50-0.69) between vegetation indices R-550/R-485, R-550/R-620, R-450/R-735, NDVI, RESV, SI and Cu content is shown, Pb, Mn in leaves and Pb and Mn - in soils, and a high degree of correlation (0.75-0.87) between the indices R-450/R-735, NDVI, RESV, LCI and the content of Zn and Cr in leaves and soils. There is a clear trend of increasing the content of heavy metals in the direction from the central parts of the park areas to the peripheral ones, which are intensively affected by traffic.
   The most polluted is the Mariinsky Park. High levels of heavy metals Cu, Pb and Cr were also found in the soils and leaves of the park of the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. The lowest level of pollution is in the Feofaniya park.
   Conclusions. The discussed vegetation indices are recommended both for rapid assessment of the state of natural and urban ecosystems, and for interpretation of satellite images for zoning and to determine the degree of man-made pollution. The use of the spectrophotometric method for bioindication is promising due to a high speed of obtaining results, a wide coverage, and a low cost.

AB  - By the end of the 1960s, The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) had established the basic purity and safety standards for poultry biologics in the United States and had licensed products to address many of the major poultry diseases of concern at that time. The emergence of new diseases, advances in scientific technology, and changes in poultry husbandry practices that occurred in the 1970s to the 1990s required the development of many new and amended regulatory requirements to keep abreast of the changing needs of the poultry industry. Veterinary Services often approved the use of special or conditional licensing procedures to shorten the time to license products needed to address emerging diseases. Infectious bronchitis, bursal disease, fowl cholera, duck virus enteritis, avian influenza, and other vaccines were rapidly licensed to address emerging disease problems using this procedure. Changes in labeling and packaging requirements were made to address changing vaccination practices. Veterinary Services permitted diluents to be shipped separate from product, first for Marek's disease vaccine and later for vaccines recommended for administration by automatic vaccinating machines. The maximum number of doses permitted to be in one container and package were also amended to address the increased size of poultry flocks. Veterinary Services also approved the use of split manufacturing procedures that permitted two or more licensed manufacturers to work together in the production of a product. This innovative use of licensing products for further manufacture allowed the industry to use production facilities more efficiently and provided a wider variety of combination products. In 1985, Congress passed an amendment to the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act that gave USDA the authority to regulate all veterinary biological products shipped in or from the United States. This amendment brought intrastate biologics manufacturers under federal jurisdiction and ensured all biological products shipped in or from the United States met the same standards of purity, safety, potency, and efficacy. The development of new recombinant DNA (r-DNA) techniques for the production of vaccines required USDA to establish new procedures and rules for the review of these products prior to their release into the environment and eventual licensure. Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act required the preparation of environmental risk assessments and public participation in the field testing and licensing of live r-DNA products. This article addresses some of the history of these and other changes in regulatory requirements for poultry products that took place in the 1970s to the 1990s, but space does not permit us to address all of the changes that have occurred. We have presented some of what we consider the most notable events in this process and leave it up to future historians to address events that may not have been included.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to conduct a historical analysis of the research-oriented studies related to dental anthropology in Argentina, evaluate its current state and discuss future expectations and perspectives. In this country, anthropological studies based on analysis of dentition have been scarce and even temporarily discontinued, since they began in the late nineteenth century, simply following the course of the predominant theoretical and methodological approaches over time. Early papers, guided mainly by evolutionary ideas, were oriented towards establishing the taxonomic position of humans through the description and comparison of morphological and morphometric aspects of the dental crown and root. Later studies mainly described types of intentional modifications (i.e. dental mutilations) and tooth wear in the context of Historic-Cultural School. However, they failed to constitute valid lines of research over time. In recent years, there has been a significant change in dental studies, mainly as a result of the interest in evaluating the adaptive aspects of human populations within biocultural settings. One of the most relevant lines of studies has been the bioarchaeologicall analysis of health and stress indicators, such as enamel hypoplasia, caries and tooth wear in hunter-gatherer and farmer societies. More recently, the study of discrete and metric dental traits began, with a goal to contribute to the study of evolution and inter-populational biological relations among South American groups. Since teeth contain valuable information not only about the environment in which the individual lived, but also about the action of neutral and non-neutral factors on human groups, the consolidation of ongoing studies will contribute to knowledge of various aspects of the adaptation and evolution of native American populations.

AB  - A sensitive and efficient colorimetric method was optimized for detection of esterase enzymes produced by endophytic fungi for development of High-Throughput Screening (HTS). The fungi were isolated and obtained previously from plant species of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest located in areas of environmental preservation in the State of Sao Paulo / Brazil, as part of the project "Chemical and biological prospecting endophytic fungi associated to plant species of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest". The compounds ethyl butyrate, ethyl acetate and methyl propionate were used as standards esters which were hydrolyzed by extracellular enzyme from endophytic fungi (EC. 3.1.1.1 - carboxylesterases) for production of carboxylic acids. Thus, the reduction of the pH increases the protonated indicator concentration (bromothymol blue), changing the color of the reaction medium (from blue to yellow), that can be observed and measured by spectrophotometry at 616 nm. The methodology with acid-base indicator was performed on 13 microorganisms, aiming Periconia atropurpurea as a potential source of esterase for biotransformation of short chain esters. The results also evidenced that this methodology showed to be efficient, fast, cheap, having low consumption of reagents and easy development, and can be applied to screen carboxylic-ester hydrolases in a large number of microorganisms.

AB  - The existing methods for the assessment of fire hazard are analyzed. For the forest regions of Siberia, which are known for the highest indicators of fire hazard, data has been assembled on the degree of natural and weather-dependent fire hazard, as well as the hazard from a source of ignition. It is proposed to assess the natural fire hazard with allowance for the geographical-zonal and general inflammability features of the forest-site types and the forest regions of Siberia. The need to take into account the dynamics of fire hazard has been noted, especially after fire-hazard seasons characterized by an extreme degree of flammability. In remote areas, it is proposed to assess the dynamics of the natural fire hazard of territories based on the predicted state of forest ecosystems after the impact of fires. The proposed method has been tested on the territory of the Nizhneangarsk forest region, and a high reliability was found for the assessment of the postfire state of forest stands (in 87% of cases). The natural fire-hazard dynamics in the Kodinsky and Gremuchinsky forest districts of the Krasnoyarsk Territory have been analyzed based on the prediction of the forest-fire aftermath. The study has also revealed significantly increased areas of forest lands characterized by the first class of natural fire hazard after the impact of several large fires in 1996 and 2006 and an increase in fire-hazard class in some of the forestry units and on the territory of the Gremuchinsky forest district as a whole.

AB  - Land use change may exert a negative impact on environmental quality. A state-impact-state (SIS) model describing a state transform under certain impacts has been integrated into land use planning (LUP) environmental impact assessment (LUPEA). This logical model is intuitive and easy to understand, but the exploration of impact is essential to establish the indicator system and to identify the scope of land use environmental impact when it is applied to a specific region. In this study, we investigated environmental driving forces from land use planning (LUPF), along with the conception, components, scope, and impact of LUPF. This method was illustrated by a case study in Zoucheng, China. Through the results, we concluded that (1) the LUPF on environment are impacts originated from the implementation of LUP on a regional environment, which are characterized by four aspects: magnitude, direction, action point, and its owner; (2) various scopes of LUPF on individual environmental elements based on different standards jointly define the final scope of LUPEA; (3) our case study in Zoucheng demonstrates the practicability of this proposed approach; (4) this method can be embedded into LUPEA with direction, magnitudes, and scopes of the LUPF on individual elements obtained, and the identified indicator system can be directly employed into LUPEA and (5) the assessment helps to identify key indicators and to set up a corresponding strategy to mitigate the negative impact of LUP on the environment, which are two important objectives of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) in LUP.

AB  - The non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs) highly contribute to the PCB dietary intake of total PCBs. Most of the NDL-PCBs are assumed through ingestion of contaminated fish and fishery products. Therefore, it is important to quantify their presence in aquatic organisms to evaluate human risks associated with fish consumption. The European catfish is a top food-chain predator and is considered a reliable bio-monitoring tool reflecting the state of the environmental organic pollution. From 2006 to 2009, 54 European catfish were captured in four sites covering the area of the Po River (North Italy), and their muscles were analysed to determine the levels of 18 PCBs congeners. All samples presented detectable levels of 18 congeners and, on average, results showed an important presence of NDL-PCBs. The sum of the six congeners (28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180 IUPAC) was used as indicator of the total PCBs concentration. The 33% of the samples analysed exceeded the maximum levels of 125 ng g(-1) set by European regulations in fish. The values measured ranged from 19.7 to 1015.4 ng g(-1) (mean 135.6 +/- 149.8 ng g(-1)).
   The concentrations of NDL-PCBs were not related to fish weight or sex, while a significant variability was found among sites (p < 0.05), according to the geographical location of many industrial activities in the catchment area of the Po River. PCB 153 and 138 were present in higher concentrations (40% and 30% respectively). We hypothesise that this is due to their high resistance to metabolic degradation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land-use intensification represents one major threat to the diversity and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. In the face of concurrent climate change, concerns are growing about the ability of intensively managed agroecosystems to ensure stable food provisioning, as they may be particularly vulnerable to climate extreme-induced harvest losses and pest outbreaks. Extensively managed systems, in contrast, were shown to mitigate climate change based on plant diversity-mediated effects, such as higher functional redundancy or asynchrony of species. In this context, the maintenance of soils is essential to sustain key ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling, pest control, and crop yield. Within the highly diverse soil fauna, nematodes represent an important group as their trophic spectrum ranges from detritivores to predators and they allow inferences to the overall state of the ecosystem (bioindicators). Here, we investigated the effects of simulated climate change and land-use intensity on the diversity and abundance of soil nematode functional groups and functional indices in two consecutive years. We revealed that especially land use induced complex shifts in the nematode community with strong seasonal dynamics, while future climate led to weaker effects. Strikingly, the high nematode densities associated with altered climatic conditions and intensive land use were a consequence of increased densities of opportunists and potential pest species (i.e., plant feeders). This coincided with a less diverse and less structured community with presumably reduced capabilities to withstand environmental stress. These degraded soil food web conditions represent a potential threat to ecosystem functioning and underline the importance of management practices that preserve belowground organisms.

AB  - This paper describes an approach to account for asymmetric preference formation in discrete choice models used for environmental valuation. The paper draws on data from a case study on preferences for environmental change resulting from a hypothetical rural development and conservation programme in Indonesia. Local knowledge on the current state of the environment was used to define an individual-specific status quo that consistently frames changes in a range of environmental services as gains or losses matching the perceptions of the local population living in the vicinity of a National Park. I estimated choice models that included separate parameters for increases and decreases in attribute levels for the environmental services and derived the indicators of local willingness to pay (WTP) corresponding to the bidirectional changes relative to the individual-specific status quo option.
   I found clear evidence of an asymmetric response to increase and decrease in attribute levels relative to the status quo. Ignoring asymmetric preference formation can therefore result in biased estimates of WTP indicators and welfare measures of change in cases where the outcomes of environmental programmes can plausibly result in both an increase and a decrease relative to a reference option. Compared to a symmetrical modelling approach, the combination of simultaneously accounting for asymmetric preference formation and preference heterogeneity in the choice model yielded additional insights that may be used to inform the development of local strategies towards biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The Natura 2000 network of protected areas is considered by the European Commission to be the centrepiece of the European Union's nature and biodiversity policy. This paper reviews the European Environment Agency's public Natura 2000 database. It comprises data for birds, mammals, fish, amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates and plants submitted by the 28 EU Member States. For each Natura 2000 site a calculation was made of the conservation value of each species, together with an assessment of population isolation in relation to natural range and global conservation value. The results show that the great majority of national species populations of Community interest and birds are just covered by each Natura 2000 site up to only 2% at maximum. The most frequently reported high negative impacts on Natura 2000 sites are human induced changes in hydraulic conditions, hunting and collection of wild animals, and grazing. Natura 2000 sites alone are unlikely to safeguard Europe's biodiversity heritage, because most species occur predominantly outside Natura 2000 protected areas. Recommendations are made for improved reporting by EU Member States to provide quantifiable data based on monitoring and comparable indicators. Reform of the Natura 2000 network is needed for an integrated ecosystem approach to allow natural and human induced fluctuations of structures and functions of species habitats. 100% landscape management of the wider countryside should be enforced as a result of the limited coverage of Natura 2000 sites for Europe's biodiversity heritage.

AB  - The ever-increasing anthropogenic activities have adversely impacted coral reef ecosystems and their ecological functions. This calls for an urgent assessment of the health state of these valuable ecosystems to justify the need for mitigation and proper management efforts. In this contribution, we used multiple indicators to assess the impact of intense oil-related activities on coral reefs in two near-by impacted and non-impacted islands in the northwestern Persian Gulf. The efficacy of indices was assessed using estimations of the effect size (omega squared), precision, and decision trees (Classification and Regression Tree (CART)). The results demonstrated that the combination of bioaccumulation of PAH in coral tissues, the percent of live coral cover, and the Sediment Constituent (SEDCON) Index were the most robust proxies reflecting the influence of human activities on reef's health. Based on sedimentary PAH concentration, the CART classified most of the indicators into two classes consisting of those in impacted and those in non-impacted locations, further supporting the feasibility of the employed indices. The findings of this study provided a warning of degradation in coral reefs of the island subjected to PAH pollution. This encourages decision-makers to execute routine monitoring and mitigation practices to maintain healthy reefs in the study areas.

AB  - The aim of this study is to generate a first global overview of pressures and methods used to assess the environmental quality of rivers and streams using macroinvertebrates. In total, 314 peer-review studies were reviewed, published in the period 1997 ? 2018, from developing economies in Africa, South-Central America, Mexico and Southern Asia. To establish a global perspective, the results from the literature review were compared to other compiled datasets, biomonitoring manuals, environmental surveys and literature reviews from Europe, North America and Australasia. The literature review from the developing economies showed that sampling was most usual during baseflow, using kick- or Surber sampling, with taxonomical identification levels mostly to genus or family. Assessments were most often done using metrics (singular and multimetrics; > 70% of the applications) and were based on community attributes related to richness and dominance (58% of studies), sensitivity (40%), diversity by heterogeneity (32%) and functional traits (25%). Within each category, the most used metrics were the richness and dominance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT), Biological Monitoring Working Party scoring systems (BMWP/ASPT), Shannon-Wiener diversity and feeding traits. Overall, 92% of the reviewed studies reported that the use of macroinvertebrates, at least in some of their responses, was successful in detecting degradation of environmental quality in the investigated rivers. Given the many similarities in applied methods worldwide, at present, we consider that a global assessment of riverine environmental quality can be feasible by using family level identifications of macroinvertebrate samples. We propose a global common metric (multimetric), comprising three of the most common river assessment metrics from the reviewed literature, but also elsewhere, namely the BMWP/ASPT, Shannon-Wiener diversity and richness of EPT. Recent concerns regarding the global state of nature and consequences for freshwater communities, as reported by the intergovernmental science-policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services (IPBES), emphasize the urgent need for such a synthesis.

AB  - In Germany, landfilling and incineration main techniques for the disposal of waste. due to humid climatic conditions, leakage of contaminated water from landfills into the sub-surface poses a considerable threat to the environment. Therefore, the German states require high safety standards for the construction of a landfill. asis is put on the presence of natural geological barrier rocks. Clay and silts, claystones and silt-stones are best suited to meet the requirements defined in legal waste regulations. With regard to retardation capacity, thickness is considered of higher importance than hydraulic permeability. Suitable have to be reduced by legally excluded areas, A site search program in Lower Saxony revealed that only 1% of the total state area falls into the best suitability category. Geoscientific investigations on the remaining suitable areas have to become detailed in the search progress. Geographical information systems (GIS) are the most adequate tools to work on all involved data and to present and outline the results. GIS make the results transparent and understandable to the public. These investigations are a necessary part of the environmental impact assessment which is obligatory for a landfill site's construction. Criteria catalogues take all important aspects of the search process into consideration and help to find the most suitable site.

AB  - As a weather element, clouds can affect CO2 exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere by altering environmental conditions, such as solar radiation received on the ground surface, temperature, and moisture. Based on the flux data measured at five typical ecosystems of China during mid-growing season (June-August) from 2003 to 2006, we analyzed the responses of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE), light use efficiency (LUE, defined as Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP)/Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)), and water use efficiency (WUE, defined as GEP/Evapotranspiration (ET)) to the changes in cloudiness. The five ecological sites included Changbaishan temperate mixed forest (CBS), Dinghushan subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest (DHS), Xishuangbanna tropical rainforest (XSBN), Inner Mongolia semi-arid Leymus chinensis steppe (NMG), and Haibei alpine frigid Potentilla fruticosa shrub (HB). Our analyses show that cloudy sky conditions with cloud index (k(t)) values between 0.4 and 0.6 increased NEE, LUE, and WUE of the ecosystems at CBS, DHS, NMG and HB from June to August. The LUE of tropical rainforest at XSBN was higher under cloudy than under clear sky conditions, but NEE and WUE did not decrease significantly under clear sky conditions from June to August. The increase in GEP with increasing diffuse radiation received by ecosystems under cloudy skies was the main reason that caused the increases in LUE and net carbon uptake in forest ecosystem at CBS, DHS, and alpine shrub ecosystem at HB, compared with clear skies. Moreover, for the ecosystem at CBS, DHS, and HB, when sky condition became from clear to cloudy, GEP increased and ET decreased with decreasing VPD, leading to the increase in WUE and NEE under cloudy sky conditions. The decrease in Re with decreasing temperature and increase in GEP with decreasing VPD under cloudy skies led to the increase in LUE. WUE, and net carbon uptake of semi-arid steppe at NMG, compared to clear skies. These different responses among the five ecosystems are attributable to the differences in canopy characteristics and water conditions. From June to August, the peaks of the k(t) frequency distribution in temperate ecosystems (e.g., CBS, NMG, and HB) were larger than 0.5, but they were smaller than 0.4 in subtropical/tropical forest ecosystems (e.g., DHS and XSBN). These results suggest that the pattern of cloudiness during the years from 2003 to 2006 in the five ecosystems was not the best condition for their net carbon uptake. This study highlights the importance of cloudiness factor in the prediction of net carbon absorption in the Asia monsoon region under climate change. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The microclimatic monitoring of the historic church of Mogila Abbey (Krakow, Poland) was carried out to study the impact of the environmental parameters on the organic and hygroscopic artworks. Specific indexes were proposed to objectively assess the quality of time series of temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and carbon dioxide (CO2) before applying the exploratory data analysis. The series were used to define the historic environmental conditions as stated in the European Standard EN 15757: 2010 and with the use of the climate evaluation chart (CEC). It was found that the percentage of time in which T and RH values are within the allowable limits of the ASHRAE (2011) Class B is more than 85 %. This means that, for about 15 % of the time, there is a high risk of mechanical damage to highly vulnerable objects mainly due to the RH variability. The environment at the chancel resulted moister than that at the cornice, and the fungal growth is possible. In addition, the time-weighted preservation index (TWPI) is computed to evaluate the life expectancy of the objects, taking into account the environmental conditions of the site under study. The method of analogues, developed to predict the evolution of a system given observations of the past and without the knowledge of any equation among variables, was proposed and applied to the time series of temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide with a 1-h sampling time to avoid the influence of the autocorrelation.

AB  - Conservation biologists often use some specialized species as surrogates for communicating conservation needs, e.g. to signal states and changes in ecosystem. This requires a detailed knowledge of a species' habitat demands and relationship between its occurrence and abundance, and certain environmental conditions. This paper explores the relationship between the occurrence and abundance of middle spotted woodpecker (Leiopicus medius) and structural, compositional, and functional elements of forest naturalness in three different forest landscapes in Poland, which encompass a wide spectrum of species' habitats. Neither compositional nor functional elements of forest naturalness seemed to affect species' distribution. In all studied areas, environmental variables related to the structural elements of forest naturalness, e.g. the share of old and uneven-aged stands, number of large living trees, positively influenced the occurrence and abundance of middle spotted woodpecker. Mature, unevenly structured forests might occur as a result of sustainable forest management, aimed at preserving the continuity of old stands and the maintenance of diverse age and species' structure, providing suitable habitat condition for the species. Therefore, both presence and abundance of middle spotted woodpeckers can serve as indicators of wildlife-friendly forest management in deciduous forests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is an emerging recognition that natural lands and their conservation are important elements of a sustainable drinking water infrastructure. We conducted a national, watershed-level environmental assessment of 5,265 drinking water watersheds using data on land cover, hydrography and conservation status. Approximately 78% of the conterminous United States lies within a drinking water watershed. The typical drinking water watershed had a high percentage of natural vegetation ((x) over tilde = 77%) but a low percentage of it was set aside for conservation ((x) over tilde = 3%). Median percentage values for urban and agriculture were 5 and 8%, respectively. Between ca. 1992 and ca. 2001, approximately 23% of the drinking water watersheds lost at least 1% of their natural vegetation, and approximately 9% of the watersheds had at least a 1% increase in the amount of urban land. Loss of natural vegetation was common in nearly all areas of the country, but also concentrated in the Ohio River and Southeast hydrologic regions. Urbanization was concentrated in the eastern United States, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast hydrologic regions.

AB  - The Qiandao Lake Area (QLA) is of great significance in terms of drinking water supply in East Coast China as well as a nationally renowned tourist attraction. A series of laws and regulations regarding the QLA environment have been enacted and implemented throughout the past decade with the aim of negating the harmful effects associated with expanding urbanization and industrialization. In this research, an assessment framework was developed to analyze the eco-environmental vulnerability of the QLA from 1990-2010 by integrating fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and geographical information systems (GIS) in an attempt to gain insights into the status quo of the QLA so as to review and evaluate the effectiveness of the related policies. After processing and analyzing the temporal and spatial variation of eco-environmental vulnerability and major environmental issues in the QLA, we found that the state of eco-environmental vulnerability of the QLA was acceptable, though a moderate deterioration was detected during the study period. Furthermore, analysis of the combination of vulnerability and water quality indicated that the water quality showed signs of declination, though the overall status remained satisfactory. It was hence concluded that the collective protection and treatment actions were effective over the study period, whereas immediately stricter measures would be required for protecting the drinking water quality from domestic sewage and industrial wastewater. Finally, the spatial variation of the eco-environmental vulnerability assessment also implied that specifically more targeted measures should be adopted in respective regions for long-term sustainable development of the QLA.

AB  - Under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) lakes are classified according to a variety of criteria. This classification facilitates state of the environment assessments and helps identify work needed to achieve the objectives of the WFD, which are broadly to maintain and/or restore water quality and ecological status at a level recognised as good or high. To achieve high or good status, lakes must meet a criterion for total phosphorus (TP) that is linked to a predicted reference condition value that is derived by various models. Lakes which fail to meet good status may require expensive remedial actions to be undertaken, thus accurate identification of the reference condition TP concentration is vital for effective environmental management. However, the models currently employed could be improved for some regions, particularly those with carbon rich soils. By examining 19 reference condition lakes (i.e. lakes essentially non-impacted by humans) in peaty areas of Scotland, we found that a simple parameter linked to water colour and humic substances was a better predictor of TP than the currently employed models (R-2 0.585 vs R-2 < 0.01). Therefore, for Scotland and elsewhere, in regions with carbon rich soils and lakes with humic waters the TP predictive models could be improved by development and incorporation of a parameter related to water colour and humic components.

AB  - During the last decades, agricultural intensification has modified the hydrology of Mediterranean wetlands, as has occurred in the Mar Menor coastal lagoon (SE Spain). Salt-steppe dominated wetlands, characteristic of transitional areas surrounding this lagoon and rich in biodiversity values, are threatened by changes in their water regime originated by land-use changes in the watershed. Traditional dryland cultures have also been replaced by irrigated ones. We assess the direct and indirect changes induced by agriculture on a terrestrial vertebrate community (steppe birds) especially sensitive to these ecosystem changes. This is made on the basis of several surveys of terrestrial birds (excluding aerial feeders and raptors) carried out between 1984 and 2008 in a representative wetland of the lagoon's continental margin (Marina del Carmoli). The changes in this bird assemblage reflect the hydrological modifications induced by agriculture at the watershed scale, which have significant effects on the relative representation of wetland habitats. Bird metrics and indices (species abundance, taxonomic composition, conservation value) describe these community changes as the combination of early declines in some species and families, and transient or late increases in other. In the long term, the family Alaudidae (and particularly species like Melanocorypha calandra) have lost importance to the benefit of Turdidae and Fringillidae. The area of salt-steppe explains a large part of the variation in the abundance of Alaudidae, while most variation of Turdidae and Fringillidae respond to the area of saltmarsh. Some Alaudidae seem to take advantage of the intermediate stages of saltmarsh expansion (Calandrella rufescens), or from the marginal irrigated crops fringing the wetland (Calandrella brachydactyla) that could compensate the loss of original agricultural habitats. Habitat changes in the wetland have occurred in three differentiated stages, and modify the steppe bird community towards a more heterogeneous assemblage including scrubland and palustrine species. Among three indices of ornithological value, only that based on the EU Bird's Directive Annex I species was negatively affected, but since the wetland has been designated a Specially Protected Area under this regulation, this represents a management failure. There exists some chance, however, to manage peripheral cropland in favour of biodiversity. The importance of monitoring in conservation evaluation and management is also stressed, since the terrestrial bird community of this wetland has not been regularly surveyed. In fact, its evaluation against the Bird's Directive criteria was made in a period of quick departure from the original, good ecological state of the wetland. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Red List Index (RLI), which uses information from the IUCN Red List to track trends in the projected overall extinction risk of sets of species, is among the indicators adopted by the world's governments to assess performance under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. For greatest impact, such indicators need to be measured and used at a national scale as well as globally. We present the first application of the RLI based on assessments of extinction risk at the national scale using IUCN's recommended methods, evaluating trends in the status of Australian birds for 1990-2010. We calculated RLIs based on the number of taxa in each Red List category and the number that changed categories between assessments in 1990, 2000 and 2010 as a result of genuine improvement or deterioration in status. A novel comparison between trends at the species and ultrataxon (subspecies or monotypic species) level showed that these were remarkably similar, suggesting that current global RLI trends at the species level may also be a useful surrogate for tracking losses in genetic diversity at this scale, for which no global measures currently exist. The RLI for Australia is declining faster than global rates when migratory shorebirds and seabirds are included, but not when changes resulting from threats in Australia alone are considered. The RLI of oceanic island taxa has declined faster than those on the continent or on continental islands. There were also differences in the performance of different jurisdictions within Australia.

AB  - Aim: The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) states the need to effectively conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas of particular importance for biodiversity by 2020. Here, a new indicator-based methodological framework to assess biodiversity protection afforded by marine protected areas' (MPA) was developed as a quick surrogate for MPAs' potential conservation effectiveness: the Marine Protected Area Protection Assessment Framework (MaPAF). The MaPAF consists of a limited number of headline indicators that are integrated in two indexes: Legal protection and Management effort, which eventually integrate in the overall MPA Protection super-index. The MaPAF was then tested in the Mediterranean MPA network as a case study. Spatial analyses were performed at three meaningful scales: the whole Mediterranean Sea, Mediterranean ecoregions and countries. The results of this study suggest that: 1) The MaPAF can serve as a useful tool for consistent, adaptive, quick and cost-effective MPA effectiveness assessments of MPAs and MPA networks in virtually any marine region, as the headline indicators used are commonly compiled and easy to retrieve; 2) The MaPAF proved usable and potentially relevant in the Mediterranean Sea where most indicators in the framework can be publicly accessed through the MAPAMED database and are planned to be regularly updated; 3) Protection afforded by MPAs is low across the whole Mediterranean, with only few MPAs having relatively high legal and managerial protection; and 4) Most Mediterranean countries need to devote substantially more work to improve MPA effectiveness mainly through increased management effort.

AB  - According to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No. 746/96 all member states of the EC are required to evaluate their agri-environment programmes to ascertain the environmental and socio-economic impacts. Analysing these impacts is a frontier topic for scientists with much research in progress. This article contributes to this research agenda in developing and applying a scheme for the evaluation of agri-environment measures from an ecological and economic point of view. The agri-environment programmes of all German federal states are systematically compared with regard to their impacts on biotic resources. Expert opinions obtained from a Delphi study serve as indicators for the ecological consequences of the programmes. Two measures for the ecological cost effectiveness of the agri-environment programmes are derived and applied. For the economic evaluation the cost effectiveness ratio and the benefit cost ratio of the programmes are calculated. Thus, this article presents an example for an integrated ecological-economical assessment of policy measures. It is shown that with respect to the protection of biotic resources by agri-environment programmes, no contradiction between ecology and economics exists in Germany. Improved biotic resource conservation is also economically advantageous. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) revised their recreational water quality criteria, in which adjustments were made by approving enterococci (ENT) quantitative PCR (qPCR) as an alternative; rapid method and advocating the use of predictive models for water quality management. The implementation of qPCR-based methods and prediction models are meant to decrease the time between sample collection and public advisories and notifications. To date, few studies have compared qPCR-based models to culture-based prediction models and none of these studies have been conducted in coastal estuarine systems. In this study, we created prediction models using qPCR-based fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) data in dual-use recreational and shellfish harvesting waters and compared them to published ENT and Escherichia coli (EC) culture-based prediction models in eastern North Carolina estuaries. Furthermore, an empirical statistical model was created to predict qPCR inhibition levels so that proper remediation techniques can be applied when it is a problem. Predictor variable selection in both qPCR- and culture-based ENT models was very similar; both models included 14-day rain total, dissolved oxygen, and salinity/conductivity, with 89 and 90% of qPCR and culture data described, respectively. Using ENT management action thresholds, qPCR- and culture-based models showed high accuracy in management decisions. The qPCR model had 92 and 96% accuracy using the 110 and 1000 cell equivalents (CE)/100 ml thresholds, respectively, and the culture model had 90% accuracy in management decisions with the 110 MPN/100 ml threshold. EC models for qPCR- and culture-based concentrations used similar independent variables (14-day humidity, salinity/conductivity, a rain/storm variable, and a measure of air temperature), with each model explaining 26 and 55% of the data variation, respectively. When using different thresholds that were logs apart for management decisions, the two EC models accurately predicted management decisions; qPCR models correctly predicted management decisions 96 and 77% of the time (using 31 and 320 CE/100 ml, respectively) while culture models correctly predicted management decisions 96 and 88% percent of the time (with 31 and 320 MPN/100 ml, respectively). Equivalency between models was shown in our non-point source impacted estuaries, with ENT models performing slightly better than EC models. In addition, inhibition of the qPCR was a major issue that had to be addressed. An inhibition model was created with easily obtained meteorological data and accounted for a high level of data variability (adjusted R-2 = 0.82). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The usefulness of bioindicators to study the state of the environment in different compartments (air, water, and soil) has been demonstrated for a long time. All persistent pollutants can be measured in some form of bioindicator, and numerous organisms are suitable for the biomonitoring purpose. In most of the works on this topic, bioindicators are used to highlight the impact of human activities. Generally, samples collected from polluted areas are compared with samples from an area considered as clean, or samples from areas characterized by different pollution sources are compared with each other. An approach that has not been attempted consists in correlating directly data on environmental quality obtained by bioindicators with parameters measuring the population health. In the present study, the concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn measured by atomic emission spectrometry (ICP OES) in 56 samples of holm oak bark from trees located in urban parks and along streets in a Northern Italy city were related to the data describing the health status of the citizens. The concentrations of some of the 10 trace elements in the bioindicator were found significantly correlated with mortality and morbidity data regarding cardiac and respiratory diseases. The results, although preliminary, show the potential of this approach for implementing strategies aimed for disease prevention and health promotion in urban areas at risk, with the objective of reducing environmental and health inequalities.

AB  - Background Marketplaces reflect not only the commerce of an area, but also its culture. In Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture with Kaili as its capital, Guizhou Province, China, traditional medicine is thriving in both rural and urban areas. The local people rely extensively on plants for traditional medicines, and these are commonly sold in local specialized markets. The Kaili medicinal market is the biggest in the prefecture. However, ethnobotanical study on herbal plants traded in the traditional market in Kaili has not been performed. The aims of this study are: (1) to document medicinal plants traded in the Kaili traditional market and the associated traditional knowledge; and (2) to analyze the level of agreement among vendors in the purported uses of medicinal plants by using informant consensus (FIC) and the fidelity level (FL). Methods Market surveys were conducted in 2014-2019 to collect information about medicinal plants and associated traditional knowledge. Information including vernacular names, preparation methods, and plant uses was obtained by interviewing 116 vendors of herbal plants. Specimens of fresh and dried herbs, collected as vouchers, were identified by the authors and other botanists at the Minzu University of China, and deposited in the herbarium at Minzu University of China. The level of agreement among information provided by different vendors was assessed using the FIC, and the percentage of vendors claiming the use of a certain medicinal plant for the same indication was assessed with the FL. Results The Miao people comprise 53.4% of all informants in this study of medicinal plants. In total, 237 medicinal plant species traded in the Kaili traditional market were recorded. They belong to 219 genera and 107 families. These plants have been categorized into their purported treatments for 20 medical conditions. The inflammation category showed the highest FIC value of 0.95, showing the best agreement among market vendors claiming its usefulness to treat this condition. The FL index helped to identify 15 culturally important medicinal plant species based on the reported uses by 20 or more vendors in the market. Three medicinal plant species, Eleutherococcus gracilistylus, Sargentodoxa cuneata, and Stephania cepharantha, had an FL > 90%, being used to treat sprains/traumas, rheumatism, and heat/toxins. Conclusions The medicinal plants sold in the Kaili market are highly diverse and have unique medicinal characteristics. The Miao people often use traditional herbal plants for disease prevention and thereby prioritize the use of medicinal plants in everyday life. The future of this medicinal marketplace, however, is uncertain since few young people (< 30 years old) are vendors or customers. Therefore, it is urgent to conserve traditional ethnomedicinal culture in local communities and pass on the associated traditional knowledge to future generations in this prefecture. And the next step should include further studies on FL > 90% plants' chemistry, pharmacology, biological activity, and toxicity for potentially developing functional foods or pharmaceutical products.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment has globally become the basis for environmental decision-making within government and industry for chemical substances. Regarding radioactive substances, recently revised International and European Basic Safety Standards are pushing the development of member state policy on environmental regulation in the field of radiological protection. Within this framework, existing derived effect benchmarks for ionising radiation and non-human species need to be more robust to reinforce their credibility when used as levels of exposure considered to be safe for the environment. Actually, the derivation of such benchmarks has mainly relied on laboratory studies from a limited number of species. Moreover lab species would be apparently less radiosensitive than for example terrestrial wildlife chronically exposed to ionising radiation in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Additionally to the results of such comparison that still need to be confirmed, another way to challenge benchmarks is to improve the quality/quantity of radiotoxicity data constituting the basis for a statistically-based comparison. This is the major focus of this paper where we demonstrate through various examples how to make the comparison more robust (i) by analysing the discrepancy between lab and field at the taxonomic level rather than at the ecosystem level, (ii) by extending the knowledge base making use of acute radiotoxicity data, (iii) by identifying environmental factors modifying radiological dose-effect relationship in the field.

AB  - Rapid urban land expansion not only stimulates socioeconomic development, but can lead to negative impacts that threaten regional food security, ecological construction, and sustainable urban development, including losses of cropland and habitats, the creation of housing bubbles, and reductions in biodiversity. Because these economic-socio-ecological problems are generally more serious in ecologically fragile areas, this study focuses on trends seen in Ganzhou District, a typical oasis city within the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in an arid-to-semi-arid area of China. We apply a remote-sensing (RS)-based method that incorporates 11 dimensional features of Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM +) images to map changes in urban land, and also develop a series of multi-dimensional indicators within a drivers, pressures, states, impacts, and responses (DPSIR) framework to quantify urban land expansion. The results of this study show that the urban land area of Ganzhou District in 2016 had expanded by 394.43% from 1987 levels, from 1979.64 ha to 9787.86 ha. These increasing pressures, jointly driven by gross domestic product (GDP), urban population, cropland area, and the industrial structure indicator (ISI), have led to the worsening economic-socio-ecological states and impacts of urban land expansion. Specifically, between 1987 and 2016, expansion intensity (EIPI) and expansion rate pressure indicators (ERPI) increased from 60.27 ha/a to 520.88 ha/a, and from 3.04%/a to 10.21%/a, respectively. Thus, the state indicators of economic development (EDSI), population carrying capacity (FDSI), food security (FSSI), and ecological construction (ECSI) decreased by 2.21 x 10(3) USD/ha, 17.62 population/ha, 34.20, and 10.80, respectively. Moreover, the impact indicators of economic development (EDII), population carrying capacity (FDII), and food security (FSII) decreased by 150.68 x 10(3) USD/ha, 62.12 population/ha, and 27.31, respectively, while the ecological construction impact indicator (ECII) increased by 29.39 between 1997 and 2007 and decreased by 13.31 between 2007 and 2016. Data also show that the area and proportion of cropland and ecological land occupied by urban land expansion increased over time. We therefore propose a series of economic-socio-ecological responses to help limit urban sprawl and foster compact green cities. Measures include planning urban growth boundaries, revitalizing urban centers and brownfields, using and reusing urban land more efficiently, strengthening land regulations, curbing excessive cropland expansion, cultivating more urban green spaces, and optimizing the trade-offs and synergies between multiple conflicting dimensions.

AB  - Data required from fisheries monitoring programmes substantially expand as management authorities transition to implement elements of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). EBFM extends conventional approaches of managing single fishery effects on individual stocks of target species by taking into account the effects, within a defined ecosystem, of local to regional fisheries on biodiversity, from genotypes to ecological communities. This includes accounting for fishery effects on evolutionary processes, associated and dependent species, habitats, trophic food web processes, and functionally linked systems. Despite seemingly insurmountable constraints, through examples, we demonstrate how data routinely collected in most observer programmes and how minor and inexpensive expansions of observer data fields and collection protocols supply ecological data underpinning EBFM. Observer data enable monitoring bycatch, including catch and mortality of endangered, threatened and protected species, and assessing the performance of bycatch management measures. They provide a subset of inputs for ecological risk assessments, including productivity-susceptibility analyses and multispecies and ecosystem models. Observer data are used to monitor fishery effects on habitat and to identify and protect benthic vulnerable marine ecosystems. They enable estimating collateral sources of fishing mortality. Data from observer programmes facilitate monitoring ecosystem pressure and state indicators. The examples demonstrate how even rudimentary fisheries management systems can meet the ecological data requirements of elements of EBFM.

AB  - The work studied the effects of site conditions on the amount of deadwood (DW) in managed forests in south-western Poland. Measurements included standing dead trees, snags with a diameter at breast height of at least 7 cm, and lying deadwood (logs, branches, uprooted trees, etc.) with a diameter at the thicker end of at least 10 cm. The study excluded snags and deadwood pieces with a diameter of less than 7 cm as well as stumps. Site conditions are presented according to the Polish site classification system taking into account both site fertility and water abundance. With respect of the fertility gradient, sites are classified as dystrophic, oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic. In terms of water abundance, there are two types of sites: mesic (low or very low contribution of groundwater, rainwater, and floodwater, with an approximate springtime water table depth of more than 1.8 m) and moist (moderate or considerable contribution of groundwater, rainwater, and floodwater, with an approximate springtime water table depth of 0.5-1.8 m). We analyzed data from 2522 sampling plots with area ranging from 50 to 500 m(2) and depending on forest stand age. The plots were established in forest stands older than 21 years old. The predominant tree species in the study area were Pinus sylvestris, Quercus robur, Quercus petraea, Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica, Alnus glutinosa, Fraxinus excelsior and Picea abies. In a separate analysis of data from 233 sampling plots, we studied the relationship between DW volume and the site index evaluated using a five-level classification (level I denotes sites with the highest productive capacity). Forest stands aged >80 years with the dominance of Pinus sylvestris were studied. The study showed a significant influence of site conditions on the DW volume in managed forests. Forest stands exhibiting better site conditions not only provided more timber, but also contributed with a greater amount of deadwood to the ecosystem. Forest stands with a site index of I contained as much as 4.9 m(3) of DW/ha, while stands with a site index of III only 2.4 m(3) of DW/ha. In terms of the 8 studied site types, it was also found that the average volume of DW increased with site fertility. The lowest volume of DW occurred on very nutrient-poor and mesic sites (0.6 m(3)/ha). In contrast, nutrient-rich and moist sites contained 15 times as much DW (9.5 m(3)/ha). Of paramount importance was water abundance. The volume of DW on moist sites was on average by 2.2-4.5 m(3)/ha higher than on mesic sites with the same fertility.

AB  - This paper analyzes the temporal and spatial characteristics of the coordination of urbanization and eco-environment of 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2015, using the method of coupling coordination degree model and global (local) spatial autocorrelation. The results show that the coordination of urbanization and eco-environment are in a state of basic coordination. The coupling coordination degree of each province is gradually increasing and the spatial difference gradually narrows as time evolves. A spatial dependence is observed in the coordination of provincial urbanization and eco-environment in China from the perspective of global correlation and its dependence is weakened with the increase of geographical distance. The local agglomeration mode presents a trend towards the evolution of the "high-high" clustering mode. Finally, the spatial Markov chain method is used to forecast the provincial coordination degree in 2016. It is further confirmed that the coordinated state of urbanization and eco-environment is getting better and the spatial correlation is strengthening in the future.

AB  - The IN highway and the new projected road network have been changing the critical Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus) habitat in Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro region (north-eastern Portugal). A holistic stochastic dynamic methodology (SDM) was developed for predicting changes in Iberian wolf population due to the new highways construction, increasing road traffic density and urbanization. The ecological indicators for wolf presence and abundance were estimated indirectly from the density of attacks on livestock. The low density of wild ungulates in the area makes livestock the main source of food for wolves. These indirect ecological indicators and state variables are the underlying database of our SDM model. This model focus on the interactions between conceptually isolated key-components, such as the density of attacks on livestock and changes in habitat conditions, providing some basis to analyse the responses of wolf populations to the environmental scenarios that will characterize the region in the future. The model proposed was preceded by a conventional multivariate statistical procedure (stepwise multiple regression analysis) performed to discriminate the significant relationships between livestock attacks and socio-environmental variables. The holistic parameters of the model were estimated from the results of the statistical treatment and from regional data regarding tendencies within the use of land. The simulation results demonstrate the SDM capability in capturing the trends of this changing region, namely by showing a dramatically decrease of wolf attacks in the region for the next decade.

AB  - With the introduction of national carbon neutrality targets, carbon emission reduction actions in developed countries have become a hot topic as part of the international community's drive to take action to mitigate climate change. Carbon emission efficiency is an important indicator that can be used to measure progress toward carbon emission reduction targets. The relationship between green technology innovation and carbon emission efficiency has not been adequately studied, and the transmission mechanism is not yet clear. Based on the above research gaps, taking 32 developed countries that have proposed carbon neutral targets as research samples, this paper used spatial econometric models to explore the impact of green technology innovation on carbon emission efficiency and adopted spatial mediation model and spatial moderation model to analyze the transmission effects of economic development, urbanization, and financial development on environment-related green technology and carbon emission efficiency. This paper aimed to provide a policy basis for developed countries to mitigate carbon emissions and achieve carbon neutrality goals as soon as possible. The following results were obtained: (1) Luxembourg, Norway, and Switzerland were found to be efficient in terms of carbon emissions, while most developed countries were in an inefficient state. (2) Environment-related green technology innovation significantly improved carbon emission efficiency. (3) Economic development and urbanization had a mediating role on green technology innovation and carbon emission efficiency. In other words, green technology innovation could have an indirect impact on carbon emission efficiency by influencing economic development and urbanization. (4) Financial development could positively moderate the sensitivity of carbon emission efficiency to green technology innovation. Improving the level of green technology innovation is one way to improve carbon emission efficiency, and the mediating effect of economic development and urbanization can be used as a focus point to improve carbon emission efficiency. The pressure of carbon emission reduction can be moderated by finance development. The results of this study provide theoretical support that will assist developed countries in achieving their carbon neutrality targets.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive will have instituted the concept of Ecological Quality Status (EQS) as a way to assess the biological quality of water masses. The EQS will be based mainly upon the composition of the different biological compartments in the ecosystem specially the benthos as compared to certain reference sites. Such management tools are already well established for freshwater (i.e. biotic indices), but not for coastal and estuarine (i.e. transitional) waters. In the framework of the Seine-Aval programme a workshop on benthic indicators was organized at Wimereux (France) in June 2005. The aim of this workshop and this paper is (1) to present the experiences of the Seine Aval researchers, and the French scientific approaches to benthic indicators, with those international experiences and approaches that have been published or are under development; and (2) to examine the existing benthic tools and their possible use in the characterization of the state of estuarine ecosystems. The debate during the workshop and the numerous recently published on the WFD are discussed in term of the implementation of the WFD in transitional water bodies using benthic indicators and indices. Some proposals for the future underline the needs to re-examine and adapt the different index thresholds, to take into account physical disturbances, to inventory the existing conditions vs reference conditions and to be as pragmatic as possible in using the WFD in transitional waters.

AB  - It is crucial that societies are informed on the risks of impoverished ecosystem health for their well-being. For this purpose, Ecological Integrity (EI) is a useful concept that seeks to capture the complex nature of ecosystems and their interaction with social welfare. But the challenge remains to measure EI and translate scientific terminology into operational language to inform society. We propose an approach that simplifies marine ecosystem complexity by applying scientific knowledge to identify which components reflect the state or state change of ecosystems. It follows a bottom-up structure that identifies, based on expert knowledge, biological components related with past and present changing conditions. It is structured in 5 stages that interact in an adaptive way: stage 1, in situ observations suggest changes could be happening; stage 2 explores available data that represent EI; stage 3, experts' workshops target the identification of the minimum set of variables needed to define EI, or the risk of losing EI; an optative stage 4, where deviance from EI, or risk of deviance, is statistically assessed; stage 5, findings are communicated to society. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness in three case studies, including a data poor situation, an area where lack of reference sites hampers the identification of historical changes, and an area where diffuse sources of stress make it difficult to identify simple relationships with of ecological responses. The future challenge is to operationalise the approach and trigger desirable society actions to strengthen a social-nature link.

AB  - The lek paradox, in which female choice erodes genetic variation in male sexually selected traits, is a fundamental issue in sexual selection. If females gain only genetic benefits from preferentially having their ova fertilized by males with particular traits, what maintains variation in these traits? Under strong directional selection mediated through mate choice, the alleles for beneficial male traits are expected to go to fixation and exhibit little variation. A theoretical solution to the lek paradox is the genic capture hypothesis which states that: costly male traits subject to female choice are condition dependent, that male condition is dependent on genes at many loci and exhibits additive genetic variance, and that positive genetic correlations exist between sexually selected traits and condition. Using a captive population of the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, we tested two key predictions from this model: (1) that genetic variance exists in beak color which is a sexually selected trait, but also in condition and immune function, and (2) that positive genetic correlations exist between condition and beak color, and between beak color, condition, and immune function. Genetic parameters were estimated from a large breeding experiment involving 81 sires, 972 offspring, a pedigree of 1526 individuals, using the animal model. We employed the following index of body condition: residuals from a log-log plot of body mass on tarsus length following a standardized and extended period of exercise, in which residual mass is known to reflect fat and protein reserves. Our results were broadly consistent with the genic capture hypothesis because we found (1) additive genetic variation in beak color and immune function and condition, and (2) positive genetic correlations between condition and beak color, and between condition, beak color, and several assays of immune responsiveness. However, both of these results need qualification. In the first case we identified an important general problem in estimating the coefficient of additive genetic variance (CVA) in body condition. In the second case, although most of the genetic correlations were positive as predicted, only some were statistically significant, possibly due to our relatively small sample sizes, because genetic correlations typically have large standard errors and therefore require very large samples to be statistically significant. The statistically significant, positive genetic correlations included those between beak color and immune function (response to tetanus), and between immune function (response to tetanus) and condition, both of which indicate that females gain good genes from mating with males in good condition and/or with a redder beak color. We discuss the implications of our results for devising more rigorous but pragmatic tests of the genic capture hypothesis.

AB  - It is established that the consortive protective ecotones are natural discrete structural units of plant cover, which have specific properties. A study of the consortive protective ecotones by compartmental analysis is proposed, while the degree of controllability of the consortive protective ecotones with the system of blocks-compartments depends, first of all, on the chosen optimization criteria. The system of criteria and subcriteria reveals an objective of a unit in the system of main strategy criteria, through which the final goal of management process is achieved. Analysis of such common features of these models as invariance of integral cone, dissipativity of system, stability of system in linear approximation shows that the results significantly depend on the type of description. The general algorithm of the use of indicators is substantiated, which combines the establishment and assessment of the corresponding factors of consortive protective ecotones by direct or indirect determination of their quantitative indicators as well as the creation on the basis of the multispectral data the spatial basis for assessing the impact of the objects of the railway on the state of the environment.
   Application of the information system for consortive protective ecotones is provided by creating rational modules, which include the following: appropriate organization of the territory; selection of forms and types of management taking into account the features of occurrence of dangerous processes and phenomena (including environmental risks) in consortive protective ecotones; taking measures to prevent the occurrence of environmental risks. The proposed approach includes the properties of natural complexes: multiple connections, stability, commutativity, additivity, invariance, as well as multifactorial correlation of the components of nature.

Researchers have attempted to quantify how these various threats impact different coastal ecosystems, and more recently have focused on understanding the cumulative impact from multiple threats. Here, the top threats to coastal marine ecosystems and recent efforts to understand their relative importance, ecosystem-level impacts, cumulative effects, and how they can best be managed and mitigated, are briefly reviewed. Results of threat analysis and rankings will differ depending on the conservation target (e.g., vulnerable species, pristine ecosystems, mitigatable threats), scale of interest (local, regional, or global), whether externalities are considered, and the types of management tools available (e.g., marine-protected areas versus ecosystem-based management). Considering the cumulative effect of multiple threats has only just begun and depends on spatial analysis to predict overlapping threats and a better understanding of multiple-stressor effects and interactions. Emerging conservation practices that hold substantial promise for protecting coastal marine systems include multisector approaches, such as ecosystem-based management (EBM), that account for ecosystem service valuation; comprehensive spatial management, such as ocean zoning; and regulatory mechanisms that encourage or require cross-sector goal setting and evaluation. In all cases, these efforts require a combination of public and private initiatives for success. The state of our ecological understanding, public awareness, and policy initiatives make the time ripe for advancing coastal marine management and improving our stewardship of coastal and marine ecosystems.

AB  - Municipalities have been replacing grass fields with artificial turf, which uses crumb rubber infill made from recycled tires. Crumb rubber contains hydrocarbons, organic compounds, and heavy metals. Water runoff from crumb rubber fields contains heavy metals. These components can damage the environment. We contaminated topsoil with new crumb rubber and measured its impact on earthworms and soil microbes. Specifically, we compared soil microbe activity and earthworm health, survivorship, and longevity in heat and light stress under two soil regimes: clean topsoil and clean topsoil contaminated with crumb rubber. We then characterized levels of metals, nutrients, and micronutrients of both soil treatments and compared those to published New York soil background levels and to levels set by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) as remediation goals. We found that: 1) contaminated soil did not inhibit microbial respiration rates, 2) earthworm survivorship was not impacted by exposure to contaminated soil, 3) earthworms' ability to cope with heat and light stress remained unchanged after living in contaminated soil, but 4) earthworms living in contaminated soil gained 14% less body weight than did earthworms living in uncontaminated soil. We also found that, with the exception of zinc, heavy metals in our contaminated soil did not exceed the background levels found throughout New York State or the remediation targets set by the DEC.

AB  - Brazil is the largest world producer and consumer of passion fruit. but in the last years. the national industry of juice started to import Pulp to assist the crescent demand of juice (concentrated. integral, nectar and tropical juice). Considering the fruit agro-processor cluster from the Zona da Mata Mineira, it is observed that the demand for fruit is not being fully achieved, particularly in the case of passion fruit, which is imported in nature from other states or processed (pulp) from other countries, aiming, the manufacture of ready to drink juice. Since it is a culture of fast economical return, the passion fruit plant has become attractive for the producers, but there is still lack of information about the production costs and the profitability in the agro industrial market, avoiding the spread of the culture. With the objective of giving a technical and economical support for the development of the Culture in the region, it was estimated the costs of production and the economical indicators were calculated: Net Present Value (NPV). Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Payback (PB). According to the method used for the analyses it is possible to conclude that the cultivation of the passion fruit plant is a profitable activity and of fast return and it is considered a good alternative for investment in the region.

AB  - Ecological indicators can facilitate an adaptive management approach, but only if acceptable levels for those indicators have been defined so that the data collected can be interpreted. Because acceptable levels are an expression of the desired state of the ecosystem, the process of establishing acceptable levels should incorporate not just ecological understanding but also societal values. The goal of this research was to explore an approach for defining acceptable levels of ecological indicators that explicitly considers social perspectives and values. We used a set of eight indicators that were related to issues of concern in the Lake Champlain Basin. Our approach was based on normative theory. Using a stakeholder survey, we measured respondent normative evaluations of varying levels of our indicators. Aggregated social norm curves were used to determine the level at which indicator values shifted from acceptable to unacceptable conditions. For seven of the eight indicators, clear preferences were interpretable from these norm curves. For example, closures of public beaches because of bacterial contamination and days of intense algae bloom went from acceptable to unacceptable at 7-10 days in a summer season. Survey respondents also indicated that the number of fish caught from Lake Champlain that could be safely consumed each month was unacceptably low and the number of streams draining into the lake that were impaired by storm water was unacceptably high. If indicators that translate ecological conditions into social consequences are carefully selected, we believe the normative approach has considerable merit for defining acceptable levels of valued ecological system components.

TI  - Evaluation of ecological and genetic condition of Rivne city for Micronucleus Test
T2  - ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS
LA  - English
AB  - Bioindication evaluation of air condition in the city of Rivne has been carried out using the micronucleus (MN) test on the oral mucous in ander-school-age children. The highest maximum values of MN indices were determined for children who live in the studied test ranges, where the content of CO (carbon oxide) exceeds the maximum permissible concentration. Cytogenetic indicators vary in a wide range of numerical values; moreover, the level of cytogenetic damage is an informative bioindicational feature.
   With the monitoring purpose, the researched urban area of Rivne was divided into 12 test ranges with different anthropogenic load; a number of large and small manufacturing firms are situated there. The analysis of statistical and analytical data on the traffic intensity in the city was conducted. The study was also based on the analysis of personal researches, obtained through a comprehensive survey carried out on 167 children in 12 test ranges in 12 preschools, the average age of children was 6-7 years. A total of 64,950 mucosal epithelial cells were explored.
   It has been shown that the deterioration of ecological and genetic conditions of the urban environment in test ranges I, II, VI, VII, VIII, XI based on the cell damage level was ''below average", the condition of the children's organism was "alarming" but the state of the environment has changed from "excellent" to "satisfactory".
   This kind of research can enable observations of the mutagenic background of regions, genetic health, and genetic threats to humans due to harmful factors.

AB  - Although an ecosystem approach to fisheries has been recognized as a means of progressing toward sustainable fishing, successful implementation of this approach has been limited. However, one way in which progress has been made is through the use of suites of indicators. Decision tree frameworks can be used to incorporate trends in ecological, fishing, and environmental indicators into ecosystem assessments. A relatively generic decision tree framework has been developed and successfully applied to multiple ecosystems. This framework incorporates trends in indicators, as well as the impacts of fishing pressure and environmental variability on ecological indicators in order to assess the state of each ecosystem. The inclusion of ecosystem expert knowledge from the outset ensures trends are correctly interpreted and allows analyses to contribute to global comparisons in a robust and meaningful manner. Although ecological and environmental indicators are well developed, those addressing the human dimensions of marine ecosystems are less so. This framework holds the potential to incorporate such indicators in order to fully assess marine ecosystems in a comparative context. Such assessments could help ensure food security from marine resources into the future as well as ensuring the well-being of coastal communities. Here critical review of the potential value of this framework has been conducted, with its usefulness emphasized in the similarities it holds, and in the contribution it could make, to current global methods of ecosystem assessments.

AB  - Ecological status, according to EU Water Framework Directive, is an expression of the quality of the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems associated with surface waters. It can be compromised by different forms of hydrological alterations. In this paper some aspects of fast and frequent fluctuations of discharge, most often caused by production of electric energy to meet peek demands or so called "hydro-peaking" has been studied. Two "hydro-peaking" indicators defined in CEN guidance standard have been evaluated for the undisturbed gauging stations in the Danube River basin in Croatia and correlated to watershed size descriptors and fitting Indicators of Hydrological Alterations. Additional third indicator based on discharge, analogous to indicator from CEN, was introduced and studied in the same way. Results have revealed that on majority of examined gauging stations values of indicators exceed boundaries for "near-natural" and "slightly modified" state. It appears that the use of analogous discharge based indicator instead of level based indicator has some advantages such as easier application and potential for more reliable regionalisation. Reliability of relationship of the third hydro-peaking indicator, based on hourly flow data, to Indicators of Hydrological Alterations, based on daily flow data, indicates the possibility of using significantly larger pool of daily data for definition of reference (undisturbed) conditions for sub-daily flow variations.

AB  - Remote sensing is the only technology that can systematically monitor physical properties of the biosphere over a vast region. However, it is still a challenge to make these measures meaningful for assessing the impacts of environmental perturbation. Here, we integrate an optical remote sensing system termed EcoiRS (Ecosystem observation by an integrated Remote Sensing system) specifically for this purpose. EcoiRS consists of three subsystems: an off-the-shelf atmospheric correction model (ACORN), a cloud/shadow removal model, and an advanced spectral mixture analysis model (AutoMCU). The core of ACORN is a set of radiative transfer codes that can be used to remove the effects of molecular/aerosol scatterings and water vapor absorption from remotely sensed data, and to convert these digital signals to surface reflectance. Shadow and cloud cover that would obscure the reflective properties of land surfaces in an image can be minimized by referring to their optical and thermal spectral profiles. AutoMCU executes iterative unmixing for each pixel using selected spectral end-members based upon the rule of Monte Carlo simulation. The main outcomes of EcoiRS include cover fractions of green vegetation, non-photosynthetically active vegetation and bare soils, along with uncertainty measures for each pixel. The dynamics of these derived products are significant indicators for monitoring the change of states of terrestrial environments, and they can be used for investigating different environmental perturbations. Here, we demonstrate studies of implementing EcoiRS to map three major but relatively less studied cases in a western Pacific island (Taiwan): typhoons, tree diseases and alien plant invasion.

AB  - The transition to a "green" economic model is a complex strategic task that requires a combination of two previously incompatible development vectors: maintaining dynamic economic growth and preserving the natural environment on a long-term basis. No country has yet been able to cope with such complexity, nevertheless, the active search for a new balanced model continues, with the development of appropriate strategies. China is among the countries moving in this direction.
   The article analyzes the influence of social, economic, and environmental factors upon the prospects for the development of a green economy and the preservation of natural areas in China. The dynamics of changes in the ecological situation from 1970 to 2018 is investigated. The authors propose a methodology for assessing the state of the environment based on demographic dynamics, economic indicators, and the level of technological development. Over the past 50 years, China has experienced intensive industrial development as a result of which the degradation of valuable natural assets is increasing in most regions. At the same time, efforts are being made in a number of provinces to remedy the situation through the formulation of new policies, the first results of which have been already visible. The government has established a new environmental legislation designed to scale the green practices of the pioneering regions throughout the country, including the trend toward the de-urbanization of individual megacities and others. The implementation of this strategy will be facilitated by the expansion of interdisciplinary scientific research, the development of complex technological solutions, and development programs that simultaneously take into account various factors.

AB  - Systemic global environmental changes are manifested in the whole Earth system and represent the global effects of anthropogenic activity on the environment. Global climate changes are included in these global environmental changes. The combined effects of climate change, extreme weather and human alterations of the environment are especially pronounced in the coastal zone where people and ecosystem goods and services are most concentrated and inputs of energy and matter from land, sea and air converge. These realities call for a more systemic and adaptive approach to resource management, environmental protection, coastal zone management, coastal engineering, an approach that considers the effects both of human activities and natural variability change in an ecosystem context. Implementing such an approach requires the capability to routinely and rapidly detect and predict changes in the state of the coastal environment. Identifying variations in hydrothermal Romanian Black Sea coastal area will be based on data about temperature, rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Period considered is 1999-2008, and coastal stations Sulina, Constanta and Mangalia are analysed. Data used have hydrothermal character and provide information on water demand of the atmosphere, depending on the size of the temperature factor. Temporal variability of hydrothermal factors is presented with some statistical parameters. They are linked as indicators of central tendency and dispersion measurement. A model for estimating the distribution of intra-annual values for hydrothermal factors is proposed for the period analysed.

AB  - Sustainability is rapidly moving from an abstract concept to a measurable state of dynamic human-ecological systems. The large number of economic, social, and environmental indicators currently available provides an unwieldy view of system sustainability. To aid policy decisions, these indicators are therefore either presented in the context of a conceptual framework, or quantitatively aggregated into indices. Due to the quantitative nature of sustainability indices, their results may be given more weight by scientists and policy-makers. However, policy decisions can be ineffective or even counterproductive if they do not consider factors which influence index behavior: the scale of the available data and choice of system boundaries; the inclusion, transformation, and weighting of indicator data; and the aggregation method used. As previous reviews have demonstrated, sustainability indices do not rank countries consistently, even when using some of the same indicator data. Several improvements would increase the utility of sustainability indices for policy decisions, particularly the identification of biases introduced by the index methodology and data inclusion. The discrepancy of current sustainability indices due to theoretical or methodological differences supports the use of several complementary indices. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study compared vaginal temperature, physiologic, and productive parameters in lactating dairy cows supplemented or not with Omnigen-AF (Phibro Animal Health, Teaneck, NJ) during the summer months in a tropical environment. Thirty-two lactating, primiparous (n = 16) and multiparous (n = 16) pregnant Holstein x Gir cows were ranked by parity, days in milk, body weight, and body condition score (BCS), and assigned to receive (SUPP; n = 16) or not (CON; n = 16) Omnigen-AF (Phibro Animal Health, Teaneck, NJ) at 56 g/cow daily (as-fed basis). During the experimental period (d -6 to 56), cows were maintained in a single drylot pen with ad libitum access to water and a total mixed ration, and milked twice daily. Cows received Omnigen-AF mixed with 200 g of corn (as-fed basis) after the daily morning milking through self-locking head gates, whereas CON cows concurrently received 56 g of kaolin mixed with 200 g of corn. For feed intake evaluation, cows from both treatments were randomly divided in 4 groups of 8 cows each, and allocated to 8 individual feeding stations for 3 d. Intake was evaluated 4 times per group from d 1 to 56. From d -6 to 0, d 15 to 28, and d 43 to 56, cow vaginal temperature was recorded hourly. Environmental temperature-humidity index (THI) was also recorded hourly from d 15 to 28 and d 43 to 56. Cows were evaluated for body weight and BCS on d -6 and 56, individual milk production was recorded daily from d -6 to 56, and milk samples were collected on d -6, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 for analyses of somatic cell count and milk components. Blood samples were collected on d -6, -3, 0, 9, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 36, 45, 48, 51, 54, and 56. Results from samples or observations collected from d -6 to 0 were included as an independent covariate in each respective analysis. Environmental THI was 74.2 +/- 0.5 and cows were exposed to THI >68 for 633 h within a total of 672 h of evaluation. Cows assigned to CON had greater vaginal temperature on d 28, 43, 45, and from d 48 to 55 (by 0.38 to 0.52%), as well as greater mean somatic cell count (by 97%) and serum haptoglobin concentrations (by 89%) compared with SUPP cows. Cows assigned to SUPP had greater mean dry matter intake (by 7%), BCS on d 56 (by 11%), and mean serum insulin concentrations (by 35%) compared with CON cows. Hence, SUPP ameliorated hyperthermia, improved nutritional status, and modulated systemic and mammary gland immune parameters in lactating dairy cows exposed to heat stress conditions.

AB  - Protected areas, such as wilderness, form the foundation of most strategies to conserve biological diversity. However, the success of protected areas in achieving conservation goals depends partly on how well ecological diversity is represented in a network of designated lands. We examined how well the world's largest highly-protected conservation network the U.S. National Wilderness Preservation System (NWPS) currently represents ecological systems found on federal lands in the contiguous United States and how ecological system representation has accumulated over the 50-year tenure of the Wilderness Act (passed in 1964 and giving the U.S. Congress authority to establish wilderness areas). Although the total area of NWPS has risen fairly steadily since 1964, the diversity of ecological systems accumulated in wilderness areas (436 ecological systems) reached an asymptote 30 years ago that is well below the total pool of ecological systems available (553) on federal lands. Thus, NWPS currently underrepresents ecological system diversity. Additionally, only 113 ecological systems are represented at more than 20% of federal land area. As the designation of new wilderness areas becomes more difficult, it is important to increase the ecological representation of those areas to achieve greater protection of biological diversity. Over the next 50 years of the Wilderness Act, federal land-management agencies and the U.S. Congress could increase the ecological diversity of wilderness areas by prioritizing under-represented ecological systems in new wilderness legislation.

AB  - Farmland biodiversity and food webs were compared in conventional and genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops of beet (Beta vulgaris L.), maize (Zea mays L.) and both spring and winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). GMHT and conventional varieties were sown in a split-field experimental design, at 60-70 sites for each crop, spread over three starting years beginning in 2000. This paper provides a background to the study and the rationale for its design and interpretation. It shows how data on environment, field management and the biota are used to assess the current state of the ecosystem, to define the typical arable field and to devise criteria for selecting, sampling and auditing experimental sites in the Farm Scale Evaluations. The main functional and taxonomic groups in the habitat are ranked according to their likely sensitivity to GMHT cropping, and the most responsive target organisms are defined. The value of the seedbank as a baseline and as an indicator of historical trends is proposed. Evidence from experiments during the twentieth century is analysed to show that large changes in field management have affected sensitive groups in the biota by ca. 50% during a year or short run of years-a figure against which to assess any positive or negative effects of GMHT cropping. The analysis leads to a summary of factors that were, and were not, examined in the first 3 years of the study and points to where modelling can be used to extrapolate the effects to the landscape and the agricultural region.

AB  - Rangelands are grasslands, shrublands, and savannas used by wildlife for habitat and livestock in order to produce food and fiber. Assessment and monitoring of rangelands are currently based on comparing the plant species present in relation to an expected successional end-state defined by the ecological site. In the future, assessment and monitoring may be based on indicators of ecosystem health, including sustainability of soil, sustainability of plant production, and presence of invasive weed species. USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are actively engaged in developing quantitative, repeatable, and low-cost methods to measure indicators of ecosystem health using remote sensing. Noxious weed infestations can be determined by careful selection of the spatial resolution, spectral bands, and timing of image acquisition. Rangeland productivity can be estimated with either Landsat or Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data using models of gross primary production based on radiation use efficiency. Lidar measurements are useful for canopy structure and soil roughness, indicating susceptibility to erosion. The value Of remote sensing for rangeland management depends in part on combining the imagery with other spatial data within geographic information systems. Finally, ARS scientists are developing the knowledge on which future rangeland assessment and monitoring tools will be developed.

AB  - Sustainable cities' growth and developmental pattern relies on design and planning that meets its inhabitants' needs. Seemingly, in these cities mixed-use buildings exists as skyline dots of vertical, horizontal and as shared 'premises' building dimensions. Essentially, mixed-use buildings are gradually replacing urban neighbourhood zooning design and building configurations particularly along major streets in the built environment. Significantly, Lagos state government in Nigeria has invested in the development of Model City Plans (MCPs) as district and neighbourhood regenerating process of which mixed-use building concept is an essential part of the scheme. Hence the need to develop a sustainability guide for mixed-use buildings leveraged on the experience of stakeholders particularly the inhabitants of these environments. The study therefore aims to establish critical indicators applicable for a sustainable mixed-use building development in Lagos, Nigeria. The study adopted questionnaire survey in soliciting for data which was thereafter analysed using inferential statistics. In this regard 341 respondents inhabiting mixed-use buildings were surveyed after selection through random sampling. Thereafter a trail of inferential statistics with empirical evidences evolved relating the critical indicators necessary for sustainability of mixed-use building as inspired by the users. The outcome established six (6) domains termed critical indicators because of the significant association of their factors for mixed-use building sustainability in Lagos, Nigeria. Notably, these developed domains adequately considered the pillars of sustainability relevant to mixed-use unlike existing guides that are mostly mono-dimension. Hence it is expected that the proposed indicators promote sustainable mixed-use, enhance sustainable city growth, creates resilient and self-sustaining cities.

AB  - Diatoms are frequently used as indicators of eutrophication in temperate systems, but little is known about their application to impacted African tropical systems. Five streams located within Gombe Stream National Park and five streams supporting human settlements draining into Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, were investigated for species composition, richness and diversity of epilithic algae. In addition, a trophic diatom index (TDI) developed for monitoring European rivers was applied to these tropical systems. 54 specific and infraspecific diatom taxa representing 20 genera were identified for all sites with Achnanthes s.l., Gomphonema and Navicula s.l. being the most common genera. Species richness varied between 10 and 21 in disturbed streams and 13 and 19 in undisturbed streams. Nutrients were significantly enriched in streams draining the deforested watersheds but indices of diversity and evenness (Shannon H, J and Simpson-Yule D, E) did not show any significant differences between streams in forested and deforested watersheds. Significant differences were observed between pooled data for the TDI between forested and deforested watersheds. Analysis of percent pollution tolerant diatom taxa indicates that organic pollution of streams in deforested watersheds may be contributing to eutrophication. This study shows that African diatoms, cosmopolitan or resembling well-known North American and European taxa, allows for trophic indices tailored to the autecological preferences of species to be applied to new regions, although intensive studies on these African taxa will lead to more accurate results. Measures of species-richness and diversity, historically used to describe the state of an ecosystem, may not be suitable to evaluate streams which are not grossly polluted.

AB  - QuestionEcosystem engineer patch dynamics can drive biodiversity patterns by controlling habitat heterogeneity. We studied changes to composition and diversity of shrub patch understorey plant communities to patch stage at a small scale, and to patch dynamics at larger scales. These patch dynamics were driven by widespread mortality of the facilitating engineer shrub Noaea mucronata, following a drought period.
   LocationPark Shaked LTER station, semi-arid northern Negev Desert, Israel.
   MethodsWe used diversity partitioning and similarity-based metrics to relate annual plant diversity to shrub state at the scale of individual patches, and to the ecosystem engineer shrub mortality rates at larger scales. We separately tested changes to species diversity within patches and to assemblage variation among patches.
   Results(1) At the patch scale, annual plant richness and diversity decreased following the loss of shrub canopy. (2) Community similarity among patches increased following shrub mortality, with a significant increase in the abundance of one dominant grass species and a decrease of most other species. (3) Taken together, these factors led to a plot-scale loss of diversity under high rates of shrub mortality. (4) Species richness and evenness metrics were significantly correlated with the shrub mortality gradient. (5) Overall, high mortality rates resulted in landscapes that were more homogeneous in both habitat structure and community composition.
   ConclusionsEcosystem engineer population dynamics and the dynamics of their patches can drive community-level processes. In our case, biodiversity patterns are strongly driven by shrub patch dynamics at all scales examined. In other ecosystems where the engineer patches are well studied and easily recognized, they can be used as indicators of ecosystem and community state.

AB  - Leachate formation is one of the many environmental hazards associated with landfilling. The leachate may migrate from the landfill to surface water and groundwater, posing a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems. Moreover, its harmful effect on human health and life has been proven. Due to the risks that landfill leachates may pose, it is necessary to control the state of the environment in their surroundings. The paper presents an example of the application of selected statistical methods (basic statistics, statistical tests, principal component analysis) to assess the impact of individual pollution indicators on the quality of landfill leachates. The conducted analysis showed the existence of significant differences between the surveyed active (Legnica, Jawor) and non-operational (Wroclaw, Bielawa) landfills in Poland. These differences were especially visible in the cases of the following: electric conductivity (EC) (non-operational landfills 1915-5075 mu S/cm, active 5093-11,370 mu S/cm), concentrations of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) (non-operational landfills 0.18-294.5 mg N/dm(3), active 167.56-907.4 mg N/dm(3)), chemical oxygen demand (COD), organic nitrogen (ON), ammonium nitrogen (AN), total solids (TS), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), sulfates, chlorides, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and nickel. Selected indicators should help to determine the progress of decomposition processes inside the landfill and the potential impact of leachate on the environment, and should be used in the mandatory monitoring of landfills.

AB  - The implementation of land use planning (LUP) has a large impact on environmental quality. There lacks a widely accepted and consolidated approach to assess the LUP environmental impact using Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). In this paper, we developed a state-impact-state (SIS) model employed in the LUP environmental impact assessment (LUPEA). With the usage of Matter-element (ME) and Extenics method, the methodology based on the SIS model was established and applied in the LUPEA of Zoucheng County, China. The results show that: (1) this methodology provides an intuitive and easy understanding logical model for both the theoretical analysis and application of LUPEA; (2) the spatial multi-temporal assessment from base year, near-future year to planning target year suggests the positive impact on the environmental quality in the whole County despite certain environmental degradation in some towns; (3) besides the spatial assessment, other achievements including the environmental elements influenced by land use and their weights, the identification of key indicators in LUPEA, and the appropriate environmental mitigation measures were obtained; and (4) this methodology can be used to achieve multi-temporal assessment of LUP environmental impact of County or Town level in other areas.

AB  - Over the past decade, Europe's Water Framework Directive provided compelling reasons for developing tools for the biological assessment of freshwater ecosystem health in member States. Yet, the lack of published study for Europe's overseas regions reflects minimal knowledge of the distribution patterns of aquatic species in Community's outermost areas. Benthic invertebrates (84 taxa) and land-cover, physical habitat and water chemistry descriptors (26 variables) were recorded at fifty-one stations in Martinique, French Lesser Antilles. Canonical Correspondence Analysis and Ward's algorithm were used to bring out patterns in community structure in relation to environmental conditions, and variation partitioning was used to specify the influence of geomorphology and anthropogenic disturbance on invertebrate communities. Species richness decreased from headwater to lowland streams, and species composition changed from northern to southern areas. The proportion of variation explained by geomorphological variables was globally higher than that explained by anthropogenic variables. Geomorphology and land cover played key roles in delineating ecological sub-regions for the freshwater biota. Despite this and the small surface area of Martinique (1080 km(2)), invertebrate communities showed a clear spatial turnover in composition and biological traits (e.g., insects, crustaceans and molluscs) in relation to natural conditions.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
LA  - English
AB  - The damaged state of the environment in what was Czechoslovakia seemed to symbolise all that was at fault with the Soviet political, social, and economic model. In response to increased domestic and international concern about levels of pollution, plus the Fact that the new government included former dissidents who had been involved in the clandestine environmental movement prior to the revolution, the environment was identified as a key priority in 1990. The tenth anniversary of the collapse of communist rule provided an appropriate point at which to assess the progress made and to consider the development of environmental capacity in the Czech Republic. Although I broadly adopt the conceptual framework of 'environmental capacity building' in this paper, I also argue that any assessment of environmental policy must focus primarily on the underlying processes of political, social, and economic: reform that, in conjunction, continue to shape environmental policy and strategies. Thus, the objective here is to consider the impact of economic reform on the environment, how a decade of political reform has affected environmental nongovernmental organisations, and what has been the actual result of external aid and assistance. Two overriding points emerge from the discussion. First, much of the improvement in levels of pollution is in fact attributable to the decline in manufacturing output rather than conservation measures or large-scale restructuring. Second, the strengthening of environmental capacity is inextricably linked to the complex process of democratic consolidation and is thus constrained not just by the legacies of communist rule, but by the evolving relationship between society, the global economy, and the state.

AB  - The article analyzes approaches to determining the risk of emergencies, as well as, based on foreign experience in determining the integral risk index (INFORM methodology) of emergencies, the authors propose a modified formula adapted to the conditions of the Siberian Federal District. The INFORM methodology includes about 50 different indicators for measuring hazards and their impact, vulnerability indicators, etc. According to the developers, the INFORM methodology is a convenient comparative analysis tool for identifying the most vulnerable regions, regions, and municipalities. The main advantage of the methodology is the presence of three aspects that cannot be changed, and the categories and components included in the aspects can be. In order to bring the calculation of the integral risk index from emergencies closer to the sphere of natural and technosphere safety, we proposed a modified methodology, which included aspects exclusively related to natural and technosphere safety. The proposed methodology in no way contradicts the INFORM methodology. The values of a number of coefficients are established for the purpose of analyzing the situation for counteracting and mitigating the consequences of emergencies (ES) and natural hazards (NH). The authors have proposed a number of formulas for assessing a number of parameters in the field of natural and technospheric safety. Based on the results of calculating the coefficients, zoning of the subjects of the Siberian Federal District was carried out using map schemes. Among the subjects on the maps, groups of entities with high and low indicators of the integrated risk index, the risk factor for the transition of a natural hazard to an emergency, the coefficient of vulnerability of the population and the territory of the Siberian Federal District from natural and man-made emergencies were identified. According to the data obtained for calculating the risk factor for the transition of a hazardous natural phenomenon to an emergency state, the average maximum value among subjects was identified in the Irkutsk Region - 70.6 %; Novosibirsk region 53.2 %; Omsk region - 67.7%, Kemerovo region - 60.2 %; Republic of Khakassia - 55.6 %. According to the values of the coefficient of protection against natural disasters, the index of insufficiency of the potential for emergency response, the subjects were ranked in tables based on the data obtained. The coefficient of protection against natural disasters showed that the greatest protection against natural disasters is observed in the Tomsk region, Krasnoyarsk Territory, Kemerovo Region. The lowest values of the coefficient of protection, and, accordingly, the least potential of protection against disasters, are observed in the Republic of Tyva, Altai Territory, the Republic of Buryatia, Transbaikal Territory. According to the index of insufficiency of emergency response potential, the greatest potential for emergency response in the subjects was noted in the Tomsk Region, Krasnoyarsk Territory, Kemerovo Region, Omsk Region.

AB  - Soil erosion has been identified as the primary abiotic driver of site degradation on many semiarid rangelands. A key indicator of erosion potential that is being increasingly implemented in rangeland evaluations is soil aggregate stability (AS) as measured by a field soil slake test. However, there have been few studies that test if decreasing AS is an indication of increasing soil erosion. A rainfall simulator experiment was conducted in southeastern Arizona to measure runoff and erosion, aggregate stability, and cover attributes on three vegetation states of the state-and-transition model (STM) of the Loamy Upland ecological site (R041XC313AZ). The states included the reference state (RS), a site encroached by mesquite (MN), and a site invaded by Eragrostis lehmanniana (ML). Within the context of the STM, runoff was only different between very high and low cover states. Erosion and AS values differentiated among states, particularly between the RS and MN states. Relationships between runoff and erosion with canopy cover and interspace bare soil suggest that certain cover levels exist where runoff and erosion have the potential to increase. The results also indicated that for this ecological site, AS < 4 may represent an increased risk of erosion occurrence. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable Development (SD) has played a major role as a foundation of several policy making frameworks developed mainly by international organizations. In this paper, some critical points regarding the origination and formulation of the SD concept are discussed. It is argued that the SD concerns with selected sectors and regions rather than the whole society and all regions of the world. To tackle these shortcomings, the conventional definition of SD is extended in this paper according to a broad philosophy of harmonizing key aspects of human, nature and systems performances over generations. Based on this extended definition, an improved Driving Force-State-Response (DSR-HNS) policy making framework is introduced. The main contribution is the modeling of the state block by human, nature and systems components to design overall and coherent policies. A procedure using the framework is also elaborated to monitor the current policies and design new ones, which provides a dynamic, nonlinear, feedback controlled policy making practice, not accommodated by existing policy making frameworks. Finally, a case study is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the modified framework and the proposed model. The study assesses Iran's electric power generation system from sustainability point of view and develops new policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mussels are often used as a biological bio-indicator for the quality assessment of marine ecosystems. Adopting this approach, the present work aims to study the initial health status of two ecosystems in Agadir Bay, Morocco expected to receive seawater desalination plant effluents. This study was conducted between February 2015 and March 2017 in two stations, Tifnit-Douira and Cap Ghir. In addition to the gametic development, variations of sex ratio and gonadal index were also determined. The reproductive cycle of Mytilus galloprovincialis is spread throughout the year. Under natural conditions, three collective spawning periods were observed. The main one was during the spring and the two other periods were optional and were in winter and summer. Variations of seawater temperature can make some changes in mussel spawning, with one principal period lasting during spring and summer and the optional one during winter. In both studied stations, sexual rest was manifested by a small percentage of the population particularly during summer, and could not reach the whole population at the same time. This finding is consistent with the gonadal index that never reached the value of 1. A unique hermaphroditism case was revealed in Tifnit-Douira mussels, and it remained statistically insignificant. The sex ratio was perfectly balanced in both stations and was in favour of males. The gonad histology did not show any cellular abnormalities in the germinal tissue. These results are of great importance since they characterize the current state of the studied stations area before the installation of the desalination plant. This state must be maintained after installation in order to preserve the typical halieutic resources of these ecosystems. The present findings confirm the good environmental health status and the aquaculture potential of Agadir Bay, especially in the north ecosystems (Cap Ghir) due to upwelling-nutritional intake and optimum seawater temperature.

AB  - To elucidate the determinants of intertidal invertebrate body temperatures during aerial exposure, I developed deterministic models using the environmental inputs of solar radiation, air temperature, ground temperature, and wind speed to predict the body temperatures of intertidal mussels (Mytilus spp.). Combined with field studies, these models were used to determine the effects of body size on body temperature, and to compare the heat budgets of mussels living as solitary individuals vs. those living in aggregations (beds). On average, the model accurately predicted the body temperatures of solitary mussels in the field to within similar to 1 degrees C. Steady-state simulations (using constant environmental conditions) predicted that, under conditions where evaporative water loss is limited, smaller (5 cm) mussels experience lower body temperatures than larger (10 cm) mussels exposed to identical environmental parameters. When evaporative cooling is limited only by intolerance to desiccation, the trend in body size reversed due to a disproportionately greater amount of tissue (per unit length) in larger mussels, which provides them with a greater reservoir of water available for evaporative cooling. In both scenarios, larger mussels display a greater "thermal inertia" (time constant of change), which buffers them against rapid changes in environmental conditions. No one environmental factor controls body temperature, and thus measurements of single environmental parameters such as air temperature are very unlikely to serve as accurate indicators of mussel body temperature. Results of unsteady simulations (using fluctuating environmental conditions) further indicated a significant effect of the spectral characteristics of the physical environment on body temperature. In many cases predictions of body temperature based only on daily means or extremes of environmental parameters are off by 6 degrees C or more due to the time dependence of the system. Models of body temperature must therefore be based upon repeated measurements of multiple environmental parameters, rather than simple statistical measures such as daily mean, maximum, or range. Significantly, several parameters in the model presented here are modified by the proximity of neighboring organisms, including predators and competitors. During extreme environmental conditions (using steady-state conditions), mussels living in beds are predicted to experience substantially lower (4 degrees-5 degrees C) body temperatures than those living in gaps. Furthermore, living within an aggregation also augments a mussel's thermal inertia, which dampens the effects of rapid temporal changes in the physical environment. In contrast to most previous studies in rocky intertidal habitats, results thus suggest that "physical factors" are not immutable boundaries imposed by the environment, but may be significantly altered by the organism itself through its size, morphology, and interactions with neighbors, which may create feedback loops between abiotic and biotic controls.

Research on the natural capital flow and stock is helpful to analyze the utilization of natural capital and promote its sustainable development. Thus, we attempted to combine the three-dimensional ecological footprint model with the decoupling model and GM(1,1) model to analyze the current and future state of land natural capital utilization, and then analyze the status of decoupling between economic development and the sustainable use of the land natural capital. The results showed that: (1) Overall, the land footprint and land capacity in the hinterland of the Three Gorges Reservoir area increased. The occupation of the land natural capital flow increased, and the footprint depth first increased and then decreased. (2) The utilization ratio of capital stock to the flows of cultivated land increased, and the space for sustainable utilization of natural capital was larger. The gray prediction showed that the ratio of capital stock to the flows in all the districts and counties of the study area will increase from 2022. (3) A decoupling relationship existed between the utilization ratio of the stock flow and Gross Domestic Product as a whole, indicating that the pressure of economic development on the sustainable utilization of natural capital has always existed. This study has a certain reference value to construct an ecological civilization in the hinterland of the Three Gorges Reservoir and formulate relevant policies on the increase of rural land natural capital.

AB  - Ecosystem models, specifically multispecies dynamic models, have been increasingly used to project impacts of fishing activity on the trophodynamics of ecosystems to support ecosystem-based fisheries management. Uncertainty is unavoidable in modelling processes and needs to be recognized and properly quantified before models are utilized. Uncertainty was assessed in this study for a multispecies size-spectrum model that quantifies community structure and ecological characteristics. The uncertainty was assumed to result from errors in fish life-history and metabolic scale parameters, environmental variability, fishing variability, and sampling errors. Given the same level of imprecision, metabolic scale parameters had the dominant influence on the uncertainty of the size spectrum modelling results, followed by life-history parameters. Both types of errors led to "scenario uncertainty", suggesting the possible existence of alternative states of community structure. Environmental variability, fishing variability, and observation errors resulted in "statistical uncertainty", implying that such uncertainty can be described adequately in statistical terms. The results derived from such a simulation study can provide guidance for identifying research priorities to help narrow the gap in scientific knowledge and reduce the uncertainty in fisheries management.

AB  - It is now widely recognised that components of the environment play the role of economic assets, termed natural capital, that are a foundation of social and economic development. National governments monitor the state and trends of natural capital through a range of activities including natural capital accounting, national ecosystem assessments, ecosystem service valuation, and economic and environmental analyses. Indicators play an integral role in these activities as they facilitate the reporting of complex natural capital information. One factor that hinders the success of these activities and their comparability across countries is the absence of a coherent framework of indicators concerning natural capital (and its benefits) that can aid decision-making. Here we present an integrated Natural Capital Indicator Framework (NCIF) alongside example indicators, which provides an illustrative structure for countries to select and organise indicators to assess their use of, and dependence on, natural capital. The NCIF sits within a wider context of indicators related to natural, human, social and manufactured capital, and associated flows of benefits. The framework provides decision-makers with a structured approach to selecting natural capital indicators with which to make decisions about economic development that take into account national natural capital and associated flows of benefits.

AB  - The Buffalo River area of concern (AOC) was assigned an impaired status for the fish tumors and other deformities beneficial use impairment category by the New York State Department of Environmental Protection in 1989. This was initially based on an inadequately documented brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) feeding study using river sediment extracts. The presence of liver tumors was subsequently supported by reports of a 19 to 27% prevalence in wild brown bullhead between 1983 and 1988 and a 4.8% prevalence in 1998. However, neither fish size (or age) nor sample locations were given, and histopathological definitions were inconsistent in these previous studies. Therefore, in 2008, we re-evaluated the prevalence of hepatocellular and chloangiocellular tumors (as well as other gross indicators of fish health) in brown bullhead averaging 25 cm in length collected from three reaches of the Buffalo River and recorded our collection sites by global positioning system. Among the 37 fish of appropriate size collected, only three exhibited liver tumors (8%). The tumors were evenly distributed within the three reaches, and only hepatocellular tumors were found. There were no differences in the prevalence of hepatic foci of alteration, body weight, length, or hepatosomatic index among the three reaches, but the conditions factor was significantly lower in fish from reach 2. Natural attenuation of water and sediment quality are the most likely causes for the decrease in liver tumors. The prevalence of liver tumors between 1998 and 2008 in the Buffalo River is similar to that found in recovery-stage AOCs and some Great Lakes reference areas. Environ. Toxicol.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. The Tatarbunars'kyi District is located in the southwestern part of Odessa region and reflects the main features of the landscape-economic structure of the region: water, agricultural, resort and environmental areas. On the other hand, the form of land use is characterized by widespread plowing of land with degradation and erosion of soil cover.
   Land structure and use patterns have a complex negative impact on ecological and economic processes and cannot ensure the sustainable development of the region, in particular it is antagonistic to the unique transitional wetland ecosystems of international importance located within the area.
   To solve the issues of balanced environmental management and zoning of the landscape and economic structure of the region, Earth remote sensing (ERS) data can be used - spectrozonal satellite imagery and geographic information systems (GIS), which can simultaneously cover the research area as a whole, carry out regular monitoring and significantly reduce costs by expensive expeditionary work. Using space monitoring data allows you to get a large array of characteristics of the state of the territorial complexes of the region.
   Purpose of the work is: assessment of the ecological state of the landscape economic structure and development of recommendations for the protection of natural and territorial complexes of the Tatarbunar 'skyi District of Odessa region based on the use of GIS and remote sensing data.
   Methods. Landsat8 satellite images with OLI and TIRS sensors, digital terrain models (SRTM) with a spatial resolution of 30 m were used as initial data. The spatial distribution of the population was carried out on the basis of OpenStreetMap data using automatic interpolation using the IDW method. Spatial analysis and data processing were carried out in the QGIS v3.4.6 software package. To quantify the vegetation cover, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI was calculated. Waterlog distribution was estimated using a modified normalized differential moisture index (NDMI). The analysis of the structure of land use and anthropogenic load was carried out on the basis of ranking of territorial objects into homogeneous groups to calculate geoecological coefficients.
   Results. The article discusses the possibilities of using Earth remote sensing data for a functional assessment of land changes as a result of anthropogenic activities, primarily arable land, analyzes the ecological and economic equilibrium of the region based on geoecological coefficients, identifies areas that are primarily exposed to environmental risks, exogenous processes and the impact anthropogenic factors. Measures are proposed to increase the environmental sustainability of agrolandscapes and the landscape-anthropogenic structure of the region's lands. A detailed hydrological and morphometric analysis of the catchment basin was carried out. Karachaus within the boundaries of the District. For the catchment estuary, remediation and nature conservation measures based on GIS are proposed and designed.

AB  - Encompassing the breadth of biodiversity in biomonitoring programmes has been frustrated by an inability to simultaneously identify large numbers of species accurately and in a timely fashion. Biomonitoring infers the state of an ecosystem from samples collected and identified using the best available taxonomic knowledge. The advent of DNA barcoding has now given way to the extraction of bulk DNA from mixed samples of organisms in environmental samples through the development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS). This DNA metabarcoding approach allows an unprecedented view of the true breadth and depth of biodiversity, but its adoption poses two important challenges. First, bioinformatics techniques must simultaneously perform complex analyses of large datasets and translate the results of these analyses to a range of users. Second, the insights gained from HTS need to be amalgamated with concepts such as Linnaean taxonomy and indicator species, which are less comprehensive but more intuitive. It is clear that we are moving beyond proof-of-concept studies to address the challenge of implementation of this new approach for environmental monitoring and regulation. Interpreting Darwin's 'tangled bank' through a DNA lens is now a reality, but the question remains: how can this information be generated and used reliably, and how does it relate to accepted norms in ecosystem study?
   This article is part of the themed issue 'From DNA barcodes to biomes'.

AB  - New Zealand operated two soil quality-monitoring programmes between 1995 and 2001 to test methods and provide data about sustainable land use for state of the environment reporting. The objective of this paper is to report on the strengths and weaknesses in the programmes to assist others wishing to set up monitoring programmes. The New Zealand programmes required the voluntary participation of the 16 autonomous regional authorities that have the legal responsibility for environmental monitoring at a regional scale, the support from the Ministry for the Environment, which has responsibility for reporting at the national scale, and agreement between participants and science providers on design. funding. data interpretation and reporting. Emphasis was towards the chemical, biological and physical characteristics of the soil. rather than contamination or erosion. The initiative was partially successful in that 10 of the 16 regional authorities participated in the project: a sampling strategy and minimum dataset were defined; an interpretive framework for assessing soil quality was established based on land use and soil order categories, and soil quality assessed at over 500 sites. Recommendations to establish small-scale national soil quality monitoring schemes include having a small number of low-cost indicators, a strong interpretive framework, standardised methods and sampling, and centralised storage of data and samples.

AB  - Tipping points can be defined as critical ecosystem thresholds that start self-enforced dynamics pushing systems into new stable states. Many lake ecosystems of arid Central Asia are sensitive to hydrological changes as they are located at the intersection of the influence of the dry Siberian Anticyclone and the relatively humid mid-latitude Westerlies, and their sediment records can be used to study past tipping points. We studied subfossil chironomid remains preserved in a ca. 6000-year-long sediment record from the Central Asian lake Son Kol (Central Kyrgyzstan) to reconstruct past ecosystem dynamics. Our results show abrupt transitions from a chironomid fauna dominated by macrophyte-associated, salinity-indicating taxa, to a vegetation-independent fauna, and subsequently to a macrophyte-associated, freshwater-indicating fauna. A comparison of the chironomid-based environmental reconstruction to other proxy indicators from the same record suggests a phase of increased Westerly strength starting about 4900 cal. yr BP. This increase led to enhanced precipitation and sediment fluxes into the lake, which in turn led to high turbidity levels and consequently to a macrophyte collapse causing abrupt changes in the chironomid fauna. At 4300 cal. yr BP, a weakening of the Westerlies in combination with higher lake levels led to lower turbidity and ultimately to the recovery of the macrophyte population and associated changes in the chironomid assemblage. These two sequences of events show how the occurrence of a gradual change in an external trigger (Westerlies) can trigger a cascade of within-lake processes (turbidity, macrophyte density) and may ultimately lead to an abrupt reorganization of the ecosystem (chironomid fauna), providing models for tipping points.
