AB  - Natural conditions in Kazakhstan are characterised by large diversity of landscapes and mineral wealth. Current ecological state of the Republic of Kazakhstan, with the prevailing system of raw materials management, is caused by the high anthropogenic pressure on the natural environment. Therefore, Kazakhstan is characterised by various types of hazards and threats which are classified by size and type of their manifestation in this paper. A brief analysis of threats of global, regional and local size is presented. In these conditions, environmental security is becoming a particularly urgent and priority part of the national security of the country. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of their state is required to ensure environmental safety. Methodical development on the integrated assessment of the level of environmental security of natural environments is proposed. Methodological basis for integration is a qualimetric principle, according to which any property of the quality is determined by two numerical parameters: the relative value and weight. The integral safety indicator reflects the general level of anthropogenic pressure and tension of natural and economic systems.

AB  - The EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program large-river assessment protocol was applied to assess the ecological condition, major stressors, and likely human disturbances of the mainstem Malheur River, OR. We used inflatable rafts to allow launching and retrieving from difficult access points and to sample river reaches inaccessible to most other boat types or wading crews, including areas with river obstacles such as rapids and small dams. Electrofishing twenty-four 1-2 km long reaches within the lower 150 km of the river during the summers of 2006 and 2007 revealed: (1) the absence of native mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni; (2) the presence of previously undocumented endemics, mountain sucker Catostomus platyrhynchus and leopard dace Rhinichthys falcatus; (3) the existence of previously undocumented aliens, flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris, tadpole madtom Noturus gyrinus, pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, fathead minnow Pimephales promelas, and western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis; (4) possible range extensions into the main river by two alien basin-reservoir inhabitants, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and yellow perch Perca flavescens; and (5) index of biological integrity scores that declined from a high of 53 for an upstream site to 0.5 for a site 6 km from the river mouth. Regular standardized direct assessments of large-river fish assemblages can provide important information used to update river-basin management plans and inform water-resource managers.

AB  - Identifying the overall status of freshwater streams is an important step in evaluating effects of land management and prioritizing restoration activities. To address these needs, we developed an index of physical habitat condition for headwater streams based on physical stream habitat data (2003-2007) and evaluated the condition status of 217 reference streams and 934 managed streams in the interior Columbia River and upper Missouri River basins. We used data collected from reference reaches to generate this index, which consisted of eight commonly collected metrics used in stream habitat monitoring. We incorporated landscape and climatic covariates into multiple linear regression analyses to control for inherent differences in physical habitat attributes among reaches, and we scored the overall condition of reaches with index values ranging from 0 to 100. Our results indicated that the condition index score of physical habitat was significantly higher in reference reaches (mean +/- SE 47.1 +/- 1.4) than in managed reaches (30.4 +/- 0.7); relative to reference reaches, a greater frequency of managed reaches had low habitat condition and a lower frequency of managed reaches had high habitat condition. Analyses evaluating the relationship between management activities and the condition of physical habitat in streams indicated a significant negative relationship with lower index scores in stream reaches within catchments containing higher densities of roads. When roads and livestock grazing occurred within catchments, we found the presence of grazing had an additional, significant negative effect on the relationship between road density and the condition of physical habitat of streams. Our results suggested that once natural variability and geoclimatic differences among reaches are accounted for, a multimetric index approach can provide managers with an easily interpretable tool to monitor the status of the overall condition of physical habitat.

AB  - Simple Summary Macroinvertebrates are very important to aquatic ecosystems. They are food for vertebrates and their biodiversity serves as a testament of the quality of their habitats. The majority of research on macroinvertebrates simply describes the composition and population density of species living in large rivers and lakes. The aim of our study was to compare the biodiversity of macrozoobenthos assemblages and to determine the effect of physicochemical and hydrological conditions on their abundance and density in 10 small rivers in agricultural areas. Overall, 105 taxa were identified as species living in changing conditions. Oxygenation of water and nitrogen content were important factors determining the existence of macroinvertebrates in these rivers. Some groups of organisms showed sensitivity to changes in water temperature as well as to the flow and depth in rivers. Most publications on the influence of environmental factors on macroinvertebrate communities focus on large rivers, whereas relatively few examine small watercourses in agricultural areas, which, due to their size and pressure from intensive agricultural production, are much more susceptible to the effects of unfavourable environmental conditions or anthropopressure. The aim of our study was to compare the biodiversity of macrozoobenthos assemblages and to determine the effects of physicochemical and hydrological conditions on their abundance and density in 10 small rivers in agricultural areas located in northwest (53 degrees 23 ' N 15 degrees 14 ' E) and central (52 degrees 11 ' N 20 degrees 48 ' E) Poland. In total, 105 taxa were recorded, with the majority being euryoecious. Among the assessed physicochemical parameters, oxygenation was found to affect the density and number of taxa; another important factor was the content of nitrate nitrogen. Sensitivity to changes in water temperature was observed in some macrozoobenthos taxa (especially Decapoda). Of the examined hydrological parameters, the greatest effects were exerted by speed, flow, and depth.

AB  - Forty-six Dorper, 46 Katahdin, and 43 St. Croix female sheep from four regions of the USA were used to evaluate responses to high heat load index (HLI) conditions. There were sequential 2-wk periods with target HLI during day/nighttime of 70/70 (thermoneutral zone conditions), 85/70, 90/77, and 95/81. Rectal temperature (RT) and respiration rate (RR) were measured at 07:00 (before daytime), 13:00, and 17:00?h (preceding nighttime). Region had few and minor effects. Intake of DM (g/day) was not influenced by period. Rectal temperature was considerably less for St. Croix than for Dorper and Katahdin at each time, with differences increasing as period advanced. Similarly, RR in periods 2, 3, and 4 was least for St. Croix, particularly at 07:00?h in period 4. Moreover, RT was slightly less for Katahdin vs. Dorper in period 4 at 13:00 and 17:00 however, RR was less for Katahdin than for Dorper in periods 3 and 4. Variance in RT in periods 3 and 4 ranked St. Croix?<?Dorper?<?Katahdin. In conclusion, based on RT and RR, resilience to high HLI conditions ranked St. Croix?>?Katahdin?>?Dorper, with lowest variability among individuals for St. Croix and greatest for Katahdin.

KW  - BIOTIC INTEGRITY

AB  - We use bird distributions in non-forested coastal wetlands of the Great Lakes to illustrate a new, conceptually explicit method for developing biotic indicators. The procedure applies a probabilistic framework to derive an index that best "fits" an observed assemblage of species, based on preliminary information about species' responses to human environmental disturbance. Among 215 coastal wetland complexes across the U.S. portion of the Great Lakes, 23 bird species were particularly sensitive (positively or negatively) to a multivariate environmental disturbance gradient ranging from 0 (maximally disturbed) to 10 (minimally disturbed). Species like Sandhill Crane (Grus canadensis) and Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis) showed strong negative relationships with human disturbance, while others like Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula), American Robin (Turdus migratorius), and European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), showed strong positive relationships with disturbance. The,functional shapes of these biotic responses were used to determine indices of ecological condition (IEC) for new sites. Values of IEC were highly correlated with the environmental gradient, but deviations from a]:I relationship reveal novel insights about local ecological conditions. For example, sites dominated by invasive plant species like Phragmites australis tended to yield IEC values that were lower than expected based on the environmental gradient. This framework for calculating ecological indicators holds significant potential for other applications because it is flexible, explicitly linked to a disturbance gradient, and easy to calculate once standardized biotic response functions are documented and made available for a region of interest.

AB  - In the process of rehabilitation of a soil, two points are fundamental: to define optimal interferences to accelerate the rehabilitation process and the most appropriate indicators to diagnose its quality. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the nanoparticle and nanostructure morphology of a Red Latosol in rehabilitation for eight years. The soil under rehabilitation process was compared with its natural state and degraded. In the topsoil, nanoparticles (empty set < 100 nm) and fine clay (empty set < 200 nm) were quantified and the nanostructures morphology was studied using images obtained by transmission electron microscopy. Soil porosity, bulk density and carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen contents were analyzed. It was found that the nanoparticles and nanostructure morphology were good soil quality indicators; the physical and chemical attributes were not sensitive to detect alterations between the conditions of degraded soil and soil rehabilitated for eight years; in the class of particles with diameter smaller than 200 nm, for the studied Red Latosol, the visualization of nanostructures is more effective.

AB  - The authors studied the impact of indoor air humidity in the range of 60% to 90% on building user perception in the temperature range of 26 to 28 degrees C. The research thesis was put forward that the impact of humidity on indoor air quality dissatisfaction of building users in a warm and humid indoor environment is greater than that indicated in thermal comfort models. The presented experiment examined the indoor air quality perception of n = 28 subjects in the test chamber of a nearly zero energy building under ten environmental conditions, together with a thermal comfort assessment. The authors developed an experimental relation for predicting building users' satisfaction based on theWeber-Fechner law, where the predicted percentage of dissatisfied users (PD) is determined by means of air enthalpy (h), PD = f(h). The obtained results confirmed the sated thesis. Additionally, the intersection points of the experimental function and isotherms resulting from the Fanger model are presented, where the thermal comfort assessment starts to indicate lower user dissatisfaction results than experimental values. The authors recommend the experimental equation for humid air enthalpies in the range of 50 to 90 kJ/kg. The indoor air quality assessment based on the enthalpy value is simple and can be used to determine the overall Indoor Environmental Quality index of a building (IEQ(index)).

AB  - The morphology of the leaves of angiosperms exhibits remarkable diversity. One of the factors showing the greatest variability is the leaf index, namely, the ratio of leaf length to leaf width. In some cases, different varieties of a single species or closely related species can be distinguished by differences in leaf index. To some extent, the leaf index reflects the morphological adaptation of leaves to a particular environment. Moreover, physiological conditions or environmental factors can change the leaf index of an individual plant. No good tools have been available for studies of the mechanisms that underlie such biodiversity. However, we have recently obtained some, albeit fragmentary, information about molecular mechanisms of leaf morphogenesis as a result of studies of leaves of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. For example, the ANGUS-TIFOLIA gene, a homolog of animal CtBP genes, controls leaf width. ANGUSTIFOLIA appears to regulate the polar elongation of leaf cells via control of the arrangement of cortical microtubules. By contrast, the ROTUNDIFOLIA3 gene controls leaf length via the biosynthesis of steroid(s). We provide here an overview of the biodiversity exhibited by the leaf index of angiosperms. In particular, we consider information obtained from studies of mutants and transgenic strains of A. thaliana, from the so-called Evo/devo perspective.

AB  - Aim. The aim is to study the species composition of the dragonfly larvae community of the steppe zone of Kabardino-Balkaria. Materials and methods. The research is based on the long-term study (2014-2017) of dragonflies of the Republic. The collection and processing of the materials were carried out using methods generally accepted in entomological research. Results. The article presents data on the composition and distribution of communities of dragonfly larvae, which are an information source for the biological indication of the state of natural aquatic ecosystems and are model bio-indicators for environmental monitoring. In the course of the study, 25 species of dragonfly larvae belonging to three suborders of Zygoptera, Anisoptera and Caloptera were identified. The distribution of larvae in water bodies of the steppe zone and their biotopes is inhomogeneous and is determined by the ecological and biological features of the species. Conclusions. The distribution of dragonflies on water habitats is associated with the quantity and quality of biotopes that are convenient for colonization, the temperature regime, the composition and quality of the natural forage reserve and the ability of the larvae of dragonflies to pass through their entire life cycle and their ecological and biological characteristics.

AB  - Climate variability induced changes in rainfall and temperature have degraded the health of vegetation across the world. Thus, monitoring of vegetation condition is essential for maintaining ecosystem health, climate sustainability and biodiversity. This article examines vegetation condition in Nainital district located in Kumaon foothills in India during 1991-2019. We utilized satellite data-based temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) model for assessing vegetation condition. Surface moisture index and bare soil index were used for validating TVDI. Findings revealed an increasing trend in land surface temperature and decreasing trend in surface moisture content. It was also found that area under bare soil has increased considerably indicating decrease in vegetation cover. Marked variations in vegetation condition were observed during the study period due to varied topography, direction and gradient of slope and variation in rainfall. TVDI has proved to be effective tool for assessing vegetation condition. Future studies in different geographical regions may find this assessment approach useful.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the long-term fluctuations in water quality and the influence of Yellow River water recharge and climatic condition on the water environmental index of a typical brackish-water lake. This study investigated several surface water quality parameters and their relationships with the water quality index (WQI) and trophic status index (TSI) of Shahu Lake from 2011 to 2018. A health risk assessment was conducted, and the correlations among water recharge, climatic conditions, and the aforementioned elements were determined. Results show that the water quality in this lake went from good to moderate and back to good as reflected in the changes in its WQI values from 2011 to 2018. The relative water quality inferiority of this lake in 2015 and 2016 was attributed to the significant increase in its CODMn, TP, TN, NH3-N, and fluoride (F-) concentrations during these years. A combination of these parameters could rapidly predict water quality through a stepwise multiple linear regression. During the study period (except in the frozen season), Shahu Lake maintained a eutrophic status every month (especially in July) irrespective of the spatial changes resulting from low secchi depth and high TP. The limiting nutrient of Shahu Lake changed from phosphorus to both nitrogen and phosphorus, especially during summer, due to seasonal variations and exogenous inputs. The lake had an acceptable health risk level, and water recharge both had positive and negative effects on this lake as reflected in the significant decrease or increase in the concentrations of its principal parameters. This condition was also attributed to temperature and precipitation, which resulted in significant TSI variations. The findings of this study provide ways of estimating and forecasting water quality and trophic status and a basis for managing and improving similar brackish-water lakes.

AB  - Population displacement due to armed conflicts, regional crises, or natural disasters often leads to large-scale settlements that impact the local environment. The specific dynamics of such semi-permanent settlements, comprising both the structural changes (to the extent of the camp, and the population density), and their wider impacts on the surroundings, require adaptive monitoring capacities. In areas where livelihoods and food security are highly dependent on natural resources, environmental deterioration can result in violent conflicts over access to, or control of, scarce natural resources, or in renewed migration of the population. Remote sensing, and in particular very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, can help determine the actual population dynamics, together with environmental changes in the surrounding areas. In an ex-post assessment using three time slices (2002, 2004, 2008) we assessed the changing environmental conditions and the resulting implications for human security and ecosystem integrity in the vicinity of a large internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in northern Darfur, Sudan. We used a Weighted Natural Resource Depletion index that integrates selected land use/land cover target classes and their relative importance for human security and/or ecosystem integrity by incorporating weightings assigned by experts to each of these classes. The results showed that the dramatic increase in the camp's population between June 2002 and May 2008 (from approximately 1200 to about 50,000 inhabitants) and areal extent (a growth of similar to 436%) was accompanied by a noticeable decrease in the area covered by single shrubs and small trees (similar to -68%), in the area covered by patches of shrubs and trees (similar to-34%), and in the area covered by grassland (similar to -3%). Moreover, a marked expansion in small-scale farming was observed, especially into fertile wadi soils. Almost 45% of all grid cells (60 m x 60 m) had experienced at least some degree of depletion of natural resources (i.e. woody vegetation, grassland, etc.) between 2002 and 2008. Major depletion was observed in the north-eastern and eastern parts of the camp in particular, while minor depletion occurred over almost all of the study area. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Determining the effects of plant community changes on animal populations is an important area of ecological research. We compared condition, population characteristics, and diet composition of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from 2 root-plowed (low brush diversity) and 2 untreated (high brush diversity) sites in the eastern Rio Grande Plains of Texas to test the hypothesis that root plowing, which decreases woody species diversity, reduced deer habitat quality. We collected 8 adult female white-tailed deer from each site every 3 months for 6 sampling periods. We assessed condition from several physiological, reproductive, and digestive indices and determined food habits by microhistological analysis of rumen samples. We estimated population size from helicopter surveys. There were no differences (P > 0.1) between high- and low-diversity sites in deer density, fawn production, age, mass, reproductive characteristics, ruminal nitrogen and neutral detergent fiber, and fat, blood, and urine indices. There was a fecal nitrogen treatment by season interaction (P < 0.05). Blood, urine, fat, digestive, and ovarian indices varied seasonally (P < 0.05). Four nitrogen indices provided conflicting information on population protein status. Therefore, data on diet composition were necessary for index interpretation. Percent browse in the diet was greater (P < 0.10) in untreated sites. Browse, forb, and grass use varied seasonally (P < 0.05). Yearly differences in precipitation were associated with changes in body condition, reproduction, and diet. Nutritional condition and population status of white-tailed deer were similar in untreated sites and sites root plowed 17 years earlier. In treated sites, the greater abundance of forbs and huisache (Acacia smallii) mast offset the effects of decreases in browse diversity on deer biology. We recommend further work on the effects of brush management on wildlife communities.

TI  - Reproductive strategy of Leporinus piau (Fowler, 1941), a neotropical freshwater fish from the semi-arid region of Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - This study concerns the reproductive strategy of the freshwater fish, Leporinus piau, native to the Brazilian semi-arid region. The hypothesis of this work predicts that the species would spawn during the rainy season, presenting a seasonal reproductive strategy. The study investigated the structure of total body length and body mass, sex ratio, body size at first sexual maturity, developmental stages of gonads, fecundity, gonadosomatic index (GSI), condition factor (K) and the spawning season of L. piau. Twelve monthly samplings (mean n = 18) were carried out in 2009 and environmental parameters such as rainfall, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity and concentration of dissolved oxygen of water were registered. The sampled population of L. piau (n = 211) showed a slight predominance of males (55%), but with larger and heavier females. First sexual maturation in males occurred earlier (16.5 cm total length) than in females (20.5 cm total length). The species is a total spawner with an average fecundity of 55 000 mature oocytes. Rainfall (225 +/- 7.2 mm) and concentration of dissolved oxygen (8.5 +/- 0.2 mg L-1) acted as influential factors during the spawning season. The monthly GSI shows that spawning starts when the rainy season is at its maximum and ends synchronously (females r = 0.91; males r = 0.89) with the end of the rainy season. L. piau presents a seasonal reproductive strategy with high reproductive output, providing a population increase and exploitation of the environmental resources.

AB  - We present a multi-criteria method for the evaluation of natural quality of hardwood forests in the Upper Midwest, USA. We define natural quality as the condition (maturity, structural diversity, dominance patterns) of a forest relative to that same forest in the absence of recent (50 to 75 years) major anthropogenic disturbance (timber harvest, grazing, etc.). Our method relies upon survey of woody vegetation in 0.10-ha circular plots, during which the surveyor measures the diameter (dbh) of the largest trees in the plot; records the total percent cover of the canopy, subcanopy, and shrub layers; and lists all the woody plant species present in each of these forest strata within broad cover classes. These data are then used to score six evaluation criteria (tree size, tree structure, shrub structure, canopy dominance, subcanopy dominance, shrub dominance) following explicit rules calibrated with respect to survey data from forest preserves. These scores are summed to yield a natural quality index, which ranges in value from 0 to 20. A measure of the overall natural quality of a forest can be determined by computing the mean of these quality indices. This method is most appropriate for large-scale evaluations of woody vegetation of forests in the Central Hardwoods Region.

AB  - The only vegetation index (VI) used in all Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-based burned area studies performed so far is the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), in spite of serious known deficiencies caused by sensitivity to atmospheric conditions and soil background. In this study, the ability of various VI to discriminate between burned and unburned surfaces is compared, using burn maps derived from classification of Landsat thematic mapper (TM) imagery as reference data. After assessing the discriminatory potential of the AVHRR channels 1-3, the following indexes were compared: the NDVI, the VI 3 (VI3), the global environmental monitoring index (GEMI), and a modified version of GEMI, call ed GEMI3. VI performance was assessed in two ways: with a signal-to-noise ratio measure and a measure of the commission error resulting from segmentation of the burned area histograms at a fixed level of omission error, Maps of commission errors were generated for each VI and cross tabulated with a land cover map to identify the land cover types more prone to confusion with burns. The newly proposed index GEMI3 performs best, followed by the GEMI, VI3, and finally NDVI, the latter being clearly out performed, even by channel 2 used individually.

AB  - Wetlands are ecosystems with great ecological value due to their extraordinary biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide. Saline wetlands have specific biological attributes and conservation significance because of the particular fauna they hold. In this study, we analyzed invertebrate assemblages, the conservation state, and environmental quality of the Desaguadero-Salinas del Bebedero Wetlands, in a RAMSAR site of central Argentina. Samples of water for physical-chemical analysis and aquatic invertebrates were taken at seven sites. A Simplified Index of Water Quality (SIWQ) and the Index of Conservation State of Lentic Somers Ecosystems (CSLSE) were applied. Forty-four invertebrate taxa were identified in a community characterized by low diversity, and high abundance of salinity tolerant groups. Some invertebrate metrics showed strong associations with concentrations of majoritarian ions in water, CSLSE and SIWQ. Five invertebrate metrics of richness and diversity, three of assemblage composition and three related to feeding groups displayed the best performance in explaining significant differences among sites. These results reinforce the use of biological assessments of human impacts in saline water bodies. They also enhance the knowledge of wetlands of arid regions, extremely fragile habitats that should be deeply studied and understood at a global scale.

AB  - The global vegetation index (GVI) is nowadays the best available index to detect changes in vegetation quantity and conditions at regional and global scales. This is determined by the global daily coverage of the Earth (NOAA satellite), availability of appropriate spectral bands to monitor vegetation (AVHRR sensor) and the small number of generated data. The main objectives of this research were to evaluate the capability of GVI monitoring natural vegetation and crop status in the climatic conditions of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and to study the relationship between GVI and water conditions. Temporal series of meteorological elements and GVI images were utilized in weekly scales, from September 1982 to May 1986 period. The temporal evolution of GVI followed the standard growth and development spring-summer crops curve, allowing to use this index in crop monitoring in the west portion of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

AB  - ABSTR A C T The modified clay is the only worldwide-accepted practical method for mitigating algal bloom. Is it ecologically safe? To evidence it, a simulative bloom-occurring system of Karenia mikimotoi was set up, and the sentinel organisms of rotifer Brachionus plicatilis in sea surface and blue mussel Mytilus edulis on the benthos were respectively included. The organisms' physiological responses were determined as the indicators to reflect the ecological impacts when clay settled from surface to the bottom during the mimic bloom-mitigating process. Modified clay at a concentration of 0.1 g/L effectively removed the K. mikimotoi at an 81% removal rate, and its addition would not significantly strengthen the negative impacts on population dynamics and reproductive activities of B. plicatilis induced by sole K. mikimotoi within the first 2 h. Even an alleviation was observed at 2 d indicated by the increase of survival rate, egg and larva production after clay addition compared with those of 2 h. When the clay particles settled to benthos, the physical damage to the gills and digestive glands of M. edulis were found via the tissue and SEM observation, especially in higher treatment groups of 0.5 and 1.0 g/L, and filtering rate, digestive enzymes, condition index, water content and mortality were also influenced. However, little impact was found in group of 0.1 g/L. Risk assessment based on the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) model further revealed that the complete key event-key event relationship-adverse outcome pathway was only clearly observed in 0.5 g/L and 1 g/L groups but not in 0.1 g/L group, inferring the small ecological risk of 0.1 g/L. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) based on the mussel's physiological responses further backed up the AOP outcoming. The combined results from rotifer to bivalve emphasized on one conclusion that modified clay at 0.1 g/L was effective and ecologically safe in coastal bloom mitigation.

KW  - THERMODYNAMICS
AB  - The increase of stress induced changes in marine environments caused by different types of marine pollution made necessary the search for indicators that assist in assessing pollution effects at the community level. The main goals, with a view to an effective management, are the early detection and evaluation of environmental responses to pollution and to avoid or mitigate negative impacts that different uses may generate.
   Exergy has been considered as a promising indicator of ecosystem integrity, acquiring a considerable interest in the context of systems ecology.
   In this research we have tested the capability of exergy (both the exergy index and specific exergy) alongside other diversity indices (Shannon and Margalef indices) of distinguishing organically enriched areas in a Mediterranean coastal lagoon (El Mar Menor).
   Results show that the exergy index and specific exergy were able to give useful information on community structure, although they were not capable of distinguishing high and poor organically enriched areas or affected by any other type of pollution. Diversity indices were more sensitive to organic pollution.
   We may say that the exergy and specific exergy are still not applicable as the only ecological indicators in a generalized way in the field of environmental management. Therefore, they still require further application in a wider range of geographical areas and in different conditions in order to study more widely the properties of exergy as an ecological indicator.

AB  - Biohydrogen attracts many attentions since it has many advantages as source of energy. Biohydrogen from sugarcane bagasse offers many advantages from economic and environmental point of view. This work aimed to study the production of hydrogen from sugarcane bagasse through enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation using Enterobacter aerogenes. Pretreatment with ionic liquid [DMIM]DMP was carried out prior to hydrolysis. It was found that process with ionic liquid was able to shift the cellulose structure from crystalline cellulose to more amorphous cellulose. Alkaline pretreatment followed by ionic liquid conducted for 20 min at 120 degrees C gave the lowest crystallinity index. This condition also gave the highest total recovery of cellulose and hemicellulose, a condition that is very important for enzymatic hydrolysis to produce as much sugar as possible. Pretreatment condition was also found to give significant effect to the yield and type of monosaccharides produced from the hydrolysis process. Optimization of the pretreatment condition of the combined alkaline and ionic liquid [DMIM]DMP pretreatment was found to give significant effect to the ease of lignocellulosic substrate for its conversion to reducing sugar. The yield of hydrogen from the fermentation of the obtained sugar was 0.46 mole H-2 per mole of glucose consumed.

AB  - Microbial communities play an important role in stream ecosystem processes, such as breakdown of senescent leaf litter, and as a primary nutritional source for detritivorous macroinvertebrates. Antibiotics may affect stream microbial communities and associated ecosystem processes, especially because recent stream and river monitoring programs have indicated the presence of antibiotics downstream of wastewater treatment plants. In the current study, effects of chronic exposure to the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro) were examined on stream microbial community-level physiological profiles and growth indices of detritivorous amphipods (Gammarus spp.) and caddisflies (Lepidostoma liba). Microcosm experiments were conducted using stream sediments and water, senesced leaf material (Acer saccharum), and macroinvertebrates. A shift in function of leaf-associated microbial communities (based on carbon source utilization) was observed for samples exposed to 100 mu g/L of Cipro for 12 d compared to control and treatments exposed to 1 and 10 mu g/L of Cipro. This was attributable to carbohydrate substrates, which had 2.7- to 3.5-fold lower microbial respiration than the lower concentrations and control (p < 0.001). For detritivores, Gammarus spp. condition index did not differ among control, 0.1, and 1.0 mu g/L treatments after 30-d exposures (p > 0.05). Similarly, L. liba growth rate did not vary among control, 10, and 100 mu g/L treatments after 45-d exposures (p > 0.05). These results suggest that Cipro may affect leaf-associated microbial communities, but at concentrations four orders of magnitude above those detected in streams. However, effects of the antibiotic on growth and condition of detritivores were not observed. Future work should focus on identifying specific changes in stream microbial communities as a result of Cipro exposure and impacts on other aquatic species.

AB  - We assessed the biotic integrity of the middle-to-upper Delaware River. We sampled fish and assembled water quality data for eight stations and three habitat types (pool, riffle, and submerged aquatic vegetation [SAV]) of the Delaware River and applied an existing index of biotic integrity (IBI) recently developed for the northern mid-Atlantic slope drainages. We used Spearman's correlation to test 1131 scores against measures of water quality (WQI) and cultural pollution. IBI scores were not significantly correlated with WQL but were significantly negatively correlated with sewage load of adjacent tributaries (r(s) = -0.647, p = 0.08). Sites ranged from good to fair in biotic integrity. Fish assemblage composition from all three habitat types was necessary in order to accurately characterize biotic integrity. Of the three habitat types, fish assemblages from SAV habitats had the greatest positive effect on biotic integrity. Continued application of the IBI may be useful as a long-term monitoring tool as this river corridor becomes increasingly urbanized.

AB  - Manila clam stock from Arcachon Bay, France, is declining, as is commercial harvest. To understand the role of environmental biotic interactions in this decrease, effects of a toxic dinoflagellate, Alexandrium ostenfeldii, which blooms regularly in Arcachon bay, and the interaction with perkinsosis on clam physiology were investigated. Manila clams from Arcachon Bay, with variable natural levels of perkinsosis, were exposed for seven days to a mix of the nutritious microalga T-Iso and the toxic dinoflagellate A. ostenfeldii, a producer of spirolides, followed by seven days of depuration fed only T-Iso. Following sacrifice and quantification of protozoan parasite Perkinsus olseni burden, clams were divided into two groups according to intensity of the infection ("Light-Moderate" and "Moderate-Heavy"). Hemocyte and plasma responses, digestive enzyme activities, antioxidant enzyme activities in gills, and histopathological responses were analyzed. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in hemocytes and catalase (CAT) activity in gills increased with P. olseni intensity of infection in control clams fed T-Iso, but did not vary among A. ostenfeldii-exposed clams. Exposure to A. ostenfeldii caused tissue alterations associated with an inflammatory response and modifications in hemocyte morphology. In the gills, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased, and an increase in brown cell occurrence was seen, suggesting oxidative stress. Observations of hemocytes and brown cells in tissues during exposure and depuration suggest involvement of both cell types in detoxication processes. Results suggest that exposure to A. ostenfeldii disrupted the pro-/anti-oxidant response of clams to heavy P. olseni intensity. In addition, depressed mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in hemocytes of clams exposed to A. ostenfeldii suggests that mitochondrial functions are regulated to maintain homeostasis of digestive enzyme activity and condition index.

AB  - A simple analytical procedure for the simultaneous determination of eight endogenous steroids (testosterone, androstenedione. 17 beta-estradiol, estrone, pregnenolone. progesterone, dihydroandrostenedione, and dihydrotestosterone) in aquatic molluscs by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been developed After a microwave-assisted extraction, samples were further extracted and purified using two successive SPE (EnviChrom-P and NH2) cartridges. Steroids were derivatized with a mixture of N-methyl-N(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA)/mercaptoethanol/ammonium iodide (NH(4)l) and determined by GC-MS in selective ton monitoring mode Recoveries were in the range 85-114%. although slightly lower for dihydrotestosterone, and the repeatability of the procedure, expressed as the coefficient of variation, was lower than 16%. The limits of detection determined in digestive glands of mussels were in the range 0.1-04 ng g(-1) wet weight for all the steroids. The developed procedure was then applied to the monitoring of steroid profiles in the digestive glands of mussels from the Arcachon Bay (France) during two reproductive cycles In parallel, two physiological parameters (lipid content and the condition index Of Mussels) were also monitored, as well as the seawater temperature and salinity. Only progesterone and pregnenolone were detected in the digestive glands of mussels, and the seasonal variations of progesterone levels seemed to be related to the spawning periods of Mytilus sp. in the Bay. The Current challenge for the determination of natural steroids in aquatic invertebrates is also briefly discussed. (C) 2009 Elseviei B.V. All rights reserved.

LA  - English
AB  - A field experiment was conducted during rainy seasons of 1985-87, to assess the performance of 29 genotypes of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) under artificial water stress and natural conditions. Among the spreading group, 'DVR 50' was the most efficient on the basis of pod yield, harvest index, plant-water status and moisture-use efficiency in natural as well as in artificial water-stress conditions. The drought index of 'LG 42' (14.33%), 'LG 46' (18.83%), 'LG 9'(19.77%) and 'LG 19' (21.10%) was lower, as also the variation in pod yield in the natural and stress conditions compared with the other genotypes. It indicates that these genotypes have better drought-tolerance ability. In bunch group, 'CGC 4018' was the most efficient genotype for pod yield, harvest index and moisture-use efficiency in both thc conditions. In addition, the genotypes 'ICGS 35-1' (18.47%), 'BG 32' (19.33%) and 'ICGS 44-1' (21.10%) showed lower drought index and higher plant-water potential, indicating their better drought-tolerance capacity.

AB  - Background: Thermal stress indices are important in predicting and choosing means for mitigating heat stress and defining critical environmental conditions for animal welfare and performance. The aim of this study was to determine the association between 16 thermal stress indices and thermophysiological variables in young Nellore bulls raised in a tropical pasture to determine the most effective parameter of heat stress to assist in the management of the thermal environment and animal welfare.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Seventy-eight young Nellore bulls (Bos taurus indicus), with a mean age of 10.5 months and mean body weight of 242.09 +/- 32.17 kg at first collection, and 17.92 months and body weight 335.80 +/- 39.02 kg at last collection, were used. During the experimental period, rectal temperature (RT) and surface temperature at the forehead, scapula, and groin, from which the average surface temperature (AST) was calculated, were measured. The difference between the AST and air temperature (i.e., AST - AT) and between the RT and AST (i.e., RT - AST) defined the thermal gradient. For the evaluation of thermal environment, the dry bulb, wet bulb, and globe temperatures, and wind speed were measured. Relative humidity, mean radiant temperature, solar radiation, temperature humidity index (THI), black global temperature humidity index (BGHI), equivalent temperature index (ETI), environmental stress index (EST), respiratory rate predictor (PRR), heat load index (HLI), comprehensive climate index (CCI), and index of thermal stress for cows (ITSC) were calculated. The average and maximum air temperatures were above thermal comfort levels, while the average relative humidity was within the ideal limit for cattle. The average globe temperature was higher than the air temperature. Solar radiation presented very high values and wind speeds were very low. RT indicated normothermia in the cattle, and AST and thermal gradient (i.e., AST - AT) indicated thermal comfort. The 16 thermal stress indices demonstrated a significant positive and moderate correlation with AST, but were not significantly correlated with RT.
   Discussion: The average (28.14 degrees C) and maximum (31.90 degrees C) air temperatures indicated discomfort, since the ideal temperature for cattle is 27 degrees C. The high thermal load of this region can contribute to poor animal welfare, thus requiring the provision of natural or artificial shade for pasture farming. The cattle in this study were in thermal equilibrium given that they maintained RT within the normal range, and the maximum limit was higher. If RT is maintained within physiological limits, the mechanisms of thermoregulation are able to eliminate excess heat (i.e., thermolysis is equivalent to thermogenesis). The AST was 5.4 degrees C below the RT. It is important to note that deep body temperature (i.e., RT) is more stable than the surface body temperature, which is influenced by ambient temperature. Considering that there was no correlation between thermal stress indices and RT, and that the cattle were able to maintain RT within physiological limits, the Nellore bulls in this study were adapted to the environment. The thermal stress indices evaluated in this study adequately reflected heat stress in young Nellore bulls raised in pastures in a tropical environment. Surface temperature was the physiological parameter that responded most significantly to environmental conditions.

AB  - Many organisms live in or on birds, with arthropods being the best studied ones. Ectosymbiotic arthropods may parasitise birds by feeding upon blood or feathers, thereby causing injury or competing for essential resources. Nevertheless, ectosymbionts sometimes cause no adverse effect to birds because they consume only excess preening oil, debris and microorganisms on feathers. The influence of these ectosymbionts on host body condition is still poorly understood, especially for species living in one of the most endangered biomes, the Atlantic Forest in South America. We tested for the relationships between ectosymbionts and host's morphological traits: flight muscle condition, mass index and feather growth rate. We inspected the body surface of 282 individual birds of 45 understory-dwelling species looking for ectosymbionts and estimated vane-dwelling feather mite load in their remiges. We calculated ectosymbiont prevalence and mean infestation intensity in 193 individual birds from 11 species. In seven species (n = 106 individual birds), we tested for the relationship between ectosymbionts and morphological traits using generalised linear mixed models. We found a negative relationship between the presence of ectoparasites and the host pectoral muscle condition, supporting the parasitic nature of tissue-feeding symbionts. Nevertheless, we found no relationship between vane-dwelling feather mite loads and hosts' morphological traits, which supports the hypothesis of likely commensalism between these organisms.

AB  - The European Union, Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires monitoring of riverine fish fauna. When the WFD came into force in 2000, most of the EU member states did not have fish-based assessment methods compliant to WFD requirements. Therefore, the objectives of FAME (http://fame.boku.ac.at), a project under the fifth R&D Framework Programme of the European Commission were to develop, evaluate and implement a standardised fish-based method for assessing the ecological status of European running waters. This paper synthesises the outputs of FAME and defines future research needs. Two different methodologies were used: the so-called spatially based modelling and the site-specific modelling, the latter leading to the European Fish Index (EFI). The advantage of the EFI is that, despite being a single index, it is applicable to a wide range of environmental conditions across Europe precluding the need for inter-calibration. The EFI will support the WFD towards harmonised/standardised assessment and management of running waters in Europe, thus enabling comparative analyses of the ecological status of running waters across Europe.

AB  - Environmental challenges to natural resources have been attributed to human behavior and traditional agricultural production techniques. Natural resource degradation in agriculture has always been a prime concern in agro ecological research and sustainability analysis. There are many techniques for assessing environmental performance; one of which, ecological footprint (EF), assesses human pressure on the environment and natural resources. The main purpose of this study was calculation of ecological indices including biocapacity (BC) and EF of rural areas of Fars province of Iran. The study was accomplished using survey and structured interviews consisting of three main questionnaires in two different steps. Different agricultural stakeholders, including farmers (for the first step) as well as the policymakers, extension managers and authorities (for the second step) were interviewed. Based on multi-stage stratified random sampling, 50 villages and 423 farmers were selected. Face validity and reliability of the questionnaires were assessed by a panel of specialists as well as conducting a pilot study, respectively. The paradigmatic perspectives of agricultural policy makers and managers (22 individuals) were also analyzed using another specific questionnaire by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Findings revealed that most of the studied villages faced a critical environmental condition due to the results of ecological indicator which was calculated in the study. According to the four main components of human ecology (POET model) including Population, Organization, Environment and Technology, village groups that differed in terms of sustainability level also showed significantly differences due to population, social participation, use of green technologies and attitude towards diverse environmental management paradigms. The causal model also revealed that population, green technology, social participation and attitude toward frontier economics, which were in accordance with the elements of human ecology model, were the main factors affecting the ecological index. Finally, AHP results determined the dominant economic perspectives of agricultural authorities. A paradigm shift toward the comprehensive paradigm of eco-development plus consideration of the results of the ecological indicator calculation as the base of agricultural planning at the local level were recommended.

AB  - We investigated the plant species diversity in patches with natural non-forest vegetation (NN), with forest communities that had developed where there was a spontaneous succession of vegetation (called: natural forests, NF), and with planted forests (PF) within cut-over peatlands located in central Poland. We studied (1) how diverse is plant composition in actively managed and in abandoned cut-over peatland areas, (2) how does afforestation influence wetland species composition, and (3) does natural plant succession in abandoned cut-over peatlands favour peatland regeneration and the maintenance of typical peatland species. We also defined the ecosystem services (with special attention to supporting services) and we analysed the conflicts and synergies of two cut-over peatland utilization options (abandonment and conventional forestry).
   An ANOVA test was used to analyse statistical differences in the diversity index, phytosociological units and Ellenberg index. Ecological conditions of NN, NF and PF were described on the base of Ellenberg indicator values (EIVs). A modified permutation test using mean randomized ElVs was used to check the significant differences in Ellenberg values.
   The results show that the vegetation of NN, NF and PF areas differ significantly in mean number of species, Shannon diversity and evenness index. The analyses of Ellenberg values indicated that the light and moisture conditions of NN, NF and PF differ markedly. The development of forest cover, both natural and anthropogenically created, leads to an increase in plants species diversity. However, the encroachment of numerous shade-tolerant forest species does not compensate for the reduction in characteristic peatland species. The afforestation of degraded peatland areas may be an option for management, but in every single case the decision for afforestation ought to be preceded by the recognition of the initial state of the species richness of degraded and potentially managed wetland. The most valuable wetlands with preserved peatlands flora should be actively restored for biodiversity conservation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The microcystin-producing cyanobacterium Planktothrix is one of the most widespread genera amongst toxin producing cyanobacteria in European lakes. In particular, the metalimnic blooms of Planktothrix rubescens have been associated with growing problems in the professional freshwater fishery as a decrease in yearly yields in the important coregonids fishery often coincides with the appearance of P. rubescens. P. rubescens is a cyanobacterial species known to produce toxic compounds, e.g. microcystins. Although microcystins have been reported to affect fish health, behaviour, development and growth and have also been associated with feral fish kills, there is currently no specific information on the effects of toxic Planktothrix filaments in fish and especially coregonids. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an environmentally relevant dose of P rubescens filaments orally applied to coregonids and to discuss the findings in the context of microcystin toxicity previously reported in carp and trout.
   A single dose of P rubescens culture, at a density of 80,000 cells per 120 mu d, was applied to coregonids thus corresponding to 0.6-0.9 mu g microcystin-LRequiv/kg body weight. Behavioural changes and opercular beat rates, growth, hepatosomatic index, condition and plasma glucose were determined. Liver, kidney, gill and the gastrointestinal tract were assessed histopathologically and immunhistologically. Exposed fish showed behavioural changes, increased opercular beat rates and elevated plasma glucose levels, possibly representing a physiological stress response. Histopathological alterations in liver, gastrointestinal tract and kidney, also immunopositive for microcystin suggested causality of tissue damage and the in situ presence of microcystins.
   The observed combination of stress and organ damage may explain the frequently reduced weight and thus the fitness noted in coregonids subjected to regular occurrences of stratified and dispersed P rubescens blooms, e.g. in lake Ammersee, Bavaria, Germany.

AB  - Mediterranean coastal dunes have been highly modified by human impacts and understanding their conservation status is crucial to preserve these extremely vulnerable habitats.
   In the present study three different diversity indices elaborated by Grunewald and Schubert (H-dune, a modified version of the Shannon diversity index, E-dune, a modified Evenness index, and N, the Naturalness index) were applied in order to assess the conservation status and anthropogenic impacts on Is Arenas dune system (CW Sardinia), one of the widest and most important in the Western Mediterranean Basin.
   Within the system, two sites with different anthropic disturbance conditions were selected; 25 permanent plots were seasonally monitored and the cover of each vascular plant present was visually estimated.
   The H-dune values were similar between sites and differences were not significant; E-dune showed higher value in the North than in the South site with relevant statistical differences.
   Moreover a seasonal variation in the indices values was recorded, which could be linked to presence of annual plants rather than the touristic pressure. Instead, the small variability of N index suggests that the application of this index may be an important tool to assess human impact on coastal dunes, but better discriminates between sites with different disturbance degrees.
   Our results highlight the usefulness of H-dune and E-dune indices to assess the conservation status of a Mediterranean coastal dune system, while these indices are less influenced by the human trampling at finer scale (sites within the beach). Spring and summer are the best seasons when the main plant diversity of Mediterranean coastal dune can be captured. The diversity indices applied, although need to be developed through further researches, could be a quickly tool allowing to assess the integrity of the coastal dunes in order to plan management actions of these complex and threatened ecosystems.

AB  - The distribution and composition of aquatic insect communities in streams at a local scale are considered to be primarily determined by environmental factors and interactive relationships within the system. Here, we evaluated the effects of forest fragmentation and forest cover changes on habitat characteristics of streamlets (igarapes) in Amazonian forests and on the aquatic insect communities found there. We also developed a habitat integrity index (HII) based on Petersen's protocol (1992) to evaluate physical integrity of these streamlets and to determine its efficiency to interpret the environmental impacts on this system. We studied 20 small streams at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP INPA/SI) study areas, Central Amazonia, 80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. The vegetation cover was estimated by using LANDSAT images and classified in the following categories: exposed soil, pastures, secondary forests (capoeiras), and primary forests. Stream habitat features were evaluated by using a HII based on visual assessment of local characteristics. Aquatic insects were sampled in four major stream substrates: litter deposited in pools or backwaters, litter retained in riffles, sand, and marginal banks. Stream habitat characteristics were significantly correlated to land use and riparian forest condition. Overall aquatic insect richness and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness were significantly lower in pasture streams, and their taxonomic composition differed significantly from streams in forested areas. However, these metrics were not significantly correlated to the stream HII. Taxonomic composition of bank insect assemblages changed significantly between streams with low and high values of HII. There was no significant relationship between the proportion of primary forest cover and the faunal metrics. Only drastic changes in the vegetal cover seem to induce significant changes in the aquatic insect community. Matrix habitat heterogeneity, distance to forest fragments, the presence of areas of secondary forest, and the intrinsic capacity to disperse in many of the insect groups may have contributed to attenuate the effects of habitat disturbance on aquatic insect assemblages in streamlets.

AB  - This paper constitutes a first attempt to model the relationship between climate change, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, with a specific emphasis on European forests. Firstly, we construct a composite biodiversity indicator that integrates quantitative and qualitative changes of biodiversity projected to 2050 for the EU-17 under future IPCC scenarios. Secondly, this indicator is integrated into two simultaneous equation models to capture the marginal impacts of changes in biodiversity on the value of ecosystem goods and services (EGS) due to climate change.
   Our estimation results confirm the role of biodiversity as a nature-based policy solution for climate change mitigation, shedding light on the policy actions that generate co-benefits by enhancing ecosystems' capacity to mitigate climate change impacts, while conserving biodiversity and sustaining the flows of EGS for human livelihoods. Especially, nature-based mitigation policies are more cost-effective and better at coping with the ethic and inequality issues associated with distributional impacts of the policy actions, compared to the pure technical solutions to improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. However, the strength of biodiversity as a nature-based policy option for climate change mitigation depends on both the nature of the EGS and the geographical area under consideration.

AB  - In seasonal environments subject to climate change, organisms typically show phenological changes. As these changes are usually stronger in organisms at lower trophic levels than those at higher trophic levels, mismatches between consumers and their prey may occur during the consumers' reproduction period. While in some species a trophic mismatch induces reductions in offspring growth, this is not always the case. This variation may be caused by the relative strength of the mismatch, or by mitigating factors like increased temperature-reducing energetic costs. We investigated the response of chick growth rate to arthropod abundance and temperature for six populations of ecologically similar shorebirds breeding in the Arctic and sub-Arctic (four subspecies of Red Knot Calidris canutus, Great Knot C. tenuirostris and Surfbird C. virgata). In general, chicks experienced growth benefits (measured as a condition index) when hatching before the seasonal peak in arthropod abundance, and growth reductions when hatching after the peak. The moment in the season at which growth reductions occurred varied between populations, likely depending on whether food was limiting growth before or after the peak. Higher temperatures led to faster growth on average, but could only compensate for increasing trophic mismatch for the population experiencing the coldest conditions. We did not find changes in the timing of peaks in arthropod availability across the study years, possibly because our series of observations was relatively short; timing of hatching displayed no change over the years either. Our results suggest that a trend in trophic mismatches may not yet be evident; however, we show Arctic-breeding shorebirds to be vulnerable to this phenomenon and vulnerability to depend on seasonal prey dynamics.

AB  - Quantitative assessment of resources and environmental carrying capacity (RECC) is a critical requirement of regional economic development. This paper proposes a new indicator assessment system for RECC that uses the ecological and environmental stress index model (ESI) and state-space method for analysis. A quantitative analysis of the northwest temperate continental climate ecotope of China was performed through a comprehensive evaluation of the present ecological carrying capacity (ECC), resources exploitation and pollution discharge conditions. Regional statistical data from 2010 were used to analyze the RECC distribution trend and explore the relationship between the ECC and socioeconomic pressure. Results indicated that the smallest ECC index was 0.0810, the ecological environment of the western and central parts of this region was particularly fragile. The highest socioeconomic pressure index was 0.0960, reflecting greater development pressure in the central areas. The approximate decoupling index (ADI) indicated that the influence of the ecosystem on RECC was small, within "relative decoupling''. RECC and socioeconomic pressure were within "absolute hook'', denoting RECC deteriorating faster than the economy grew. Development pressure from net primary productivity, population density, the energy consumption index and the water use index was significant. However, the study area is still developing, and different development strategies must be devised for different regions.

AB  - Knowledge of the factors affecting the vigor of desert riparian trees is important for their conservation and management. I used multiple regression to assess effects of streamflow and climate (12-14 years of data) or climate alone (up to 60 years of data) on radial growth of clonal narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angustifolia), a foundation species in the arid, Closed Basin portion of the San Luis Valley, Colorado. I collected increment cores from trees (14-90 cm DBH) at four sites along each of Sand and Deadman creeks (total N = 85), including both perennial and ephemeral reaches. Analyses on trees <110 m from the stream channel explained 33-64% of the variation in standardized growth index (SGI) over the period having discharge measurements. Only 3 of 7 models included a streamflow variable; inclusion of prior-year conditions was common. Models for trees farther from the channel or over a deep water table explained 23-71% of SGI variability, and 4 of 5 contained a streamflow variable. Analyses using solely climate variables over longer time periods explained 17-85% of SGI variability, and 10 of 12 included a variable indexing summer precipitation. Three large, abrupt shifts in recent decades from wet to dry conditions (indexed by a seasonal Palmer Drought Severity Index) coincided with dramatically reduced radial growth. Each shift was presumably associated with branch dieback that produced a legacy effect apparent in many SGI series: uncharacteristically low SGI in the year following the shift. My results suggest trees in locations distant from the active channel rely on the regional shallow unconfined aquifer, summer rainfall, or both to meet water demands. The landscape-level differences in the water supplies sustaining these trees imply variable effects from shifts in winter-versus monsoon-related precipitation, and from climate change versus streamflow or groundwater management Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Decline or health deterioration of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated forest stands has recently been observed mainly in sub-mountainous parts of Central Europe. Forest inventory of 208 randomly distributed circular plots including field observations of spruce tree health and rot symptoms by honey fungus (Armillaria ostoyae) was used for assessing intensity of spruce forest health decline in a managed forest area of 12.7 th. ha located in Beskids Mts., NE Czech Republic. First, principal component analysis was used to separate inventory variables related to environmental stress (reduced apical increment, dry tree top and stem resin exudation due to A. ostoyae infestation) into PC1, and health deterioration symptoms associated with mechanical damage (peeling, crown breaks) into PC2. The first two principal components explained 59% of the total variability in health decline symptoms. Spatial variability of both principal components was explained using spatial lag regression model identified from a set of environmental variables including sulfur and nitrogen deposition, elevation, solar radiation, age of the forest stands and geological properties (geochemical reactivity index). Environmental stress (PC1) was associated with low elevations (sub-optimal for spruce), high level of nitrogen and sulfur deposition (their interaction), low geochemical reactivity and also stand age. On the other hand, mechanical damage (PC2) significantly increased with elevation and stand age. As the forest decline in Beskids Mts. is related to A. ostoyae spreading from local infestation hot spots, both principal components had a significant spatial autocorrelation, partly distorting the signal of environmental conditions. The results indicate that the disturbed forest soils by long-term acid deposition and subsequent nutrient degradation and more pronounced drought stress at low elevations are the most important drivers of the recent spruce health decline in Beskids Mts.

AB  - Growth and mortality for different size classes (30-49 mm, 50-79 mm and 80-100 mm shell width) of the fan mussel Pinna bicolor transplanted at open sea bottom, within enclosure cages, and on suspended rafts were studied and compared over an 18-month study period. Growth, in terms of shell width, dry tissue weight and condition index of the same size class, did not show significant differences (P > 0.05) between the transplanted populations at the open sea bottom and in enclosure cages. Fastest growth was noted for the small-size class during the initial 12-month period, with a net increase in maximum shell width of 50-60 mm (100-120 mm shell length). Thereafter, growth tended to slow down and all growth parameters became similar for all the three size classes. In comparison of the small-size fan mussels between the bottom (open and caged) transplants and that on the suspended rafts, a better growth result was registered in the suspended raft population possibly due to a faster induced flow and availability of food in the water column. Mortality of transplanted P. bicolor was the highest at open sea bottom, and predominantly caused by predation by fish and crabs. Highest mortality was also noted in the small-size class as the larger fan mussels were less vulnerable to predation than the small juvenile. The number of transplanted P. bicolor at open sea bottom fell to the same natural density within the first 12 months of the study and stabilized afterwards, suggesting that the natural population of P. bicolor was controlled by its predators. In rearing of fan mussels, both growth and mortality should be considered in concert, so as to select an optimal size class of transplants which would attain the maximum growth, with minimum mortality, over the culture period.

AB  - In natural cavities, old nest material accumulates with successive use, thereby reducing the size of the cavity, and allowing the numbers of certain haematophagous ectoparasites to increase. For this reason and because researchers studying birds breeding in nest boxes typically remove old nests from boxes, the results of such studies have been questioned. The accumulation of old nest material might affect nest-site selection and nest building by hole-nesting birds, so we tested this hypothesis by manipulating the presence and amount of old nest material in nest boxes of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Our experiment also allowed us to examine whether costs are incurred by females due to nest building in terms of their subsequent reproductive output. When a choice of boxes was available, swallows preferred empty and clean boxes, or those where the old material had been microwaved, over those with old, untouched material. Clean boxes and those with microwaved material had more space inside, so our experiments support two hypotheses: swallows avoid potentially high numbers of parasites in nests with old material; or they prefer large cavities. Empty boxes affected nest building. The mass and volume of nests built in clean boxes were greater than for nests built on old material. Females did not add more feathers to the nest lining in boxes with old material as compared with clean boxes. Correlation analyses suggested that females building large nests began egg laying earlier in both years. Otherwise, there were no associations between the sizes of nests built by females and subsequent reproductive output (e.g. clutch size) or nestling size (e.g. body-condition index). Our results show that the common habit of removing old nests from boxes can affect nest-site choice and nest-building behavior. Nest building does not influence reproductive output by Tree Swallows.

AB  - Cork oak (Quercus suber L., 1753) is a Mediterranean evergreen tree species with a thick and characteristic bark covering the trunk and branches. Despite the fact that cork oak is distributed over about 1.7 million hectares in the western Mediterranean Basin, information about soil biota in this particular habitat at present is scanty. This study was carried out in a cork tree wood in Bergeggi (Liguria, NW Italy), characterized by a Pluvioseasonal Oceanic Mediterranean bioclimate. The profile, texture, pH, total carbonate content, total organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents, soluble phosphorus (P) and cation exchange capacity were measured in order to characterize the soil. Soil biological quality was evaluated by studying microarthropod communities. Each month, from February 2007 to January 2008, 10 soil samples measuring 10x10x10cm were collected from the wood being studied and arthropods were extracted using Berlese-Tullgren funnels. The biological quality of soil based on arthropods (QBS-ar) index, taxa abundance, Shannon diversity index (H') and Pielou's evenness index (J) were applied to assess soil biological quality in the cork oak being studied.
   A total of 29 taxonomic groups were identified. Some important groups, such as Pseudoscorpionida, Palpigradi, Miriapoda and Protura were detected every month, but only a few groups showed a clear abundance distribution trend throughout the year and globally it was impossible to define general trends. The results suggested that the condition of the soil was good, as generally observed in natural environments not subjected to significant impacts. It was also possible to demonstrate that the Mediterranean climate causes strong seasonal fluctuations in soil biota, resulting in corresponding differences in the QBS-ar index values. Therefore, the QBS-ar index could be considered to be a valid candidate for the biomonitoring of soil biodiversity in natural and anthropic soils, but in Mediterranean climates comparisons of different areas must be performed analyzing samples collected during the same period.

AB  - We measured survival, growth, and body condition of 8 hatchling cohorts of desert tortoises Gopherus agassizii (living in predator-resistant outdoor pens in the Mojave Desert, California, USA) over 11 yr to evaluate head-starting methods. At 11 yr of age, 7 times as many of the first cohort had survived than if they had been free-living tortoises. Subsequent improvements in predator control, food and water supplementation, and pen structure increased survival from 7 to 10 times that under wild conditions in younger cohorts. Annual survival averaged 96%. Carapace length (CL) increased 6.95 mm yr-1, similar to that of free-living tortoises. Annual growth rates varied with calendar year (possibly reflecting food and water supply), age, cohort (year hatched), mother, and in 4 dry years, with crowding. Most of the first cohort grew to a releasable size (CL > 100 mm) by their 9th year. Body condition indices remained high, indicating little dehydration despite droughts in 8 of the 11 years, because irrigation offered drinking opportunities. Headstarted tortoises developed fully hardened shells (>= 98% of adult shell hardness) earlier (10.1 vs. 11.6 yr), but at a larger CL (117 vs. 104 mm) than did free-living tortoises. Selective feeding in head-start pens decreased subsequent germination of favored wildflower species, apparently by reducing the natural seedbank. Consequently, we reseeded and irrigated each autumn to promote subsequent spring food supply. We irrigated in early summer to enable drinking and ensuing consumption of dry, dead plants and Bermuda grass hay, a supplement. These procedures can greatly improve juvenile survivorship, and increase numbers of hard-shelled, midsized juveniles to help augment wild populations.

AB  - The diverse old-growth forests in Klamath region of northern California and southern Oregon provide valuable ecosystem services (e.g., maintaining watersheds, wildlife habitat, recreation), but may be vulnerable to a wide range of stressors, including invasive species, disrupted disturbance regimes, and climatic change. Yet our understanding of how forest structure in the Klamath region relates to the current physical environment is limited. Here we provide present-day benchmarks for old-growth forest structure across a climatic gradient ranging from coastal to dry interior sites. We established 16 large (1 ha) forest plots where all stems > 5 cm in diameter were identified to species and mapped. Climate across these sites was highly variable, with estimated actual evapotranspiration correlated to several basic measures of forest structure, including plot basal area, stem size-class inequality, tree species diversity and, to a lesser extent, tree species richness. Analyses of the spatial arrangement of stems indicated a high degree of non-uniformity, with 75% of plots showing significant stem clumping at small spatial scales (0 to 10 m). Downscaled predictions of future site water balance suggest changes will be dominated by rapidly increasing climatic water deficit (D, a biologically meaningful index of drought). While these plots give a picture of current conditions, continued monitoring of these stands is needed to describe forest dynamics and to detect forest responses to ongoing and future stressors.

AB  - Sedimentation in the sea occurs through natural processes, such as wave and tidal action, which can be exacerbated during storms and floods. Changes in terrestrial land use, marine aggregate extraction, dredging, drilling and mining are known to result in substantial sediment deposition. Research suggests that deposition will also occur due to the modern development of marine renewable energy. The response to individual burial under three depths of sediment, three sediment fractions and five burial durations was investigated in two mussel species, Modiolus modiolus and Mytilus edulis in specialist mesocosms. Both mussel species showed substantial mortality, which increased with duration of burial and burial by finer sediment fractions. M. modiolus was better able to survive short periods of burial than M. edulis, but at longer durations mortality was more pronounced. No mortality was observed in M. modiolus in burial durations of eight days or less but by 16 days of burial, over 50% cumulative mortality occurred. Under variable temperature regimes, M. edulis mortality increased from 20% at 8 degrees C to over 60% at 14.5 and 20 degrees C. Only M. edulis was able to emerge from burial, facilitated by increased byssus production, laid mostly on vertical surfaces but also on sediment particles. Emergence was higher from coarse sediment and shallow burials. Byssus production in M. edulis was not related to the condition index of the mussels. Results suggest that even marginal burial would result in mortality and be more pronounced in warm summer periods. Our results suggest that in the event of burial, adult M. modiolus would not be able to emerge from burial unless local hydrodynamics assist, whereas a small proportion of M. edulis may regain contact with the sediment water interface. The physiological stress resulting in mortality, contribution of local hydrodynamics to survival and other ecological pressures such as mussels existing in aggregations, are discussed.

AB  - Chrosomus cumberlandensis (Blackside Dace [BSD]) and Etheostoma spilotum (Kentucky Arrow Darter [KAD]) are fish species of conservation concern due to their fragmented distributions, their low population sizes, and threats from anthropogenic stressors in the southeastern United States. We evaluated the relationship between fish abundance and stream conductivity, an index of environmental quality and potential physiological stressor. We modeled occurrence and abundance of KAD in the upper Kentucky River basin (208 samples) and BSD in the upper Cumberland River basin (294 samples) for sites sampled between 2003 and 2013. Segmented regression indicated a conductivity change-point for BSD abundance at 343 mu S/cm (95% CI: 123-563 mu S/cm) and for KAD abundance at 261 mu S/cm (95% CI: 151-370 mu S/cm). In both cases, abundances were negligible above estimated conductivity change-points. Post-hoc randomizations accounted for variance in estimated change points due to unequal sample sizes across the conductivity gradients. Boosted regression-tree analysis indicated stronger effects of conductivity than other natural and anthropogenic factors known to influence stream fishes. Boosted regression trees further indicated threshold responses of BSD and KAD occurrence to conductivity gradients in support of segmented regression results. We suggest that the observed conductivity relationship may indicate energetic limitations for insectivorous fishes due to changes in benthic macroinvertebrate community composition.

AB  - Fisheries acoustic instruments provide information on four major groups in aquatic ecosystems: fish with and without swim bladder (tertiary and quaternary consumers), fluidlike zooplankton (secondary consumers) and small gas bearing organisms such as larval fish and phytoplankton (predominantly primary producers). We entertain that this information is useable to describe the spatial structure of organism groups in pelagic ecosystems. The proposal we make is based on a multi-frequency indicator that synthesises in a single metric the shape of the acoustic frequency response of different organism groups, i.e. the dependence of received acoustic backscattered energy on emitting echosounder frequency. We demonstrate the development and interpretation of the multi-frequency indicator using simulated data. We then calculate the indicator for acoustic water-column survey data from the Bay of Biscay and use it to create reference maps for the spatial structure of the four scattering groups as well as their small scale spatial variability. These maps provide baselines for monitoring future changes in the structure of the pelagic ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances are widely recognized as major threats to terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity worldwide, including areas located in non-forest ecosystems. Headwater streams in the neotropical savanna are severely threatened by large-scale landscape changes that degrade local habitat characteristics and lead to biodiversity loss. The objective of our study was to evaluate Ephemeroptera assemblages as bioindicators of catchment land use and cover, local streambed and riparian vegetation conditions, and instream water quality. To do so, we sampled mayfly nymphs in 184 stream sites across a broad disturbance gradient in four hydrologic units of the Brazilian neotropical savanna. We selected seven metrics without significant co-variation with natural variability: % catchment urban, riparian vegetation condition index (RCOND), human disturbances of the stream channel and riparian zone (Wl_HALL), substrate mean embeddedness (XEMBED), dissolved oxygen (mg L-1), pH, and total phosphorus (mg L-1). We ran threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN) for each disturbance metric to detect change points in mayfly genera responses (whether sensitive or tolerant) and assemblage turnover pattern. TITAN showed that 20 of the 39 genera found were robust bioindicators (based on purity and reliability values >0.95), sixteen of them being sensitive to increased disturbance. The most sensitive genera were Tricorythopsis (Leptohyphidae) and Camelobaetidius (Baetidae), showing decreased abundance to most disturbance metrics. We found a turnover pattern of mayfly genera in response to Wl_HALL in a narrow variation range. For total phosphorus, the benchmark value defined in Brazilian Federal Legislation is higher than the turnover threshold of several mayfly genera. This indicates that we will lose many sensitive genera even within the limits imposed by national environmental legislation. The indicator taxa approach, based on multiple taxa rather than univariate metrics or single indicator species, demonstrates the value of quantitative ecological information for conserving and managing freshwater ecosystems globally.

AB  - With the gradual emergence and development of rural tourism, more and more people are choosing to travel to the countryside to experience natural scenery and historical culture different from that of the city. At the same time, inappropriate tourism development methods will inevitably have a negative impact on the relatively fragile rural ecological environment. How to maintain and improve the ecological environment of the countryside while developing tourism has become an important part of building an 'eco-livable' green countryside. This paper takes the assessment of the ecological carrying capacity of rural tourism as the theoretical basis for the evaluation of rural ecological environment, and explores the main factors and the degree of influence on ecological carrying capacity in rural tourism development. Firstly, the environmental impact factors of rural tourism development and the specific ecological carrying capacity indexes are established, and four main impact factors of tourist capacity overload, ecological space occupation. environmental protection problems and service facilities carrying capacity are summarised and the corresponding 14 ecological carrying capacity indexes are identified; secondly, the ecological carrying capacity evaluation index system of rural tourism is constructed. and the hierarchical analysis method is applied to the factors at the criterion level and the factors at the indicator level for weight analysis. Then, five traditional villages with good conditions for rural tourism development in Gansu Province (Tiantang A village in Tianzhu County, Huaqiao B village in Kang County, YueYaQuan C Village in Dunhuang City. Hekou D village in Lanzhou City, Fenghuang E village in Jingchuan county) were selected for empirical research. Finally, based on specific ecological problems, development principles and development countermeasures for improving the ecological environment of rural tourism in Gansu were proposed. The results of the study show that, through the evaluation of the ecological carrying capacity of the five villages, the evaluation result is that two villages are at the weak load level and three villages are at the moderate load level. In the summary of the main impact factors, the percentage of ecological land and the fragmentation of ecological land are common problems in the five villages and are factors with a high level of impact; the wastewater pollution treatment rate and the carrying capacity of toilet facilities each appear twice, indicating that they are at a medium level of impact, while the remaining impact factors vary from village to village and are individual problems for each village, with the lowest level of impact.

AB  - This paper proposes a general approach to deal with flutter instability of the magnetic-electric-thermo-elastic functionally graded plates (METE-FGPPs) subject to supersonic airflow with any yawed angle. The unified method is established on the basis of the first order shear deformation theory and the supersonic piston theory. Various boundary conditions, two porosity distributions and three temperature distributions are taken into consideration. The material properties and temperature gradient distribution changing continuously along the thickness are evaluated according to Voigt model and the formulations of motion equations of METE-FGPPs can be derived by adopting Rayleigh-Ritz method. In order to satisfy various boundary conditions easily, the physical spring technology is used. The displacement functions can be expressed by using the characteristic orthogonal polynomials to improve the convergence of the numerical calculations. Firstly, the convergence of the present method is confirmed by verifying the convergence of the physical spring and truncated numbers. Then, the versatility, stability and accuracy are verified by some numerical examples and experiments. Finally, the influences of the key parameters, including power law indexes, boundary conditions, magnetic potential, electric voltage, temperature and yawed flow angles etc, on the flutter instability of the METE-FGPPs are discussed in detail.

AB  - The impact of cell culture environment on the glycan distribution of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been investigated through a combination of experiments and modeling. A newly developed CHO DUXB cell line was cultivated at two levels of initial Glutamine (Gln) concentrations (0, 4 mM) and incubation temperatures of (33 and 37 A degrees C) in batch operation mode. Hypothermia was applied either through the entire culture duration or only during the post-exponential phase. Beyond reducing cell growth and increasing productivity, hypothermia significantly altered the galactosylation index profiles as compared to control conditions. A novel semi-empirical dynamic model was proposed for elucidating the connections between the extracellular cell culture conditions to galactosylation index. The developed model is based on a simplified balance of nucleotides sugars and on the correlation between sugars' levels to the galactosylation index (GI). The model predictions were found to be in a good agreement with the experimental data. The proposed empirical model is expected to be useful for controlling the glycoprofiles by manipulating culture conditions.

AB  - Mounting evidence exists to indicate that Lake Erie is once again experiencing eutrophication. Such signs include increases in both the incidence of harmful algal blooms in the western basin and the re-emergence of large hypoxic areas in bottom waters of the central basin. Towards further assessing Lake Erie's health and the degree to which this ecosystem has become more eutrophic, we calculated a Planktonic Index of Biotic Integrity (P-IBI) for the western and central basins of Lake Erie during 2003-2013 and compared values to P-IBI values from previous periods of heightened eutrophy (1970) and the recovery from eutrophy (1995-2002). As expected, P-IBI scores in the eutrophic/hypereutrophic range (<3) have predominated in both the western and central basins during 2003-2013. This decline in P-IBI scores (and hence, ecosystem health), however, has been more evident in the western basin than in the central basin. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

AB  - We examine the variation in condition of ten exploited fish species as an indicator of large-scale habitat quality in the north-western Mediterranean. To determine fish condition, we used morphometric (Fulton's K) and physiological (hepatosomatic, HSI; digestivesomatic, DSI; and gonadosomatic, GSI) indices. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were applied to assess the influence of depth, latitude, length, year, sex and reproductive status on condition. The GLMs incorporating all independent variables accounted for between 25 and 74% of the variance in Fulton's K condition factor, 15-77% of the variance in HSI, 14-35% of the variance in DSI, and 77% of the variance in GSI. The mean condition factor of the species studied showed considerable interannual fluctuations along with an increasing trend over the time series (1994-2001). Length is an important explanatory variable in explaining condition of fish species. Condition typically increased with fish length and explained 72% of the deviance in GSI of M. barbatus. For some species, there were differences in condition due to sex and reproductive status, with adults being usually better in condition than juveniles and, among adults, females better than males. The influence of latitude and depth on condition of a given species varied according to the index used to assess condition. When there was a significant effect, fish with the highest condition factor, HSI and/or DSI inhabited the shallowest and northernmost parts of the area of study. Considering that condition influences growth, reproduction and survival of fish, our results support the importance of shallow habitats to productivity of demersal stocks in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Chick body condition can be a sensitive indicator of local environmental conditions and has been shown to be correlated with chick survival. Designing a reliable index of chick body condition for a given species from a single measurement point requires knowledge about the extent of variation in body size, about chick age and about the relative sensitivity of the growth of different biometric measures to variation in environmental conditions. To gain this knowledge, we describe sex-specific variation in growth of several morphometric measures and body mass of Eurasian Spoonbills Platalea leucorodia. We repeatedly measured 35 chicks that grew up in small colonies on the island of Schiermonnikoog to derive detailed growth curves until fledging (based on the 12 surviving chicks) and to assess the extent of reduction in growth of starved chicks measured at least twice (n = 11) compared to those that survived. Growth curves until fledging were compared with biometric measurements of two to five week old chicks from (mostly) larger colonies of which hatching date was accurately estimated (n = 631). Growth of all measures, except the eighth primary, was sex-specific, with the most pronounced sex effect on the asymptotic values of tarsus length and body mass: adult males were predicted to become 17% heavier than females and to have 22% longer tarsi than females. Body mass and tarsus growth tended to be more reduced under food deprivation than (head-)bill and eighth primary growth. As an index of chick body condition, we propose to use the proportional deviation in body mass from the predicted body mass for a given age and sex. To do so, measurements of nearly fledged Spoonbill chicks should include at least eighth primary length to estimate age, tarsus length to estimate sex, and body mass as a measure that integrates age, sex and environmental effects.

AB  - Establishment of a benchmark against which deleterious changes to an estuary can be evaluated requires validating that it has not been subjected to detrimental anthropogenic perturbations and then identifying the biological features which are indicative of a pristine condition and can thus be employed as indicators for detecting and monitoring departures from the natural state. The characteristics of the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna of an essentially pristine, seasonally-open estuary in Western Australia (Broke Inlet) have been determined and compared with those previously recorded for a nearby eutrophic, seasonally-open estuary (Wilson Inlet). Density was far lower in Broke than Wilson. Compositions differed radically at all taxonomic levels, with polychaetes contributing less, and crustaceans more, to the abundance in Broke. Average taxonomic distinctness was greater for Broke than both Wilson and 16 other temperate southern hemisphere estuaries, whereas the reverse was true for variation in taxonomic distinctness, emphasizing that Broke Inlet is pristine.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to establish an environmental management zoning for coal mining industry which is served as a basis for making environmental management policies. Based on the specific impacts of coal mining and regional characteristics of environment and resources, the ecological impact, water resources impact, and arable land impact are chose as the zoning indexes to construct the index system. The ecological sensitivity is graded into three levels of low, medium, and high according to analytical hierarchy processes and gray fixed weight clustering analysis, and the water resources sensitivity is divided into five levels of lower, low, medium, high, and higher according to the weighted sum of sub-indexes, while only the arable land sensitive zone was extracted on the basis of the ratio of arable land to the county or city. By combining the ecological sensitivity zoning and the water resources sensitive zoning and then overlapping the arable-sensitive areas, the mainland China is classified into six types of environmental management zones for coal mining except to the forbidden exploitation areas.

AB  - Biochemical and fatty acid composition of the bivalve Arca noae were investigated in the Mali Ston Bay in relation to environmental conditions. Sampling was carried out monthly, from December 2001 to November 2002. Wet shellfish meat consists on average of 77.61% water and 22.39% dry matter, while dry shellfish meat consists on average of 89.04% organic and 10.96% inorganic matter. PCA analysis identified temperature, nitrate, silicate, MICRO, Chl a and salinity as the most important environmental factors influencing the biochemical composition of A. noae. An increase of dry weight content of A. noae was observed during the spring when both the sea temperature and food supply increased rapidly. Protein (54.39-62.06% of dry weight), carbohydrate (4.13-8.07% of dry weight) and lipid (3.46-8.58% of dry weight) content varied significantly during the year. Protein and lipid level reached the maximum value in June. The fatty acid profiles of total lipids extracted from A. noae showed a high level of unsaturation (UNS/SAT 1.9-3.4). Total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) represented the majority of total fatty acids (40.3-59.9% of total fatty acids) and the most abundant were eicosapentaenoic (20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic (22:6n-3) acid. The n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio value varied between 2.1 and 5.0 and was highest during the spring (April to June). Due to their low lipid and high percentage of healthy polyunsaturated fatty acids A. noae can be evaluated as a quality seafood product. The most suitable period of the year for the consumption of A. noae is in the spring when it reaches its highest nutritional value.

AB  - Environmental pollution tends to reduce the quality of water sources around the world. Thus, there is a clear need for strategic assessments of conditions that negatively affect river basins. The Sao Joao River basin is located in a strategic conservation area due to the abounding water resources and biodiversity, but is strongly affected by anthropic activity. In this study, eight metals were evaluated (Cu, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cr, Co, Cd and Pb) in sediment and water from ten different points in the Sao Joao water basin. The Sao Joao basin pollution was evaluated through the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), ecological risk potential (ERP) and degree of pollution (Dp). The most toxic metals found in sediments were Cr (3.1-10.7), Cd (2.1-5.5) and Pb (5.0-28.1) in mu g g(-1). In the water samples, the most toxic metals were Cr (3.7-33.2), Cd (6.3-14.2) and Pb (5.0-57.5) in lg L-1. The Igeo presented indices between 2 and 3 in 80% of the samples, indicating significant pollution in the sediment. In 40% of the points sampled, the ERP values indicated severe risk for the ecosystem. In 30% of the water samples, the Dp values were over 40, indicating the highest pollution level. The results reveal that the use of land and water in the Sao Joao water basin without proper care might represent considerably high ecological and sanitary risk.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the bioclimatic thermal stress assessed by Equivalent Temperature Index (ETI) and Temperature Humidity Index (THI) on Braford and Nellore bulls sperm quality during the reproductive seasons at the tropical region in the Brazilian Pantanal. We used 20 bulls aged approximately 24 months at the beginning of the study. Five ejaculates per animal were collected using an electroejaculator. Temperature, air humidity, and wind speed data were collected every hour from the automatic weather station at the National Institute of Meteorology. Infrared thermography images data were collected to assess the testicular temperature gradient in each animal. Data were analyzed with ANOVA using MIXED procedure of SAS and means were compared using Tukey's HSD test. The THI and ETI at 12 days (epididymal transit) were higher in January (89.7 and 28.5, respectively) and February (90.0 and 29.0, respectively) compared to other months (P < 0.01). Total seminal defects differ only in Bradford bulls between the months of November and February. Nellore bulls had lower major defects (MaD) and total defects (TD) compared to Braford. Nellore bulls showed correlation between minor defects (MiD) and THI for 30 days (0.90) and 18 days (0.88; P < 0.05). Braford bulls showed correlation for MaD (0.89) in ETI for 12 days (P < 0.05). Infrared thermography showed no difference between animals. Reproductive response to environmental changes is a consequence of Nellore and Braford adaptation to climate stress conditions. Both THI and ETI environmental indexes can be used to evaluate the morphological changes in the seminal parameters in Nellore or Braford bulls; however, more experiments should be performed focusing on larger sample numbers and also in reproductive assessment during the consecutive years to assess fertility potential.

AB  - Background: Being established in 1988 in the vicinity of Isfahan city, Mubarakeh Steel complex has imposed adverse environmental and health effects within the area. The study area is covered by lots of farms through which major crops like wheat and rice are provided.
   Methods: Considering the imposed pollution load of the complex, the current study has monitored the concentration of metals Fe, Al, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn, Co, Mo, As in 14 soil samples within the study area. Furthermore, human health hazards of mentioned metals due to consumption of domestic rice and wheat have also been evaluated through different scenarios. In order to evaluate the mobility of metals in soil samples the sequential chemical analysis is performed.
   Results: Regarding the accumulation of metals in loose phases the order of metals bioavailability risk level is estimated to be as follows:
   Co > Cd > Mo > Ba > As > Pb > Mn > Cu > V > Zn > Cr > Ni
   Discussion: An index approach is also considered to evaluate the severity of metal contamination. Regarding geochemical accumulation index, only cadmium is detected to be in a moderately contaminated status while other metals declare an unpolluted condition. Index of pollution pays more attention to mobility potential of metals and accordingly detects metals Co, Mn, As, Pb, Cd, Ba and Mo to be in a moderately contaminated level. On the other hand, enrichment factor declares all toxic metals except for Co, Ba and V to be enriched.
   Conclusions: Considering human health hazard assessment, except for Fe, Ba, Cu and Zn, all metals intakes in different scenarios are considered as hazardous while their CDI values are much more than the respective oral reference doses.

AB  - The introduction of the European Water Framework Directive has increased the interest in benthic foraminifera as a biomonitoring tool. This prompted the need to standardise the methods used to analyse benthic foraminifera, including which sediment fraction to analyse. In some regions benthic foraminifera produce small ( 125 mu m) adult tests, and the current study assessed the effect of analysing the 63 mu m or > 125 mu m fraction on determining the Ecological Quality Status (EcoQS) in two fjords in northern Norway. The diversity indices ShannonWiener index (H'log2) and Hurlbert's rarefaction index (ES100), and the multi-metric Norwegian Quality Index (NQI), from both the > 63 mu m and > 125 mu m fraction resulted in the same or similar EcoQS, reflecting good environmental conditions in both fjords. The same applied to the AZTI's Marine Biological Index (AMBI), except at one location which had moderate EcoQS. At this location especially, more foraminifera with a tolerant or opportunistic response to organic matter enrichment occurred in the > 63 mu m fraction than in the > 125 mu m fraction. Hence, the higher H'log2 and ES100 of the > 63 mu m fraction can be somewhat misleading as it indicates better environmental conditions, whereas the AMBI indicates more organic matter input. The Stainforthia group and Epistominella vitrea, indicating organic matter enrichment and increased primary productivity were, however, mostly absent in the > 125 mu m fraction. Their absence in this fraction could have consequences for monitoring potential anthropogenic pressure factors and identifying long-term changes in environmental conditions when using this fraction. This study suggests the > 125 mu m would be mostly sufficient for determining the EcoQS in northern Norway.

AB  - This paper presents evaluation of snow accretion properties of long-rod and cap & pin insulators focusing on the phenomena found in the snowstorm in 2005, which related to wet snow accretion packed with sea-salt. Field observations at severe natural environment and laboratory tests under defined conditions were parallelly carried out in order to clarify wet snow accretion process under various conditions.
   In field observations, it was confirmed that snow easily accreted on insulators at temperature range especially between 0 and +1.0 degrees C. The long-rod insulator's sheds were bridged more easily than that of cap & pin type because of its narrower shed spacing. In laboratory tests, cylindrical snow accretion, which was found in the snowstorm in 2005, was achieved. The mechanisms on explaining snow accretion on long-rod insulators were found to be similar to those confirmed for wires. The laboratory simulations agree well with the field observations.
   In order to estimate the amount of snow flux on insulators caused by a snow event for given climatic conditions, an index called the snow accretion potential ability (SAP) was proposed. SAP is defined by using the snow flux and associated with the weight term in the index for the snow stress product (SSP). SAP was adopted to evaluate snow accretion characteristics by field observations and laboratory tests, and the snow accretion phenomenon during a snowstorm in 2005 was discussed.

AB  - A multibiomarker approach was carried out for the first time in the South Portuguese Coast using Mytilus galloprovincialis, to assess environmental quality, establish if there are adverse biological responses associated to different sources of anthropogenic contamination and to determine spatial and seasonal trends. For this purpose the battery of biomarkers selected was: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPx total and Se dependent), Cytochrome P450 component system, Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), metallothionein (MT) and lead-delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and Condition Index (CI) along with the determination of PAHs and metals (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn). Results show that despite the levels of both organic and metallic contaminants in these eight spots in the South Coast of Portugal not being particularly high compared with other contaminated/polluted sites worldwide, the selected battery of biomarkers responded efficiently to the environmental changes and allowed an environmental assessment between seasons and sites. Different spatial and seasonal responses were evident along the South Coast of Portugal, meaning that the contamination is not homogeneous. This does not only reflect different competition, origin and intensity of contamination, but also different environmental conditions (e. g. temperature, salinity). Along the South Portuguese Coast site 8 was the most contaminated, while site 2 was considered the least contaminated. Despite environmental factors possibly causing difficulties in the general interpretation of biomarker data, those that better responded to environmental contamination were CYP450, SOD-mit and T-GPx for the Sigma PAHs, MT (digestive gland) for metals (especially Cu), ALAD for Pb and LPO for both organic and metallic contamination. These biomarkers were also positively correlated with temperature in summer, revealing this as a more stressful/critical season. In future environmental contamination assessments there is no need to analyse the components b5, P418, NADH and NADPH of phase I MFO system, and MT in the gills, since their responses are not evident.

AB  - Aim. - Alterations of biological rhythms are well recognized to play a crucial role in the origin and maintenance of depression, but little is known about the profile of circadian rhythms at a premorbid age in adult depressed patients. The present study was aimed at investigating the association, if any, of depressive disorders with biological and behavioural rhythm modifications both at the time of observation and at an earlier age than the clinical onset of depression. The hypothesis was that such modifications could be an early biological index of vulnerability to the illness.
   Subjects and methods. - One hundred and seventy-eight patients affected by DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder were examined/observed, compared to a group of 178 matched healthy subjects. All the included subjects were asked to fill in a retrospective questionnaire reporting time of awakening and falling asleep and time of subjective peaks of appetite, energy and cognitive function during "Adolescence" (12-15 years), "Youth" (16-20 years) and "Present condition" periods.
   Results. - An advance of awakening time by about 20 minutes during "Adolescence" was reported in the depressed subjects as compared to the controls. Awakening is also reported as significantly (P < 0.001) advanced by about 36 minutes during "Youth" in depressed patients, while time of falling asleep at the same age in the patients group shows 19 minutes delay. Regarding "Present condition" an advance of awakening time (33 minutes) in depressed patients was reported, in association with a delay of the subjective peak of cognitive functioning (62 minutes). Discussion. - Depressed patients show clear-cut differences in sleep pattern as compared to controls, consisting in a constant and significant advance of awakening time, while the time of sleep onset never reaches any statistical difference between the groups throughout ages.
   Conclusions. - The results are consistent with the hypothesis that early alterations of the general circadian profile can contribute to the onset of adult life Major Depressive Disorders. (c) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The USDA Forest Service and Environmental Protection Agency have cooperatively developed a knowledge base for assessment and monitoring of ecological states and processes in sixth-code watersheds. The knowledge base provides a formal logical specification for evaluating watershed processes, patterns, general effects of human influence, and specific effects on salmon habitat. The knowledge base was designed in the NetWeaver knowledge base development system and evaluated in the Ecosystem Management Decision Support (EMDS) system. EMDS is an application framework for knowledge-based decision support of ecological landscape analysis at any geographic scale. The system integrates geographic information system and knowledge base system technologies to provide an analytical tool for environmental assessment and monitoring. The basic objective of EMDS is to improve the quality and completeness of environmental assessments and the efficiency with which they are performed. This paper presents an overview of the NetWeaver and EMDS systems, describes the general structure of the knowledge base for watershed assessment, and presents a small example of its use for evaluating erosion processes.

AB  - The stone crayfish Austropotamobius torrentium (Schrank, 1803) is a native European species distributed in central and southeastern Europe. Recent molecular phylogenetic research has shown that at least seven distinct monophyletic phylogroups exist within A. torrentium, with the highest genetic diversity found within the northern-central Dinaric (NCD) region in Croatia. Genetic divergence for some of these phylogroups was sufficiently large to suggest that they might actually represent cryptic species. Our research studied the morphometric and meristic characteristics of stone crayfish populations in the Zumberak-Samoborsko gorje Nature Park (Croatia) situated in the genetically diverse NCD region. The aim was to test whether there are some morphological features that clearly separate stone crayfish belonging to the three previously identified phylogroups into distinct groups based on morphology. We analysed morphological data of stone crayfish belonging to three distinct populations inhabiting small streams within the Zumberak-Samoborsko gorje Nature Park. Analyses showed that there are significant differences in some of the recorded morphometric and meristic characteristics between the studied populations for both males and females. Multivariate discriminant analyses of the measured morphological features revealed the characteristics that clearly separate populations in a similar way as molecular methods. For males, these were the characteristics describing claws, carapace, and rostrum, and for females those describing carapace, rostrum, and total length. Percentage of correctly classified crayfish per population was high (91-100%) for both sexes. Although isolated stone crayfish populations showed morphological and genetic differences, no significant correlations were obtained between genetic and morphometric distances. Analyses of additional samples and application of different genetic markers are needed to elucidate the relationships between the different populations of the stone crayfish.

AB  - Vegetation, soils, on-site disturbances, and watershed land use and land cover were assessed at 81 coastal tidal wetland sites using the New England Rapid Assessment Method. Condition indices (CIs) were derived from various combinations of the multi-dimensional data using principal component analyses and a ranking approach. Nested within the 81 wetlands was a set of ten reference sites which encompassed a range of watershed development and nitrogen loadings. The reference set of coastal tidal wetlands was previously examined with an intensive assessment, which included detailed measures of vegetation, soils, and infauna. Significant relationships were found between most of the rapid assessment CIs and the intensive assessment index. Significant relationships were also found between rapid assessment CIs and the developed lands in a 1-km buffer around the coastal wetlands. The regression results of the rapid assessment CIs with the intensive assessment index suggest that measures of vegetation communities, marsh landscape features, onsite marsh disturbances, and watershed natural lands can be used to develop valid CIs, and that it is unnecessary to make finer scale measurements of plant species and soils when evaluating ambient condition of coastal tidal wetlands in southern New England. However, increasing the survey points within coastal tidal wetland units when using a rapid assessment method in southern New England would allow for more observations of vegetation communities, marsh landscape features, and disturbances. Nevertheless, more detailed measures of hydrology, soils, plant species, and other biota may be necessary for tracking restoration or mitigation projects. A robust and standardized rapid assessment method will allow New England states to inventory the ambient condition of coastal tidal wetlands, assess long-term trends, and support management activities to restore and maintain healthy wetlands.

AB  - The use of silver in various spheres of life and production leads to an increase in environmental pollution, including soil. At the same time, the environmental consequences of silver pollution of soils have been studied to a much lesser extent than those of other heavy metals. The aim of this study is to estimate silver ecotoxicity using the soil state biological indicators. We studied soils that are significantly different in resistance to heavy metal pollution: ordinary chernozem (Haplic Chernozems, Loamic), sierosands (Haplic Arenosols, Eutric), and brown forest acidic soil (Haplic Cambisols, Eutric). Contamination was simulated in the laboratory. Silver was introduced into the soil in the form of nitrate in doses of 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg. Changes in biological parameters were assessed 10, 30, and 90 days after contamination. Silver pollution of soils in most cases leads to deterioration of their biological properties: the total number of bacteria, the abundance of bacteria of the genusAzotobacter, the activity of enzymes (catalase and dehydrogenases), and the phytotoxicity indicators decrease. The degree of reduction in biological properties depends on the silver concentration in the soil and the period from the contamination moment. In most cases, there is a direct relationship between the silver concentration and the degree of deterioration of the studied soil properties. The silver toxic effect was most pronounced on the 30th day after contamination. In terms of their resistance to silver pollution, the studied soils are in the following order: ordinary chernozem > sierosands >= brown forest soil. The light granulometric composition of sierosands and the acidic reaction of the environment of brown forest soils, as well as the low content of organic matter, contribute to high mobility and, consequently, high ecotoxicity of silver in these soils. The regional maximum permissible concentration (rMPC) of silver in ordinary chernozem (Haplic Chernozems, Loamic) is 4.4 mg/kg, in sierosands (Haplic Arenosols, Eutric) 0.9 mg/kg, and in brown forest soils (Haplic Cambisols, Eutric) 0.8 mg/kg.

AB  - High levels of ammonium in groundwater is a potential threat to drinking water security and ecological status. The role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in mobilization of natural ammonium in groundwater is crucial but the intrinsic link between them has still been poorly understood. This study used high-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and fluorescence excitataion-emission-matrix spectra (EEMs) with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to elucidate the influence of DOM characteristics in groundwater systems having contrastive ammonium levels in Dongting Plain, central Yangtze River. The results indicate that NH4+-N concentration in groundwater of western plain (0-16.75 mg/L) are much higher compared with southern plain (0-1.5 mg/L). The groundwater in western plain is in a more reductive environment and characterized by larger molecular weight (MW) of DOM and lower polydispersity (rho), whereas DOM with relatively small molecular weight and high polydispersity is detected in the south with a more oxidative condition. The groundwater in western plain is characterized by lower fluorescence index (f450/500) and biological index (BIX), and dominated by the high molecular weight terrestrial humic-like component and larger amounts of microbial humic-like components. Protein-like is the main component in groundwater of southern plain with higher f450/500 and BIX. The ammonium concentration in groundwater correlates well with molecular weight and increases significantly with the content of high molecular weight terrestrial humic-like component, indicating that mobilization of ammonium is more closely associated with the terrestrial organic matter of high molecular weight. This study further enriches the theory on mobilization of ammonium in Quaternary alluvial-lacustrine aquifer systems and provides theoretical basis for the local water supply security.

AB  - Recent climate change has caused comparatively rapid shifts in the phenology and geographic distributions of many plants and animals. However, there is debate over the degree to which populations can meet the challenges of climate change with evolutionary or phenotypic responses in life history and morphology. We report that migrating birds captured at a banding station in western Pennsylvania, USA, have exhibited steadily decreasing fat-free mass and wing chord since 1961, consistent with a response to a warmer climate. This confirms that phenotypic responses to climate change are currently underway in entire avian assemblages. Declines in body size were not explained by an index of habitat condition within the breeding or wintering distributions. Instead, size was negatively correlated with temperature in the previous year, and long-term trends were associated with the direction of natural selection acting on size over the winter: species undergoing the strongest selection favoring small wing chord showed the most rapid long-term declines in wing. Phenotypic changes are therefore in line with the prevailing selection regime.

AB  - Predicted climate change scenarios for the end of this century suggest a substantial warming and ocean acidification of sea surface waters. Physiological performance of marine coastal organisms will be affected leading to changes in whole communities. In particular, ocean acidification poses an important threat for shelled molluscs. Nevertheless, climate change impacts are species-specific and responses may even differ among species that play a similar role in the ecosystems. Currently, two mussel species, the native Mytilus galloprovindalis Lamarck 1819 and the non-indigenous Xenostro bus securis Lamarck 1819, share the same habitat along shores in the inner part of the Galician Rias Babcas (NW Spain) forming mixed patchy clumps. Here, we used an experimental approach in mesocosms to evaluate the effects of increasing temperature and acidification on mussel clumps of different composition (monospecific and mixed clumps). Our model systems were artificially constructed clumps resembling those found on rocky shores. Responses to environmental stressors were measured on several functioning variables at the individual (i.e. survivorship, growth, condition index and composition of shell) and clump level (i.e. respiration, ammonia and phosphate excretion rates). The decrease of pH had a lethal effect and reduced growth on the native mussels. The invader was more resilient although individual responses were very often shaped by the composition of the clump. The reduced pH and, especially the high temperature conditions, tended to cause an increase in respiration rates of all types of clumps. Interactions between the two species seemed to modulate many effects at both individual and clump levels highlighting the complexity of responses when considering multiple stressors.

AB  - Various properties have been advocated for biological evenness indices, with some properties being clearly desirable while others appear questionable. With a focus on such properties, this paper makes a distinction between properties that are clearly necessary and those that appear to be unnecessary or even inappropriate. Based on Euclidean distances as a criterion, conditions are introduced in order for an index to provide valid, true, and realistic representations of the evenness characteristic (attribute) from species abundance distributions. Without such value-validity property, it is argued that a measure or index provides only limited information about the evenness and results in misleading interpretations and evenness comparisons and incorrect results and conclusions. Among the overabundant variety of evenness indices, each of which is typically derived by rescaling a diversity measure to the interval from 0 to 1 and thereby controlling or adjusting for the species richness, most are found to lack the value-validity property and some lack the property of strict Schur-concavity. The most popular entropy-based index reveals an especially poor performance with a substantial overstatement of the evenness characteristic or a large positive value bias. One evenness index emerges as the preferred one, satisfying all properties and conditions. This index is based directly on Euclidean distances between relevant species abundance distributions and has an intuitively meaningful interpretation in terms of relative distances between distributions. The value validity of the indices is assessed by using a recently introduced probability distribution and from the use of computer-generated distributions with randomly varying species richness and probability (proportion) components.

AB  - The periodicity of a river expressed in cycles of various lengths (monthly, seasonal, multiannual) is a result of climatic factors and overlapping environmental conditions within its catchment. In uncontrolled or poorly surveyed catchments, it is very difficult to determine the duration of a stream's hydrological activity. This is especially relevant for catchments with complicated water circulation in karstic rocks. The present study concerns the small catchment of the Strazyski Potok river located in the area of the Tatra National Park, in the Western Tatras. The observation period covered the 2015 hydrological year, which differed hydrologically from average conditions. This study aims to develop a simple method to explain the processes shaping the mountain stream discharge periodicity. The research employed periodic field observations linked with climatic and non-climatic factors. Environmental conditions were assessed as four classes reflecting their influence on appearance or disappearance of mountain stream water. Class boundaries were the values of quartiles. The degree of correspondence between environmental factors and stream field observations was described via the Index DC (Degree Correspondence Index) approach. Complete correspondence (Index DC =0) was found in 23% catchments, a weak relationship between conditions favouring discharge and actual condition (Index DC= -1, +1) was noted within 11 catchments, while in 9 catchments, no such relationship was found (Index DC = -2, +2). The obtained results indicate a correspondence or lack thereof between the environmental potential of the catchment and its discharge periodicity. The discrepancies between the assessment of the influence of climatic and non-climatic factors and the data collected during field observations provide a basis for more detailed studies. Continuation of these studies based on the proposed classifications will allow for a more complete explanation of water disappearance in river channels and the determination of their short- and long-term discharge periodicity.

AB  - Alternative diets made without marine proteins and with more plant ingredients are being used in channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus with the goal of maintaining profitability. The potential to use similar diets for baitfish may be greater because they consume natural foods throughout production. We conducted a feeding trial in outdoor pools with golden shiners Notemigonus crysoleucas using four practical diets with 28% or 32% protein in formulas with porcine meat and bone meal (MBM) or corn gluten feed (CGF) and no animal protein. Groups of 200 fish with a total initial weight of 37.7 +/- 0.9 g (mean +/- SE) were stocked into each of four 4.1-m(3)static pools per treatment and fed daily to apparent satiation for 8 weeks. Diet effects were assessed by measuring growth, survival, feed conversion, condition index, and body composition. Chlorophyll a and zooplankton were sampled to gauge natural productivity. Individual weight and total length of golden shiners were greater in fish fed diets with 32% protein than in those fed diets with 28% protein and in fish fed diets with CGF than in those fed diets with MBM. However, the differences were not commercially relevant as all fish would grade into the "small crappie minnow" category. Mean individual weight gain (based on group initial and final weights), feed intake, feed conversion, and survival were similar in golden shiners fed diets with 28% or 32% protein and MBM or CGF. However, golden shiners fed diets with MBM had more body fat, higher Fulton's K index, and higher relative weight than those fed diets with CGF. These traits may indicate greater robustness, which is more important in baitfish than rapid growth. The 28%-protein diet with MBM was the least expensive option that increased body fat and condition of golden shiners. Natural productivity was positively correlated with fish growth, enhancing the potential to use less expensive diets in golden shiners in outdoor systems.

AB  - Every year since 1993, from February to December, the French network IFREMER/REMORA has monitored mortality, growth and quality criteria of two oyster year-classes ('juveniles' of the first-year class and 'adults' of the second-year class), distributed among various stations of French oyster farming areas. This has provided a standard and simple annual assessment of the rearing results, generally tallied with professional observations. Each year, data series have been obtained, from which mean values (references), chronological trends or spatial differences can be analysed. Results in Brittany, from 1993 to 1998, show that 80% of oysters of 30 g in February grow to a range of 55-85 g at the end of the year, with a mortality rate lower than 20%. Mortality occurs mainly in spring for adults and in summer for juveniles. Although annual fluctuations exist, connected to climatic and hydrological influences, differences remain high between the monitored stations. This allows characterization of sites. Some chronological trends appeared significant, but the period of time remained too short for any prediction. On the other hand, REMORA data, especially when compared to climatological or hydrological data series, may support various types of studies: description of oyster quality, biological indicators in coastal water monitoring, explanatory models of the oyster-farming ecosystems. Lastly, unusual mortalities (in 1995), lack of growth (1998) and problems with quality (infestation by the worm Polydora) could be pointed out and quantified. Moreover, unusual results could be observed, which might not be explained only by annual variations or geographical specificities. This gives to REMORA network the role of watchdog and the possibility of giving advice for collective oyster management.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates collected at seven different streams displaying different pollution levels were used to investigate species abundance patterns in polluted streams. Community response to disturbances in streams was analysed using species abundance distribution (SAD) for benthic macroinvertebrates across different levels of pollution. The slopes of rank abundance were characteristically steeper with decreasing species richness at the polluted sample sites, while the slopes were less steep with higher species richness at the clean or slightly disturbed sample sites. The SADs were broadly fitted to the log normal distribution in benthic macroinvertebrate communities across different levels of pollution. A geometric series was partly accepted for the communities at the severely polluted sites where new species could not be readily introduced. A power law was applied to the SADs, and the parameters reflected the states pertaining to the sample sites. The SADs were also efficient ill revealing ecological state of communities where physico-chemical indicators could not be easily differentiated for stressful conditions in streams.

AB  - Elemental (CHN) and proximate biochemical compositions of body tissues are useful tools among the ecological indices most commonly used in evaluation of the energetic status of animal populations. Gnaiger and Bitterlich (1984) supplied procedures for the interconversion between both these measurements based on stoichiometric relationships, that were further tested using gut contents and body tissue samples of freshwater fishes. Despite a lack of validation studies, the reported conversion factors have been broadly applied in the field of body composition analysis of marine invertebrates, especially bivalve mollusks. The aim of this study was to test the applicability of those conversion equivalents in analysis of the body tissues of two congeneric clam species (Ruditapes decussatus and Ruditapes philippinarum). To this end, proximate biochemical composition, as analyzed by fractionated extraction of tissues samples and quantification using spectrophotometric methods, was converted to elemental composition, and the resulting figures were compared with those of direct CHN analysis. The results of this comparison indicate good agreement within the ranges reported, provided that ninhydrin positive substances (NPS) are incorporated in the biochemical composition analyses. The magnitude of the nonprotein N component in bivalve tissues appears to complicate the reverse computation of biochemical components from elemental composition because no accurate estimation of proteins from N contents might be possible. Additionally, a specific correction of residual water in dried samples of bivalve tissues for CHN analysis should be applied. The absence of broad differences found between species reflects the morphological, evolutionary and functional proximity between them, whereas tissue differences display the differential role that each organ plays in the organism, although other sources of variability such as diet and sex should be addressed in future research.

AB  - Accurate predictions on the bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are critical for hazard and ecosystem health assessments. Aquatic systems are influenced by multiple stressors including climate change and species invasions and it is important to be able to predict variability in POP concentrations in changing environments. Current steady state bioaccumulation models simplify POP bioaccumulation dynamics, assuming that pollutant uptake and elimination processes become balanced over an organisms lifespan. These models do not consider the complexity of dynamic variables such as temperature and growth rates which are known to have the potential to regulate bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms. We contrast a steady state (SS) bioaccumulation model with a dynamic nonsteady state (NSS) model and a no elimination (NE) model. We demonstrate that both the NSS and the NE models are superior at predicting both average concentrations as well as variation in POPs among individuals. This comparison demonstrates that temporal drivers, such as environmental fluctuations in temperature, growth dynamics, and modified food-web structure strongly determine contaminant concentrations and variability in a changing environment. These results support the recommendation of the future development of more dynamic, nonsteady state bioaccumulation models to predict hazard and risk assessments in the Anthropocene.

AB  - The Mejillones Peninsula upwelling system (northern Chile) appears to be a natural laboratory, suitable to test hypotheses concerning variability of copepod growth in nature, In this zone, in January 2000, we collected zooplankton samples inside and outside of an upwelling plume to assess differential responses of copepodid Calanus chilensis to spatial distribution of temperature, chlorophyll a (chl a), current field and dissolved oxygen (DO). We studied variability of prosome length (PL), dry weight (DW), oil sac volume (OSV), ovary development (GI) and a condition index (CI) of females, and PL and OSV of Copepodid Stage C5. The sea temperature ranged between 14 and 20degreesC in the upper 10 m, whereas chl a varied between 3 and 14 mg m(-3). We distinguished 2 zones according to temperature and the current field: a cold retention area coinciding with the upwelling plume, and a warmer highly advective zone, outside the plume. Abundance of most copepodids was associated with cold and chl a-rich waters, and positively correlated to current speeds. DW and Cl of females and PL of Stage C5 were negatively correlated to temperature, but not to chl a. Within the cold retention zone, copepodids were more abundant, females and C5 copepodids were larger and heavier, and females had more developed ovaries, but there were no differences in lipid content or CI. We concluded that resulting circulation may act as an efficient mechanism to maintain copepodids within the chl a-rich upwelling center, but this also implies spatial heterogeneity in temperature and food, giving rise to variability in growth and development of copepods, which is then reflected in different-sized individuals in the late stages of development.

AB  - This paper introduces several concepts which underlie the development of a spatially and temporally explicit forest ecosystem design model, forest simulation optimization system (FSOS). These concepts include: (1) two common landscape indicators - patch size and age class distributions - to quantify non-timber resource objectives; (2) dynamic cut block and patch building; (3) the integration of short- and long-term planning; and (4) target-oriented, adaptive forest ecosystem planning. FSOS uses a simulated annealing algorithm and a resource weighting approach to schedule harvest units to achieve a desired forest ecosystem state. We tested FSOS successfully on the data set from an 80 000 ha Tree Farm Licence in southwestern, British Columbia, Canada. Results of this analysis demonstrate the ability of FSOS to gradually change the landscape based on a desired future condition and differing resource priority schemes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Mycobacterial infections are widely distributed in animals and cause considerable economic losses, especially in livestock animals. Bovine paratuberculosis and bovine tuberculosis, which are representative mycobacterial infections in cattle, are difficult to diagnose using current-generation diagnostics due to their relatively long incubation periods. Thus, alternative diagnostic tools are needed for the detection of mycobacterial infections in cattle. A biomarker is an indicator present in biological fluids that reflects the biological state of an individual during the progression of a specific disease. Therefore, biomarkers are considered a potential diagnostic tool for various diseases. Recently, the number of studies investigating biomarkers as tools for diagnosing mycobacterial infections has increased. In human medicine, many diagnostic biomarkers have been developed and applied in clinical practice. In veterinary medicine, however, many such developments are still in the early stages. In this review, we summarize the current progress in biomarker research related to the development of diagnostic biomarkers for mycobacterial infections in cattle.

TI  - Regarding the choice of composite indicators of ecological safety of water in the basin of the Siversky Donets
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY

KW  - ecological safety of surface waters
KW  - composite water quality indicator
KW  - complex water quality index
AB  - The lack of effective mechanisms of the methods of basin management, control of and responsibility for the ecological state of surface sources of drinking water leads to the fact that the main man-made objects that determine the ecological state of surface water sources are most often located in one oblast, while the production and consumption of the drinking water from those sources occur in the territory of other oblasts, which complicates the effective management of environmental safety of surface water sources. This is especially true for the regions of Ukraine which are poor in surface water resources, located in the basin of the Siversky Donets River, the water bodies of which are the main sources of water supply in the eastern regions of the country. The main consumer of water is Donetsk Oblast (over 50% of the annual volume), and Kharkiv and Luhansk Oblasts together consume approximately the same volume of water per year (up to 50% of the annual volume). Therefore, it is important to substantiate the integrated indicators of the ecological status of the water body to improve the environmental safety of surface water sources. The paper shows that oxygen indicators play an important role in the ecology of a water body. They are associated with the assimilative ability of water, the ability of water to decompose organic matter. Therefore, the content of dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen consumption in water is of great interest not only in terms of life development, but also as a composite measure of the ecological status of the aquatic environment. The relationship between the value of the combined index of water pollution and the value of biochemical oxygen consumption makes the indicator of biochemical oxygen consumption important for the integrated assessment of water contamination with various organic substances. For the tasks for which we justify the choice of composite measures of the ecological condition of surface waters, it is more important to identify the effects of contamination not directly at the site of contamination, but at some distance from it and after some time. Therefore, the use of the amount of dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen consumption as indicators that characterize the oxidation of pollutants present in water is the most appropriate for the tasks of timely monitoring of water bodies. Therefore, as a composite indicator for characterizing the condition of the watercourse and conducting timely monitoring, we chose oxygen indicators.

AB  - 1. Diel vertical migrations (DVM) are frequently observed in pelagic fish and zooplankton populations. In addition to predator avoidance and foraging opportunity, bioenergetics optimisation has been hypothesised to cause the selective advantage of migrating fish. However, experimental confirmation of growth advantages of fish held at naturally observed cyclic temperatures, and food densities are surprisingly rare.
   2. We compared growth rates, growth efficiencies and energy budgets of vendace (Coregonus albula, Salmoniformes) fed daily rations of 10% body mass and held at low (4.5 degrees C), high (8 degrees C) and cyclic (switch between 4.5 and 8 degrees C) temperatures over a period of 6 weeks. Biochemical body composition was evaluated by bioimpedance analyses and direct determination of water, lipid and protein content in a subset of fish.
   3. Growth rate and food conversion efficiency were similar in fish held at high and cyclic temperatures, but higher than those found at low temperatures. Body condition of fish at cyclic temperatures was maximised, but these fish also had the highest water content. The proportion of lipids and proteins was slightly depleted in fish held at cyclic and low temperatures relative to the high temperature treatment. Accordingly, growth and biochemical composition of fish responded specifically to cyclic temperatures and were not simply intermediate between those found at low and high temperatures.
   4. We could not confirm a bioenergetics advantage of fish switching between high and low temperatures. However, there were no substantial extra metabolic costs through exposure to cyclic temperatures, and hence, fish performing DVM may benefit from predation avoidance without compromising their metabolic balance and hence growth rates. These results suggest that the evolution of DVM is a multi-faceted process with no single ultimate explanation.

AB  - The repeat swimming ability and oxygen uptake (Mo-2) of adult sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum), were assessed at ambient water temperatures at three field locations along their migration route. Following these measurements, internal and external fish condition was evaluated according to United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines. Here we report on the physiological characteristics of fish having either moderate or severe levels of disease and injury. Routine oxygen uptake (Mo-2) did not differ between healthy fish and those with indices of ill health. In contrast, fish classified as sick, which included conditions of damaged internal organs, an Ichthyophonus spp. heart infection, a Saprolegnia spp. gill infection, and skin wounds, had a lower post-exercise Mo-2 and were unable to repeat their critical swim speed (U-crit) on the second swim test. Moderate levels of disease or injury did not significantly affect either U-crit or post-exercise Mo-2. We conclude that the ability of adult salmon to recover quickly from exercise may be a useful indicator of sublethal pathologies.

AB  - Septicaemia due to hypervirulent (HV) Klebsiella pneumoniae is the leading cause of neonatal pup mortality in endangered New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) at Enderby Island, in the New Zealand sub-Antarctic. Accounting for approximately 60% of annual pup mortality at this site following an epizootic event in 2001-02, HV K. pneumoniae is also emerging worldwide as a significant community-acquired human pathogen. To facilitate efficient direct mitigation to reduce pup mortality, a case-control study and prospective cohort study were conducted to identify risk factors amenable to active management. Additionally, to investigate impacts of hookworm (Uncinaria spp.), a nested treatment trial with the anthelmintic ivermectin was undertaken concurrently. During two austral summer field seasons (2016-2018), 698 pups were captured for treatment trial recruitment and the collection of morphometric measurements, biological samples and risk factor data. Gastrointestinal carriage of the virulent phenotype of K. pneumoniae was a consistent risk factor, while ivermectin treatment and higher body condition index consistently reduced risk of HV K. pneumoniae mortality. Significantly fewer ivermectin-treated pups were found dead (24.1% control, 11.1% treatment), with a trend towards a higher proportion of HV K. pneumoniae deaths amongst the control group. This study provides evidence to support ivermectin treatment as a pup mortality mitigation strategy in New Zealand sea lions at Enderby Island. If applied to larger colonies where HV K. pneumoniae and hookworm impact pup survival, this intervention could have population-scale benefits for this endangered species. Further work is required to understand how ivermectin prevents HV K. pneumoniae septicaemia, but removal of hookworms before intestinal mucosal damage occurs could limit systemic spread of virulent bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - The depositional environment and tectonic setting of the newly identified Ri-Qing-Wei Basin are the focus of controversy. In order to solve these questions, the geochemical characteristics of siltstones from Laiyang Group in Taolin area are analysed in detail. The siltstones present similar contents of SiO2 and Al2O3 compared with upper continental crust (UCC) and post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) and are classified as wacke on chemical classification plot of clastic rocks. The trace elements are characterized by the depletion of transition elements (Sc, V, Cr, Ni, and Cu). The chondrite-normalized REE patterns exhibit the enrichment of LREE and depletion of HREE, as well as significant negative Eu anomalies. Relative high Index of Compositional Variability (ICV) values suggest the siltstones are compositionally immature and the sediments of first-cycle. The low Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) values of the samples indicate the weak source weathering condition. Moreover, the characteristics of A-CN-K plot suggest K-metasomatism occurred after burial. A series of palaeo-environment indexes imply that the Laiyang Group were deposited in a reducing marine environment with hot and arid climate. Major- and trace-based tectonic setting discriminant diagrams all indicate that the Ri-Qing-Wei Basin was formed in an active continental margin setting; this conclusion is also supported by the analysis of the coeval igneous rocks. Based on the investigations of the subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific plate and the development of Cretaceous basins on the eastern Eurasia, we propose that Ri-Qing-Wei Basin was formed in response to the delamination of the North China Craton and the subduction of Izanagi plate.

AB  - Chlorophyll a is the most commonly used indicator of phytoplankton biomass in the marine environment. It is relatively simple and cost effective to measure when compared to phytoplankton abundance and is thus routinely included in many surveys. Here we collate 173, 333 records of chlorophyll a collected since 1965 from Australian waters gathered from researchers on regular coastal monitoring surveys and ocean voyages into a single repository. This dataset includes the chlorophyll a values as measured from samples analysed using spectrophotometry, fluorometry and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The Australian Chlorophyll a database is freely available through the Australian Ocean Data Network portal (https://portal.aodn.org.au/). These data can be used in isolation as an index of phytoplankton biomass or in combination with other data to provide insight into water quality, ecosystem state, and relationships with other trophic levels such as zooplankton or fish.

AB  - Coastal aquaculture installations concentrate large numbers of wild fish species of both ecological and economic importance, including schools of bogue, Boops boops (L.), in high abundance and biomass. The aggregated species consume large quantities of the easily available pellets lost from cages. As a consequence, the physical condition of farm-associated wild fish is increased and their physiology is altered. These changes may influence local fisheries as many of these aggregating species are targeted by fishers. We assess whether local fishers catch wild fish that have previously aggregated at fish farms by comparing the body condition, trophic indexes, diet overlap and the fatty acid (FA) composition of B. boops obtained from local fish markets and around fish farms. Bogue captured by trammel-nets and around fish farms facilities presented a similar biological condition, as well as high quantities of pellets in the gut, and their FA profile was affected by vegetal-derived FAs. In contrast, bogue captured by trawlers were not influenced by fish farms, as they consumed natural trophic resources. We conclude that artisanal fishers exploit these aggregated fish populations once they have dispersed away from farms, and benefit from a 'biomass export' from fish farms at a local scale.

AB  - Benthic invertebrate community composition was surveyed across the salinity gradient of the Pensacola Bay Estuary in Florida during summer 2016. Macrofauna densities ranged from 1000 to 9300 individuals m(-2), with highest densities occurring at the upper estuary and the lowest in the mid- and lower estuary. Taxonomic richness and Shannon diversity were lowest in the upper estuary and increased along the salinity gradient. Small-bodied, near-surface infaunal polychaete species (e.g., Mediomastus ambiseta and Paraprionospio alata) dominated the macrofaunal community in fine sediment areas. We calculated the Gulf of Mexico Benthic Index of Biological Integrity for each site and compared the index scores with those from Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program - Estuaries, an earlier benthic assessment model. Condition evaluations by the different models did not match across all sites in this study; however, scores consistently indicated that most sites were at or near degraded levels, implying that Pensacola Bay represents a marginal habitat for a "healthy" benthic macrofauna community. This study provided new information about the benthic communities and sediments in the Pensacola Bay estuary. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2020;16:245-256. Published 2019.

AB  - The total concentrations of 16 United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA)-listed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in coastal and estuarine sediments along the northern shores of the Bohai and Yellow Seas, China, at any study location varied from 0.236 to 8.34 nM g(-1) dry weight (dw). For a given PAH, concentrations varied by one to two orders of magnitude. Ecological risk assessments based on biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) indicated that the potential ecological hazard of PAHs in the sediments was limited. The average total sediment PAH concentrations were less than the effects range low, indicating that PAHs currently present in the sediments were not harmful to aquatic organisms. The estimated PAH concentration in the aquatic organisms was 0.223 nM g(-1) and posed a limited threat to human health via biological concentration from sediment to harvest of the sea. Assuming no additional PAH inputs, 99% of the 16 PAH molecules currently present in the sediments would be degraded in 40 years.

AB  - Climatic conditions may impact on the body condition of animals and thereby affect their survival prospects. However, climate may also impact directly on the survival prospects of animals by affecting the size of immune defence organs that are used for defence against parasites. We used a large long-term database on body condition and size of the spleen in birds to test for immediate and delayed relationships between climatic conditions as indexed by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and body condition and spleen mass, respectively. Across 14 species of birds, spleen mass was significantly positively correlated with the NAO index, while the delayed effect of NAO on spleen mass was not significant. Spleen mass was positively related to body condition, but body condition did not depend significantly on NAO or delayed NAO effects. Bird species with a strong positive effect of NAO on spleen mass tended to have small spleens for their body size, while species with a strong negative effect of NAO on spleen mass tended to have relatively large spleens. Since bird species with relatively large spleen have been shown to suffer more from the negative effects of parasites, we can infer that the effects of climate as indexed by NAO on the size of the spleen depends on the importance of parasite-mediated natural selection.

AB  - The paper presents the results of studies on the effect of wastes of the Cherepovets iron-and-steel works containing phenol, naphthaline and oil products on fish parasites of the Sheksna part of the Rybinsk water reservoir (the Volga river system). It has been shown that the number of highly sensitive ectoparasites of Abramis brama (Protozoa, Dactylogyrus monogeneans, Ergasilus sieboldi crustaceans and Caspiobdella fadejewi leeches) considerably decreases in the zone of pollution. It has been first suggested to use Diplozoon paradoxum and Caryophyllaeus laticeps, parasites of bream highly resistant to toxic effect, the number of which considerably increases in the zone of pollution, as indicators of anthropogenic pollution and ecological state of a water body. Among diplozoons there have been first discovered individuals having structural anomalies (reduction of the attachment organs, violation in the symmetry of arrangement and number of valves) that serves as evidence or mutagenic effect of toxic substances of polluted waters on morphogenesis of the parasite.

AB  - Water quality modelling is an effective tool to investigate, describe and predict the ecological state of an aquatic ecosystem. Various environmental variables may simultaneously affect water quality. Appropriate selection of a limited number of key-variables facilitates cost-effective management of water resources. This paper aims to determine (and analyse the effect of) the major environmental variables predicting ecological water quality through the application of fuzzy models. In this study, a fuzzy logic methodology, previously applied to predict species distributions, was extended to model environmental effects on a whole community. In a second step, the developed models were applied in a more general water management context to support decision and policy making. A hill-climbing optimisation algorithm was applied to relate ecological water quality and environmental variables to the community indicator. The optimal model was selected based on the predictive performance (Cohen's Kappa), ecological relevance and model's interpretability. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was performed as an extra element to analyse and evaluate the optimal model. The optimal model included the variables land use, chlorophyll and flow velocity. The variable selection method and sensitivity analysis indicated that land use influences ecological water quality the most and that it affects the effect of other variables on water quality to a high extent. The model outcome can support spatial planning related to land use in river basins and policy making related to flows and water quality standards. Fuzzy models are transparent to a wide range of users and therefore may stimulate communication between modellers, river managers, policy makers and stakeholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The development of ice-and-snow tourism (IST) has great potential for poverty alleviation and is of great significance for promoting the sustainable development of alpine areas. However, little attention has been given to evaluating the suitability and potential of ice-and-snow tourism in poverty-stricken areas. Taking 832 poverty-stricken counties in China as samples, this study proposed an integrity suitability index (ISI) based on natural and socioeconomic factors to evaluate the suitability and potential of developing ice-and-snow tourism in povertystricken counties. The results showed that there are significant differences between the spatial distributions of the suitability of glacier- and skirelated tourism. The former is mainly distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, while the latter is distributed in low-altitude mountainous areas. Additionally, 36.0% of the total number of poverty-stricken counties have the potential to match medium-to high-level ISIs of ice-and-snow tourism, of which 2.5%, 32.9% and 0.2% are suitable for glacier excursions, ski sports and both, respectively. Furthermore, climate change and environmental protection are the main constraints on the development of ice-and-snow tourism and corresponding development strategies are proposed. This study can provide references for scientific planning and policy making regarding the sustainable development in povertystricken areas.

AB  - Legislative norms developed at the end of the 1970s, structural changes in the economy, and the implementation of filters in both vehicles and industries improved the air quality of North Rhine-Westphalia, the largest western state in Germany in terms of population and economic output. Because these changes occurred unevenly across the state, the main aim of the given study is to analyse the historical development of air pollutants in the various environments (e.g., industrial, traffic or rural background) within the state.
   NO, NO2 and O-3 concentrations observed at six stations (one industrial, two traffic, one urban and two rural background) from 1981 to 2007 have been obtained from the Environmental State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection (LANUV NRW). These data have been evaluated to investigate time trends of these pollutants and the impact of weekly cycles on ozone formation in NOx-limited areas (rural background) and VOC-limited areas (urban areas with traffic network). The relationships between ozone production mechanisms and ozone precursors (NO, NO2 and their ratio) have also been taken into account.
   In contrast to the sharp decrease in NO concentrations (65%), only a moderate, insignificant decrease in NO2 (10%) was observed because catalytic filters in vehicles support emissions of NO2 as a primary pollutant. Changes in NO/NO2 ratio and higher temperature favoured an increase in ozone concentrations (20%), which appears to be the indicator of summer smog. The results showed that, although ozone forming potential is higher at background stations due to higher biogenic VOC and lower NO emissions, time trends were steeper at the industrial stations because of radical changes in NOx concentrations.
   Examination of the weekly and diurnal cycles of NO and NO2 showed that not only the absolute average values of the pollution levels decreased (with a turning point in 1998) but also the shape of the diurnal cycle (differences between primary and secondary peaks) changed in response to developed legislative norms (Bayerisches Landesamt fur Umweltschutz, 2011).

AB  - Pressures on the environment resulting from corporate activities cause impacts that will occur over different time scale into the future and also have been occurring for different amounts of time in the past. The development of fair and equitable corporate sustainability reporting (CSR) initiatives requires that these temporal aspects be properly taken into account. In order to relate indicators of environmental pressure to indicators of environmental state changes. time scales specific to that pressure should be used. We review the different ways in which temporal aspects have been dealt with in CSR and other schemes and show that there is often no consistent and rigorous treatment of time. We discuss several obstacles that may have impeded the appropriate treatment of time in CSR so far and suggest that these issues must be resolved as CSR becomes more widely adopted.

AB  - Floodplain habitats are a functionally very important part of the landscape in large alluvial rivers. Yet, methods for their ecological assessment are poorly known. In the current article, we present the evaluation of the ecological development of the middle section of the Danube (between rkm 1804 and rkm 1841) as related to the Gabcikovo water works, which had a significant impact on the hydromorphology of the Danube in Slovakia. At our seven sites (two in the main channel, two in the parapotamal side arms and three in the plesiopotamal side arms), we evaluated the ecological state by calculating the floodplain index (FI) based on benthic Oligochaeta, Polychaeta, Isopoda, Amphipoda and Mysidacea over a long-term period (1990 - 1997). Change-point analysis was used to evaluate the development of the FI, which closely reflected discharge related changes. We identified three main patterns: 1) The major changes were associated with a shift of the FI values by one or more habitat zones, especially after damming in 1993: Considerable water level decline caused the increase of the FI values by one habitat zone at the Istragov parapotamal site and in the eupotamal Danube lower stretch (which shifted even to the plesiopotamal zone after 1996). On the contrary, a shift from the original parapotamal to eupotamal zone indicated the decreased FI values in the Bodicka brana after this arm became free-flowing in 1996. 2) The minor changes accompanied only a slight water level decline in the Danube upper stretch, maintaining the FI values in the original eupotamal zone. Similarly, the fluctuating FI values form parapotamal to plesiopotamal in the Kralovska luka site, reflecting the alternating presence/absence of a water connection with the adjacent anabranch system, did not show any obvious trend. 3) No changes were found at the Sporna sihot, where hydromorphological conditions remained relatively stable during the whole monitored period. The FI thus proved to be highly effective for the indication of spatial and temporal changes in hydrological connectivity, based on the selected taxa groups. Our results suggest that the FI can be used as an important tool to assess the ecological state of the floodplain systems of large alluvial rivers.

AB  - Indicators of growth and condition were used to compare the habitat quality of nurseries of juvenile sole (Solea solea L.) in the Bay of Biscay, based on one survey in 2000. The four biological indicators are poorly correlated with each other, suggesting that no single measure may give an adequate description of fish health and of its habitat's quality. Growth indicators showed significant differences between northern and southern areas. Juveniles from the two southernmost nurseries, the Gironde estuary and the Pertuis Antioche, displayed significant lower otolith increment widths and mean sizes. These differences were inversely related to water temperature and unrelated to genetic or age differences, and are unlikely to be due to limiting trophic conditions in the nurseries. Hence, they may be considered in terms of differences in habitat quality and potential anthropogenic impacts. Condition indices do not show this north-south pattern but highlight low condition values in the Pertuis Antioche. Shortterm and fluctuating biochemical indicators such as RNA/DNA ratios appeared to be unreliable over a long-term study, while morphometric indices seemed to be relevant, complementary indicators as they integrate the whole juvenile life-history of sole in the nurseries. The growth and condition indices of juveniles in September 2000 from nursery grounds exposed to the Erika oil spill in December 1999 were relatively high. These results lead us to suggest that there was no obvious impact of this event on the health of juvenile sole and on the quality of the exposed nursery grounds a few months after the event.

AB  - A primary goal for Chesapeake Bay watershed restoration is to improve stream health and function in 10% of stream miles by 2025. Predictive spatial modeling of stream conditions, when accurate, is one method to fill gaps in monitoring coverage and estimate baseline conditions for restoration goals. Predictive modeling can also monitor progress as additional data become available. We developed a random forests model to predict biological condition of small streams (<200 km(2) in drainage) in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Biological condition was measured with the Chesapeake Bay Basin-wide Index of Biotic Integrity (Chessie BIBI), a stream macroinvertebrate index. Our goal was to predict biological condition in all unsurveyed small streams present in a 1:24,000 scale catchment layer as a 2004-2008 baseline. We reclassified the 5-category Chessie BIBI ratings into two categories, poor and fair/good, to align with management goals of the Chesapeake Bay Program. The model included 12 geospatial predictor variables including measures on spatial location, bioregion, land cover, soil, precipitation, and number of dams in local catchments. We trained the model with a random 75% subset of Chessie BIBI data (n = 1449), and used the remaining 25% of Chessie BIBI data (n = 484) as test data. The model performed well, correctly predicting 72% of samples in training data and 73% of samples in test data, but model accuracy varied among bioregions. We performed uncertainty analyses by adding bands of either +/- 0.05 or +/- 0.10 BIBI units to the cutoff between poor and fair/good. These uncertainty analyses resulted in 14.5% (+/- 0.05 band) and 24.8% (+/- 0.10 band) of samples in test data being classified as in uncertain condition. For 95,877 small stream reaches in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the model predicted 64% in fair/good condition, the +/- 0.05 uncertainty analyses predicted 57% in fair/good condition, and the +/- 0.10 uncertainty analysis predicted 50% in fair/good condition. These reported values have different implications for the number of improved stream miles required to meet the goal of improving 10%. Incorporating uncertainty provides an assessment of model strength as well as confidence in predictions. We, therefore, suggest increased reporting of uncertainty in studies that spatially predict stream conditions.

AB  - The deep-water rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris is a demersal decapod crustacean that is commercially exploited by trawl fleets. The present work compares its Population dynamics, biology and condition in two locations (southern and north-western Mallorca in the Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean, separated by a distance of 120 kill) with different environmental conditions and explores the relationships between the species and certain environmental factors. Six multidisciplinary bimonthly Surveys were carried Out during 2003 and 2004 in these two locations (between 150 and 750 m depth) in order to collect data on the demersal species with bottom trawl, the hydrography (temperature and salinity) with CTD casts, and trophic resources (zooplankton in the water column and suprabenthos with Bongo net and Macer-GIROQ sledge respectively) and sediments with a Shipeck dredge. The trawl fleets front both locations were monitored by monthly on board sampling and daily landings obtained front sales bills. Additional data was obtained from other trawl Surveys. Temporal differences were detected both annually, with a decreasing trend over the last years in species abundance, and seasonally, in the biological indexes analysed. Bathymetric differences were also found in abundance, mean length, sex-ratio and condition of females. There were clear differences between the two locations studied, with higher abundance, condition and mean length and a lower length at first maturity for females in the north-western location. Trophic conditions could act as a link between geo-physical and biological changes. These short spatio-temporal differences could be due to the higher productivity found at this location, with higher density of preferred prey for the studied species together with adequate sea-floor topography, sediment composition and hydrographical characteristics.

AB  - In the management of forest ecosystems, spatial information about the extent, condition and pressures are essential. In the current study, we present a framework for a remote sensing-based forest ecological base map covering Norway. Combining remotely sensed imagery from optical satellite systems such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat provides information about forest ecosystem extent and change over time. Utilizing a national dataset of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data allowed predicting a range of attributes describing forest condition, including naturalness. In total, seven definitions of naturalness were evaluated. Pressures on the forest ecosystems were mapped using a change detection algorithm and satellite data from 1986 to 2020. Change detection is the cornerstone in monitoring and for understanding the pressures on the ecosystems. The predicted forest extent had an overall accuracy of 85 to 89% using Sentinel-2 imagery from 2020 and 71 to 81% using Landsat imagery from 1986. For the forest condition attributes, the explained portion of the variances were >70% for biomass, height and volume and from 21% to 64% for number of stems, crown coverage and a diversity index. Naturalness was classified with accuracies of 77 to 98%, except for age-based definitions. Nevertheless, a large number of false positives were present. Change detection was evaluated in terms of final harvest and was identified with an overall accuracy of 84-92%. The land cover change classification had an overall accuracy of 70-92%. The detailed maps of forest condition and forest pressures were aggregated to a local level using model-based inference, providing estimates of mean values and uncertainty at a scale suitable for ecosystem indicator development. The collection of map layers describing forest extent, condition and pressures form a forest ecological base map important for environmental management.

AB  - Background: During gait, the braking index represents postural control, and consequently, the risk of falls. Previous studies based their determination of the braking index during the first step on kinetic methods using force platforms, which are highly variable. This study aimed to investigate whether determining the braking index with a kinematic method, through 3D motion capture, provides more precise results. Methods: Fifty participants (20 to 40 years) performed ten trials in natural and fast gait conditions. Their braking index was estimated from their first step simultaneously using a force platform and VICON motion capture system. The reliability of each braking index acquisition method was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients, standard error measurements, and the minimal detectable change. Results: Both kinetic and kinematic methods allowed good to excellent reliability and similar minimum detectable changes (10%). Conclusion: Estimating the braking index through a kinetic or a kinematic method was highly reliable.

AB  - Land-use/land-cover change in Central Asia has led to ecological disasters such as draining of the Aral Sea, salinization, desertification that ultimately affect the ecosystem's health. However, only a few studies have systematically assessed the spatial-temporal characteristics of ecosystem health in Central Asia using an integrated ecosystem assessment method. Therefore, this study aims to assess the ecosystem health of Central Asia using multi-source high-resolution data as the indicator and the integrated ecosystem vigor-ecosystem organization-ecosystem elasticity (V-O-E) model. The result showed that most of the areas in Central Asia are in a weak state of ecosystem vigor, ecosystem organization, ecosystem elasticity, and ecosystem health. The fragile state of the ecosystem health was highly due to the decreasing density of forest land, farmland, waterbody, and the increasing density of bare land and artificial land. The area of farmland gradually decreased, from 878639.08 km(2) in 2000 to 719128.08 km(2) in 2010 and 584251.36 km(2) in 2017. The forest of Central Asia has been declining continuously from 161998.69 km(2) in 2000 to 115343.96 km(2) in 2010 to 81185.10 km(2) in 2017 and has become spatially heterogeneous. Interestingly, the area of forest land in Xinjiang increased from 18216.14 km(2) in 2000 to 20970.92 km(2) in 2010 and 23098.12 km(2) in 2017, although there was a decrease in the overall forest land in other countries of Central Asia; this shows that China's afforestation and reforestation policies during the last two decades had notable contributions to the ecosystem vigor and ecosystem elasticity in Xinjiang, which led to the increase in ecosystem health in Xinjiang. Hence, it is urgent to initiate integrated water management measures, limit the population growth and take adequate measures to enhance the techniques of farmland development to enhance the ecosystem health of Central Asia.

AB  - Total of 40 ostracod taxa obtained from 141 different sampling locations in Bolu were examined to determine relationships between habitat preferences of species and their ecological characteristics from June to August 2006. According to the first axis of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), 52% of the relationships between species and five most influential environmental variables with 36.2% of variances were explained. Although the first four variables, air temperature, water temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity had significant influence (P < 0.05) on species composition, the effect of dissolved oxygen (P = 0.47) was relatively low. Spearman correlation analyses indicated that some species had weak to strong positive correlation with electrical conductivity, whereas some others had a significant negative correlation with pH and redox potential. Only two species (Herpetocypris chevreuxi and Ilyocypris inermis) had strong correlation to the habitat type (P < 0.05). Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustered species into four groups based on their occurrences. Species with cosmopolitan characteristics displayed higher tolerances to environmental variables than noncosmopolitans or rare species. Indeed, four cosmopolitan species (Heterocypris incongruens, I. bradyi, Candona neglecta, and C. candida) had high Environmental Tolerance Index (ETI) values for at least six different environmental variables. Thus, cosmopolitans are highly adaptable within a wide range of environmental conditions and geographical distribution.

AB  - The Anishinabek/Ontario Fisheries Resource Centre collaborated with the First Nation communities along the North Channel of Lake Huron - Aundeck-Omni-Kaning, Mississauga, Sagamok Anishnawbek, Serpent River and Wikwemikong Unceded - on a 5-year lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) index netting project. The impetus for this undertaking was concern that adequate information was not available for the derivation of the commercial catch quotas by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. Traditional First Nation fishing waters were sampled from 2000 to 2004 using the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources index netting methodology. A total of 2,760 lake whitefish were caught in 468 net sets, representing up to 17 year classes. The catch-per-unit-effort, as well as the number of year classes represented in the catch, was greater in Aundeck-Omni-Kaning than in the other four areas in the North Channel. The size and age at which 50% of lake whitefish are mature, ranged from 350 mm to 520 mm and 3 to 5 years, respectively. The data gathered from this study augmented the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources biological catch data and was used in their statistical catch-at-age models for the derivation of lake whitefish commercial catch quotas in the North Channel.

AB  - Mexico is the southernmost country in North America, and extends into Central America, south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The northern half of Mexico is located on the Temperate belt and is arid in character (Nearctic), while the rest is within the Tropical belt (Neotropical). Climate varies from extremely temperate desert in the north, to tropical humid in the south. Mexico has more than 500 freshwater fish species, about 271 of them country endemics, and approximately 48 endemics from binational basins. There are still some 30-40 fish species not yet described. There are 563 fish species colonizing coastal flood plain species. In addition to the numbers of colonizing fishes, the burden of introduced exotics has also been growing. In 1904, only 4 species were recognized as exotics; by 1997 the number had increased to 94, and by 2008 to 115. The main fish collections in Mexico are at IPN, UNAM, and UANL and are the most representative, being national in scope, although concentrated in the tropics, central region, and general in coverage, respectively. The decline of the native fish fauna has been in focus in recent years, usually as trend-in-time comparisons, where the loss of native forms and increase of exotics and/or colonizer species is evident in many basins, mainly in Rio Balsas, Rio Grande, and Rio Lerma-Santiago. As a result, the numbers of species reported at some degree of risk have been increasing also, from 17 in 1963 to 192 in 2005. The trends in colonizers, exotics, and species at risk among Mexican fishes are parallel. The Index of Biological Integrity (IBI), in either its geographical, or historical form (IBIh), has been applied to the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo basin, USA and Mexico. IBIh values go between 0-91 (average 31). Alien species are regarded as detrimental. Overall, the IBI trends have been similar in all regions, starting from 70-95% in upper reaches, decreasing to less than 0-35% in the lower reaches of West central basins, and then down to 15% or less near the Lower Rio Grande delta. Several alien species of plecos have been recognized in the rivers Balsas, Grijalva-Rio Usumacinta complex, and, also, one in the Rio Grande. Mexican rivers are notoriously dewatered in the northern half of the country. Until 1962, the Rio Grande had an average runoff of 12,000+ millions of cubic meters/year; however by 2002 it was less than 2% of that value. The river went nearly dry along the Big Bend region and was dry for months in the delta region, both in 2002 and 2004. The Rio Grande is mostly dry north of the Rio Conchos junction, its main Mexican tributary, and other tributaries provide now between 1% (Rio San Juan) and 20% (Rio Conchos) of pre-1960 runoff. A modified Index of Biological Integrity for Rio Grande resulted in grades from 70 to 95% of the baseline in upper reaches, less than 35% in lower reaches, to less than 15% near the coast. The Texan version of the IBI was not representative as it suppresses data on euryhaline fishes. The reports of total toxics were masked, since the sum should have included both organics and heavy metals exceeding USA regulations to the total count, but only one of the two was included.

AB  - 1. Stream habitat quality assessment complements biological assessment by providing a mechanism for ruling out habitat degradation as a potential stressor and provides reference targets for the physical aspects of stream restoration projects. This study analysed five approaches for predicting habitat conditions based on discriminant function, linear regressions, ordination and nearest neighbour analyses.
   2. Quantitative physical and chemical habitat and riparian conditions in minimally-impacted streams in New Hampshire were estimated using United States Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program protocols. Catchment-scale descriptors were used to predict segment-scale stream channel and riparian habitat, and the accuracy and precision of the different modelling approaches were compared.
   3. A new assessment index comparing and summarizing the degree of correspondence between predicted and observed habitat based on Euclidean distance between the standardized habitat factors is described. Higher index scores (i.e. greater Euclidean distance) would suggest a greater deviation in habitat between observed conditions and expected reference conditions. As in most biotic indices, the range in index scores in reference sites would constitute a situation equivalent to reference conditions. This new index avoids the erroneous prediction of multiple, mutually exclusive habitat conditions that have confounded previous habitat assessment approaches.
   4. Separate linear regression models for each habitat descriptor yielded the most accurate and precise prediction of reference conditions, with a coefficient of variation (CV) between predictions and observations for all reference sites of 0.269. However, for a unified implementation in regions where a classification-based approach has already been taken for biological assessment, a discriminant analysis approach, that predicted membership in biotic communities and compared the mean habitat features in the biotic communities with the observed habitat features, was similar in prediction accuracy and precision (CV = 0.293).
   5. The best model had an error of 27% of the mean index value for the reference sites, indicating substantial room for improvement. Additional catchment characteristics not readily available for this analysis, such as average rainfall or winter snow-pack, surficial geological characteristics or past land-use history, may improve the precision of the predicted habitat features in the reference streams. Land-use history in New Hampshire and regional environmental impacts have greatly impacted stream habitat conditions even in streams considered minimally-impacted today; thus as regional environmental impacts change and riparian forests mature, reference habitat conditions should be re-evaluated.

AB  - Background Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus (CN) and Oreochromis niloticus (ON) health status were investigated in Asejire Reservoir (AR) and Lagos Lagoon (LL), South-west Nigeria. Fish samples collected were separated into sexes. Growth pattern {length (cm); weight (g), Isometric index, condition factor (K)} were measured. Heavy metals (lead (Pb), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and chromium (Cr) in ppm concentrations were determined in Lagos Lagoon and Asejire reservoir. Results Fish samples ranged at one male to one or two females. No significant difference in length and weight of O. niloticus between locations. Significant difference in weight occurred in C. nigrodigitatus between locations; highest condition factor was recorded in Asejire Reservoir O. niloticus, (ARON); lowest condition factor was observed in Asejire Reservoir C. nigrodigitatus (ARCN) as this indicated a negative allometric value, normal in Bagridae species. Male species possessed higher condition (K)-factor than female species within locations, between locations, between species, and within species, female C. nigrodigitatus having higher condition factor than male ARCN. Highest isometric value occurred in ARON and lowest in Lagos Lagoon C. nigrodigitatus (LLCN). Male ARON had highest isometric value, and O. niloticus species had higher isometric value (b <= 3) and positive allometric (b > 3); and C. nigrodigitatus has negative allometric (b < 3). Heavy metals Zn had highest value, while Cr ranked lowest value for ARON. Lagos Lagoon O. niloticus (LLON) Zn had highest value while Pb had lowest value. LLCN heavy metals determined revealed Zn had highest value, while Cr had lowest value; and ARCN heavy metals determined revealed Zn had highest value, and Cr had lowest. In all, Zinc (Zn) was top-ranked. Conclusion Results indicate niche response and performance as species specific; while environmental influence and stressors, food availability and reproduction factors contribute to well-being of fish. The heavy metals influence on the fish species is of public concern to man to avoid food poisoning.

AB  - Variability in mesoscale nearshore oceanographic conditions plays an important role in the distribution of primary production and food availability for intertidal consumers. Advection of nutrient rich waters by upwelling usually allows the proliferation of diatoms, later replaced by dinoflagellates. We examined upwelling effects on the fatty acid (FA) signature of a benthic intertidal filter feeder to identify its response to pulsed variability in food availability. The study took place in two contrasting seasons and at two upwelling and two non-upwelling sites interspersed within the southern Benguela upwelling system of South Africa. We investigated the FA composition of the adductor muscles and gonads of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis to assess how FA are apportioned to the different tissues and whether this changes between upwelling and non-upwelling conditions. In situ temperature loggers used to identify upwelling conditions at the four sites indicated that such events occurred only at the upwelling centres and only in summer. Tissues differed strongly, with gonads presenting a higher proportion of essential FAs. This could reflect the faster turnover rate of gonad tissue or preferential retention of specific FA for reproductive purposes. FA composition did not vary as a direct function of upwelling, but there were strong dissimilarities among sites. Upwelling influenced mussel diets at one upwelling site while at the other, the expected signature of upwelling was displaced downstream of the core of upwelling. Condition Index (CI) and Gonad Index (GI) differed among sites and were not influenced by upwelling, with GI being comparable among sites. In addition, FA proportions were consistent among sites, indicating similar food quality and quantity over time and under upwelling and non-upwelling conditions. This suggests that the influence of upwelling on the west coast of South Africa is pervasive and diffuse, rather than discrete; while nearshore retention or advection of upwelled water is critical and site-specific so that the effects of upwelling differ even among sites categorised as upwelling centres.

AB  - The AZTI's marine biotic index (AMBI), an ecological indicator for managing estuarine and coastal waters worldwide, was tested in two fjords in Chilean Patagonia. The Aysen Fjord (42 degrees Lat. S) supports intensive salmon farming in coastal ecosystems, while the Baker Fjord (48 degrees Lat. S) is currently just beyond the limit of the southern expansion of salmon concessions. The ecological status of the Aysen Fjord was classified as good, while the status of the Baker Fjord was classified as high and unbalanced. These differences were consistent with our expectations, illustrating the effect of local environmental conditions and human activities, combined with river inputs into semi-confined fjords. This method is appropriate for the evaluation of the ecological status of the fjords, but requires a sufficient amount of data for the robust environmental assessment as proposed by the Water Framework Directive (WFD).

AB  - Grasslands are important for their ecological values and for agricultural activities such as livestock production worldwide. Efficient grassland management is vital to these values and activities, and remote sensing technologies are increasingly being used to characterize the spatiotemporal variation of grasslands to support those management practices. For this study, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery was used as an input to develop an open-source and automated monitoring system (Sen2Grass) to gain field-specific grassland information on the national and regional level for any given time range as of January 2016. This system was implemented in a cloud-computing platform (StellaSpark Nexus) designed to process large geospatial data streams from a variety of sources and was tested for a number of parcels from the Haus Riswick experimental farm in Germany. Despite outliers due to fluctuating weather conditions, vegetation index time series suggested four distinct growing cycles per growing season. Established relationships between vegetation indices and grassland yield showed poor to moderate positive trends, implying that vegetation indices could be a potential predictor for grassland biomass and chlorophyll content. However, the inclusion of larger and additional datasets such as Sentinel-1 imagery could be beneficial to developing more robust prediction models and for automatic detection of mowing events for grasslands.

AB  - Contaminant effects on defence responses of ecologically and economically important organisms, such as the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, are likely to influence their ability to resist infectious diseases, particularly at the young stages. The aim of this study was to explore the potential relationships between organic contaminants accumulated in the soft tissues of juvenile oysters, defence responses and physiological condition. Oysters were transplanted during summer and winter periods in different sites in the Marennes-Oleron Bay, the first area of oyster production in France, and in the Gironde Estuary, the biggest estuary in Occidental Europe. Amongst the battery of biochemical and physiological biomarkers applied in the present work [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondyaldehyde (MDA), catecholase, laccase and lysozyme in gills, digestive glands, mantle and haemolymph, glycogen, proteins and lipids in the digestive gland and the condition index at the whole-organism level], MDA and lysozyme in the digestive gland and SOD, GPx and laccase in plasma contributed in order to significantly discriminate the sites in which oysters bioaccumulated different levels of heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HPAHs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polybromodiphenylethers (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and lindane. These results strengthen the hypothesis that it is possible to differentiate sites depending on their contamination levels and biological effects by carrying out studies with transplanted juvenile oysters. In addition, correlations were found between antioxidant and immune-defence responses, and PAH and DDT body burdens in the first area of oyster production in France (the Marennes-Oleron Bay) and where considerable oyster mortalities have been reported. This result suggests that the presence of organic chemical contaminants in the Marennes-Oleron Bay may influence defence responses in juveniles of C. gigas, and, therefore, could influence their ability to resist infectious diseases.

AB  - The long-arm mullet, Valamugil cunnesius (Val.) harbours an infection in their gonads, by the dracunculid nematode, Philometra cephalus Ramachandran. Though P cephalus was reported from Mugil cephalus way back in 1975 and the parasite was reported to cause serious harm to the gonads of its host, so far no attempt has been made to study its nature of infection. This paper reports the results of the study on the host-parasite relation of P cephalus. P cephalus is highly host-specific and it infects both testis and ovary of V cunnesius. The prevalence of infection was 41.7%; it was much higher in females (48.3%) than in males (28.2%). Prevalence registered an increasing trend with length of fish and advancing gonad maturity. Though hepato-somatic index, gonado-somatic index and condition factor were adversely affected by the infection, the greatest impact of the infection was on the fecundity, which was significantly lowered, by nearly four times, in the infected fish (mean fecundity = 13.8 x 10(3)) compared to the uninfected fish (mean fecundity = 52.1 x 10(3)). The high prevalence of the infection in females and the significant reduction in fecundity together could have serious adverse effects on the host population.

AB  - A shrub savannah landscape in Niger was optically characterized utilizing blue, green, red and near-infrared wavelengths. Selected vegetation indices were evaluated for their performance and sensitivity to describe the complex Sahelian soil/vegetation canopies. Bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) of plants and soils were measured at several view angles, and used as input to various vegetation indices. Both soil and vegetation targets had strong anisotropic reflectance properties, rendering all vegetation index (VI) responses to be a direct function of sun and view geometry. Soil background influences were shown to alter the response of most vegetation indices. N-space greenness had the smallest dynamic range in VI response, but the n-space brightness index provided additional useful information. The global environmental monitoring index (GEMI) showed a large VI dynamic range for bare soils, which was undesirable for a vegetation index. The view angle response of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), atmosphere resistant vegetation index (ARVI) and soil atmosphere resistant vegetation index (SARVI) were asymmetric about nadir for multiple view angles, and were, except for the SARVI, altered seriously by soil moisture and/or soil brightness effects. The soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was least affected by surface soil moisture and was symmetric about nadir for grass vegetation covers. Overall the SAVI, SARVI and the n-space vegetation index performed best under all adverse conditions and were recommended to monitor

AB  - This work proposes a methodology based on classical thermodynamics, which allows the variation in ecosystem composition to be interpreted within the framework of the exergy concept. The basic equation of exergy [Mejer, H., Jorgensen, S.E., 1979. Exergy and ecological buffer capacity. State-of-the-art in Ecological Modelling 7, 829-846] was decomposed into three terms - size (C), structural information (1) and concentration (X) - and their significance as indicators of ecosystem state was evaluated by simulating different scenarios of development in a simplified freshwater ecosystem. In order to calculate the exergy terms, the most critical issue in using exergy in an ecological context, i.e. the estimate of reference equilibrium values for organic matter and organisms, had to be faced. With this aim, the equations of classical thermodynamics in solution were applied, and "virtual" values of concentration at equilibrium were calculated for a number of organic compounds (VEC) and freshwater organisms (VECE). The results of the simulation showed that, whereas exergy and the exergy terms inherently connected with the abiotic component varied consistently with the incorporation of biomass into the ecosystem, the structural information of the biotic component followed different, even opposite, pathways of variation, which were dependent only on the change in the size spectrum of the community. Due to the strict dependence of the VECE values on organism size, the increase of structural information with increasing abundance of large and complex species is also consistent with the general pattern of succession delineated by the classical r-K model. Structural information is therefore proposed as an indicator of the development state, as well as an ecological orientor, whose maximisation is expected during ecosystem development. However, since an increase in structural information is not necessarily accompanied by an increase in exergy, a sort of "antagonism" between these two related orientors emerges, whose resolution may contribute to shed light on the fundamental forces which drive ecosystem development.

AB  - Pollutants in soils and other environmental matrices can directly pose significant human health risks through various exposure pathways, especially for local population. The concentration and distribution of heavy metals (Pb, Ni, Cd, Cr, Fe and Zn) and the gamma ray emitting (U-238, Th-232, and K-40) radionuclides in bituminous soils were analyzed using well calibrated atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) and gamma-ray spectrometry using NaI(TI) detector. The average concentration of Pb, Ni, Cd, Cr, Fe and Zn were 28.2, 24.1, 5.16, 42.5, 170 and 226 mg kg(-1) respectively. The average activity concentration of U-238, Th-232, and K-40 were 42.6 +/- 6.50, 113 +/- 10.5 and 461 +/- 24.3 Bq kg(-1) respectively. These values were above the world average value, although only six samples were higher than the world average value. The average activity concentrations, radium equivalent and dose rate of measured radionuclides were compared with other literature values and country's maximum allowable limit for heavy metals. The geo-accumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor, pollution loading index (PI), enrichment factor, and potential ecological risk index (PERI) were calculated to assess the heavy metals pollution level in soils. The total hazard index (THI) and carcinogenic risk (CR) were used to assess human health risk of heavy metals. The pollution level using the four pollution assessment model were in the order Pb > Cd > Ni > Cr > Fe > Zn. The estimated carcinogenic risk (CR) for children and adults obtained were all higher than the safe limit (1 x 10(-6)) while the non-carcinogenic risk (THI) was below the safe limit (THI (<) 1). Pollution sources were identified using multivariate statistical analysis. It was found that Cr contributed > 97% to the overall cancer risk (CR) for children and adults. The pollution sources were identified using multivariate statistical analysis. Therefore, the federal and state ministry of environment, health and solid minerals must rise to the urgent need of remediating the bituminous soil which may pose great health risk to human population in the study area.

AB  - This study was carried out in agricultural soils in La Laguna, Coahuila - Durango, Mexico (annual precipitation 80-250 mm). The structure of soil fungal genera of three field soil was studied. In soil of Tierra Blanca, an orchard pecan of 51 years, there were isolated 23 genera of soil fungi, and only 12 genera of other two field soils (El Chupon, a pecan orchard of 14 years, and San Jorge, culturing with alfalfa). For each genus of soil fungi there were calculated the Importance Value Index (I V I). The genus Fusarium showed the greater I V I of the three field soils (71-98). The diversity (Shannon's index) of genera of fungi was different from each soil according to confidence intervals (95%), with values of 1.89, 1.72 y 1.19 for Tierra Blanca, El Chupon and San Jorge, respectively. Additional ecological indexes were calculated, as Simpson, maxim richness (H' max), regularity (F). The values of Index Simpson and F were similar between Tierra Blanca and San Jorge, but only H' max was similar between El Chupon and San Jorge. The similarity index of Shoresen was equal for Tierra Blanca vs. El Chupon, or Tierra Blanca vs. San Jorge (51.4), whereas El Chupon vs. San Jorge was 58.3. The index B for the genera of fungi in Tierra Blanca vs. El Chupon or Tierra Blanca vs. San Jorge was 0.48, but San Jorge vs. El Chupon was 0.83. The genera of soil fungi found in La Laguna are 67-75% similar to soil fungi isolated from desert, such as the Israel desert, but in soils of La Laguna the structure of genera fungal is different; here Fusarium is the most abundant, and appear new genera such as Trichoderma. The changes of soil mycobiota could be the result of the effect of agricultural activity during the last 50 years.

AB  - The international winter wheat improvement program (IWWIP), an alliance between Turkey-CIMMYT-ICARDA, has distributed improved germplasm to different National Agricultural Research Systems (NARS) partners through international nurseries and yield trials for the last 25 years. This study was carried out in order to determine the rate of breeding progress for yield and yield related traits at IWWIP using data of the international winter wheat yield trials (IWWYT), IWWYT 1-13, collected from 1997 to 2010 in irrigated environments across different countries. The relative grain yield of the best line expressed as percent of the best check (Kinaci-97), widely grown cultivar (Bezostaya) and trial mean (TM) increased at a rate of 0.6, 1.6 and 0.2 %/year, each non-significant (P > 0.05), respectively. Regression analysis indicated that TM has increased at a rate of 91.9 kg/ha/year (P = 0.007). The net realized breeding progress was estimated by accounting the variability due to management and weather conditions using surrogate variables such as integrated biological indices taken as means of common checks. The net realized gain for the BL was 66.2 +/- A 19.7 kg/ha/year (P = 0.01). Success rate of the BL, per cent of sites where the BL exceeds the local check in grain yield, ranged from 50 to 87 % across trials. To date, more than 55 varieties of IWWIP origin have been released in 10 countries of Central and West Asia including Afghanistan, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Some varieties, such as Solh and Kinaci-97, have been released under different names in different countries indicating their broad adaptation. Cluster analysis of IWWYT sites indicated that IWWIP sites in Turkey and Syria are associated with most of the testing sites in Central and West Asia and North Africa (CWANA) region. The recently identified high yielding genotypes are recommended for direct release and/or parental purposes by the respective NARS.

AB  - Background Climate change and human activities continue to drive a widespread decline in global mangrove coverage, undermining their capacity to provide ecosystem benefits. While global and local scale drivers of change on mangroves are widely acknowledged, the relative importance and the exposure of mangroves to climatic, geomorphological, and direct human threats vary spatially. Understanding the role and relative importance of the multiscale and multiple threats to mangroves and how these vary spatially is fundamental for formulating a spatially adaptive approach to their management and conservation. Aim Our study investigated the role of multiple threats on mangroves and the relative exposure. Location Western Indian Ocean (WIO) region. Time period Recent past (2002-2019 and future (2050-2060). Major taxa studied Mangrove. Methods Using satellite-derived indicators of mangrove condition aggregated over 19 years (2002 to 2019) and 14 proxies of climate, human activity, and geomorphology, we applied machine learning methods to determine the role and relative importance of the change drivers. Using outputs from this deductive statistical process, we applied inductive methods to map mangrove exposure spatially. Results Model results highlight the importance of catchment erosion, human pressure, sea level, and macroclimate as the main drivers of the present-day ecological condition of mangroves in the WIO. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was more sensitive to the identified drivers than the vegetation condition index (VCI), with the relative importance of variables varying across the two vegetation indicators. Main conclusions In anticipation of a stronger manifestation of climate change impacts, the resilience of mangroves in the WIO could be improved through adaptive management over time and space. Testing the efficacy of the essential biodiversity variables (EBV) is critical for understanding the mechanisms of ecosystem change and managing biodiversity change.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between fish assemblage and habitat in streams dominated by an agricultural landscape. Fishes from 20 natural and 20 channelized streams were sampled using electrofishing gear in east central Indiana. Streams that had been channelized had a lower quality fish assemblage when compared to natural streams as measured by the Indiana V Eastern Corn Belt Plain Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). Stream habitat was evaluated using the Ohio EPA Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI), which indicated that channelized streams had lower quality primarily due to a loss of heterogeneous habitat. Pearson correlation analysis relating IBI and QHEI was positive and significant and demonstrated that a reduction in riffle and pool areas associated with channelization was the most significant factor influencing the fish assemblage. Furthermore, species lost when streams were channelized were predictable and often represented environmentally sensitive species. The results of this study suggested that stream channelization has a negative influence on the fish assemblage which should be recognized before any stream development.

AB  - Control of long-established invasive species to aid threatened native species presents major logistic and economic challenges. Invasive common carp (Cyprinus carpio) recently accounted for over 90% of the fish biomass in Utah Lake (Utah, USA), driving many undesired changes to ecosystem structure. Carp control efforts have removed >12,000 tons of carp from the system over 10 yr. However, the impact of recent removal efforts on carp population structure and dynamics remains unclear. We develop an integrated age-structured population model incorporating carp harvest data with independent standardized monitoring data to evaluate population-level consequences of the removal effort and evaluate future removal scenarios. Specifically, we estimate the age structure, biomass, and population dynamics of carp in Utah Lake and simulate carp population responses to potential future management strategies. The model estimates carp population biomass has decreased to approximately 27.6% of pre-removal biomass and 23.4% of the greatest estimated biomass. However, carp removal gear is highly selective of older, larger individuals, and current removal efforts have had little impact on young age-classes. Evidence of recent strong juvenile cohorts of carp suggests a compensatory response to removal efforts that may increase total biomass as these age-classes mature. Simulations of carp population response to potential alternative harvest approaches demonstrate that the current gear is unlikely to maintain carp biomass below target thresholds even at substantially increased levels of effort due to gear selectivity, compensatory recruitment, and periodic large recruitment events resulting from lake level increases. A hypothetical gear selecting for juvenile carp is predicted to have a meaningful chance of maintaining low carp biomass, particularly if effort is at least tripled over current levels. These simulations illustrate the value of analytically exploring multiple management approaches when conducting adaptive management. Even when historically used methods have been successful at approaching management objectives, their suitability may change as ecosystem state changes. Periodic re-assessment of ecosystem state and willingness to explore potential alternative approaches is critical to the long-term success of any management program as socio-ecological systems and knowledge change.

AB  - The reproductive cycle and the energy content of soft parts of Tawera gayi were studied monthly from August 2001 to July 2002 in Ushuaia Bay, Beagle Channel. The degree of sexual maturity was determined histologically. The sex ratio was significantly different of 1:1 (896 females, 796 males, chi(2)-test, P < 0.05). First sexual maturity occurred at 12 mm shell height in both sexes. In males the reproductive cycle was determined analyzing the monthly percentage of gonadal stages. High percentages (85%-100%) were mature (ripe stage) during a large part of the year (March to September) and in October the 100% of individuals were partially spawned with recovery. An image analyzer was used to determine quantitatively female reproductive cycle. The percentage of gonadal area covered by oocytes was lower in December. The mean number of mature oocytes (diameter > 40 mu m) by gonadal area and the mean diameter of oocytes reached the lower values during October, November, and December, indicating a spawning peak. This more intensive spawning activity coincides with the phytoplankton bloom in spring. The energy content of soft parts was measured using a microbomb calorimeter in monthly samples during a year. The mean energy content in both sexes was significantly different reaching 20.95 kJ/g AFDW for females and 21.39 kJ/g AFDW for males. The relative condition index attained the lower values in August, September, and October. The monthly values of the energy content did not show significant differences in both sexes. Results of this study indicate that notwithstanding T. gayi lives in a markedly seasonal environment as Subantarctic waters of Beagle Channel shows a protracted gamete production with a principal spawning episode and small pulses of evacuation during the rest of the year.

AB  - Many species experience prolonged periods of fasting due to changes in habitat and food availability. Metrics that quantify energy reserves available during these periods allow for a better understanding of the interaction between environmental change and species survival. Body condition of polar bears has been assessed using morphometric and subjective indices, lipid content of adipose tissue, body composition models and, recently, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). We assessed the utility of BIA and examined correlations among condition metrics for 134 free-ranging polar bears on shore in western Hudson Bay in fall 2012-2013 and spring 2013-2014. We also examined long-term inter-annual and seasonal trends from 736 bears handled in 2004-2014. Total body fat, as estimated from BIA, was correlated with adipose tissue lipid content, energy density and fatness index, but not storage energy or skull width. Body condition was higher in adult and subadult females than males, consistent with energetic demands of gestation and lactation. Adult females had higher body fat in the fall than spring, and body fat decreased with increasing number of dependent offspring. Long-term trends indicated a decline in body condition for all adult and subadult males and females. Although there were similar patterns among BIA and other established metrics, its limitations in the field suggest that BIA may not be the most efficient method of monitoring body composition in polar bears in comparison to other modeled metrics, such as energy density. Declines in polar bear body condition over time may be a reflection of contemporaneous changes in sea ice availability and population demography, and thus have implications for the long-term conservation of this subpopulation.

AB  - The main objective was to study the seasonal variation of mercury concentrations in different tissues (muscle, hepatopancreas and gills) of Carcintis maenas from low and high Hg contaminated areas, a valuable resource in temperate estuaries and a possible pathway for human uptake. Individuals of two size classes (around 35 and 55 mm cephalothorax wide) were captured monthly between March 1999 and May 2000 in two areas of Ria de Aveiro: in the main navigation channel that connects the lagoon to the sea, and in the inner lagoon area heavily contaminated by mercury (maximum Hg in sediments of 5.4 mu g g(-1)). Pronounced decreases in salinity and temperature and reduced food availability in winter seemed to be the responsible for the decline of the crab condition index (0.75-0.45) in larger individuals. Muscle and hepatopancreas exhibited higher mercury concentrations than gills, with concentrations in the contaminated site ranging from 0.03 to 0.63 mu g g(-1) and 0.02 to 0.34 mu g g(-1), respectively. Linear regressions between muscle and hepatopancreas (r = 0.94, p < 0.001) and muscle and gills (r = 0.97, p < 0.001) suggested a rapid redistribution of mercury inside the organism. During winter, a rapid elimination of mercury was found in the three analysed tissues followed by uptake. Larger crabs presented elimination rates from 18 to 34 ng g(-1) per week, while the smaller crabs showed lower elimination rates (10-24 ng g(-1) per week). The uptake was similar in both size classes (11-15 ng g(-1) and 8.1-15 ng g(-1) per week, respectively for large and small crabs). Our results suggest that C. maenas harvested in the contaminated areas must be considered with caution, since Hg concentrations were found to exceed the threshold concentration allowed for human consumption (0.5 mu g g(-1)).

AB  - Mussel seed Mytilus galloprovincialis (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) from two origins (rocky shore and collector ropes) was cultivated on a raft in the Ria de Arousa (north-west Spain), from seeding to thinning out, for 226 d (November 1995-July 1996) and two aspects of metabolism, oxygen consumption rate (VO2) and ammonia excretion rate (VNH4-N) were studied in situ.
   The model derived from multiple analysis of oxygen consumption accounted for 91.9% of the variance, based on dry weight of the mussels and the environmental factors quality of food (organic content) and mainly chlorophyll-a. Seed origin also showed significant influence. The seasonal pattern of the oxygen consumption can be attributed mainly to the variation of chlorophyll-a, which showed a higher range of values in the spring months.
   Origin of seed did not show a homogeneous effect on oxygen consumption throughout the cultivation period. Collector rope mussels showed higher oxygen consumption values at the beginning of the cultivation period and after the first 15 d, but the rocky shore mussels showed a higher oxygen consumption between days 22 and 110. Energy-conserving patterns and lower condition index at the onset of the experiment for rocky shore mussels could explain these initial differences.
   Multiple analysis on the variation of ammonia excretion rate provided a model that accounted for 72.6% of the variance based on dry weight of mussels, seed origin and the environmental parameters chlorophyll-a and total particulate matter. The rocky shore mussels showed a significantly higher excretion values for most of the cultivation period, although there was no constant tendency throughout. High excretion values were recorded between January and March, whilst for the rest of the cultivation period values were low.
   The O:N index was higher in collector rope mussels for most of the cultivation period, which may suggest a more favourable energy metabolism and/or a more appropriate nutritional state for these specimens.

AB  - The effects of climate change on agricultural ecosystems are increasing, and droughts affect many regions. Drought has substantial ecological, social, and economic consequences for the sustainability of agricultural land. Many regions of the northern hemisphere have not experienced a high frequency of meteorological droughts in the past. For understanding the implications of climate change on grassland, analysis of the long-term climate data provides key information relevant for improved grassland management strategies. Using weather data and grassland production data from a long-term permanent grassland site, our aims were (i) to detect the most important drought periods that affected the region and (ii) to assess whether climate changes and variability significantly affected forage production in the last decade. For this purpose, long-term daily weather data (1961-2019) and the standardized precipitation index (SPI), De Martonne index (I-DM), water deficit (WD), dryness index (DI), yield anomaly index (YAI), and annual yield loss index (YL) were used to provide a scientific estimation. The results show that, despite a positive trend in DI and a negative trend in WD and precipitation, the time-series trends of precipitation, WD, and DI indices for 1961-2019 were not significant. Extreme dry conditions were also identified with SPI values less than -2. The measured annual forage yield (2007-2018) harvested in a four-cut silage system (with and without organic N-fertilization) showed a strong correlation with WD (R = 0.64; p < 0. 05). The main yield losses were indicated for the years 2008 and 2018. The results of this study could provide a perspective for drought monitoring, as well as drought warning, in grassland in northwest Europe.

AB  - We investigate control of plasmonic-photonic coupling in flat metallic nanoantenna arrays. We demonstrate that when the nanoantennas are packed together along their short axis (transverse lattice constant) and the incident light polarization is along their long axis, they can support lattice-induced plasmonic resonance coupled to a super-photonic mode that densely fills the superstrate volume. Our results show that at a certain wavelength, this resonance joins the plasmonic tip modes of the nanoantennas, forming meta-dipole modes. These modes have field profiles similar to those of the natural plasmonic dipole modes of individual nanoantennas, but they occur at much shorter wavelengths and offer a very high bulk refractive index sensitivity (925612 nm/RIU). We show that with an increase in the transverse lattice constant, such a sensitivity decreases as the metadipole modes disappear. Under this condition, the refractive index sensitivity supported by natural modes of the nanoantennas increases, as the plasmonic edge mode suppression caused by charge rearrangement decreases.

AB  - In recent years, phytoplankton phenology has been proposed as an indicator to monitor systematically the state of the pelagic ecosystem and to detect changes triggered by perturbation of the environmental conditions. Here we describe the phenology of phytoplankton growth for the world ocean using remote-sensing ocean colour data, and analyse its variability between 1998 and 2007. Generally, the tropics and subtropics present long growing period (approximate to 15-20 weeks) of low amplitude (<0.5 mg Chl m(-3)), whereas the high-latitudes show short growing period (<10 weeks) of high amplitude (up to 7 mg Chl m(-3)). Statistical analyses suggest a close coupling between the development of the growing period and the seasonal increase in insolation in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean. In the tropics and subtropics, variability in light is low, and the growing period is controlled by nutrient supply occurring when mixing increases. Large interannual variability in the duration of the growing period is observed over the decade 1998-2007, with positive anomalies following the major 1997-1998 El Nino-La Nina events, and generally negative anomalies from 2003 to 2007. Warmer Sea-Surface Temperature (SST) over the duration of the growing period is associated with longer duration at high-latitudes indicating an extension of the growing period over summer months. The opposite is observed in the tropics and subtropics, where the duration is shorter when the SST is warmer, indicating increased stratification. Positive phases of North Atlantic Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode and negative phases of Multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation index (El Nino conditions), associated with enhanced water mixing and nutrients supply, generally sustain longer growth. On the basis of the results, perspectives are drawn on the utility of phenology as an organising principle for the analysis of pelagic ecosystem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work is devoted to studying the dynamics of changes in phytotoxicity of oil-contaminated meadow soils in the process of microbial bioremediation. The research was conducted under laboratory and field conditions. Winter rye (Secale cereale) was selected as the test object. In order to assess the degree of toxicity in the laboratory, the indicators of seed germination - germination rate and germination energy-were determined. In a field experiment, the ecological state of oil-contaminated soils was evaluated by the germination rate and the amount of aboveground plant biomass. The research results showed that the content of petroleum products significantly affected the percentage of germination of rye seeds. There are differences in the size of seedlings for different experimental schemes: in all tests, the average height of cleoptila on polluted soil was less than on unpolluted soil, but at the same time it varied for different experimental bioremediation schemes. The use of potassium humate and modified vermiculite as additives significantly reduced the toxicity of the oil-contaminated soil.

AB  - Infestation of fish by the crustacean ectoparasite Lernaea cyprinacea Linnaeus, 1758 was investigated to establish the extent of infestation, potential effects of the parasite and its ecological adaptations. Fish samples were collected from impoundments in the Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve in the southeastern lowveld of Zimbabwe and these included the cichlids Oreochromis mossambicus, Oreochromis placidus and Tilapia rendalli, the cyprinids Labeo altivelis and Barbus paludinosus, the clariid Clarias gariepinus, the centrarchid Micropterus salmoides and the characid Hydrocynus vittatus. All the cichlids and one cyprinid (L. altivelis) were infested with L. cyprinacea. The two Oreochromis species exhibited prevalence as high as = 100% and mean intensity up to 149 parasites per fish. Lernaea cyprinacea exhibited an aggregated distribution in host populations and were attached mostly to the ventral and caudal regions of hosts, while the head was the least preferred attachment site. With a few exceptions, there was no significant correlation between parasite prevalence and intensity with host size, sex, condition factor, gonadosomatic index or fecundity.

AB  - Invasive species are threatening biodiversity and ecosystem stability globally. The introduction of the California kingsnake (Lampropeltis californiae) on Gran Canaria, Canary Islands. Spain represents an emerging invasion that is already threatening endemic island species. Dead neonatal mice treated with 80-mg acetaminophen tablets are approved as a registered pesticide for control of invasive brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis) in Guam and could potentially be used as an oral toxicant to control invasive California kingsnake populations. We sought to evaluate oral toxicity of acetaminophen and to determine the dosage necessary for lethal control of invasive California kingsnake populations. Dead mice inserted with a known acetaminophen dose (0 mg, 40 mg. 60 mg, and 80 mg) were fed to California kingsnakes from Gran Canaria. Each dose was tested in 20 male and 20 female snakes representing the size range found in Gran Canaria. After snakes ate their dead mouse, they were monitored for mortality, regurgitation, and time of death and regurgitation. Treatments of 60 mg and 80 mg had 100% mortality, while 40 mg had 87.5% mortality. No control snakes died. Time to death occurred on average 38.6 hours after consuming the dead mouse. The top two time to death models accounted for 97% of model weights and included variables dosage (mg/kg). sex, and dosage * sex or those terms plus body condition index. Out of the 116 snakes that died, 97 regurgitated the mouse that contained the acetaminophen capsule, and time to regurgitation was highly correlated with time to death. Acetaminophen is a highly effective oral toxicant for California kingsnakes. Dead mouse baits treated with acetaminophen have potential as a control method on Gran Canaria but should not solely be expected to protect native species or eradicate California kingsnakes on Gran Canaria. Future efforts should focus on preventing California kingsnakes from invading other Canary Islands.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos and dimethoate are overused agricultural pesticides that can trigger trophic cascades, resulting in toxicity to both terrestrial and aquatic organisms as well as altered ecosystems. In previous studies, substantial attention has been given to the effects of pesticides on vertebrate species and, to a lesser extent, species of zooplankton. The present study was designed to show that the fission time effective concentration in ciliates is a potential aquatic detection index for environmental monitoring. The ciliate Urostyla grandis was treated with doses of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate. After exposed to the pesticides, the LC50 (i.e., concentration that killed 50% of the ciliate cells within 24 h) values were 0.029 mg L-1 for chlorpyrifos and 0.0685 mg L-1 for dimethoate. The fission time effective concentrations after 168 h of exposure were 0.0075-0.0093 mg L-1 for chlorpyrifos and 0.2640-0.2750 mg L-1 for dimethoate. These results show that the fission time effective concentration is lower than the LC50 value in ciliates, indicating that fission time effective concentration is more suitable than the LC50 value for environmental monitoring using ciliates. The effects of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate on ciliate cell ultrastructures included agglutination of chromatin in the macronucleus, protruded and discontinuous macronuclear and micronuclear membranes, loss of integrity of mitochondrial membranes and contents, and abscission and deformation of the adoral zone of membranelles.

AB  - In order to evaluate the relationship between different traits of grain yield in durum wheat, 20 durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) landraces selected from the northwest of Iran together with five controls were evaluated under normal and drought stress conditions. Environmental mean squares were significant for all the traits studied except for harvest index which showed that drought stress has significant effect on all the traits. In normal condition, fertile tillers, peduncle length, spike length, number of grain spike and harvest index had the most positive direct effect on yield, while under drought stress condition, biological yield and harvest index had the most positive direct effect on yield. In regression analysis (stepwise method) in normal condition, infertile tillers and 1000 grain weight remained in the final model (R-2 = 0.485), while under stress condition, Fv/Fm, Fm and biological yield remained in the final model (R-2 = 0.667). Factor analysis of the total five factors was used to determine 76.708 and 77.128% of the data changes and adjustments in normal irrigated and drought stress conditions, respectively. The multiple statistical procedures used in this study showed that harvest index and biological yield were the most important yield variables to be considered under drought conditions. So, these traits could be used as selection criteria for increasing yield.

AB  - A comparative analysis of the fish condition (Fulton's K) of 10 cod stocks in the north Atlantic in relation to the temperature of their habitat, growth rates and their reproductive potential is presented. It is shown that the cod stocks in the north Atlantic display different levels of mean condition, which is partly due to the different temperature regimes of their habitats. Cod living in colder waters, e.g. Greenland, Labrador and Grand Bank stocks, were found to be in poorer condition than cod living in warmer waters, e.g. North Sea and Irish Sea stocks.
   Poor condition causes reduced productivity in terms of slow growth and low recruitment potential. Stocks in better condition display significantly higher weights at age 4 than stocks in poor condition. The a coefficients (function's slopes) obtained from standardised Ricker's recruitment-spawning stock biomass (SSB) relationships were defined as indicators for the recruitment potential of stocks. These a coefficients were found to be positively correlated with the mean condition factor of the 10 stocks analysed. This indicates that stocks consisting of individuals in poor condition appear to be very susceptible to reduced recruitment at low SSB, while the stocks that consist of fish in good condition seem to behave more robustly with a higher probability of good recruitment at low SSB. The positive effect of the cod condition on their reproductive potential generally implies that the stocks' in good condition in the temperate regions of the northeast and west Atlantic can sustain higher exploitation rates than stocks in poor condition in the colder regimes of the northwest Atlantic (Greenland, Labrador and Grand Bank). This is confirmed by the positive relationship established between the estimated biological management reference points F-med and the mean cod condition factors, as well as by the recent status of these stocks.

AB  - Few studies have investigated the use of aquaculture-produced foods by piscivorous birds. American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) were collected from four locations (two aquaculture, one riverine and one coastal) in the southeastern United States during winter and spring 1998-1999 to assess the contribution (biomass, frequency of occurrence) of aquaculture-produced foods and their effect on body condition. Pelican diets reflected opportunistic foraging across locations. Diet near catfish ponds consisted mostly of Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctalus). Diets along the Mississippi River had similarly high biomass of catfish, but otolith counts suggested lower use of catfish. Diets near crawfish (Procambarus spp.) ponds included shad (Dorsomis spp.), crawfish and sunfish (Lepomis spp.); whereas diets from coastal Louisiana were predominantly salt water fish. Pelican body condition, as indexed by percent ()mental fat, was similar between seasons but higher at catfish ponds. Foraging at crawfish ponds did not improve body condition over foraging in natural conditions. The superabundant, large and vulnerable food source (i.e. catfish in aquaculture ponds) likely resulted in reduced energy expenditures by pelicans, which would improve body condition. Higher fat reserves could facilitate spring migration and reproductive success. American White Pelican use of catfish at aquaculture facilities is predicted to continue and likely increase.

AB  - The objectives of this study were algal control and health assessments in a temperate eutrophic reservoir. Laboratory and mesocosm-scale in situ top-down biomanipulation experiments using planktivorous fishes and filter-feeding macroinvertebrates were conducted along with identification of the limiting nutrient using nutrient enrichment bioassays (NEBs), and ecosystem health evaluation based on the modified index of biological integrity model (Reservoir Ecosystem Health Assessment; REHA). Nutrients and N/P ratio analyses during 5 years revealed that the reservoir was in a eutrophic-hypertrophic state and that the key limiting nutrients, based on the NEBs, varied among seasons. Reservoir trophic guilds indicated declines in sensitive and endemic fish species and dominance of tolerant omnivores. Model values from multimetric REHAs averaged 25.8, indicating that the ecological health was in "fair to poor" condition. Overall microcosm biomanipulation tests suggested that macroinvertebrates, specifically Palaemon paucidens and Caridina denticulata, were effective candidates for phytoplankton control, compared to fishes. In situ mesocosm experiments revealed the highest removal rates with bluegreen algae and a phytoplankton size fraction of 2-19 mu m (R (e) > 90%, Mann-Whitney U = 64.5-74.0, p < 0.01), the dominant fractions in the reservoir. Our biomanipulation technique may provide a key tool for efficient management and restoration of eutrophied reservoirs.

KW  - TRAWL SURVEYS
AB  - Index-based assessments, in which research survey indices serve as the primary source of abundance information, are used for many commercially harvested stocks in the Northeast region. Such assessments generally provide advice only on trends in the relative size of the stock, lack a biological reference point or level, and lack a decision framework for drawing statistical inferences about the state of the resource. We present a stochastic simulation technique for inferring population status relative to an index-based reference point. We applied an integrated moving average model to trawl data on Atlantic wolffish, Anarhichas lupus, to derive fitted indices and propose using the lower quartile (25th percentile) of the fitted indices as a reference point. From bootstrapping techniques applied to model residual errors we empirically characterized the variance and shape of the parent distributions of both a fitted abundance index at any point in time and the lower quartile. Treating these distributions as jointly continuous random variates, we generated the cumulative density function for the condition Pr(index < lower quartile). Thus, for any value of the lower quartile, we can determine the probability that the fitted index at any point in time lies below that value of the biological reference point. An examination of the joint cumulative probability satisfying this condition is important because it allows us to ascertain quantitatively the likelihood of correctly deciding whether such a stock is below a prescribed threshold level.

AB  - Most studies of urban streams have relied on single variables to characterize the degree of urbanization, which may not reflect interactions among features of urban landscapes adequately. We report on an approach to the characterization of urbanization effects on streams that used principal components analysis and multiple regression to explore the combined, interactive effects of land use/land cover, human population demography, and stream habitat quality on an index of biological integrity (IBI) of fish communities. Applied to a substantially urbanized region in northeast OH, USA, the analysis demonstrated the interactive nature of urbanization effects. Urban land use and stream habitat quality were significant predictors of IBI, but were no better than and, in some cases, poorer predictors than other gradients and interactions among gradients. High integrity sites were characterized by low forest cover and high grassland cover at sub-catchment scale, but high forest cover within a 500 m radius local zone of the sample point, conditions often found in protected parklands in the region. The analysis also indicated that variability in stream habitat quality was unrelated to landscape or demographic features, a result we attribute to the interaction between the geological and urbanization histories of the region.

AB  - In the present paper we have examined the applicability of dimensionless and invariant numbers (DN & IN) to the analysis of the cardiovascular system of mammals, whose functions were Measured at standard metabolic conditions. The calculated IN did not change when we compared these figures with those obtained in dogs while they were Submitted to graded exercise on a treadmill. In both instances, rest and exercise, the constancy of the IN prevailed, in accordance with Cannon's principle of "homeostasis" (1929). On the contrary. when dogs were examined during a standardized hypovolemic shock, we observed a breakdown of the IN. and the resulting DN evolved as a reliable index of the condition of "heterostasis" as defined by H. Selye. The robustness of the homeostatic regulations is based on high-gain integral feedback mechanisms, while "heterostasis" could be associated with low-gain integral feedback processes, when organisms are Submitted to unitary step disturbances or to changes of the set-point at the entrance of the feedback loop.

AB  - Evaluation of potential culture sites represents a 'good practice' alternative to support the development of oyster industry at the northeast of Mexico. The relationship of growth, condition and survival of Crassostrea gigas with the environmental parameters was studied at the Navachiste-Macapule lagoon system (Sinaloa, Mexico) from November 2011 to November 2012. The culture was carried out using 2,520 small oysters (3.5 +/- 0.5 mm shell height) in a suspended long-line system. The environmental parameters and oyster biometrics were sampled each 15 days. The mean values were: temperature=25.01 +/- 5.29 degrees C, dissolved oxygen=6.10 +/- 1.93 mg L-1, salinity=33.5, pH=7.82 +/- 0.39 and depth=1.66 +/- 0.55 m. The concentrations of total suspended solids, particulate organic matter and chlorophyll a fluctuated from 41.94 to 125.22 mg L-1, 8.91 to 15.22 mg L-1, and 13.36 to 3.69 mg m(-3), respectively. After 13 culture months, the shell height reached 95.05 +/- 9.21 mm, length 85.64 +/- 20.01 mm, width 28.76 +/- 10.91 mm, and the total weight 83.58 +/- 17.18 g. The daily growth rate for the shell height and total weight were 0.25 mm day(-1) and 0.23 g day(-1), respectively. Significant differences were found for the total weight and the shell metric values throughout the culture. The final survival and mean condition index were 94.72% and 34.65 +/- 4.46, respectively. Water temperature exerted a positive stronger effect on shell height and total weight. Results show that C. gigas reached the commercial size (80 mm SH) after 8 months of culture under the environmental conditions of the Navachiste-Macapule lagoon system, Sinaloa, Mexico. Obtained data contribute with basic information on further studies and commercial production cycles of this species in the region.

AB  - The ablated aerosols of biological matrix sample were studied using 213 nm nanosecond laser ablation system. The stable signal intensity and high sensitivity were obtained when the laser energy was 25%, the spot size was 200 mu m, the scan rate was 20 mu m/s, the frequency was 20 Hz and the carrier gas was 700 mL He + 700 mL Ar. Relative fractionation index of 56 elements were investigated and 31P as the internal standard element was selected under the optimized laser ablation conditions. The results showed that particle size of the biological sample was 3 mu m, which was larger compared with NIST 610 sample. Element fractionation in biological sample was smaller than in glass sample, and relative fractionation index of most elements attained 1.0 +/- 0.1. Element fractionation mechanism of biological sample was discussed. The possible reason why the relative fractionation index in biological sample with large particle size did not significantly increase compared to the glass sample is that the 3 mu m particles entered into ICP can be atomized. On the other hand, enrichment effect for large ablation particles was relatively small. Further study of the influence factors of fractionation effect indicated that, the fractionation effect had relations with laser ablation energy, laser frequency and scan rate, negatively relation with the oxide boiling point, and positively relation with oxide bond energy and ionization energy.

AB  - Statistical, dynamical, and statistical-dynamical hybrid models have been developed in past decades for the seasonal prediction of North Atlantic hurricane numbers. These models' prediction skills show considerable decadal variability, with particularly poor performance in the past few years. Here, environmental factors that affect hurricane activities are reevaluated to develop a new statistical model for seasonal prediction by 1 June of each year. The predictors include the April-May multivariate ENSO index (MEI) conditioned upon the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) index, the
   [GRAPHICS]
   power of the average zonal pseudo-wind stress across the North Atlantic in May, and the average March-May tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature. When compared to the actual number of hurricanes each year from 1950 to 2013, this model has a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.91 with a correlation coefficient of 0.71. It shows a 39% improvement in RMSE over a no-skill metric (based on the 5-yr running mean of seasonal hurricane counts) for the period 2001-13. It also outperforms three statistical-dynamical hybrid models [CPC, Colorado State University (CSU), and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR)] by more than 25% for the same period. Furthermore, two approaches are developed to provide the uncertainty ranges around the predicted (deterministic) hurricane number per season that better encompass the range of uncertainty than does the standard method of adding/subtracting a standard deviation of the errors.

AB  - The surface salt marsh sediments from marine ecosystems in the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh was assessed for trace elements like iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), titanium (Ti), potassium (K), strontium (Sr), rubidium (Rb), zirconium (Zr), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and lead (Pb), their potential sources, and associated ecological risks. The range of trace elements in sediment (mg/kg) followed the decreasing order: Fe (25020-35176) > Ca (8679-16323) >Ti (2678-3340) > K (23680-16770) > Sr (138.32-209.64) > Rb (124-186.57) > Zr (96.21-161.35) > Zn (37.71-44.95) > Cu (36.51-51.66) > Pb (1.35-10.42). The concentrations of trace elements were under the average shale values of metals in sediment except for Fe, Cu and Rb, which can occasionally be associated with adverse biological effects. Contamination level and ecological risk were evaluated using contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (I-geo), pollution load index (PLI), and potential ecological risk index (PERI). Multivariate statistical technique was used to classify the metal sources. The results showed that Fe was significantly enriched in the sediments. Ecological risk factors illustrated a pollution-free condition of the salt marsh ecosystem in Bangladesh.

AB  - In the Basin of Mexico, one of the most important economic regions in the country with over 22 million inhabitants, peri-urban streams have been transformed into sewers, drains, and pipes to avoid flooding or unsanitary conditions; the change affects not only the ecosystem's goods and services but also the aquatic communities that support the natural ecological processes. We aimed to develop a diatom-based diagnosis of the ecological quality of these aquatic ecosystems through the study of epilithic diatom response to regional environmental gradients. Samples of epilithic diatoms and water were collected in 45 sites representing 12 perennial streams, and multivariate analyses were performed on environmental and biological data. The ecological quality gradient to which diatoms responded was related to oxygen saturation, soluble reactive phosphorous, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and hydromorphological quality. Three species groups were recognized according to their ecological preferences along CCA1 axis, indicators of high and low ecological quality, and tolerant species. By assigning an indicator value to each species group, we calculated the DEQI using the formula adapted from Pantle and Buck, indicating five different ecological quality classes. This index is proposed for complementing the ecological quality evaluation as a biological metric that responds to multiple regional stressors of the structure and function of these peri-urban streams in the Basin of Mexico.

AB  - Blades are weak and essential parts of an aeroengine. Monitoring the running state of blades is essential for ensuring the safety of aeroengine operation. Blade tip timing (BTT) is considered a promising technique for operational blade vibration monitoring for turbomachinery; however, it is difficult to analyze the BTT signal because of the inherent undersampled limitation. To overcome this limitation, the minimal sensor layout scheme is restricted to be "three." Usually, more than five probes are required for good signal revolution. This requirement is an installation restriction that limits the application of BTT; however, for users, the conflict between probe layout optimization and real installation restriction is also a serious problem. Motivated by these issues, a single-probe BTT (SP-BTT) method is proposed; the SP-BTT method could extract the shift between natural frequencies, which could be used as a damage index for blade condition monitoring. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, numerical simulations and experimental tests are performed.

AB  - The invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas Thunberg, 1793 was introduced in Denmark for aquaculture in the 1970s. Presently, feral populations are found in many parts of the country, with the largest populations established on existing beds of blue mussel, Mytilus edulis Linnaeus, 1758. This study was conducted in the Limfjord estuary, at Agger Tange, where C. gigas was introduced in 1972. The study site is a large cluster of raised intertidal bivalve beds inhabited by C. gigas and M. edulis in a sheltered part of the estuary. The two bivalves have some of the same living requirements, and as C. gigas have been present in the ecosystem for more than 40 years, we hypothesize that the presence of C. gigas has altered the spatial and temporal distribution of M. edulis by inducing a niche separation. The spatiotemporal development of the bivalve bed was determined using orthophotos. C. gigas and M. edulis were collected from the bivalve bed, shell lengths were converted into biomass, which were interpolated to create biomass contours and combined with modelled topography of the bivalve bed to study niche separation. The bivalve bed slowly extended northwards over a period of 11 years, where it also became more fragmented. The northern part of the bed was composed of mussel mats on top of soft sediment. This area was dominated by M. edulis, while areas in the south were dominated by C. gigas. In the southern part, the bivalve bed was composed of thick and compact sediment suggesting it represent the oldest part of the bivalve bed. There were no differences in the conditions of C. gigas and M. edulis from old or newly established areas, and there were no difference in the vertical distributions of the bivalve species. Thus, spatial and temporal separation of the two species is not pronounced at present, and thus unable to explain why they seemingly coexist.

AB  - The development of targets is foundational in conservation. Although progress has been made in setting targets, the diverse linkages among ecological and social components make target setting for coupled social-ecological systems extremely challenging. Developing integrated social-ecological targets is difficult because it forces policy makers to consider how management actions propagate throughout social-ecological systems, and because ultimately it is society, not scientists, that defines targets. We developed an interdisciplinary approach for identifying management targets and illustrate this approach using an example motivated by Puget Sound, USA. Our approach blends ecological modeling with empirical social science to articulate trade-offs and reveal societal preferences for different social-ecological states. The framework aims to place information in the hands of decision makers and promote discussion in the appropriate forums. Our ultimate objective is to encourage the informed participation of citizens in the development of social-ecological targets that reflect their values while also protecting key ecosystem attributes.

AB  - We evaluated the effects of multiple bottom-up processes on the relative condition (an index of length-specific weight) of adult Gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus sampled from the US commercial fishery, from 1964 to 2011, in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM). A series of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were constructed to examine the influence of Mississippi River Discharge (MRD), El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), wind vector components, sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll a concentration. Relative condition was positively correlated with MRD and highest during weak La Nina-like and moderate El Nino-like conditions. The effect of wind vector components was variable across the NGOM. This observation is likely due to geographic differences in wind-related transport of nutrient rich river plume waters Relative condition was highest at 24 degrees C and declined rapidly when SST was below 23 degrees C or above 29 degrees C Relative condition exhibited seasonal variability with increasing condition from August until November, likely caused by seasonal provisioning by individuals for winter spawning. We show that multiple bottom-up processes contribute to contrasts in the condition of Gulf menhaden in the NGOM and these results can be used to predict the response of Gulf menhaden to environmental variability.

AB  - Globally, desertification is a challenging issue today. As per United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), it has been altering the quality of life of several people across the world. The study deals with temporal monitoring and mapping land degradation and desertification over the Thar Desert, which occupies the northwestern part of Rajasthan, India, with arid climatic conditions. It is necessary to control desertification by taking a few safety steps to create an early warning system based on scientific facts and satellite and secondary data. The current study has focused on integrating different data (i.e., climate, vegetation, and socio-economic), primary and secondary, as per their availability at a spatial scale for evaluating Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA), prone to desertification. It also provides temporal observation of various ESA indicators to measure the intensity and severity of land degradation in desertification. The weightage of ESA indicators was assigned based on Analytical Hierarchical Processes (AHP) to quantifying the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI). Overall, current research can guide authorities in proceeding with appropriate measures for addressing the process of land degradation. It would help the concerned authorities to execute suitable actions for combating desertification as apprised in COP-14 meeting under UNCCD framework, lately held in New Delhi (India) in 2019.

AB  - One year qualitative and quantitative study of communities of three major taxonomic groups has been carried out at test panles placed in the upper infarlittoral zone of coastal area of Vela Luka Bay, Croatia. A list of 44 taxa was recorded. Chaetomorpha sp., Ulva sp., Fosliella farinosa, Sphacelaria cirrosa, Polysiphonia scopulorum were the most frequent dominant taxa. Among 27 algal taxa with noticeable presence only three were classified as ESG (Ecological State Groups) I. Low diversity and species richness together with massive presence of the green algae (as Ulva sp.) and negligible presence of ESG I taxa, may lead to erroneous conclusion that Vela Luka Bay is eutrophicated area. Low values of biomass and R/P (Rhodophyceae by Phaeophyceae ratio) Index together with dominance of Phaeophyta also support conclusion that there is no negative impact of nutrient enrichment on macrophyta fouling community in Vela Luka Bay.

AB  - How does environmental public action govern the heterogeneous temporalities of the social and natural worlds? To contribute answering this question, this paper critically studies the policies deployed to govern water scarcity in South-western France for more than thirty years. This paper shows the ambiguity associated to the construction of an environmental reference state for rivers corresponding to management threshold based on a modeled representation of rivers pristine state. To do so, this paper analyses the manner actors involved in the design and implementation of public policies try to render planning and crisis management consistent, thanks to common indicators. This paper discusses the manner actors create new rooms for maneuver by negotiating modeling methods and, by doing so, disarm environmental concerns.

AB  - This study presents influence of hydrological connectivity between oxbow lakes and the river on water quality determined based on the structure of aquatic invertebrate communities in oxbow lakes. Five oxbow lakes of the Lyna River were investigated, i.e. two lotic, two semi-lotic and one lentic ecosystem. It was shown that Chaoboridae (Diptera), Oligochaeta and Hydrobiidae (Gastropoda) were the most abundant groups of invertebrates, often accompanied by Chironomidae larvae (Diptera). Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera were the only invertebrate bioindicators observed in the studied water bodies. The EPT% index, determined based on their abundance, as well as EPT:C, determined based on their proportion to Chironomidae, indicated that groups of these organisms sensitive to environmental conditions occurred at low abundance in all hydrological types of oxbow lakes. Family Biotic Index (FBI), Biological Monitoring Working Party index (BMWP-PL) and Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), both adapted to the Polish conditions, revealed low water quality regardless of the degree of hydrological connectivity. This study shows that the structure of invertebrate communities inhabiting oxbow lakes can be a source of valuable monitoring data. BMWP-PL seems to be the most objective among the biotic indices. Hence, it can be applied in biomonitoring research of many types of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Human activities put stress on our oceans and with a growing global population, the impact is increasing. Stressors rarely act in isolation, with the majority of marine areas being impacted by multiple, concurrent stressors. Marine spatial cumulative impact assessments attempt to estimate the collective impact of multiple stressors on marine environments. However, this is difficult given how stressors interact with one another, and the variable response of ecosystems. As a result, assumptions and generalisations are required when attempting to model cumulative impacts. One fundamental assumption of the most commonly applied, semi quantitative cumulative impact assessment method is that a change in modelled cumulative impact is correlated with a change in ecosystem condition. However, this assumption has rarely been validated with empirical data. We tested this assumption using a case study of seagrass in a large, inverse estuary in South Australia (Spencer Gulf). We compared three different seagrass condition indices, based on survey data collected in the field, to scores from a spatial cumulative impact model for the study area. One condition index showed no relationship with cumulative impact, whilst the other two indices had very small, negative relationships with cumulative impact. These results suggest that one of the most commonly used methods for assessing cumulative impacts on marine systems is not robust enough to accurately reflect the effect of multiple stressors on seagrasses; possibly due to the number and generality of assumptions involved in the approach. Future methods should acknowledge the complex relationships between stressors, and the impact these relationships can have on ecosystems. This outcome highlights the need for greater evaluation of cumulative impact assessment outputs and the need for data-driven approaches. Our results are a caution for marine scientists and resource managers who may rely on spatial cumulative impact assessment outputs for informing policy and decision-making. Crown Copyright

AB  - The present study investigates the As-contamination scenario in groundwater and treated drinking water sources from all the 9 gram panchayats under Raninagar-II block, Murshidabad. Approximately 54.6 % of groundwater samples from the domestic and community tube-wells (n = 366) are with As concentration above the permissible limit in drinking water (10 mu g/l); while 37.3 % of groundwater samples from agricultural tube-wells (n = 67) are As-contaminated above its recommended value in irrigational water (100 mu g/l). Malibari-II is the worst affected gram panchayat with mean As concentration of 141 mu g/l (range: <3-995 mu g/l; n = 67) in domestic tube-wells and 294 mu g/l (range: 69.7-990 mu g/l; n = 16) in irrigational water. Arsenic-Iron pollution index assessment and ecological risk analysis state that the groundwater of the study area is sternly polluted. About 12.5 tonnes of As is withdrawn every year through irrigational water in the entire block. Bio-accumulation of As in rice grain (1.78) and paddy whole grain (2.67) shows the potential of hyper-accumulation. The concentrations of two essential micro-nutrients in groundwater (Selenium and Zinc) are low (mean: 0.57 and 84.5 mu g/l, respectively) which encourages the poor health of the local inhabitants. The populations can be expected to suffer from serious cancer and non-cancer risk through contaminated drinking water where the studied adult males face higher risk than the females. The R.O. and Sajaldhara water treatment plants show 77.6 and 74.4 % of As removal efficiency; however, dug wells are the safest drinking water source among all the available sources with a natural Fe/As ratio of 66.1 and account for lowest health risk according to SAMOE.

AB  - We investigated effects of ecological and physiological factors on brood patch area and prolactin levels in free-ranging Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens; hereafter "Snow Geese") and Ross's Geese (C. rossii). On the basis of the body-size hypothesis, we predicted that the relationships between prolactin levels, brood patch area, and body condition would be stronger in Ross's Geese than in the larger Snow Geese. We found that brood patch area was positively related to clutch volume and inversely related to prolactin levels in Ross's Geese, but not in Snow Geese. Nest size, nest habitat, and first egg date did not affect brood patch area in either species. Prolactin levels increased as incubation progressed in female Snow Geese, but this relationship was not significant in Ross's Geese. Prolactin levels and body condition (as indexed by size-adjusted body mass) were inversely related in Ross's Geese, but not in Snow Geese. Our findings are consistent with the prediction that relationships between prolactin levels, brood patch area, and body condition are relatively stronger in Ross's Geese, because they mobilize endogenous reserves at faster rates than Snow Geese.

AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate antioxidant roles of natural Azolla filiculoides on the physiological and biological aspects of young common carp. The fish were fed 0 (control), 2.50, 5.00 and 7.5% of azolla powder for 8 weeks. There were significant differences among treatments for weight gain, specific growth rate and relative growth rate. Also, significant differences were observed (p < 0.05) for RBC, Hgb, MCV, PLT and WBC. On the other hand, there were no significant differences for MCH, MCHC, Granules, Lymphocyte and Monocyte. AST, total protein, globulin and albumin in fish plasma were significantly higher (p < 0.05) for those fed with 2.50, 5.00 and 7.5% azolla than those in treatment 1(control). The highest blood glucose value was in T1 (control) which significantly differs from that in 3 and 4. There was a significant difference in plasma cholesterol of fish fed with azolla compared to control, as well as in values of triglyceride between treatment 4 and all others. Finally, there were significant differences for Hepatosomatic index, Spleenosomatic index and condition factor. The results of this study confirmed that natural azolla (5.00 and 7.5% g kg-1 feed) had significant effects on physiological, nutritional and biological parameters of common carp.

AB  - The effect of treated sewage on the quality of water and phytoplankton populations of Lake Manzala was studied with emphasis on use of algae to monitor water pollution as part of a search for a biological assessment of water quality. Lake Manzala is situated at the northern part of the Nile-delta, Egypt.
   Disposal of treated sewage into Lake Manzala appeared to have differential effects on water quality and phytoplankton populations. Marked seasonal and local variations were observed for the physical and chemical characteristics of water. 157 species of algae were identified, 59 Chlorophyta, 37 Bacillariophyta, 30 Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria), 28 Euglenophyta, one Pyrrhophyta and 2 Cryptophyta. Distribution and abundance of these algal divisions were found to differ at different sampling stations. Qualitative and quantitative growth of each algal division displayed great seasonal variations. The phytoplankton standing crop was mainly due to the contribution of Bacillariophyta whereas the species composition is dependent mainly on Chlorophyta.
   A great parallelism was noted between the quality of water samples based upon the chemical and physical investigations and their quality based upon the biological indices. Compound eutrophication index indicated that the nature of the investigated water ranged between eutrophic and hypereutrophic conditions. Diversity index values indicated that the water in the study area was of a moderate level of pollution. Saprobic index and saprobic quotient revealed the presence of beta- to alpha- mesosaprobic forms of algae.

AB  - Ovarian development in Labeo dyocheilus was assessed during active reproductive phase under ambient environmental conditions in captivity and wild. Increasing day length and water temperature seemed favourable for ovarian development in female L. dyocheilus under both conditions. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) was lower in May and higher in July in captivity (6.168 and 13.366) and wild (5.798 and 16.166) respectively. Ovarian development started little bit in advance in captivity with late yolk vesicle stage oocyte in May when yolk globule stage oocytes were prominent in wild. Fully grown cocytes with germinal vesicle migration (GVM) and germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) stages were observed in July in both conditions. Degree of transformation of developing oogonials into advance stage oocytes was observed to be better in wild fish compared to captivity reared ones. The histophysiological changes in liver corresponded well to the progression of ovarian development. Successive granulation and vacuolization of hopatocyte cytoplasm were indicative of augmented synthetic activity and probably mobilization of energy content for oocyte growth. These observations indicated that normal ovarian development of L. dyocheilus under captivity in Tarai region of Uttarakhand would be useful for success of its seed production in captivity for stock augmentation in wild or species diversification in aquaculture.

AB  - Fish condition indices can be used as biological indicators of the health of individuals and are influenced by numerous external and internal drivers. Like most essential biological traits, they are very sensitive to the spatial heterogeneity occurring in marine ecosystems, which appears at many observational scales. This brings out different ecological processes that can only be revealed either regionally or locally. The scale-dependent spatial variability concerns not only environmental factors, but also anthropogenic activities such as fishing. Understanding these relationships is crucial for improving the spatial management of marine resources, because fish condition considerably affects the sustainability of populations. We explore the influence of density-dependent (intra-specific competition) and density-independent variables (surface chlorophyll a concentration and fishing impact) on fish condition of three species of harvested gadoids (Merluccius merluccius, Phycis blennoides and Micromesistius poutassou) of the benthopelagic communities off the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean). This area is characterized by high spatial heterogeneity in the environmental processes and fishing impact. Results show contrasting responses in body condition to the investigated covariates, with species-specific and ontogenetic differences sensitive to the spatial scale of analysis. Some of these responses occur at regional level, while others are more sensitive to local variation. Intra-specific competition shows a very clear effect, which depends on the ontogeny, identifying aggregation areas for recruits and limitation of resources for older individuals. Surface chlorophyll a has always a species-specific regional effect, despite gadoids have a more benthic behavior. Fishing effort displays a heterogeneous impact on fish condition. While spatially contrasting effects are observed at local scale, non-linear regional patterns occur, with positive effects of fishing pressure at intermediate levels. Models analyzing the influence of external drivers in essential fish biological traits such as body condition should consider the spatial variation in responses, especially in highly heterogeneous areas where anthropogenic activities occur. Failing to do so may hide local ecological processes that can be crucial for the persistence of fish populations, which is of paramount relevance for the regional assessment and spatial management of marine exploited resources.

AB  - An adaptation of index of biotic integrity (IBI) was performed for the first time in Brazil at the Rio Paraiba do Sul, between Barra Mansa and Barra do Pirai, a very important extent of this river because of the high pollution levels, and for being the main abstraction source of Rio de Janeiro city wafer supply. A monthly standardised sampling programme, from March-1995 to February-1996, was carried out at four sites. Seines, casting nets and net trays were used for catching fishes. IBI was obtained by integrating 12 ecological and environmental attributes of fish taxocene, populations, and individual organisms to assess biological integrity based in Species Composition, Trophic Structure and Fish Condition. Overall, water quality was classified between poor and fair and an improvement was detected between the high polluted Barra Mansa site and the less polluted Barra do Pirai site, showing the capacity of restoration of the river over this 50 km. Seasonally, the best conditions were reached from March to August, and the worse, from September to February, when most aloctone materials are brought to the river.

AB  - In this study, we investigated which strategy Macrobrachium amazonicum populations use to survive in river and estuary environments. In each environment, abiotic factors were analyzed in situ, and ovigerous females and males of M. amazonicum specimens were captured. To determine ovarian maturity and morphotypes, gonads were removed and processed histologically, and the gonadosomatic index and condition factor (K) were determined. Ovigerous females were analyzed to determine the relationship between ovarian maturation and the embryonic phases of eggs in the brood pouch. Precipitation, turbidity and dissolved oxygen showed differences between the estuary and river. The population of ovigerous females showed that ovarian maturation was simultaneous with embryonic development. However, the freshwater prawn populations in the river were smaller and consisted of a greater number of ovigerous females with maturing and mature ovaries. In the estuary, ovigerous females with spawned and reorganized ovaries were observed more frequently. In males, the GC morphotype was absent in the river, where the TC morphotype predominated and showed similar reproductive conditions as the GC morphotype in the estuary. M. amazonicum has strategies for allocating energy for reproduction or growth in different environments. This description established the trade-off as a strategy used by M. amazonicum to maintain the population in adverse environments. (C) 2021 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Extraction of coalbed natural gas (CBNG) often results in disposal of large quantities of CBNG product water, which may affect aquatic ecosystems. We evaluated the effects of CBNG development on fish assemblages in tributary streams of the Powder and Tongue rivers. We used treatment and control, impact versus reference sites comparisons, surveys of CBNG product-water streams and in situ fish survival approaches to determine if CBNG development affected fish assemblages.
   2. Several of our results suggested that CBNG development did not affect fish assemblages. Species richness and index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores were similar in streams with and streams without CBNG development, and overall biotic integrity was not related to the number or density of CBNG wells. Fish occurred in one stream that was composed largely or entirely of CBNG product water. Sentinel fish survived in cages at treatment sites where no or few fish were captured, suggesting that factors such as lack of stream connectivity rather than water quality limited fish abundance at these sites. Fish species richness did not differ significantly from 1994 to 2006 in comparisons of CBNG-developed and undeveloped streams. Biotic integrity declined from 1994 to 2006; however, declines occurred at both impact and reference sites, possibly because of long-term drought.
   3. Some evidence suggested that CBNG development negatively affected fish assemblages, or may do so over time. Specific conductivity was on average higher in treatment streams and was negatively related to biotic integrity. Four IBI species richness metrics were negatively correlated with the number or density of CBNG wells in the catchment above sampling sites. Bicarbonate, one of the primary ions in product water, was significantly higher in developed streams and may have limited abundance of longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae). Total dissolved solids, alkalinity, magnesium and sulphate were significantly higher in developed streams.
   4. Biological monitoring conducted before the development of CBNG, and continuing through the life of development and reclamation, together with data on the quantity, quality and fate of CBNG product water will allow robust assessment of potential effects of future CBNG development worldwide.

AB  - E-government is recognized as a tool for improving transparency and openness in the public sector and for combatting corruption. Understanding the relationship between e-government development and the level of corruption would allow for a more effective leveraging of related projects in anti-corruption efforts. This paper examines the impact of e-government development on the level of corruption in the context of economic perspective. In contrast to previous studies, this empirical relationship is measured across sub-indices (dimensions) of related indices between 2002 and 2016. The results show that higher levels of e-government development are related to lower levels of corruption. The three most important dimensions found are the environment sub-index, which assesses the extent to which a country's market conditions and regulatory framework support entrepreneurship, innovation, and ICT development; the usage sub-index, which assesses the level of ICT adoption by a society's main stakeholders; and the telecommunication infrastructure sub-index measuring a country's ICT infrastructure capacity. Following these findings, certain ways of influencing of the level of corruption by a stimulation of concrete e-government development dimensions can be drawn. This is important especially in the time of a financial crisis and its consequences, which are also discussed in this paper.

AB  - Background: Only recently data on bat echolocation call intensities is starting to accumulate. Yet, intensity is an ecologically crucial parameter, as it determines the extent of the bats' perceptual space and, specifically, prey detection distance. Interspecifically, we thus asked whether sympatric, congeneric bat species differ in call intensities and whether differences play a role for niche differentiation. Specifically, we investigated whether R. mehelyi that calls at a frequency clearly above what is predicted by allometry, compensates for frequency-dependent loss in detection distance by using elevated call intensity. Maximum echolocation call intensities might depend on body size or condition and thus be used as an honest signal of quality for intraspecific communication. We for the first time investigated whether a size-intensity relation is present in echolocating bats.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured maximum call intensities and frequencies for all five European horseshoe bat species. Maximum intensity differed among species largely due to R. euryale. Furthermore, we found no compensation for frequency-dependent loss in detection distance in R. mehelyi. Intraspecifically, there is a negative correlation between forearm lengths and intensity in R. euryale and a trend for a negative correlation between body condition index and intensity in R. ferrumequinum. In R. hipposideros, females had 8 dB higher intensities than males. There were no correlations with body size or sex differences and intensity for the other species.
   Conclusions/Significance: Based on call intensity and frequency measurements, we estimated echolocation ranges for our study community. These suggest that intensity differences result in different prey detection distances and thus likely play some role for resource access. It is interesting and at first glance counter-intuitive that, where a correlation was found, smaller bats called louder than large individuals. Such negative relationship between size or condition and vocal amplitude may indicate an as yet unknown physiological or sexual selection pressure.

AB  - Wheat is one of the important cereal crops in the world and is the main staple food for many. Among the different environmental stresses, drought is the most critical threatening wheat productivity worldwide. This study evaluated and classified morphological and physiological characteristics of wheat genotypes in two non-stress and drought-stress conditions. A field study was conducted at the Research Station of Agricultural Faculty of Islamic Azad University of Tabriz, Iran between 2012 and 2013. Thirty wheat genotypes with six replications were sown in a randomised complete block design. As indicated in the results analysis of variance, the studied genotypes were genetically different in all characteristics. The grain yield had positive correlation with straw yield, harvest index, and biological yield Based on factor analysis, in the non-stressed condition, the first factor was referred to as yield, and in the stressed condition, the first factor was called yield components. To classify genotypes, cluster analysis was performed on the Ward method. The results of the analysis were divided into three groups in non-stressed experiment genotypes while in stress experiment genotypes, they were divided into four groups. Considering the cluster analysis, the first group was presented as the optimal one in the non-stress condition. The results indicated that in order to obtain the desirable grain yield, we can increase most of the traits with positive and significant correlations with the yield.

AB  - In April 2006, the Norwegian government launched a White Paper on a new holistic management plan for the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea, including the fishery protection zone around Svalbard. Following international guidelines for ecosystem-based management, the plan provides an overall framework for managing all human activities (oil and gas industry, fishing, and shipping) in the area to ensure the continued health, production, and function of the Barents Sea ecosystem. The primary function of area-based management is the identification of areas of special importance from either ecological or human perspectives. In each area, access for different human activities is to be carefully managed. The plan is based on an assessment of the current and anticipated impact of human activities and of the interactions between them, taking into account deficits in current knowledge of ecosystem state and dynamics. To monitor the overall development of the Barents Sea's state of health, a set of indicators with associated environmental quality objectives has been developed.

AB  - Among freshwater systems, coldwater habitats are among the most threatened by climate change. Examining the impacts of increasing water temperature requires the use of both traditional biomonitoring efforts and measures of ecosystem function and structure. We examined fish and macroinvertebrate communities, leaf decomposition rates, periphyton production, and ecosystem metabolism to compare two branches of a trout stream in Minnesota with differing thermal regimes. The cooler South Branch had more coldwater fish, a higher index of biological integrity for fish but a lower index for macroinvertebrates. There were no differences in leaf decomposition rates between branches, although non-native buckthorn leaves decomposed faster than native black cherry leaves. Periphyton production was higher in the North Branch than the South Branch. Both branches had high nitrogen but low phosphorus levels. Nutrient enrichment with phosphorus enhanced periphyton production in both branches. Measures of stream metabolism, based on diurnal variation in oxygen levels, showed that both branches were heterotrophic. Despite higher periphyton production in the North Branch, gross primary production was higher in the South Branch. The bioassessment measures used in our study yielded inconsistent results, pointing to the need for multiple methods to examine and better describe potential responses to warming from climate change.

AB  - The establishment of plant populations in novel environments may generate pronounced shifts in floral traits and plant mating systems, particularly when pollinators are scarce. In this study, floral morphology and mating system functioning are compared between recently established and older populations of the annual plant Blackstonia perfoliata that occur in different pollinator environments.
   Hand-pollination and emasculation experiments were conducted to assess the extent of pollinator-mediated pollen deposition and pollen limitation, and the contribution of autonomous selfing to total seed production. Detailed measurements of key floral traits were performed to compare the flower morphology and mating system functioning between plants from both pollination environments.
   Pollinator-mediated pollen deposition was about twice as low in the recently colonized and pollinator-poor environment compared with the old and pollinator-rich sites, but total seed set was little affected by any type of pollen limitation. The contribution of autonomous selfing to total seed production was higher in the pollinator-poor sites than in the pollinator-rich sites (index of reproductive assurance 056 and 017, respectively), and seed production was only poorly affected by selfing, whereas in the pollinator-rich populations selfing reduced total reproductive output by about 40 compared with outcross pollination. Plants originating from pollinator-poor environments produced smaller flowers that showed significantly lower levels of dichogamy (i.e. protogyny) and herkogamy. These reductions resulted in a 2-fold higher capacity for autonomous selfing under pollinator-free conditions (index of autonomous selfing 081 and 041 in plants originating from the pollinator-poor and pollinator-rich environment, respectively).
   The results illustrate that plant populations colonizing novel environments can differ markedly in floral morphology and mating system functioning. Due to a temporal shift in the male phase, the breeding system of B. perfoliata shifted from delayed selfing under pollinator-rich conditions towards competing selfing in recently established populations, providing greater reproductive assurance when pollinators and/or reproductive partners are limited.

AB  - Excessive use of agricultural chemicals and unreasonable utilization of agricultural wastes have led to severe agricultural non-point source pollution (ANPSP) problems in China. Based on the agricultural pollution loads and pollution control strength, the ecological risk index (ERI) was constructed and was used to explore the spatial-temporal pattern of agricultural ecological risks in China during 1978-2017. The findings indicated that Chinese agricultural ERI was gradually increased from 0.031 to 0.348 in 1978-2017, which has the same phased change characteristics as the succession of agricultural policies. At present, the ecological risk grade of ANPSP was present in the stair-step distribution characteristics of "high in the east and south and low in the west and north" as a whole. Southern China, as the main producing area of aquatic products, had the higher ecological risks. Northeastern China, the Huang-Huai-Hai Area, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, as the grain-producing bases, had moderate ecological risks, but Southwestern China and Northwestern China with the poor agricultural production conditions had the lower ecological risks. It evidently showed that the ecological risk problems faced by the high-quality development of Chinese agricultural industrialization are increasingly severe.

AB  - In recent years, research studies have increasingly focused on assessing the occurrence of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in ecosystems. However, much remains unknown concerning the potential effects on APIs on non-target organisms due to the complexity of the mode of action, reactivity and bioconcentration potential for each specific drug. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac (DCF) is one of the most frequently detected APIs in surface waters worldwide and has recently been included in the list of priority substances under the European Commission.
   In this study, mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were exposed to an environmentally relevant nominal concentration of DCF (250 ng L-1) over 15 days. The responses of several biomarkers were assessed in the mussel tissues: condition index (CI); superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and phase II glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, lipid peroxidation levels (LPO) associated with oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity related to neurotoxic effects and vitellogenin-like proteins linked to endocrine disruption.
   This study demonstrated significant induction of SOD and GR activities in the gills in addition to high CAT activity and LPO levels in the digestive gland. Phase II GST remained unaltered in both tissues, while the up-regulation of the AChE activity was directly related to the vitellogenin-like protein levels in exposed females, indicating an alteration in the estrogenic activity, rather than a breakdown in cholinergic neurotransmission function. This study confirmed that DCF at a concentration often observed in surface water induces tissue-specific biomarker responses. Finally, this study also revealed the importance of a multi-biomarker approach when assessing the potentially deleterious effects in a species that may be vulnerable to the continuously discharge of APIs into the ecosystems; this approach provides crucial new information regarding the unknown effects of DCF.

AB  - Distributions of arsenic and metals in surface sediments collected from the coastal and estuarine areas of the northern Bohai and Yellow Seas, China, were investigated. An ecological risk assessment of arsenic and metals in the sediments was evaluated by three approaches: the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the degree of contamination, and two sets of SQGs indices. Sediments from the estuaries of the Wuli and Yalu Rivers contained some of the greatest concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, lead, and zinc. Median concentrations of cadmium and mean concentrations of lead and zinc were greater than background concentrations determined for the areas. All sediments were considered to be heavily polluted by arsenic, but moderately polluted by chromium, lead, and cadmium. Current concentrations of arsenic and metals are unlikely to be acutely toxic, but chronic exposures would be expected to cause adverse effects on benthic invertebrates at 31.4% of the sites.

AB  - Accelerated export of nitrogen-containing dissolved organic matter (DOM) or dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to streams and rivers from agricultural watersheds has been reported worldwide. However, few studies have examined the dynamics of DOM molecular composition with the attention paid to the relative contributions of DON from various sources altered with flow conditions. In this study, end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) was conducted with the optical properties of DOM to quantify the relative contributions of several major organic matter sources (litter, reed, field soil, and manure) in two rivers of a small agricultural watershed. DOC and DON concentration increased during the storm events with an input of allochthonous DOM as indicated by an increase in specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and a decrease in biological index (BIX), fluorescence index (FI), and protein-like component (% C3) at high discharge. EMMA results based on a Bayesian mixing model using stable isotope analysis in R (SIAR) were more accurate in source tracking than those using the traditional IsoSource program. Manure (>30%) and field soil (also termed as "manure-impacted field soil") (>23%) end-members revealed their predominant contributions to the riverine DOM in SIAR model, which was enhanced during the storm event (up to 56% and 38%, respectively). The molecular composition of the riverine DOM exhibited a distinct footprint from the manure and manure impacted field soil, with a larger number of CHON formulas and abundant polyphenols and condensed aromatics in peak flow samples in the studied rivers. The riverine DOM during peak flow contained many unique molecular formu-las in both rivers (4980 and 2082) of which >60% originated from manure and manure-impacted field soil. Combining the EMMA with DOM molecular composition clearly demonstrated the effect of manure fertilizer on the riverine DOM of the watershed with intensive agriculture. This study provides insights into the source tracking and regulation of DON leaching from anthropogenically altered river systems worldwide.

AB  - The Paciencia river estuary (PRE) is an Amazonian estuary with relevant socio-economic importance; however, it is undergoing a continuous anthropogenic pressure such as the input of untreated domestic effluents. Hence, the phytoplankton community and trophic indices were analysed during three seasons in 2017 to assess the water quality and understand the degree of human influence in a macrotidal estuary. The trophic state of the PRE was determined by applying the trophic state index (TSI), trophic index, and Karydis trophic index, and ecological status by diversity metrics (diversity, evenness, richness, and dominance). Multivariate analysis indicated that TSI and dominance index were the most sensitive indices to changes in environmental conditions. The precipitation regime characterised the estuary in two different trophic scenarios. PRE was hypereutrophic in the dry season and mesotrophic in the rainy/transitional seasons based on the TSI. A high dominance index was recorded in the dry season with blooms of Thalassiosira rotula, reflecting an ecological disturbance. A higher phytoplankton diversity was recorded in the rainy/transitional seasons, indicating a tendency toward a lower stressed ecosystem. Therefore, understanding the trophic state variability in tropical estuaries and its response to changes in phytoplankton ecology is essential to support the management of coastal ecosystems.

AB  - The Bering Sea spans a wide latitudinal range, connecting with the temperate North Pacific Ocean to the south and the arctic Chukchi Sea to the north. Climate change has rapidly and significantly altered Bering Sea ecosystem dynamics. The biomass of predominantly boreal marine species have increased in the subarctic northern Bering Sea following recent record-high water temperatures across the shelf. Among those species are two commercially-important flatfishes: yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera; YFS) and northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra; NRS). In this study, the Bering Sea was divided latitudinally into three areas - north, central, and south - to assess the implications of a northward shift or expansion of juvenile flatfish habitat on production potential. The growth, diet, and condition of juveniles were compared among areas from 2016 to 2018. Summer bottom temperatures in the Bering Sea in 2016 and 2018 were anomalously warm, but 2017 temperatures were closer to the 2010-2018 average. Prey availability does not appear to be a limiting habitat factor across the Bering Sea. Juveniles of both species grow faster in length and to greater length-at age in the south. The morphometric-based condition of juvenile YFS appears to be better in the northern Bering Sea, while that of juvenile NRS also improves towards the north. Condition increased from 2016 to 2017, but then decreased slightly from 2017 to 2018. Although the results suggest larger size and faster growth of juveniles are associated with warmer bottom temperatures, there is also indication that growth and condition of juvenile flatfish may not continue to increase if current high temperatures persist in their habitat. Exploratory habitat models show that the condition of juvenile YFS may be negatively influenced by temperature. Negative effects on growth and energy storage may set in as the upper thermal physiological tolerance of each species is approached. The critical temperature maxima for each species is unknown, but it may be lower for the cold-adapted YFS than for NRS, implying that YFS may be less buffered against effects of climate warming.

AB  - A green assay based on the development of an enzymatic reaction in drop format under headspace single-drop microextraction conditions is described for the first time. An aqueous drop containing the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and the cofactor beta-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has been used as fluorescence probe for determining ethanol in alcohol-free cosmetics by microvolume fluorospectrometry. Experimental parameters affecting the microextraction performance were carefully optimized. Under the conditions employed, the contribution of other alcohols was found to be negligible. After 10 min of microextraction, a detection limit of 0.04 mu g g(-1) ethanol, a repeatability, expressed as relative standard deviation, of 5.3% for a 0.05 mM ethanol standard and a preconcentration factor of 391, were reached. Accuracy of the proposed methodology was evaluated by comparison of calibration slopes corresponding to external calibration with aqueous standards and standard addition calibration. The method was successfully applied to different alcohol-free cosmetics (external calibration was carried out in all cases). Additional advantages such as simplicity and high sample throughput can be highlighted. The greenness profile of proposed methodology was established using NEMI criteria (US National Environmental Methods Index). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Time series data of key environmental variables (water temperature, global radiation, vertical light attenuation, internal P load) and biomass of four colour classes of photosynthetically active algae were collected during 2003 and 2004 with daily resolution. Using these data, seasonal patterns of phytoplankton were analyzed as a function of the dynamic environment. Abstraction of the environmental state as a point in multi-dimensional space was used to identify habitat templates of bloom-forming groups and derive an indicator of environmental stability/physical disturbance. These templates were synthesized into a simple threshold model that sufficiently simulated development and collapse of various blooms. Blooms were, however, rare events related to specific environments with strong, unidirectional forcing. Tentative quantification of disturbance and compositional stability/community change allowed discriminating disturbance-driven changes and autogenic succession with reasonable success. The two processes were found to be equally important in shaping the composition and biomass of phytoplankton.

AB  - In this article, a revised and enlarged version of a qualitative assessment matrix for the appraisal of ecosystem service potentials is introduced. The product is a simple tool for scoring terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystem types with respect to their abilities to provide provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services as well as indicators of ecosystem state by applying criteria of ecosystem integrity. The methodological steps of matrix development are described, and the emerging expert opinions are illustrated by characterizing different ecosystem types, analysing different ecosystem services and showing the outcomes of linked GIS-based mapping exercises. The applicability of the matrix is demonstrated by some case studies. The related uncertainties are characterized and discussed in context with limitations, arising challenges and conceptual problems. The tool is made available on the internet, and the authors are looking forward to critical checks and proposals for improvement.

AB  - Over the past two decades there has been increasing interest in developing indicators to monitor environmental change. Remote sensing techniques have been primarily used to generate information on land use/land cover changes. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has used this technology to monitor wetland trends and recently developed a set of remotely-sensed indicators to characterize and assess trends in the integrity of natural habitat in watersheds. The indices largely focus on the extent of "natural" cover throughout a given watershed, with an emphasis on locations important to fish, wildlife, and water quality. Six indices address natural habitat extent and four deal with human-caused disturbance. A composite index of natural habitat integrity combining the habitat extent and habitat disturbance indices may be formulated to provide an overall numeric value for a watershed or subbasin. These indices facilitate comparison between watersheds (and subbasins) and assesssment of trends useful for environmental monitoring. This paper describes the indices and presents an example of their application for characterizing and assessing conditions of subbasins within Delaware's Nanticoke River watershed.

AB  - Remote sensing is a key technology that enables us to scale up our empirical, in situ measurements of carbon uptake made at the site level. In low leaf area index ecosystems typical of semi-arid regions however, many assumptions of these remote sensing approaches fall short, given the complexities of the heterogeneous landscape and frequent disturbance. Here, we investigated the utility of remote sensing data for predicting gross primary production (GPP) in pinon-juniper woodlands in New Mexico (USA). We developed a simple model hierarchy using climate drivers and satellite vegetation indices (VIs) to predict GPP, which we validated against in situ estimates of GPP from eddy-covariance. We tested the influence of pixel size on model fit by comparing model performance when using VIs from RapidEye (5 m) and the VIs from Landsat ETM+ (30 m). We also tested the ability of the normalized difference wetness index (NDWI) and normalized difference red edge (NDRE) to improve model fits. The best predictor of GPP at the undisturbed PJ woodland was Landsat ETM+ derived NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), whereas at the disturbed site, the red-edge VI performed best (R-adj(2) of 0.92 and 0.90 respectively). The RapidEye data did improve model performance, but only after we controlled for the variability in sensor view angle, which had a significant impact on the apparent cover of vegetation in our low fractional cover experimental woodland. At both sites, model performance was best either during non-stressful growth conditions, where NDVI performed best, or during severe ecosystem stress conditions (e.g., during the girdling process), where NDRE and NDWI improved model fit, suggesting the inclusion of red-edge leveraging and moisture sensitive VI in simple, data driven models can constrain GPP estimate uncertainty during periods of high ecosystem stress or disturbance.

AB  - Isolated NE-SW stretching the Helan Mountain massif, separating the temperate grassland of the Ordos plateau from the Tenggeli Desert, is a key position of studying the glacier development in west China as well as the coupling conditions of climate change with tectonic uplift. The glacial landforms and deposits including cirques, peaks, knife-edge ridges, lateral moraines, and terminal moraines distribute above 2800 m a.s.l. in the middle part of the Helan Mountain. This distribution indicates that here was once glaciated during the late Quaternary. Morphology features show a clear sequence of landscape forming events took place throughout the Helan Mountain. Laboratory optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating (AMS C-14) results indicate a late history of glacial advance. Late Pleistocene glaciers in the middle part of the Helan Mountain advanced to near their positions at least four times, and the glacial sequences can be assigned as the middle stage of last glacial cycle (MIS3b, 43.2 +/- 4.0 ka), last glacial maximum (LGM, similar to 18 ka), late glacial (12.0 +/- 1.1 ka) and neo-glacial (3.4 +/- 0.3 ka) respectively. Adopting equilibrium line altitude similar to 2980 m of last glacial maximum and the modern theoretical snowline altitude similar to 4724 m as the maximum amplitudes, and the standard marine isotope curve (MIS) as the glacial equilibrium line change since the Gonghe Movement (150 ka), the relationship between the mountain altitude and glacier development is discussed herein. Compared with other environmental indexes such as the loess-paleosol and ice core, conclusions are made that glacier advances in the Helan Mountain during the late Quaternary obviously depended on the coupled control of tectonic uplift of mountain with the climate condition. It is at last glaciation that the mountain reached the altitude above snowline and coupled with the glacial climate. The glacial advances occurred in the early and middle stages of last glacial cycle after the Gonghe Movement.

AB  - Mussel culture and fisheries are two increasing activities in Baja California, NW Mexico. One of the risks for these activities is the presence of harmful parasites like certain copepod species. This study was carried out to determine the parasitic copepods associated with edible mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. and Mytilus californianus Conrad, from Baja California, NW Mexico, and to establish certain aspects of their distribution, temporal fluctuation, and damage to their host. The study was carried out at sites of contrasting environmental conditions: exposed rocky shores, protected shores, protected and polluted areas, and culture area. Two species of parasitic copepods were found inhabiting the mantle cavity and gills of mussels: Pseudomyicola spinosus Raffaele and Monticelli (Mycolidae) and Modiolicola gracilis Wilson (Clausidiidae). This is the first record of these copepods in Mexican waters. M. gracilis was found in M. galloprovincialis and M. californianus from all localities studied in numbers from 0 to 5 individuals per host and a maximum prevalence of 26.66% in the first species, and from 0 to 15 specimens per mussel and a maximum prevalence of 70% in the second species. Its presence was relatively constant through the year, with a slight increase in autumn and winter. P. spinosus, by contrast, was scarce or absent in M. californianus and M. galloprovincialis from exposed rocky shore environments. Its number and prevalence were low in the mussel culture area. However, it was very abundant in M. galloprovincialis from the protected and polluted environments, where its numbers ranged from 0 to 59 copepods per mussel and a prevalence of 100%. Rates of infestation in mussels increased in autumn. Macroscopical damages associated with the presence of copepods were not detected, and the histopathologic analysis did not reveal any damage to the tissues of the host. However, there were more parasites in larger mussels, and most parasitized mussels showed a low condition index. P. spinosus could be considered a potential threat to the mussel culture.

AB  - The reproductive biology and glycogen content of a suberenated ark shell Scapharco kagoshimensis (Tokunaga,1906) in Ariake Bay were investigated from April 2004 to May 2005 in relation to environmental factors such as water temperature, and partial spawning was from July to September, and the spent stage was first found in September. In the female, gamete development was first observed in April, and continued until July. The matured ovary was seen in July, and partial spawning occurred in August, and the spent stage appeared from August. The gonads could not be distinguisged in boht sexes form December to March. Spawning in both sexes occurred during the period of highest water temperature (>25 degrees C). The condition factor index remained high (>28.0) from April to June and rapidly declined to 18.9 during June and July. Glycogen content gradually decreased from 43.1 mg g to 20.1 mg/g from April to July 2004 and gradually increased from 34.1 mg/g in Janualry to 62.6 mg/g in April 2005. These results suggested that S. kagoshimensis in Ariake Bay was characterized by it spawning period in summer, monocyclic gametogenesis throughout the year, and an inverse relationship between gonad development and glycogen content.

AB  - The functional feeding groups of the riverine macrozoobenthos are studied in two ecoregions (East Balkan and Pontic Province) and two catchment basins (Aegean and Black Sea) in Bulgaria. Totally, 83 benthic samples from 40 sites situated at 35 rivers, which belong to ten types of water bodies are analysed for establishing site-specific referent conditions. Ecological state is assessed through the Total Number of Taxa and values of the Biotic Index and RETI/PETI Trophic Index. The specific trophic structure of benthic communities characterised as unaffected and adopted as reference conditions are described. The distribution of the functional feeding groups is in compliance with the principles of the River Continuum Concept. Assessed as Total Number of Taxa, the trophic structure is dominated by scrapers followed by predators and shredders. The analysis of the abundance shows similar distribution of shares of the functional feeding groups in the two catchment basins, with prevailing participation of scrapers. A parallel analysis of the distribution of the taxa of the functional feeding groups and those of the indicator groups defining the values of the Biotic Index is performed.

AB  - Environmental temperatures affect nearly all aspects of ectotherm physiology, including terrestrial salamanders. Therefore, habitat disturbances that alter temperature regimes may interact with physiological processes to affect energy budgets of salamanders or constrain surface activity and possibly lead to changes in population-level parameters. We hypothesized that warmer surface temperatures following harvesting of canopy trees could cause surface-active salamanders to expend more energy for metabolism, potentially leaving a smaller proportion of the energy budget available for reproduction or storage. From 2006 to 2008, we quantified temperature regimes of salamander refugia in a field experiment replicated at 4 sites that included plots subjected to a timber harvest and plots not manipulated during this time period. At each site, we quantified temperature regimes in regenerating forest stands which, approximately 10 years earlier, experienced a range of harvest intensity from shelterwood to silvicultural clearcut. Further, we compared energetic parameters including 1) calories required to maintain homeostasis across an active season, 2) abundance of available potential energy (i.e., invertebrate prey), and 3) a measure of growth and storage (i.e., body condition index) among silvicultural treatments for surface-active salamanders. For surface-active eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), mean calories required for maintenance were approximately 33% greater in recently harvested forest compared to unharvested controls, but body condition was inconsistent among treatments, and invertebrate abundances were similar among treatments but differed by study site. In contrast, we did not detect a treatment effect in any energetic metric 8-14 growing seasons after harvesting. Given that surface-active salamanders in recently harvested forest may be forced to restrain behaviors associated with foraging and mating or trade-off growth or reproduction for increased basic maintenance costs, energetics may be an important but overlooked short-term contributor to observed changes in abundances, reproductive demography, or surface activities after timber harvesting. Managing for both the rapid recovery of understory vegetation and retention of large stumps and logs may help mitigate warming of microclimate for salamanders and should be considered further.

AB  - Despite the dramatic decrease of atmospheric lead (Pb) concentrations in urban areas of most industrialised countries, we hypothesised that urban common blackbirds (Turdus merula) may still be contaminated by Pb concentrations of toxicological concern due to transfer from soil through the food chain. We sampled blackbirds and earthworms, one of their main preys, in Besanqon, a middle-size city of Eastern France (where atmospheric Pb concentrations decreased from 0.5 mu g/m(3) in 1987 to nearly 0 in 2002) and in a rural reference site. Lead concentrations were determined in the tissues of the different functional groups of earthworms (anecic, epigeous and endogeous) and in blood, washed and unwashed outermost tail feathers and breast feathers of blackbirds. Fresh masses and an index of individual body condition were measured in the two blackbird populations as biomarkers of possible toxic effects. Lead concentrations in earthworms did not differ among functional groups but were significantly higher in urban individuals than in rural ones. Concentrations in outermost tail feathers, breast feathers and blood were significantly higher in urban blackbirds (7.75 +/- 4.50, 3.15 +/- 1.77 and 0.15 +/- 0.09 mu g/g, respectively) than in rural individuals. In urban blackbirds, concentrations in washed and unwashed outermost tail feathers allowed estimating the external contamination (probably due to deposition of dusts and/or to excretion of the uropygial gland) at 37% of the total Pb concentration of the unwashed feathers. Remaining 63% should be linked to food chain transfer of persistent Pb from urban soils. Among the 23 sampled blackbirds, 4 of them (3 in the urban site and I in the rural site) exhibited blood Pb concentrations higher than the benchmark value (0.20 mu g/g) related to subclinical and physiological effects in birds. Variations in body condition index were not correlated to Pb concentrations in blackbird tissues. Present results suggest that Pb may still be of environmental concern for blackbirds in urban areas because of the persistence of Pb in soils and its transfer through the food chain.

AB  - Environmental conditions such as temperature and relative humidity influence the rate of evaporation of moisture from the concrete pore structure, They therefore have a direct influence on the development of transport properties, which are related to durability. Portland cement concretes of various grades were wet cured for different periods of time and exposed to controlled environmental conditions. The influences of temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed on potential durability of the cover layer were assessed by means of durability index parameters related to the transport processes of oxygen permeability, water sorptivity, and chloride conductivity.
   Temperature, in the range 18 to 35degreesC, had the most significant influence on the results, The effect of elevated temperatures on evaporation and hydration resulted in either significant reductions or improvements of potential durability, The influence of relative humidity, in the range 50 to 65%, was less significant. Exposure to 82% relative humidity resulted in significant improvements in the indexes of poorly cured concretes, while well-cured concretes were insensitive to changes in relative humidity. The influence of wind speed on potential durability was insignificant.

AB  - The chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is usually grown under rainfed, rather than irrigated conditions, where drought accompanied by heat stress is a major growth constraint. The aim of this study was to select chickpea genotypes having resistance to drought/heat stress and to identify the most appropriate selection criteria for this. A total of 377 chickpea accessions were sown 2 months later than normal for the Antalya region (Turkey) to increase their exposure to the drought and high-temperature conditions of a typical summer in this part of the world. Interspersed between every 10 test genotypes as benchmark genotypes, were plants of the two known genotypes ILC 3279 (drought-susceptible) and ILC 8617 (drought-susceptible), while ICC 4958 (known drought-resistant) and ICCV 96029 (known very early, double-podded) were also sown for confirmation. All plants were subsequently screened for drought and heat stress resistance. Soon after the two known susceptible genotypes had died, evaluations of the entire trial were made visually on a scale from '1' (free from drought/heat damage) to '9' (all plants died from drought/heat). Yield loss in many of the test genotypes and in the two known susceptible genotypes (ILC 3279 and ILC 8617) rose to 100 %. The desi chickpeas (smaller, dark seeds) were generally more drought- and heat-resistant than the kabuli chickpeas (larger, pale seeds). Two desi chickpeas, ACC 316 and ACC 317, were selected for drought and heat (> 40 degrees C) resistance under field conditions. Seed weight was the trait least affected by adverse environmental conditions and having the highest heritability, and it should be used in early breeding selections. When breeding drought- and heat-resistant chickpeas, path and multivariate analyses showed that days to the first flowering and maturity to escape terminal drought and heat stresses should be evaluated ahead of many other phenological traits, and harvest index, biological yield and pods per plant for increased yield should also be considered.

AB  - Amitriptyline (AMI) is a commonly tricyclic antidepressant to treat depression, anxiety, and other conditions. Like many other pharmaceuticals, AMI and its by-products are incompletely removed during wastewater treatment and therefore they are released to rivers, estuaries and coastal waters. The presence of this kind of compounds in the water environment may involve a negative impact on non-target aquatic organisms at relatively low concentrations. However, the knowledge of AMI effects on aquatic organisms in the environment is scarce. Thus, the objective of this work is to determine the effects of environmentally-relevant concentrations of AMI on biological responses at biochemical and cellular levels in marine teleost. Gilt-head seabream (S. aurata) were exposed to AMI for 7 days at 0.2 mu g/L in an open flow system and a battery of biomarkers were investigated: acetylcholinesterase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, cytochrome C oxidase, P450 CYP1A1 ethoxyresorufin (O) dealkylation, and lysosomal biomarkers. Biomarkers were integrated as IBR/n (biological response index). Overall, it can be concluded that AMI exposure at environmentally-relevant concentration induces significant biological responses to stress in marine teleost, especially in lysosomal biomarkers. However, further research is needed about the effects of AMI and other pharmaceuticals on biomarkers in nontargeted species, to raise the knowledge about the toxicity of this type of emerging pollutants.

AB  - SOIL QUALITY INDEX ASSOCIATED TO THE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE (SQI(GR)) IN THE UPPER RIO GRANDE BASIN, MINAS GERAIS In the last years, soil quality indexes for analyses of the environmental sustainability and agricultural production have been proposed in increasing numbers. However, none of these indexes is related to the groundwater recharge soil quality index for conditions in Brazil. The objective of this study was to generate a soil quality index related to the groundwater recharge (SQI(GR)) of the physiographical conditions of the Upper Rio Grande Basin and to draw a map of SQI(GR) using geostatistical procedures. The proposed SQI(GR) consists of a linear combination of three properties related to water infiltration into the soil: bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity and macroporosity. To validate the index, the participation of the base flow in the total flow of four sub-basins of the Upper Rio Grande Basin was considered, analyzing the behavior of this hydrologic indicator taking the spatial distribution of SQI(GR) as reference. This validation process indicated the importance of SQI(RG) as tool to evaluate the groundwater recharge potential since it reflects the influence of different land uses on the base flow behavior and, consequently, on water yield from sub-basins.

TI  - Positive effects of COVID-19 lockdown on river water quality: evidence from River Damodar, India
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
KW  - INDEX
AB  - The global economic activities were completely stopped during COVID-19 lockdown and continuous lockdown partially brought some positive effects for the health of the total environment. The multiple industries, cities, towns and rural people are completely depending on large tropical river Damodar (India) but in the last few decades the quality of the river water is being significantly deteriorated. The present study attempts to investigate the river water quality (RWQ) particularly for pre- lockdown, lockdown and unlock period. We considered 20 variables per sample of RWQ data and it was analyzed using novel Modified Water Quality Index (MWQI), Trophic State Index (TSI), Heavy Metal Index (HMI) and Potential Ecological Risk Index (RI). Principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson's correlation (r) analysis are applied to determine the influencing variables and relationship among the river pollutants. The results show that during lockdown 54.54% samples were brought significantly positive changes applying MWQI. During lockdown, HMI ranged from 33.96 to 117.33 with 27.27% good water quality which shows the low ecological risk of aquatic ecosystem due to low mixing of toxic metals in the river water. Lockdown effects brought river water to oligotrophic/meso-eutrophic condition from eutrophic/hyper-eutrophic stage. Rejuvenation of river health during lockdown offers ample scope to policymakers, administrators and environmentalists for restoration of river health from huge anthropogenic stress.

AB  - Ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE) is defined as the ratio of carbon gain (i.e., gross primary productivity; GPP) to water consumption (i.e., evapotranspiration; ET). WUE is markedly influential on carbon and water cycles, both of which are fundamental for ecosystem state, climate and the environment. Drought can affect WUE, subsequently disturbing the composition and functionality of terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, the impacts of drought on WUE and its components (i.e., GPP and ET) are assessed across the Contiguous US (CONUS) at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Soil moisture simulations from land surface modeling are utilized to detect and characterize agricultural drought episodes and remotely sensed GPP and ET are retrieved from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). GPP, as the biome vitality indicator against drought stress, is employed to investigate drought recovery and the ecosystems' required time to revert to pre-drought condition. Results show that drought recovery duration indicates a positive correlation with drought severity and duration, meaning that a protracted drought recovery is more likely to happen following severe droughts with prolonged duration. WUE is found to almost always increase in response to severe (or worse) drought episodes. Additionally, ET anomalies are negatively correlated with drought severity and ET is expected to decrease during severe (or worse) drought episodes. Lastly, the changes of WUE are decomposed in relation to its components and the cross-relation among the variables is revealed and a consistent changing pattern is detected.

AB  - Since its introduction in the early 1960s, the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has demonstrated a capacity to adapt and change in the face of new challenges. The reformed CAP, under AGENDA 2000, encourages more environmentally friendly farming practices. In the context of their rural development plans, Member States are required to link policies on agriculture with protection of the environment and to ensure that farmers meet environmental standards. Additionally, Member States should maintain and restore the quality of both their aquatic and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems according to the Directive 2000/60/EU, 'Establishing a framework for Community Action in the field of Water Policy'. Within this framework, agri-environmental indicators play an important role in planning and implementing CAP guidelines. However, selection and use of the proper indicators remains unresolved, considering that ecosystem processes are complex and interactions in most cases not obvious.
   This paper proposes a methodology for assessing the environmental state and impacts of current land use and management when implementing agri-environmental measures of CAP. The proposed methodology includes a modified Driving forces-Pressures-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) framework, identification of Zones of Specific Functional Interest (ZSFI), and criteria for selecting agri-environmental indicators, which assess the functional performance of each zone and meet existing legislation.
   The Mygdonia Watershed (Greece) is an example where through use of both the appropriate Minimum Data Set of agri-environmental indicators at the identified zones and the proposed modified DPSIR, the functioning performance of each ZSFI can be assessed to evaluate the applied agri-environmental measures.

AB  - Patterns of growth and seasonal variation in body mass, kidney fat level, and bone marrow fat level were investigated in a roe deer population south of Paris. Size dimorphism was not apparent until the deer were 2 years of age, following a second period of rapid growth in males during spring-summer. No differences between the sexes in fat accumulation or in the periodicity of the annual fat cycle were observed. However, annual cycles of adult body mass were asynchronous between the sexes. Carcase mass was stable for much of the year, but one marked seasonal decline was observed in animals of each sex. For females (April-August) this reflected investment in late gestation and lactation, but among males (April-November) it was presumably linked to the costs of rutting. Contrary to reports for other ungulates, no over-winter decline in adult carcase mass, kidney fat level, or bone marrow fat level was observed, possibly because winters were mild. All four fat indices (kidney fat index, three bone-marrow fat indices) declined over spring-summer. This seasonal cyclicity does not match the energy requirements of reproductive activity, suggesting that the fat cycle is intrinsic, linked to seasonal metabolic variation in roe deer. We suggest that carcase mass is a more reliable index of condition in roe deer.

AB  - Animals inhabiting arid environments use a variety of behavioural and physiological strategies to balance their water and salt budgets. We studied the effects of dehydration and salt loading on osmoregulatory capacities in a large herbivorous desert lizard, the Moroccan Spiny-tailed lizard Uromastyx nigriventris, the family Agamidae. These lizards select plants with a high K+ to Na+ ratio of 15 to 20, and like other herbivorous lizards, effectively eliminate the extra electrolyte load, mainly via a pair of active nasal salt glands, which exude the extra ions from blood. Here we present results of a series of laboratory experiments, which tested a five-week food and water deprivation and the excretory response of nasal salt glands, during a short period of five days, following salt loading by two separated injections of KCl or NaCl at a 5-day interval (4th and 9th days). During food-water deprivation, hypohydrated lizards lost 32% of their initial body mass with a substantial decrease of their Body Condition Index and the tail volume as an index of energy (fat and then potential metabolic water) storage. Plasma osmolality significantly increased by 20%. There were also significantly increased plasma sodium, chloride, and total protein concentrations. On the other hand, there was no significant decrease in the plasma glucose level. Most of the salt loaded lizards secreted far more K+ than Na+ via the nasal glands, even after NaCl loading. The K+/Na+ ratio decreased only after two to three repetitive NaCl injections but insufficient Na+ was eliminated. Two successive KCl injections were successfully eliminated, but daily natural average K+ administration induced progressive hyperkaliemia. These experimental data agreed with previous observations showing variations of plasma Na+ and K+ concentrations in free-living lizards. The nasal gland constitutes the main route of Cl- excretion but the Cl-/(Na+ + K+) ratio may vary according to observations in other herbivorous species.

AB  - The article forms a hypothesis about a stable connection between the system of values of a literary character, the character of the plot eventfulness and the surrounding space filled with objects and phenomena. Based on the value coloring of any plot fact or phenomenon that forms an event series in the plot, the author suggests that it is possible to build a literary and aesthetic typology based on a universal value structure formed naturally around the issue of the purpose and meaning of the existence of an individual and humanity. A prerequisite for a protagonist to commit an act and form a plot event is a set of conditions formed by the value systems of his own and those around him. The character's environment indexes its ontological and axiological status, which allows you to clarify the properties of the narrative model of the work, adding new information about the actual conditions for the formation of the plot event. The argument in favor of this possibility is the fact that, equally in reality and in the artistic world of the work, there is the emergence of structures that organize the value world of a person with a central point in the form of a sacred symbol, below which are located hedonistic, social, physiological, etc. levels of being. In the transcendental reality of the individual, characteristic concentric circles and zones of metaphysical responsibility are formed. The problem is that the value system of the person is located and operates in his outlook, getting in reality, a considerable range of estimates, but in the aesthetic object spatial-material environment constructed by the author in accordance with the strategic outlook of the character that gives reason for the construction of a typology based on the level of remoteness / contradictions / match / zoom, etc. to the sacred center of the value system through which it becomes possible to describe literature as a consistent and solid structure.

AB  - This paper analyzes the scientific practices that constitute carbon economies by rendering carbon countable, fungible, and governable. Examining US biofuel governance, I draw on field research and document and policy analyses to consider the roles state, private industry, and civil society actors play in negotiating scientific practice in biofuel governance and to explore the geographically uneven consequences of contrasting science-society configurations. This research illustrates the complex and contradictory roles of nature's quantification and state-supported science in carbon economies. Although nature's quantification as carbon was initially used as a technology of opposition and accountability to limit vested interest power and maintain biofuels' greenhouse gas reduction capacity, it ultimately served industry interests by focusing policy deliberation on technical issues industry deftly navigated and away from policy rationale, value conflict, and biofuels' broader social-ecological consequences. Drawing attention to state-supported environmental risk assessment and place-based approaches to integrating science and agriculture, this research describes multiple, conflicting modes of state scientific practice and emphasizes the importance of considering multiple scientific perspectives in climate change research and intervention. I argue that, rather than focusing on mitigating climate change through universal, carbon-focused science alone, future science-society configurations should include efforts to build institutional capacity for transformation and adaptation to confront uneven and changing social-ecological circumstances using site-specific scientific knowledge.

AB  - The present study aims to explore the diversity patterns of cultivable filamentous fungi and establish the ecological interactions that occur within the mycological community on soapstone in two distinct places: Architectural Complex of Caraca and Congonhas town, in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. A total of 200 isolates of filamentous fungi were detected and 72 distinct taxa were identified using molecular tools. The rock-inhabiting fungal communities were comprised of cosmopolitan taxa, which displayed high diversity and richness, but low dominance indexes at two of the sampling sites over the course of 12months. The detection of organic acids secreted by the isolated filamentous fungal species revealed the potential for deterioration of the model stone by these fungi. Our results suggest that the isolated fungal communities of the two Brazilian localities have the ability to adapt to environmental adversities over the four seasons of the year, predicting adaptive population dynamics in the stone colonization. We conclude that this study on the ecological dynamics of the rock-inhabiting fungal communities can help to understand the competitive interactions between the environmental fungi. In addition, these fungi may contribute to the preservation of the Brazilian historical heritage that is vulnerable to environmental conditions.

AB  - Biological monitoring has become one of the most widely used approaches in aquatic monitoring. As a result, the effect of the xenobiotics entrained by the organic and inorganic effluents on different aquatic species is therefore entirely distinct. The aim of this study is to assess and to compare changes in biological responses, as non-specified biomarkers, measured in the gills and adductor muscles of the Mediterranean and African mussels,Mytilus galloprovincialis(designated MG) andPerna perna(designated PP) coexisting on Algerian coastal sites (Figuier, W. Boumerdes, Algeria) during the Winter and Spring period (2015/2016). Catalase enzyme activity, total proteins, and condition index were measured in collected samples of two size classes (class1: [2-2.5 cm] and class2: [4.5-5.5 cm]). During the study period, the values of enzymatic activities were relatively higher in MG than in PP (January, class 2, MG: 46.9 U/mg proteins, PP: 39.1U/mg proteins). Additionally, the results obtained showed a slight disturbance of the metabolism in two species of the same size class which resulted in a remarkable increase of catalase activity in March (class 2, MG: 54.2 U/mg protein, PP: 49 U/mg protein) and in April (class 2, MG: 51.9 U/mg protein, PP: 44.8 U/mg protein) compared to the other months. During the study period, the total proteins revealed a variation nonspecific for the two species at various sizes. With regard to the results obtained, biological responses were completely different in the two species with various sizes that were exposed to the natural or anthropogenic changes. Seasonal specificity contributed considerably and differently to the stress of the two species. Moreover, the catalase enzyme activity and total proteins proved their effectiveness as nonspecific, relevant and sensitive biomarkers.

AB  - Incubation temperatures, in addition to an embryo's genetic makeup, are critical in many aspects of adequate sea turtle embryonic development. The effects of high and low incubation temperatures on hatchling quality have been previously examined; however, many of these studies were conducted on relocated or laboratory-reared nests, which do not accurately reflect natural nest temperature fluctuations. To observe the impacts of varying in situ incubation temperatures on loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) hatchling morphology, various health variables and locomotor performance, temperature data loggers were deployed in 15 loggerhead nests on Juno Beach, Florida, between May and July 2018. Over the course of the study period, 10 morphological traits were measured, blood analytes and heart rate were assessed for the establishment of reference intervals and the self-righting response in seawater was evaluated. Warmer months were associated with smaller body size and higher body condition index, larger umbilical scar size, slower righting time, lower heart rates and higher packed cell volume, hemoglobin, total solids, total white blood cell count, absolute heterophils and absolute basophils. These findings provide evidence that higher in situ incubation temperatures have the potential to adversely affect hatchlings from warmer nests due to increased risk of predation from smaller body sizes, decreased physical responses and overall fitness, altered hemodynamic balance (e.g. dehydration) and potential inflammation and/or stress. With rising temperatures, we predict sea turtle hatchlings may have increasing risks of developing suboptimal physiological features affecting overall fitness and ultimately survival. These results demonstrate that rising environmental temperatures can negatively impact sea turtle hatchlings, thus representing additional stress on sea turtle populations and contributing to our understanding of potential pathophysiological effects of climate change on the delicate life-stage class of the sea turtle hatchling. This information will be useful for formulating effective future sea turtle management plans.

Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 299: R387-R394, 2010. First published May 26, 2010; doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.00546.2009.-This study investigated whether the estimation error of volume-weighted mean body temperature (Delta(T) over bar (b)) using changes in core and skin temperature can be accounted for using personal and environmental parameters. Whole body calorimetry was used to directly measure Delta(T) over bar (b) in an Experimental group (EG) of 36 participants (24 males, 12 females) and a Validation group (VG) of 20 (9 males, 11 females) throughout 90 min of cycle ergometry at 40 degrees C, 30% relative humidity (RH) (n = 9 EG, 5 VG); 30 degrees C, 30% RH (n = 9 EG, 5 VG); 30 degrees C, 60% RH (n = 9 EG, 5 VG); and 24 degrees C, 30% RH (n = 9 EG, 5 VG). The core of the two-compartment thermometry model was represented by rectal temperature and the shell by a 12-point mean skin temperature (Delta(T) over bar (sk)). The estimation error (X-0) between Delta(T) over bar (b) from calorimetry and Delta(T) over bar (b) from thermometry using core/shell weightings of 0.66/0.34, 0.79/0.21, and 0.90/0.10 was calculated after 30, 60, and 90 min of exercise, respectively. The association between X0 and the individual variation in metabolic heat production (M - W), body surface area (BSA), body fat percentage (%fat), and body surface area-to-mass ratio (BSA/BM) as well as differences in environmental conditions (Oxford index) in the EG data were assessed using stepwise linear regression. At all time points and with all core/shell weightings tested, M-W, BSA, and Oxford index independently correlated significantly with the residual variance in X-0, but % fat and BSA/BM did not. The subsequent regression models were used to predict the thermometric estimation error (X-0_pred) for each individual in the VG. The value estimated for X-0_pred was then added to the Delta(T) over bar (b) estimated using the two-compartment thermometry models yielding an adjusted estimation (Delta(T) over bar (b_adj)) for the individuals in the VG. When comparing Delta(T) over bar (b_adj) to the Delta(T) over bar (b) derived from calorimetry in the VG, the best performing model used a core/shell weighting of 0.66/0.34 describing 74%, 84%, and 82% of the variation observed in Delta(T) over bar (b) from calorimetry after 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively.

AB  - The thermal denaturation of proteins was evaluated in the natural state of bovine muscle using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The Longissimus lumborum muscle was selected according to ultimate pH (pH) values classified into two groups: low pH with values between 5.4 and 5.8, and intermediate pH with values between 5.81 and 6.19. The muscles were cut and aged at 2 degrees C up to 21 d post mortem. The three maximum temperatures of denaturation (T-max1, T-max2, T-max3) found in muscle were evaluated, showing higher thermal stability in the intermediate pH group, which could be an indicator of protection of proteins against aggregation or enzymatic activity. The thermal behavior of muscle proteins could be defined by biochemical factors that are affected by pH of the muscle, however, further studies are necessary to explain this process, which could have a great impact on the understanding of the fmal tenderness achieved in meat.

AB  - 1. A prototype Estuarine Fish Health Index (EFHI) using biological indicators from multiple levels of biological organization is described. Three test estuaries of similar size and morphology but with different development pressures were sampled for this purpose.
   2. The EFHI integrates the well established Estuarine Fish Community Index (EFCI) developed for South African estuaries, which uses fish community level metrics to assess estuarine condition, with stress responses measured at lower levels of biological organization.
   3. Four sub-organism level biomarkers were used: liver histopathology assessment, acetylcholinesterase and lipid peroxidase assays and an individual fish condition factor analysis. The data from these analyses and the results of the EFCI were integrated to determine if combining these inputs produces a more sensitive and predictive tool for assessing estuarine health than when used in isolation.
   4. Challenges and management applications of this new tool are explored and further studies to improve its prognostic capacity are suggested. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We recorded species abundance and richness of oribatid mites along 16 plots established in semi-deciduous forest fragments in Amazonia. The results were compared with a published dataset consisting of an inventory carried out in 38 plots in the surrounding savanna. Totals of 143 and 91 species were recorded in the forest fragments and savanna, respectively. Sorensen similarity index between both environments was 0.44. Ordination of sites according to oribatid mite species composition showed a clear separation between forest fragments and savanna. Rostrozetes ovulum, Archegozetes longisetosus and Eohypochthonius (Eohypochthonius) becki were abundant and frequent in the forest fragments but exceedingly rare in the savanna. Neoppia (Neoppia) schauenbergi, Pseudoppia sp. C, Microppia sp. A and Cosmochthonius sp. A were limited to the savanna. This study also represents an early step toward knowing which groups of species are exclusive to one or another vegetation type or are sensitive to their inherent environmental conditions.

AB  - To assess the competitive ability of plant species, ecologists describe many species from contrasting habitats with traits that are proxies of ecophysiological functions whereas agronomists describe few species from similar habitats with process-based parameters. Here, we combined both approaches and compared many contrasting crop and weed species of temperate European arable crops in terms of competition for light, to understand weed response to shading by crop canopies and to choose light-competitive crop species and varieties. We (1) measured species parameters that drive light-competition processes in 26 crop and 35 weed species of temperate European arable cropping systems, (2) related the parameter values to species features that are easier to measure or available in databases. Early plant-growth parameters (relative growth rate RGR, initial leaf area) were measured in optimal light and nutrient conditions in a greenhouse with automatic non-destructive measurements. Potential plant morphology in unshaded conditions (specific leaf area SLA, leaf biomass ratio LBR, plant height and width per unit biomass HM and WM, vertical leaf distribution) was measured in garden plots in optimal light and nutrient conditions and harvested at 4-5 stages. Shading response was measured by comparing potential morphology to that of plants grown under shading nets. We confirmed well-known relationships (lower SLA and LBR in legumes vs non-legumes ...), included new species features (base temperature, photosynthetic pathway ...), and established relationships for the new shading-response parameters (weeds respond more to shade than crops, by increasing LBR, SLA, HM and WM ...). Some correlations reported in ecology (RGR vs SLA ...) were not verified on our species pool from arable temperate fields.

AB  - An attempt is made in this research to analyse the nonlinear response of functionally graded material shallow arches with both edges clamped. The arch is resting on a three parameter nonlinear elastic foundation during deformation and is subjected to uniform lateral pressure and uniform temperature rise. Material properties are expressed according to a power law function and are assumed to be temperature dependent. The governing equilibrium equations of the arch are established with the aid of third order shear deformation curved beam theory of Reddy and von Karman type of strain-displacement relations. The obtained equations contain three coupled and nonlinear equations in terms of circumferential displacement, lateral displacement and cross section rotation. Considering the immovable type of edge supports, the equations are reduced to two new coupled and nonlinear equations. These equations are solved using the two step perturbation technique for the case of clamped boundary conditions. Explicit expressions are resulted which yield the deflected shape of the arch as a function of temperature elevation and uniform pressure. It is shown that the arch reveals the snap-through type of instability under certain conditions. The response of the arch is highly affected by the power law index, thermal environment, side to thickness ratio and stiffnesses of the foundation.

AB  - Members of the spider genus Amaurobioides are restricted to the spray zone of rocky marine coasts, where they construct and hunt from silk retreats. Collecting for this study shows these spiders to be distributed around the entire New Zealand coast. A Templeton, Crandall, and Sing (TCS) analysis of the ND1 mitochondrial gene places specimens from the North Island and the northern half of the South Island into a group distinct from Amaurobioides maritima O.P.-Cambridge, 1883, which is restricted to the southern half of the South Island. Females of this northern group exhibit latitude- and temperature-related clines in body length, body mass, and residual index of condition, with larger individuals with greater indices of condition being found at cooler, southern sites. This size cline also appeared in a broader geographical analysis that included Amaurobioides piscator Hogg, 1909 from the sub-Antarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands. Thirteen ND1 haplotypes are represented in the northern group. Both independent contrast analyses and standard regressions of the mean body lengths and mean masses of these haplotypes, and the mean latitudes and temperatures of the sites where haplotypes were present, document a Bergmann's size cline, and provide evidence for an underlying genetic component.

AB  - The behavior of binary composites (BC) containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-1799) and various amounts of microcellulose (MC) in water and biochemical media (soil, compost, water-silt mixture) is studied. The results of the experiment emphasize the complex nature of the biodegradation of the studied composites under natural conditions. Introduction of microcellulose into the polymer matrix of PVA about 60 vol.% is accompanied by the formation of a porous structure that promotes the penetration of water and components of biochemical media into the volume of the material. At the same time, the uniform distribution of the MC fibers creates the effect of a reinforcing filler and allows you to maintain strength even with prolonged soaking of the BC. The achievement of "zero" strength at exposure in water is observed after 2 days, 14 days, 2 months. for BC with a content of MC 0. 80-60, 40-10 vol.%, respectively. After 6 months of incubation in the soil environment, the index of destruction of composites was 0.89, 0.87, 0.95, 0.96 with a degree of filling with microcellulose of 10, 20,40, 80 vol.%, respectively, while there was a lack of fragmentation of the samples. A method of computer colorometry in the dynamics of biodegradation of polysaccharide-filled thermoplastics is proposed to assess the degree of penetration of components of biochemical media into the volume of the material.

AB  - YIELD and its related traits; heading date, hundred kernel weight and kernels number as well as harvest index and biological yield are complex traits that require the concerted action of many genes and are affected by environmental cues. To genetically dissect those traits, 140 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) genotyped with 120 DArT and SSR markers were grown under field conditions in the two consecutive growing seasons 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 in Sohag, Egypt. A part from KN and HI, our results did show significant interaction between genotypes and the growing seasons(GxS). The observed GxS was reflected by an interaction between the significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) and the growing seasons (QTLxS). In total, we report 13 significant QTL associated with HD, KW, SN, HI, and YLD, of which four QTL showed conditional neutrality as they were significant only in the second season. We observed significant negative correlation between HD and SN, HKW and YLD suggesting that selecting for early heading RILs with long grain filling period would increase the total yield, an observation that could be genetically dissected by the QTL cluster on LG-6. The associated markers mapped here can be used in breeding programs to select for favorable adaptive mechanisms, which is very crucial to meet the food requirement of an increasing human population.

AB  - This paper describes the scientific framework established within doctoral and postdoctoral programs designed to contribute to a thorough understanding of the specific processes involved in environmental engineering and protection, as to improve the environmental management and performance in an efficient and sustainable way. A coherent conceptual framework is developed for the analysis and management of some specific approaches in engineering and environmental protection (pollution phenomena, decontamination processes/remediation, reactive and proactive advances), evaluated by applying a set of sustainable development indicators, able to compare, evaluate and develop a set of methods and approaches based on concepts and scientific methods, which will make process analysis solid. The study includes some groups of activities such as: selection and processes analysis considering pollution/remediation based on the behaviour of environmental contaminants, considering the source-pathway-receptor chain, starting with process baseline, target and projection; selection of the most relevant sustainability indicators for the evaluation of prevention, control and remediation of environmental components processes; performance evaluation, thresholds, causal loops, model construction and scenario analysis.
   Various approaches are applied to provide a systematic categorization of socio-economic, environmental and natural resource information under four headings: pressure (stresses or agents of environmental change), state (resources assets, environmental quality), impact and societal response. Indicator integration is also addressed as a means by which individual and quite different indicators in a framework can somehow be viewed together to provide a global view of sustainable development. Sustainability diagrams, as well as indices would ensure clarity for users offering a high level of prominence.

AB  - Animals living in urban areas are exposed to novel and potentially stressful human disturbances. In response to the increased number of stressors in these habitats, they may manifest changes in their immune system, body condition and physiology. Many bird species are negatively impacted by urbanization, whilst other species thrive in urban areas. The capacity to adjust the physiological responses to the stressors associated with urban areas may play a key role in explaining the success of some bird species in these environments. In this study, we compared indicators of physiological stress response and body condition in free-living Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia) inhabiting urban and rural areas. We calculated a scaled index of body condition, and assessed leukocyte profiles and the heterophil/lymphocyte ratios of chicks and adults. We found no significant differences in these parameters between individuals from rural and urban areas. Chicks showed higher relative leukocyte counts than adults, which may be associated with ontogenetic development and immune system activation processes.

AB  - In the short-term, reproductive expenditure has repercussions for survival and future reproductive output. In long-lived seabirds, parents are expected to adjust their reproductive investment based on their physiological and immune status and then respond to the needs of their offspring without incurring additional costs. However, the impacts of parental expenditures on physiological and immune status have not been well explored. We compared the foraging effort (number and duration of foraging trips), time at nest and physiological status (plasma metabolites, heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, creatine kinase (CK) activity) and body condition index (BCI) of blue-footed boobies subjected to experimentally increased or decreased breeding demands. When parental reproductive demands were increased, adults made more foraging trips and decreased their time at the nest. The increases in adult physical activity were reflected in higher levels of creatine kinase/total protein (CK/TP, U/g) and higher H/L ratios, indicating that adjustments in foraging effort were reflected in their physiological status. When parental reproductive demands were reduced, parents adjusted their level of effort according to the lower needs of their offspring; as a result, their overall physiological status was greater than that of the controls, showing lower CK/TP levels and H/L ratios. Our findings indicate that parents modified their foraging effort in response to variation in the food demands of the brood to maintain reproductive value, but this adjustment had consequences for physiological status in both costs and benefits. Blue-footed boobies inhabit upwelling systems where they experience high environmental variability throughout their life span. Thus, the ability to adjust breeding effort may buffer breeding success under different scenarios, with short-term physiological expenditures possibly related to long-term survival.

AB  - In this study, wild three-spined sticklebacks were sampled every six weeks, between April and October, in a low contaminated stream. For all fish, physiological indexes, such as condition factor, hepato-, gonado- and nephro-somatic index were calculated to determine fish condition and reproductive status. Moreover, a set of biomarkers including biotransformation enzymes, oxidative stress parameters, neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption markers was measured. The results allowed to determine biomarker variability due to fish gender or sampling season. For example, 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity, glutathione peroxidase as well as vitellogenin and spiggin exhibited strong gender differences. Conversely, lipoperoxidation and acethyleholinesterase activity were characterised by a lack of gender and seasonal variation, and can be considered as more robust parameters for a field application. The present work allowed to establish practical guideline for biomarker measurements in wild sticklebacks and to define a reference system which can be used to analyze variations in future monitoring studies.

AB  - Non-Newtonian fluid flow in porous and fractured media is of considerable technical and environmental interest. Here, the flow of a non-Newtonian fluid in a variable aperture fracture is studied theoretically, experimentally and numerically. We consider a shear-thinning power-law fluid with flow behavior index n. The natural logarithm of the fracture aperture is a two-dimensional, spatially homogeneous and correlated Gaussian random field. An experimental device has been conceived and realized to allow the validation of the theory, and several tests are conducted with Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids and different combinations of parameters to validate the model. For Newtonian fluids, experimental results match quite well the theoretical predictions, mostly with a slight overestimation. For non-Newtonian fluids, the discrepancy between experiments and theory is larger, with an underestimation of the experimental flow rate. We bear in mind the high shear-rates involved in the experiments, covering a large range where simple models seldom are effective in reproducing the process, and possible interferences like slip at the wall. For all test conditions, the comparison between analytical and numerical model is fairly good.

AB  - By using higher-order shear deformation beam theory (HSDBT), free vibration analysis of functionally graded (FG) spinning cylindrical beam subjected to thermal environment is performed. A new displacement field for hollow circular cylindrical beam is proposed that keeps the shear stress to be free at both inner and outer surfaces of the beam. The present formulation includes all possible terms of linear equations of spinning beam such as centripetal and Coriolis forces. Material properties are assumed temperature dependent and graded in the thickness direction. To discretize the system, the Rayleigh-Ritz method, which is an efficient and accurate approximation method, is used. The convergence of the method is verified, and the results are compared with available solutions in the literature. We investigate the effects of spinning speed, temperature dependence of material properties, and material property graded index on the natural frequency parameter of the FG cylindrical beam with different boundary conditions.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. The Dniester Regional Landscape Park (DRLP) is a natural protected area of Ukraine that extends along the right bank. Dniester, within the Tlumatsky and Gorodenkovsky districts of Ivano-Frankivsk region, covers an area of 19 656 ha. It was founded by the decisions of the IvanoFrankivsk Regional Council on July 15, 1993 and December 3, 2016, when the park was named after Sergiy Didych. The objectives of the park are: conservation of valuable natural and floristic-cultural complexes; creation of conditions for efficient tourism and recreation; adherence to the regime of protection of protected objects; promotion of ecological and educational work; maintaining an overall environmental balance in the region.
   The research methodology performed by the specialists of the Department of Ecology of the Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas was based on a component assessment of the ecological state of the geological environment, relief, water resources, atmospheric air, soil and vegetation, sociosphere and technosphere by selection construction of databases and ecological and technological-geochemical maps of the state of the environment.
   As a result of studies of the geological environment, geomorphosphere and soil cover, their changes under the influence of natural (planar, linear and bright erosion, villages, landslides, landslides, landslides, etc.) and technogenic (quarries, drilling wells, etc.) factors are still negligible - from 0.0015 to 0.04% of the area and volume in the model areas. Surface water pollution in the Dniester River and its tributaries is average, and groundwater - from normal to satisfactory. Only in places where the polluted water is discharged is it difficult and unsatisfactory. Ecological condition of atmospheric air, precipitation of rain and snow, vegetation cover - normal and only about mm. Interpreter and Gorodenko - satisfactory and complex. On the whole, according to the assessment of all environmental components, the environment of the DRLP is still in good condition, but requires the implementation of the measures recommended by the authors.
   The scientific novelty of the environmental research of the DLRP is that the authors of the article first performed their own field environmental studies on the monitoring system of each component of the landscape, and the results using GIS technologies to build a summary ecological map.
   The practical significance of the work is to provide the DPRL with a scientific basis for the creation of a permanent ecological monitoring network and the dissemination of the methods of ecological assessment developed by the authors to other nature reserves and sites - nature monuments, reserves, national nature parks, nature reserves, biosphere reserves and reserves.

AB  - Stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) have been used extensively to trace nutrients from Pacific salmon, but salmon transfer more than carbon and nitrogen to stream ecosystems, such as phosphorus, minerals, proteins, and lipids. To examine the importance of these nutrients, metrics other than isotopes need to be considered, particularly when so few studies have made direct links between these nutrients and how they affect riparian organisms. Our study specifically examined delta C-13 and delta N-15 of riparian organisms from salmon and non-salmon streams in Idaho, USA, at different distances from the streams, and examined whether the quality of riparian plants and the body condition of invertebrates varied with access to these nutrients. Overall, quality and condition metrics did not mirror stable isotope patterns. Most notably, all riparian organisms exhibited elevated delta N-15 in salmon streams, but also with proximity to both stream types suggesting that both salmon and landscape factors may affect delta N-15. The amount of nitrogen incorporated from Pacific salmon was low for all organisms (<20%) and did not correlate with measures of quality or condition, probably due to elevated delta N-15 at salmon streams reflecting historical salmon runs instead of current contributions. Salmon runs in these Idaho streams have been declining, and associated riparian ecosystems have probably seen about a 90% reduction in salmon-derived nitrogen since the 1950s. In addition, our results support those of other studies that have cautioned that inferences from natural abundance isotope data, particularly in conjunction with mixing models for salmon-derived nutrient percentage estimates, may be confounded by biogeochemical transformations of nitrogen, physiological processes, and even historical legacies of nitrogen sources. Critically, studies should move beyond simply describing isotopic patterns to focusing on the consequences of salmon-derived nutrients by quantifying the condition and fitness of organisms putatively using those resources.

AB  - Pearl millet marker-assisted selection (MAS) programs targeting adaption to variable postflowering moisture environments would benefit from quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that improve grain yield across the full range of postflowering moisture conditions, rather that just in drought-stressed environments. This research was undertaken to identify such QTLS from extensive (12-environment) phenotyping data set that included both stressed and unstressed postflowering environments. Genetic materials were test crosses of 79 F-2-derived F-4 progenies from mapping population based on widely adapted maintainer line (ICMB 841) x a postflowering drought-tolerant maintainer (863B). Three QTLs (on linkage group [LG] 2, LG 3, and LG 4) were identified as primary candidates for the MAS for improved grain yield across environments, and with QTLs for the harvest index across environments, and with QTLs for both grain number and individual mass under severe terminal stress. Neither had a significant QTL x environment interaction, indicating that their predicted effects should occur across a broad range of available moisture environments. We have estimated the benefits in grain yeild and accompanying changes in yield components and partioning indices that would be expected as a result of incorporating these QTLs into other genetic backgrounds by MAS.

AB  - Connectivity between estuarine fish nurseries and coastal adult habitats can be affected by variations in juvenile growth and survival. Condition indices are renowned proxies of juvenile nutritional status and growth rates and are valuable tools to assess habitat quality. Biochemical (RNA:DNA ratio) and morphometric (Fulton's condition factor K) condition indices were determined in juveniles of Solea solea, Solea senegalensis, Platichthys flesus, Diplodus vulgarls and Dicentrarchus labrax collected in putative nursery areas of nine estuaries along the Portuguese coast (Minho, Douro, Ria de Aveiro, Mondego, Tejo, Sado, Mira, Ria Formosa and Guadiana) in the Spring and Summer of two consecutive years (2005 and 2006) with distinct climatic characteristics. Individual condition showed significant variation amongst species. The combined use of both condition indices highlighted the low correlation between them and that RNA:DNA had a higher sensitivity. RNA:DNA varied between years but overall the site relative patterns in condition were maintained from one year to the other. Higher RNA:DNA values were found in Spring than in Summer in most species. Intra-estuarine variation also occurred in several cases. Species specific trends in the variability of condition amongst estuaries were highlighted. Some estuaries had higher juvenile condition for more than one species but results did not reveal an identical trend for all species and sites, hindering the hypotheses of one estuarine nursery promoting superior growth for all present species. Significant correlations were found between condition indices, juvenile densities and environmental variables (water temperature, salinity and depth) in the estuarine nurseries. These influenced juvenile nutritional condition and growth, contributing to the variability in estuarine nursery habitat quality. Management and conservation wise, interest in multi-species approaches is reinforced as assessments based on a single species may not reflect the overall nursery habitat quality.

AB  - Some domestic waste disposal sites (DWDS) accumulate enormous amounts of food that humans discard. This food resource is exploited by different species whose population dynamics have as a result been altered. The effects of feeding on human waste on individual health parameters such as body condition are still unknown. Traditionally, body condition in wildlife has been assessed using morphological indices based on size and weight. Expanding the range of indices to include the analysis of indicators at the physiological level can provide a more comprehensive picture of the animals' health status. In this work, we studied how different amounts of waste consumption (assessed using stable isotope analysis) affect nestling health and body condition in an expanding population of the endangered Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus). We used morphometric and physiological approaches, including plasma biochemistry, antioxidant defences and oxidative stress biomarkers. The results of the multivariate redundancy analysis and variance partitioning showed that the proportion of diet originating from DWDS is the main factor explaining physiological indicators in the studied vulture population. Nestlings that were fed on food from DWDS had lower levels of vitamins (e.g. alpha-tocopherol) and carotenoids (zeaxanthin and lutein), which have important functions as antioxidant defences, immunostimulant properties and ornamental purposes. Nevertheless, nestlings that were fed on food from DWDS were better nourished and experienced fewer food shortages than individuals not fed using this resource, which had lower levels of cholesterol. Possibly due to the easy access to food, breeding pairs using DWDS could have fewer difficulties in feeding their nestlings and thus could engender more regular brood sizes than those not exploiting this type of resource. Our integrative approach using diverse components was crucial for a reliable assessment of health and body condition in Egyptian Vulture nestlings and its relationship to the consumption of food derived from human-altered environments.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the seasonal cycle of condition, nutrition and gonad development, as well as the magnitude of seasonal variations in energy content of somatic and gonad tissues in juveniles, males and females of Sclater's barbel, Barbus sclateri, from the upper Guadalete River (south Spain). The influence of reproductive cycle on somatic changes was also investigated and discussed. Measurements of condition factor (K), somatic index (SI). gonadosomatic index (GSI) and somatic and gonad energy content (J g(-1) dw) were made in individual specimens taken from the Guadalete River monthly for 12 months. This freshwater ecosystem is characterised by strong seasonal fluctuations in water and flow level, temperature and food supply. It was found that in general juveniles, males and females of barbel exhibited a similar condition, nutrition and somatic energy cycle throughout the year, with the highest values in spring and the lowest in summer. Depletion of K, SI and somatic energy storage from spring until mid-summer seems to be associated with high metabolic demands during this period, and in adult fish also with spawning-related activity. The gonad index and energy content of the gonad were the highest in April and the lowest in summer for both sexes. Spawning took place during late spring - early summer, with fish quiescent by mid summer. The energy required for ovarian development (3970 J g(-1) dw) was greater than the one for testes development (2763 J g(-1) dw). Data on gonad energy content indicated a period (March to April) of intense energy accumulation (64% males and 37% females) which was related to the decline in the average somatic energy content in males and females. The somatic energy content was linearly related to K and SI. In the same way, GSI correlated positively with gonad energy. Linear trends were found between somatic parameters (K, SI and energy content) and gonad parameters (GSI and energy content).

AB  - Summer mortalities have been observed in French shellfish areas (including Normandy) since 1994, but origin of this syndrome remains unclear and is suspected to be caused by a combination of several interacting extrinsic (biotic and abiotic) and intrinsic (genetic, physiological, immunological) factors. The French research program, MOREST aimed to identify the origin of oyster summer mortality along the French coast, focusing on the interactions between oysters, their pathogens, and the environment. The present study analyzed spatio-temporal variation in growth, condition and mortality in spat, and half-grown and market-sized oysters reared from February 2000 to October 2003 at six stations within two different areas in the Bay of Veys, Normandy: Grandcamp (GR), and Gefosse (GE) that is more estuarine. These biological parameters were compared between years, age groups, and areas. Results showed that shell growth was significantly lower in the station highest on the shore and similar in the four other sites, whereas tissue growth and condition index were higher in the Gefosse area. Results also showed large interannual, interage, seasonal and spatial variation in oyster mortality. In 2001, mortalities were markedly higher than in other years and all batches and sites were affected by high mortality rates. Moreover oysters suffered much higher mortalities in their second and third years than as spat, and the difference between age classes was accentuated when mortality was high. Increases in mortality occurred when the gonad was most extensively developed and the peak coincided with the spawning and postspawning periods when gonad volume began to decrease. Spatial variability showed that mortality was higher in Gefosse than Grandcamp. Chronology and spatial variations in mortality highlighted the importance of timing and confirmed that mass mortalities may be closely linked to reproduction. The risk seems to be associated with high reproductive effort, partial spawning, and/or slow gonad resorption. Spatial variation also suggests that the study sites experience varying degrees of stress caused by biological changes and probable differences in water quality reflecting the influence of freshwater input in Gefosse where mortality is higher.

AB  - The paper explores two types of indicators: Odum's 24 attributes for describing the state of an ecosystem based on its maturity; and the fishing-in-balance (FIB) index for describing how ecosystem exploitation changes over time. Application of the FIB index to the Gulf of Thailand and the North Atlantic fisheries, describing the development in fisheries catches and their trophic levels over time, reveals that the index is straightforward to parameterize and adds an ecological dimension to fisheries catch series; it is a useful indicator for assessing the impact of fisheries on ecosystems.

AB  - The use of effluent water from a turbot (Psetta,,maxima) farm for culturing Venerupis pullastra juveniles (seed) was evaluated. Reproductive activity, growth, condition, and survival rate were investigated. After a 2-mo acclimation period, clam seed (mean live weight = 360 +/- 18 mg so, mean length = 14 +/- 1.7 mm SD) were grown from June 30 to November 20 of 1993 in three different flow-rates of wastewater. Thirty individuals were sampled from each tank biweekly. Stability in the main environmental parameters of the effluent (temperature, salinity, oxygen, etc.) provided good conditions fur seed growth. After the acclimation period, mortality was less than 18%. Growth-rate coefficients (K values) of V. pullastra were correlated positively with increase in the effluent flow and were significantly higher than in the control tanks (K = .001). Shell length (27.4 +/- 1.8 mm so) and, in particular, live weight (2,907.6 +/- 530.9 mg sD) were highest in tanks with a now of 4 vol/h and these tanks also produced the fastest growth rate (K = .0445). In tanks with flows of 1 vol/h and 2 vol/h, final weights and lengths were 1,823 +/- 273.2 mg sD, 23 +/- 1.8 mm sD and 2,361 +/- 351.4 mg sn, and 25 +/- 1.4 mm so, respectively. Condition indices of clams followed a similar pattern reaching final values ranging from is to 28 and were significantly higher. than in the control tanks. High condition index values might he due mostly to the high amount of food present in the effluent water throughout the experiment. Stereological and histological techniques were used to determine gametogenic activity. Successive spawnings and recovery of the gonad, which are characteristic of this species, were noted in clams in experimental tanks. However, they occurred in a shorter time period. Results suggest that it is possible to rear V. pullastra seed under these special culture conditions and that a better balance between volume of effluent used and clam productivity was achieved with a flow rate of 2 vol/h.

AB  - Background
   Multiple host introductions to the same non-native environment have the potential to complete life cycles of parasites incidentally transported with them. Our goal was to identify a recently detected parasitic flatworm in the invasive Brown Treesnake (Boiga irregularis) on the remote Pacific island of Guam. We considered possible factors influencing parasite transmission, and tested for correlations between infection status and potential indicators of host fitness. We used genetic data from the parasite and information about the native ranges of other possible non-native hosts to hypothesize how it arrived on Guam and how its life cycle may be currently supported.
   Methods
   We identified the parasite by comparing larval morphology and mtDNA sequences with other Pseudophyllid tapeworms. We assessed probability of infection in individual snakes using logistic regression and examined different factors influencing presence of parasites in hosts.
   Results
   We identified the parasite as the pseudophyllid cestode Spirometra erinaceieuropaei, with all sampled worms from multiple snakes sharing a single mtDNA haplotype. Infection appears to be limited to the only freshwater watershed on the island, where infection prevalence was high (77.5%). Larger snakes had a higher probability of being infected, consistent with the chronic nature of such infections. While infection status was positively correlated with body condition, infected snakes tended to have lower intra-peritoneal fat body mass, potentially indicating a negative effect on energy stores.
   Conclusions
   We discovered that B. irregularis inhabiting a small area of forested habitat in a freshwater watershed on Guam are often infected by a novel parasite of Asian origin. While further work is needed, this species of Spirometra, itself a non-native species, likely depends on a suite of recently introduced hosts from different parts of the world to complete the life cycle. This baseline study provides little evidence of any effects on host fitness, but additional data are needed to more thoroughly explore the consequences of infection in this invasive snake population.

TI  - Assessing the Synchronicity and Nature of Australian State Business Cycles
T2  - ECONOMIC RECORD
LA  - English
KW  - MODEL
AB  - This paper assesses the synchronicity and nature of Australian state business cycles. To this end, I develop a time-varying parameter panel Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) with a novel common stochastic volatility factor in the error structure, which is estimated in an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The common stochastic volatility factor reveals that macroeconomic volatility was more pronounced during the Asian financial crisis than during the more recent global financial crisis. Next, the panel BVAR's common, state- and variable-specific indicators capture several interesting economic facts. In particular, the fluctuations of the common indicator closely follow the trend line of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development composite leading indicators for Australia, making it a good proxy for nationwide business cycle fluctuations. Furthermore, despite significant co-movements of Australian state and territory business cycles during times of economic contractions, the state indicators suggest that the average degree of synchronisation across the Australian state and territory cycles in the 2000s is only half of that in the 1990s. Given that aggregate macroeconomic activity is determined by cumulative activity of each of the states, the results suggests that the federal government should consider granting state governments greater autonomy in handling state-specific cyclical fluctuations.

AB  - Aphanius iberus is an endemic cyprinodontoid fish species of Mediterranean ponds in danger of extinction. In this study, we studied some abiotic and biotic factors that can influence A. iberus's size structure and density in Mediterranean brackish ponds. We sampled fish using fyke nets in 10 ponds of Emporda (Spain) during the spring season. Our results showed that a better ecological status (according to the Water Quality of Lentic and Shallow Ecosystems (QAELS) index), pond's depth and pond's isolation (reflected by an increase in total nitrogen) were related to larger individual sizes and more size-diverse populations. Increasing the salinity is known to help the euryhaline A. iberus acting as a refuge from competitors. Nevertheless, our results showed that higher conductivities had a negative effect on A. iberus's size structure, leading to a decrease in the mean and maximum size of the fish. Fish abundance (expressed as captures per unit of effort (CPUE)) seemed to increase with increasing the pond's depth and total nitrogen (the latter reflecting pond isolation). In conclusion, our results suggest that achieving a better pond ecological status may be important for the conservation of endangered A. iberus, because better size-structured populations (i.e., larger mean and average lengths) were found at higher water quality conditions.

AB  - In this chapter, we introduce digital holographic microscopy (DHM) as a marker-free method to determine the refractive index of single, spherical cells in suspension. The refractive index is a conclusive measure in a biological context. Cell conditions, such as differentiation or infection, are known to yield significant changes in the refractive index. Furthermore, the refractive index of biological tissue determines the way it interacts with light. Besides the biological relevance of this interaction in the retina, a lot of methods used in biology, including microscopy, rely on light-tissue or light-cell interactions. Hence, determining the refractive index of cells using DHM is valuable in many biological applications. This chapter covers the main topics that are important for the implementation of DHM: setup, sample preparation, and analysis. First, the optical setup is described in detail including notes and suggestions for the implementation. Following that, a protocol for the sample and measurement preparation is explained. In the analysis section, an algorithm for the determination of quantitative phase maps is described. Subsequently, all intermediate steps for the calculation of the refractive index of suspended cells are presented, exploiting their spherical shape. In the last section, a discussion of possible extensions to the setup, further measurement configurations, and additional analysis methods are given. Throughout this chapter, we describe a simple, robust, and thus easily reproducible implementation of DHM. The different possibilities for extensions show the diverse fields of application for this technique.

AB  - A spatial synoptic climatological index is developed that both characterizes the dynamic and thermodynamic surface weather regime and is capable of assessing and analysing the impact of synoptic-scale variations on numerous environmental parameters.  Based upon surface weather data for the contiguous USA for 1984, daily maps are produced that show those areas under the influence of similar weather conditions. The index is developed by applying principal components analysis to a daily matrix of 141 stations by 24 weather elements (chosen to represent the thermal-moisture and surface flow characteristics).  The resulting component scores are grouped using a two-stage clustering technique. This yields a map showing lobes of air having relatively homogeneous weather characteristics.  These lobes (clusters) are spatially coherent and correspond closely to surface weather map features.
   To allow for daily tracking of the clusters and identification days or weeks after disappearance, the means of each of the daily clusters are grouped across days.  The resulting 90-cluster categorization describes all of the major synoptic situations that occurred in 1984.  Some of the common categories include maritime and continental polar air masses, frontal passages, and continental high dominance.  These groups demonstrate seasonality, regionality, and high within-category similarity.  The resulting maps are useful since they are surface weather maps yet add clarity for environmental interpretation.

AB  - In the past decades, sugarcane production in Brazil has expanded rapidly to meet increasing ethanol demand. The large majority of this expansion occurred in Sao Paulo state. We used an integrated approach considering location-specific biophysical characteristics to determine the environmental impacts of sugarcane expansion and their spatial variation in Sao Paulo state (2004-2015). The included environmental impacts are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, biodiversity, soil erosion, and water quantity. All impacts were integrated into a single environmental performance index to determine trade-offs between impacts. Our results show a strong spatial variation in environmental impacts and trade-offs between them. The magnitude and direction of these impacts are mostly driven by the type of land use change and by the heterogeneity of the biophysical conditions. Areas where expansion of sugar cane has resulted in mostly negative environmental impacts are located in the center and east of the state (related to the change of shrublands, eucalyptus, and forest), while areas where sugar cane expansion has resulted in positive impacts are located in the center-west and north (related to the change of annual crops). Identifying areas with mainly positive and negative impacts enables the development of strategies to mitigate negative effects and enhance positive ones for future sugarcane expansion.

AB  - Field endocrinology research through the quantification of glucocorticoids or stress hormones in free-living wildlife is crucial for assessing their physiological responses towards pervasive environmental changes. Urinary corticosterone metabolite (UCM) enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) has been validated for numerous amphibian species as a non-invasive measure of physiological stress. Body-condition indices (BCIs) have also been widely used in amphibians as an indirect measure of animal health. Field endocrinology research on amphibian species in Asia is limited. In this study, we validated a UCM EIA in a pen-urban sub-population of the common Asian toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus) in Pune, Maharashtra, India. We determined the baseline levels of UCMs in male (n = 39) and female (n = 19) toads. Secondly, we used a standard capture handling protocol to quantify changes in UCMs during short-term captivity. We also determined BCIs in the male and female toads using Fulton's index (K) and residual condition index (RCI). The results showed that mean baseline levels of UCMs were significantly higher in male toads than in females. There was no significant change in mean levels of UCMs of males and females between capture and captivity (0-12 h). This highlights plausible habituation of the species to the pen-urban environment. Associations between UCMs with BCIs (K and R) were positive in male toads but negative in females. In conclusion, our UCMs EIA can be applied with BCIs to assess health of the Asian toads. We also suggest that direct fitness parameters such as sperm and oocyte quality, reproductive ecology and immunocompetence measurements should be applied in combination with these conservation physiology tools to quantify the fitness consequences of pervasive environmental changes on native amphibians.

AB  - Bivalve histopathology has become an important tool in aquatic toxicology, having been implemented in many biomonitoring programmes worldwide. However, there are various gaps in the knowledge of many sentinel organisms and the interference of confounding factors. This work aimed (i) to develop a detailed semi-quantitative histopathological index of the digestive gland and gonad of the Mytilus galloprovincialis mussel collected from five sites contaminated with distinct patterns of organic and inorganic toxicants along the Basque coast (SE Bay of Biscay) and (ii) to investigate whether seasonal variability and parasitosis act as confounding factors. A total of twenty-three histopathological alterations were analysed in the digestive gland and gonad following a weighed condition index approach. The alterations were integrated into a single value for a better understanding of the mussels' health status. The digestive gland was consistently more damaged than the gonad. Mussels from the most impacted sites endured the most significant deleterious effects showing inflammation-related alterations together with digestive tubule atrophy and necrosis. Neoplastic diseases were scarce, with only a few cases of fibromas (benign neoplasia). In contrast, in moderately or little impacted sites, contamination levels did not cause significant tissue damage. However, parasites contributed to overestimating the values of histopathological indices (i.e. more severe tissue damage) in mussels from little impacted sites, whilst the opposite occurred in mussels from highly polluted sites. Accordingly, inter-site differences were more pronounced in autumn when natural physiological responses of advanced maturation stages did not interfere in the histological response. In conclusion, although seasonal variability and parasitosis mask the response of histopathological indices, this biomonitoring approach may provide good sensitivity for assessing the health status of mussels if fluctuations of these confounding factors are considered.

AB  - There is a growing concern over change in vegetation dynamics and drought patterns with the increasing climate variability and warming trends in Africa, particularly in the semiarid regions of East Africa. Here, several geospatial techniques and datasets were used to analyze the spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics in response to climate (precipitation and temperature) and drought in Eritrea from 2000 to 2017. A pixel-based trend analysis was performed, and a Pearson correlation coefficient was computed between vegetation indices and climate variables. In addition, vegetation condition index (VCI) and standard precipitation index (SPI) classifications were used to assess drought patterns in the country. The results demonstrated that there was a decreasing NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) slope at both annual and seasonal time scales. In the study area, 57.1% of the pixels showed a decreasing annual NDVI trend, while the significance was higher in South-Western Eritrea. In most of the agro-ecological zones, the shrublands and croplands showed decreasing NDVI trends. About 87.16% of the study area had a positive correlation between growing season NDVI and precipitation (39.34%, p < 0.05). The Gash Barka region of the country showed the strongest and most significant correlations between NDVI and precipitation values. The specific drought assessments based on VCI and SPI summarized that Eritrea had been exposed to recurrent droughts of moderate to extreme conditions during the last 18 years. Based on the correlation analysis and drought patterns, this study confirms that low precipitation was mainly attributed to the slowly declining vegetation trends and increased drought conditions in the semi-arid region. Therefore, immediate action is needed to minimize the negative impact of climate variability and increasing aridity in vegetation and ecosystem services.

AB  - The increase in nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) loadings from agriculture nonpoint source pollution has been one of the major sources of water pollution or eutrophication. Comparisons between sewage sludge and livestock manure for nutrients loading, ecological risk and agricultural using potential were investigated in Taiyuan metropolitan area of Shanxi to determine which one was more suitable for agricultural using in the studying area. The mean organic matter and nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in sewage sludge were 350.12 g/kg, 36.14 g/kg, 21.50 g/kg and 12.00 g/kg, and the contents of organic matter and nutrients (N+P K) all exceeded the specified values formulated by Disposal of Sludge from Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant -Control Standards for Agricultural Use (CJ/T 309-2009). In contrast to livestock manure, sewage sludge had a comparable advantage for agricultural using due to the contents of organic matter and nutrients as well as the proportion of N:P:K. The mean loadings of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium can be ranked in the following decreasing orders as N>P>K for sewage sludge, and N>K>P for livestock manure, and all mean loadings of nitrogen. phosphorus and potassium did not exceed the ecological safety threshold values of 125 kg/ha"a, 62.5 kg/ha"a and 62.5 kg/ha"a, which were published by the Ecological County, Ecological City and Ecological Province Construction Index (revised draft). besides the mean loading of phosphorus for sewage sludge. In particular, loadings of nitrogen and potassium were higher for livestock than sewage sludge, and loadings of phosphorus were higher for sewage sludge than livestock in different districts. According to the mean values of the monomial ecological risk index, nutrients can be ranked in the decreasing order of P>N>K for sewage sludge and K>N>P for livestock manure, and they were all below the safety threshold value of 0.5. In general, the ecological risks of nitrogen and potassium were higher for livestock manure than sewage sludge, and those of phosphorus were higher for sewage sludge than livestock manure. The mean potentials of agricultural using of sewage sludge and livestock manure were 1.07 t/ha"a and 4.59 t/ha"a respectively; livestock manure had higher potential than sewage sludge; and the restrictive factor were nitrogen and phosphorus for sewage sludge, nitrogen and potassium for livestock manure. In detail, the districts having negative potential were more for livestock manure using than sewage sludge using. furthermore, the negative potential for sewage sludge using was determined by phosphorus, and for livestock manure were all determined by potassium. Combining all the analysis with the local soil condition of low nitrogen, low phosphorus and high potassium, sewage sludge was more suitable for agricultural using than livestock manure in the ecological safety manner in the studying area.

AB  - Bioindicators are useful for determining nutrient regimes in marine environments, but their ability to evaluate corals reefs in different ecological states is poorly understood. The precision, availability and congruency of eight potential bioindicators (brown macroalgae, green macroalgae, turf algae, cyanobacteria, soft corals, zoanthids, sponges, and sediment) and their stable isotopic and elemental signatures (delta N-15, delta C-13, %N, %C, and C:N Ratio) were assessed across 21 reefs in the Inner Seychelles. The coefficient of variation (CoV) for delta N-15 showed that green and brown macroalgae were highly precise (2.47 +/- 0.95, n = 11; 4.68 +/- 1.33, n = 16, respectively), though were less common on coral-mortality reefs relative to macroalgal-dominated ones. Zoanthids were also highly precise for delta N-15 (2.98 +/- 1.20), but were more readily available regardless of reef state (n = 18). Congruency was low among these indicators, suggesting that different physiological mechanisms for nutrient processing have a stronger influence on a bioindicator's effectiveness than reef state.

AB  - Vallisneria spiralis, a widely distributed wetland plant, was used to reveal how the light intensity at the top of the plant, plant morphology and antioxidant enzyme activity respond to different hydrologic conditions from Lake Poyang, China. By designing a laboratory experiment simulating historical water levels of low, normal and high wetland plant submersion, this study aimed to elucidate the effects of different levels of flooding on growth and antioxidant enzyme activity for V. spiralis. The results showed that the plant crown light intensity of the treated group and control group (CG) first decreased and then increased along with the seasonal variation of the water level. The maximum and minimum values of the plant crown light intensity were observed in April and July, respectively. Similar to the CG, V. spiralis from the normal and low water level (LWL) groups was measured and had higher plant height growth in the flooding period from May to June, and the entire plant biomass also showed a steady growth trend in the same period. However, the plant growth of the high water level (LWL) group was lower during the whole simulation period, with negative growth in July. Antioxidant enzyme activities changed with the seasonal temperature, and the activity of the CC showed a rising trend. Compared with those of the CC, the antioxidant enzyme activities of the HWL group showed a 'bell shaped' trend, which was first significantly induced and then significantly inhibited. In addition, the peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities from the LWL group in April were also significantly induced. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) index showed that a comprehensive biological index could well reflect the effects of seasonal water levels in Poyang Lake on the growth of the wetland plant V. spiralis. This study indicated that high flooding levels had the strongest negative effect on the growth and enzyme activity of the submerged plant V. spiralis.

AB  - Important Cd contamination has been observed in the Gironde estuary, France, but other metallic and organic pollutants are also present. Since sediment is well-known as a major compartment for the storage of numerous pollutants in aquatic environments, its contribution as a source of pollutants for the biota has been examined according to different methodologies. Geochemical studies have provided estimates of Cd mobility particularly with decreasing pHs and increasing salinity, a result in agreement with the relative abundance of exchangeable Cd and Cd bound to carbonates shown by sequential extraction. When in vitro assays tended to be more realistic with regard to the digestion process in bivalves, Cd extraction at low pH was lowered but was still important compared to Cu or Zn. Moreover, toxicity of Gironde sediments to copepod and sea urchin larval stages (not to oyster larvae) brought indirect evidence of the bioavailability of sediment-bound pollutants. Except the aromatic compound perylene, bioaccumulation in bivalves concerns mainly metals. In oysters they were found preferentially in the soluble phase and, in the cytosol, a strong relationship between cadmium and metallothionein-like proteins has been shown, suggesting a detoxication process in this species. This hypothesis is in agreement with the fact that neither cytopathological effects in gills and digestive glands nor marked changes of condition index were observed. On the other hand, no changes in MTLP levels in mussels were induced by metal accumulation in individuals transplanted from a comparatively unpolluted area (Bay of Bourgneuf). The stability of GST activity may be related to a poor accumulation of aromatic compounds. Changes in MDA concentration, AChE and catalase activities are discussed. Mobility, bioavailability of pollutants, significant responses of biomarkers suggest a potential environmental hazard. However, since interspecific differences occur, is the risk at the level of the whole estuarine ecosystem equilibrium or is it limited to a small number of species?.

AB  - Experimental studies on Dover sole larvae were carried out in order to characterize their nutritional status at sea. Criteria were obtained from histological studies (serial sections of the digestive system) and from analyses of lipid components (triacyglycerols and sterols), and were compared with sea-caught larvae from field studies (March-April 1987-88-89). At the same time, age estimates were obtained using otolith readings. These age estimates gave the mean duration of the different larval stages for each cruise, as well as the mean age variation at metamorphosis. Within-season and annual differences of the duration of the larval period were observed and correlated, within fixed limits, to variations of the sea-water temperature in the spawning period (in 1987, the spawning season starting during a ''cold'' winter in 1988 and 1989, the spawning season starting during a ''cool'' winter) and to the nutritional status of the larvae. The histological criteria support the possible existence of a ''critical period'' (Hjort's hypothesis) beginning at the first-feeding stage. At sea, this critical situation, often noticed even before the yolk-sac was exhausted, can last about 10 days and likewise delay the age at metamorphosis. Survival estimates have sustained this result. In field studies, the average daily mortality rate decreased from 25 %, during the embryonic period, to 4.6 % once the first-feeding stage was completed. After this stage, the pelagic larvae improved their nutritional condition and increased their level of energy supplies in glycogen and triacylglycerols. In a marine environment, larval recovery was slow, resulting in a lesser supply storage than with laboratory-reared larvae. Both histological criteria and the triacylglycerol to sterol ratio nevertheless indicated this trend to recovery which seemed necessary prior to undergoing metamorphosis. As long as there is no supply storage, metamorphosis is delayed or cannot take place. In the field, metamorphosing larvae had therefore no critical nutritional status.

AB  - 1. Biodiversity indices are widely used to summarize changes in the distribution and abundance of multiple species and measure progress towards management targets. However, the sensitivity of biodiversity indices to the data, landscape classification and conservation values underpinning them are rarely interrogated. There are limited studies to help scientists and land managers use biodiversity indices in the presence of fire and vegetation succession.
   2. The geometric mean of species' relative abundance or occurrence (G) is a biodiversity index that can be used to determine the mix of post-fire vegetation that maximizes biodiversity. We explored the sensitivity of G to (1) type of biodiversity data, (2) representation of ecosystem states, (3) expression of conservation values, and (4) uncertainty in species' response to landscape structure. Our case study is an area of fire-prone woodland in southern Australia where G is used in fire management planning. We analysed three datasets to determine the fire responses of 170 bird, mammal and reptile species.
   3. G and fire management targets were sensitive to the species included in the analysis. The optimal mix of vegetation successional states for threatened birds was more narrowly defined than the optimal mix for all species combined. G was less sensitive to successional classification (i.e. number of states); although classifications of increasing complexity provided additional insights into desirable levels of heterogeneity.
   4. Weighting species by conservation status or endemism influenced the mix of vegetation states that maximized biodiversity. When a higher value was placed on threatened species the importance of late successional vegetation was emphasized.
   5. Representing variation in individual species' response to vegetation structure made it clearer when a decrease in G was likely to reflect a significant reduction in species occurrences.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Data, models and conservation values can be combined using biodiversity indices to make robust environmental decisions. Combining different types of biodiversity data using composite indices, such as the geometric mean, can improve the coverage and relevance of biodiversity indices. We recommend that evaluation of biodiversity indices for fire management verify how index assumptions align with management objectives, consider the relative merits of different types of biodiversity data, test sensitivity of ecosystem state definitions and incorporate conservation values through species weightings.

AB  - Information is summarized on juvenile salmonid distribution, size, condition, growth, stock origin, and species and environmental associations from June and August 2000 GLOBEC cruises with particular emphasis on differences related to the regions north and south of Cape Blanco off Southern Oregon. Juvenile salmon were more abundant during the August cruise as compared to the June cruise and were mainly distributed northward from Cape Blanco. There were distinct differences in distribution patterns between salmon species: chinook salmon were found close inshore in cooler water all along the coast and coho salmon were rarely found south of Cape Blanco. Distance offshore and temperature were the dominant explanatory variables related to coho and chinook salmon distribution. The nekton assemblages differed significantly between cruises. The June cruise was dominated by juvenile rockfishes, rex sole, and sablefish, which were almost completely absent in August. The forage fish community during June comprised Pacific herring and whitebait smelt north of Cape Blanco and surf smelt south of Cape Blanco. The fish community in August was dominated by Pacific sardines and highly migratory pelagic species. Estimated growth rates of juvenile coho salmon were higher in the GLOBEC study area than in areas farther north. An unusually high percentage of coho salmon in the study area were precocious males. Significant differences in growth and condition of juvenile coho salmon indicated different oceanographic environments north and south of Cape Blanco. The condition index was higher in juvenile coho salmon to the north but no significant differences were found for yearling chinook salmon. Genetic mixed stock analysis indicated that during June, most of the chinook salmon in our sample originated from rivers along the central coast of Oregon. In August, chinook salmon sampled south of Cape Blanco were largely from southern Oregon and northern California; whereas most chinook salmon north of Cape Blanco were from the Central Valley in California.

AB  - Biological assessment of Oreochromis niloticus was conducted monthly between January, 2004 and December, 2006 in 3 zones [( Zone I: upper Cross River ( savanna wetlands) Zone II: middle Cross River ( savanna/ forest wetlands) and Zone III: lower Cross River ( forest wetlands)] along 200 km length of the inland wetlands of Cross River, Nigeria. Major items in the diet of O. niloticus were algae and plant 38 and 20.4% ( Zone I), 21.7 and 18.0% ( Zone II), 20.2 and 26.9% ( Zone III), respectively. Diet breadth ranged from 0.820 - 0.913. Food richness and Gut Repletion Index were 12 and 100%, respectively. Sex ratio was 1: 1 ( Zone1), 1: 0.78 ( Zone II) and 1: 0.89 ( Zone III). Mean allometric coefficients ( b) of the length-weight relationship were 2.194 +/- 0.215 ( Zone I), 2.935 +/- 0.333 ( Zone II) and 3.03 +/- 0.202 ( Zone III). Fecundity varied from 70 eggs for fish ( total length ( TL) = 11.00cm and weight ( W) = 37.9 g) to 502 eggs ( TL = 25.8cm and W = 198.8g) in Zone I, 60 eggs ( TL = 13.3cm and W = 19.8g) to 709 egg ( TL = 26.5, W= 317.0) in Zone II and 110 eggs ( TL = 13.7cm, W = 24.0g) to 811 eggs ( TL = 22.8cm, W = 278.8g) in Zone III. Relationship exists between fecundity and body size. Mean condition index ranged from 0.770 +/- 0.128 minimum for males at Zone I to 1.188 +/- 0.157 maximum also for males at Zone III. Therefore, male O. niloticus were in better condition than females and the forest wetlands of Cross River ( Zone III) offered more favourable living conditions for the species than the savanna wetlands ( Zone I and II).

AB  - An integrated ecosystem assessment was carried out for the Limfjord over the period from 1984 to 2008 to describe changes in ecosystem structure and potentially important drivers. The Limfjord is a eutrophic transitional Danish fjord system with the main inflow from the North Sea in the west and main outflow to the Kattegat in the east. We showed that from 1990 to 1995, the ecosystem structure shifted from dominance by demersal fish species (eelpout, whiting, flounder, plaice) to that of pelagic fish species (sprat, herring, sticklebacks), small-bodied fish species (black goby, pipefish), jellyfish, common shore crab, starfish and blue mussels. We interpret this change as a regime shift that showed a similar temporal pattern to regime shifts identified in adjacent seas. The observed changes in trophic interactions and food web reorganisation suggested a non-linear regime shift. The analyses further showed the regime shift to be driven by a combination of anthropogenic pressures and possible interplay with climatic disturbance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tidal conditions differently influence inter-tidal organisms in terms of general physiological and metabolic responses. In this study we investigated the morphological response in shells of Mytilus galloprovincialis native to different micro-tidal coastal environments in the Northern Adriatic Sea. Our purpose was to highlight the ecophenotypic variability across tidal levels and to elucidate how tidal currents and waves produced by anthropogenic activities may play a part in modulating shell morphology. Three sampling sites were selected: an open-sea area 15 km off-shore and two sites within the lagoon of Venice, the first near one of its three inlets, and the other one in the proximity of Venice city centre. At each sampling site, organisms were seasonally collected at different depths within their vertical zonation, either in the inter-tidal zone i.e. at both the highest and lowest tide zonation limits, and subtidally. The mussel shells were analysed by investigation of their morphometric relationships (height/length and width/length ratios) and by elliptic Fourier analysis of the shell contours. Shell thickness and condition index were also evaluated for a better comprehension of energy allocation/partitioning. Estimates based on long-term measurements, visual observation, wind statistics and wave growth laws allowed an evaluation of the forces acting on shells. At the open-sea site, the observed phenotypic variability of both shell shape and thickness was clearly related to the tidal vertical zonation. At the two lagoon sites, the currents generated by tidal flow through the inlet and the waves caused by the frequent passage of boats influenced both shell shape and thickness. A trade-off between protection and growth was apparent along the tide gradient, as emphasized by the differences in the partitioning and allocation of energy between shell and flesh production.

AB  - Sex allocation theory posits that mothers should preferentially invest in sons when environmental conditions are favorable for breeding, their mates are of high quality, or they are in good body condition. We tested these three hypotheses in rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata), monomorphic seabirds that lay a single-egg clutch, in 2 years that differed in environmental conditions for breeding. Results supported the environment and mate quality hypotheses, but these effects were interactive: offspring sex was independent of paternal traits in the poor year for breeding, while females mated to larger and more ornamented males reared more sons in the better year. Conversely, offspring sex was unrelated to female condition, as indexed by hatching date. We propose that good rearing conditions enable females to rear sons possessing the desirable phenotypic attributes of their mates. Results also supported two critical assumptions of sex allocation theory: (1) dimorphism in offspring condition at independence: daughters fledged with higher baseline levels of corticosterone than sons and (2) differential costs of rearing sons versus daughters: mothers rearing sons when environmental conditions were poor completed parental care in poorer condition than mothers rearing daughters in the same year and mothers rearing either sex when conditions were better. These novel results may help to explain the disparate results of previous studies of avian sex allocation.

AB  - The significant role and impact of humans in fostering environmental change, at all spatial-temporal scales, has been formally recognised by the development and inclusion of the Anthropocene epoch into the standardised geological time scale. Due to the role and impacts that humans are having, it is necessary to develop an understanding of the co-evolutionary relationship between humans and the environment in the Anthropocene Specifically, in relation to the fundamental dynamics of sustainability and unsustainability. This requires the development of approaches which are capable of developing new holistic knowledge concerning the fundamental dynamics of sustainability/unsustainability operating at any specified spatial-temporal scale(s) in the Anthropocene. Henceforth, this paper proposes a holistic quantitative framework - the Sustainability Dynamics Framework. The framework integrates and extends four fundamental theories concerning the environment-human relationship into a single framework. The framework is then demonstratively applied for the first time to determine and analyse the fundamental dynamic relationships between indicated levels of sustainability (Svalues) and various influencing factors, significantly expanding upon previously obtained results and analysis in Phillips (2015). The demonstrative application indicates that the SDF has a potential contribution towards ad- vancing knowledge concerning the dynamics of sustainability/unsustainability in the Anthropocene. This will be demonstrated through the future applications of the SDF to newly developed case studies of a multi spatial-temporal nature.

AB  - It has been investigated the ecological status of the cooling pond of Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) on the hydrochemical and toxicological indicators. The ecological water quality by most hydrochemical and hydrophysical indices corresponds to the class II, category 3, and is characterized as "fairly clean". However, according to the BOD5 index, the water quality is "satisfactory" (class III, category 4). By the contents of both nitrogen of nitrates and phosphorus of phosphates the water quality belongs to the class IV, category 6, as "bad, dirty water". The main anthropogenic pollutants are copper, iron, zinc, and fluorides. The ecological characteristics by their concentrations in the water correspond to the class III, and categories 4-5 of quality, which are "poorly and moderately polluted" water. Accumulation of toxic metals in the surface layer of the reservoir bottom sediments depends on their types, the minimal content is found in sandy sediments, and maximal one is in muddy sediments. The possibility of significant secondary pollution of the water environment by toxic metals is small under the hydrophysical and hydrochemical conditions typical for the cooling pond of Zaporizhzhya NPP. According to the calculations, the value of the average chemical index of ecological quality is "2.5", which characterizes the water of the Zaporizhzhya NPP cooling pond as "good" and "clean".

Here, we report the development and application of a method for the analysis of the glucan extracted in 0.5 N NaOH solution making use of an available preparation of Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL). The method yields reproducible beta-1,3-D-glucan measurements from samples of outdoor air, yeast cells, fungal spore preparations and ragweed pollen, and is more sensitive than competing measurements. The LAL-based measurement compared favourably to that based on size-exclusion chromatography using UV and refractive index detection. Growth conditions of the fungi did not materially change the concentrations of glucan in spores indicating that this is a stable property. Glucan content was proportional to spore surface area; however, some species contain higher relative spore glucan contents.

AB  - The bees were declared the most important living beings on the planet. They act as natural indicators of the state of the environment, protect and maintain ecosystems and contribute to genetic and biotic diversity. Due to its socio-economic and scientific role, beekeeping is an activity that contributes to the development of the rural area. In the analysis we have chosen Hunedoara County, considering its national position and prospects for the development of organic beekeeping. The elaboration of the PESTEL analysis ensures a long-term perspective of the apiculture strategy in Hunedoara County. In order to dispose of bee products (honey, organic honey, pollen, propolis, etc.) in optimal conditions to be marketed both through stores and online, we propose the creation of short chains between a specialized micro-enterprise, tourist pensions that provides food services, restaurants or bars that are located in areas with commercial ford and local beekeeping producers in HNV areas, of which at least one holds certification for organic honey. Beekeeping entrepreneurship can be developed through the actions of beekeepers in the field of promotion, by efficiently selecting possible distribution channels in the country and abroad.

AB  - Based on the first-order shear deformation theory, this paper focuses on the free vibration behavior of two-dimensional functionally graded material truncated conical shells resting on Winkler-Pasternak foundations. The materials are assumed to be isotropic and inhomogeneous in the length and thickness directions of truncated conical shell. The material properties of the truncated conical shell are varied in these directions according to power law functions. The derived governing equations are solved using differential quadrature method. Convergence of this method is checked and the fast rate of convergence is observed. The primary results of this study are obtained for (S-S-S-L), (C-S-C-L), and (C-S-S-L) boundary conditions and compared with those available in the literatures. Furthermore, effects of geometrical parameters, material power indexes, mechanical boundary conditions, Winkler and Pasternak foundation moduli on the nondimensional frequency parameters of the two-dimensional functionally graded material truncated conical shell are studied.

AB  - The automation of the mica surface displacement of a surface force apparatus (SFA) increases the accuracy of the intermolecular force measurements that is obtained without the presence of the experimenter. The automatic device cancels any thermal drift and the stability of the mica surfaces is optimum. The distance between the mica surfaces is measured by Tolansky multiple-beam interferometry (FECO method) which offers a sensitivity of 0.1 nm in the direction perpendicular to the plane of contact area. The mean refractive index of the medium between the mica plates is computed from simultaneous measurements of the wavelengths of two successive fringes of equal chromatic order (FECO). A conversion of an isotropic molecule to another anisotropic molecule can be identified from the variations of the refractive index. In good conditions, we can compute the local concentration of the molecules in the gap of the device, and estimate the Young's modulus of a protein ((C) Societe francaise de biochimie et biologie moleculaire / Elsevier, Paris).

AB  - Mobile video applications are becoming increasingly prevalent and enriching the way people learn and are entertained. However, on mobile terminals with inherently limited resources, mobile video streaming services consume too much energy and bandwidth, which is an urgent problem to solve. At present, research on cost-effective mobile video streaming typically focuses on the management of data transmission. Among such studies, some new approaches consider the user's behavior to further optimize data transmission. However, these studies have not adequately discussed the specific impact of the physical environment on user behavior. Therefore, this paper takes into account the environment-aware watching state and proposes a cost-effective mobile video streaming scheme to reduce power consumption and mobile data usage. First, the watching state is predicted by machine learning based on user behavior and the physical environment during a given time window. Second, based on the resulting prediction, a downloading algorithm is introduced based on the user equipment (UE) running mode in the LTE system and the VLC player. Finally, according to the corresponding experimental results obtained in a real-world environment, the proposed approach, compared to its benchmarks, effectively reduces the data usage (14.4% lower than that of energy-aware, on average) and power consumption (about 19% when there are screen touches) of mobile devices.

AB  - The estuary wetland in the coastal zone faces the risk of ecological integrity loss because of global environmental change and human activities. The evaluation of the estuary ecological integrity and its variation provides the basis for the environmental management of estuary wetland and coastal zone. In this study, we generalised the previous studies, extended the concept of estuary wetland ecological integrity and developed a multi-scale evaluation index system including environmental quality, biology and ecology, landscape pattern and ecosystem management (EBLE) based on dissipation theory. We applied the method to evaluate the ecological integrity in Jiulongjiang estuary in 2004 and 2009. The result indicated that the IEBLE scores in Jiulongjiang estuary were 0.64 in 2004 and 0.58 in 2009, and the IEQ IBE, ILP and IEM scores were 0.72, 0.64, 0.57 and 0.60 in 2004 and 0.56, 0.62, 0.60 and 0.51 in 2009, respectively. The comprehensive scores had decreased in the past five years. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Five oxbow lakes of the yna River, located in an agricultural area, were studied seasonally in 2005 and 2008. The EPT index (abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera larvae), as well as their proportion to Chironomidae indicated that groups sensitive to environmental conditions occurred at low abundance in relation to the different hydrological types of oxbow lakes. The Family Biotic Index, the Biological Monitoring Working Part index adapted to Polish conditions and the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) revealed low water quality regardless of the level of hydrological connectivity. In turn, the indices of biodiversity Margalef (d) and probability of interspecific encounters indicated good or satisfactory water quality. The pH correlated positively with the total abundance of aquatic invertebrates, while lower macroinvertebrate abundance was observed in turbid waters of lentic oxbows with a high content of total dissolved solids. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that hydrological connectivity was the main factor responsible for the value of monitoring indices, followed by the physical and chemical parameters of the local environment. Among the indices used, it was ASPT-PL that grouped the studied oxbow lakes according to their hydrological types and seems to be the best index. This study shows that the structure of invertebrate communities inhabiting oxbow lakes reflects physico-chemical conditions of water and can be a valuable source of monitoring data, indispensable to the management and protection of these important aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Sediment is the most commonly identified pollutant associated with macroinvertebrate community impairments in freshwater streams nationwide. Management of this physical stressor is complicated by the multiple measures of sediment available (e.g., suspended, dissolved, bedded) and the variability in natural "healthy" sediment loadings across ecoregions. Here we examine the relative importance of 9 sediment parameters on macroinvertebrate community health as measured by the Virginia Stream Condition Index (VSCI) across 5 ecoregions. In combination, sediment parameters explained 27.4% of variance in the VSCI in a multiregion data set and from 20.2% to 76.4% of variance for individual ecoregions. Bedded sediment parameters had a stronger influence on VSCI than did dissolved or suspended parameters in the multiregion assessment. However, assessments of individual ecoregions revealed conductivity had a key influence on VSCI in the Central Appalachian, Northern Piedmont and Piedmont ecoregions. In no case was a single sediment parameter sufficient to predict VSCI scores or individual biological metrics. Given the identification of embeddedness and conductivity as key parameters for predicting biological condition, we developed family-level sensitivity thresholds for these parameters, based on extirpation. Resulting thresholds for embeddedness were 68% for combined ecoregions, 65% for the Mountain bioregion (composed of Central Appalachian, Ridge and Valley, and Blue Ridge ecoregions), and 88% for the Piedmont bioregion (composed of Northern Piedmont and Piedmont ecoregions). Thresholds for conductivity were 366 mu S/cm for combined ecoregions, 391 mu S/cm for the Mountain bioregion, and 136 mu S/cm for the Piedmont bioregion. These thresholds may help water quality professionals identify impaired and at-risk waters designated to support aquatic life and develop regional strategies to manage sediment-impaired streams. Inclusion of embeddedness as a restoration endpoint may be warranted; this could be facilitated by application of more quantitative, less time-intensive measurement approaches. We encourage refinement of thresholds as additional data and genus-based metrics become available. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:77-92. Published 2018.

AB  - To assess the estrogenic effects of ethinylestradiol on zebrafish, zebrafish at different developmental stages (embryos, juveniles, and adults) were exposed to the synthetic hormone ethinylestradiol (EE2) in concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 ng/L for up to 33 days. Survival, hatching, length, weight, growth, condition, hepatosomatic index, gonadosomatic index, and vitellogenin (VTG) production were examined. Exposure of zebrafish juveniles and embryos to 100 ng EE2/L for up to 33 days had significant effects on survival, growth, and hatching. Two VTG fragments with molecular weights of approximately 140 and 170 kDa were detected with protein electrophoresis and Western blotting in the blood of exposed males and exposed and unexposed females, as well as in whole-body homogenates of exposed and unexposed juveniles. Significantly higher VTG concentrations (compared to controls) were measured in adults exposed to 10 and 100 ng EE2/L for 14 days, but not in fish exposed to 1 ng EE2/L. This study demonstrated that (1) zebrafish juveniles, larvae, and embryos are sensitive to the toxic effects of the endocrine disrupter EE2; (2) the effects on VTG production in adults are detected after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2; (3) unexposed juvenile zebrafish produce measurable concentrations of VTG.

AB  - Changes induced by a short-term (8 days) starvation period on the metabolism (VO2, oxygen uptake rate; VNH4, ammonia excretion rate) of the benthic deposit-feeding amphipod Pontoporeia affinis Lindstrom were studied from a Baltic deep (125 m) open-sea population.  The experiments were performed during two different nutritional periods:  in March, which represents a period when the benthic environment is deficient of good quality food, and in June, when the vernal phytoplankton bloom has enriched the sediment with fresh algal material.  In March, the VNH4-N of P. affinis is already extremely low, and the resulting VO2:VNH4-N ratios (atomic O:N) high (> 240), indicating an almost exclusive utilization of lipids as the energy source of metabolism.  The initial VNH4-N is considerably higher in June and the O:N ratio (mean 54) indicates an equal use of protein and lipid.  The VO2 is less affected by starvation.  The O:N ratio elevates during food deprivation as the animals shift their metabolic balance further towards the use of stored lipid.  The results suggest that the ammonia excretion of P. affinis is an indicator of more-or-less recent feeding history of individuals, and the O:N ratio is a potential index for the condition of these animals as it reflects the nutritional state of the benthic environment; for realistic results, animals should not be kept too long (over 3 days) without food in the laboratory prior to measurements.  Results from additional NH4-N excretion experiments, performed on animals collected from geographically different locations, show marked deviations in rates of ammonia release, most likely due to differing environmental conditions.

AB  - We developed an index to quantify rehabilitation success for terrestrial environments using data on reptile assemblages from five rehabilitated mine site waste dumps and adjacent undisturbed areas. It is based on the multi-metric principles of the index of biotic integrity (IBI). This rehabilitation and degradation index (RDI) is a quantitative measure of the extent to which the reptile assemblage in a rehabilitated site resembles that in an analogue site. It utilises a combination of diversity, assemblage composition and ecological parameters. Each of these parameters is further sub-divided and an overall weighted score out of 100 can be calculated for a disturbed area. This index can also be used to quantify the impact of grazing, feral predators or noise and dust on functional terrestrial ecosystems. Data from the Western Australian goldfields are used to explain the calculations necessary to achieve an RDI score. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conductivity elevation produces osmotic stress to aquatic biota and then alters biological communities. The responses of stream fish to conductivity remain unclear and strategies for protection are poorly developed. We collected data of fish and conductivity from sixty-two sites of the Taizi River to evaluate the changes to the fish community and species along the gradient of conductivity. Our results found that conductivity elevation was related to the regional development of urban and farmland and the local degradation of habitat quality. The community metrics of abundance and F-IBI, but not species richness and diversity, showed a significant linear correlation with conductivity. Conductivity of the top three F-IBI grades (excellent, good and normal) was significantly lower than those of the other two F-IBI grades (poor and bad). The boundary conductivity between normal grade and poor grade was approximately equal to 500 mu S cm(-1). We found different probability patterns for different species along the conductivity gradient; one capture probability pattern showed decline trend along the conductivity gradient. Except for two dominating and widespread species and one tolerant species, the remaining fish species of the first pattern should be designated as protection objects. In order to protect fish community integrity and sensitive species, sustainable land use management on the catchment scale and habitat quality improvement on the local scale should be given more attention by catchment managers.

AB  - While many coastal ecosystems previously supported high densities of seagrass and abundant bivalves, the impacts of overfishing, eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and habitat loss have collectively contributed to the decline of these important resources. Despite improvements in wastewater treatment in some watersheds and subsequent reduced nutrient loading to neighboring estuaries, seagrass and bivalve populations in these locations have generally not recovered. We performed three mesocosm experiments to simultaneously examine the contrasting effects of nutrient loading and historic suspension-feeding bivalve densities on the growth of eelgrass (Zostera marina), juvenile bivalves (northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria; eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica; and bay scallops, Argopecten irradians), and juvenile planktivorous fish (sheepshead minnow, Cyprinodon variegatus). High nutrient loading rates led to significantly higher phytoplankton (chlorophyll a) levels in all experiments, significantly increased growth of juvenile bivalves relative to controls with lower nutrient loading rates in two experiments, and significantly reduced the growth of eelgrass in one experiment. The filtration provided by adult suspension feeders (M. mercenaria and C. virginica) significantly decreased phytoplankton levels in all experiments, significantly increased light penetration and the growth of eelgrass in one experiment, and significantly decreased the growth of juvenile bivalves and fish in two experiments, all relative to controls with no filtration from adult suspension feeders. These results demonstrate that an appropriate level of nutrient loading can have a positive effect on some estuarine resources and that bivalve filtration can mediate the effects of nutrient loading to the benefit or detriment of different estuarine resources. Future ecosystem-based approaches will need to simultaneously account for anthropogenic nutrient loading and bivalve restoration to successfully manage estuarine resources.

AB  - Community, diversity, and biological index metrics for chironomid surface-floating pupal exuviae (SFPE) were assessed at different subsample sizes and sampling frequencies from wadeable streams in Minnesota (USA). Timed collections of SFPE were made using a biweekly sampling interval in groundwater-dominated (GWD) and surface-water-dominated (SWD) streams. These two types of stream were sampled because they support different Chironomidae communities with different phenologies which could necessitate sampling methodologies specific to each stream type. A subsample size of 300 individuals was sufficient to collect on average 85% of total taxa richness and to estimate most metrics with an error of about 1% relative to 1,000 count samples. SWD streams required larger subsample sizes to achieve similar estimates of taxa richness and metric error compared to GWD streams, but these differences were not large enough to recommend different subsampling methods for these stream types. Analysis of sample timing determined that 97% of emergence occurred from April through September. We recommend in studies where estimation of winter emergence is not important that sampling be limited to this period. Sampling frequency also affected the proportion of the community collected. To maximize the portion of the community, collected samples should be taken across seasons although no specific sampling interval is recommended. Subsampling and sampling frequency was also assessed simultaneously. When using a 300-count subsample, a 4-week sampling interval from April through September was required to collect on average 71% of the community. Due to differences in elements of the chironomid community evaluated by different studies (e.g., biological condition, phenology, and taxonomic composition), richness estimates are documented for five sampling intervals (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks) and five subsample sizes (100, 200, 300, 500, and 1,000 counts). This research will enhance future studies by providing guidelines for tailoring SFPE methods to study specific goals and resources.

AB  - Urban vegetation impinges upon the physical environment by positively enhancing the microclimate and air and water quality. On the other hand, changes to the physical environment as well as the socioeconomic conditions of urban dwellers affect the health of urban vegetation and species abundance and diversity. This two-way vegetation-environment dynamism makes urban vegetation an ideal meter to gauge the environmental health of cities. Although studies utilizing such a proposition exist with reference to the physical environment, the usefulness of vegetation in monitoring urban social change has received very little attention. In this study the author seeks to find whether changes in urban vegetation can be linked to urban social changes by using Detroit as a case study. Demographic trends in Detroit are analyzed in light of the increasing greenness in the city detected by recent satellite images. Robust relationships between greenness change and demographic factors associated with urban decay (population decline, an increase in poverty level, and an increase in vacant units) are found. Models built with a remotely sensed greenness change index and urban decay variables appear to be free of any serious bias. Tests for the validity of such models are also successful. It is concluded that vegetation trends could be used as indicators of urban socioeconomic changes. A vegetation-based urban environmental quality index could therefore be developed to monitor physical and social changes in cities.

AB  - Context. Anthropogenic disturbances induce physiological and behavioural responses in numerous species. The negative effects of human disturbance are of special concern to threatened and endangered species.
   Aims. The present study aims to compare physiological stress measures and reproductive success of Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) living near roads with jays that live away from roads. Specifically, it aims to test whether roads are stressful.
   Methods. We assessed physiological measures that can serve as indicators of 'stress' to determine whether a highway that bisects our study site had physiological effects on adult male Florida scrub-jays. We captured male breeders from three territory types, including scrub habitat that (1) bordered a highway with a grassy shoulder that created an 'edge' habitat (roadside), (2) bordered human-maintained habitat (a plowed firebreak of sand with adjacent pasture) that served as a control for the edge-effect of the road (pasture) and (3) contained only natural scrub habitat (interior). We measured baseline concentrations of the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT), body mass, and a suite of longitudinal body measures to generate a body condition index in males from each territory type over three breeding seasons.
   Key results. Roadside jays had greater body mass than did interior and pasture jays, although there were no differences in overall baseline CORT concentrations or body condition among territory classes. There was no difference in clutch initiation date or size and nestling and independent-young survival.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that the road through our study site has physiological effects on Florida scrub-jays; however, there is mixed evidence as to whether it acts as a chronic stressor.
   Implications. Our findings provide evidence that roads and road-associated disturbance has neutral or potentially beneficial physiological effects of roads on Florida scrub-jays. Knowledge of these effects of roads and disturbance on jays will hopefully provide additional opportunities to improve conservation of this species.

AB  - A practical issue is present in sustaining and rehabilitating the ecologically vulnerable post-mining area in which the environmental condition varies spatially and therefore influenced by multiple factors. This paper attempts to integrate the ecological vulnerability assessment and rehabilitation treatment to assist land managers in revealing vulnerable features along with developing treatments of vulnerability mitigation. Using a post-mining site in a mountainous area in western China as study area, an indicator system and framework for assessing and reducing vulnerability were developed based on a vulnerability analysis. Geo-informatics, such as satellite image processing and spatial analysis, were employed to perform the assessment and planning. It was found that higher exposure and sensitivity are the main causes of increased vulnerability in a seriously disturbed post-mining area. Rehabilitation treatments were arranged spatially and structurally based on the framework of vulnerability mitigation. A pre-evaluation of the effectiveness shows this type of rehabilitation has a convergence effect that clusters and lowers the ecological vulnerability index ( EVI). The average value of EVI will be reduced by 15.02% if the minimum standards of rehabilitation can be completed. Altogether, an integration of rehabilitation treatments and the quantification of vulnerability in a spatially explicit manner are critical for planners to gain more insight into ecological vulnerability in post-mining area, which provides guidance to simplify rehabilitation planning with respect to vulnerability mitigation.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates have a long history of use in environmental monitoring. However, macroinvertebrate-based multimetric approach has not been well developed to assessment aquatic ecosystems in China, particularly in lake ecosystems. Eutrophication has been recognized as one of the main pressures affecting shallow lakes in China and elsewhere and it is thus desirable to quantify its effects on ecological integrity of lake ecosystems. Here, 41 subtropical shallow lakes in the Eastern Plain Lake Ecoregion of China were sampled and defined as three groups along eutrophication gradients. A macroinvertebrate-based multimetric index, consisting of three taxonomic metrics (No. of Gastropoda taxa, biological pollution index, and Margalef index) and two functional metrics (functional evenness and relative abundance of deposit feeder) was developed based on the datasets of the 41 lakes, and the results of multiple linear regression showed that the MMI was significantly related to the concentration of TP and macrophyte cover. This finding indicated that the MMI could characterize the influence of eutrophication on lake ecosystems. Our results also indicated that functional metrics could complement the information provided by taxonomic metrics, and we recommend to properly use functional metrics in lake biomonitoring. The macroinvertebrate-based MMI proposed here is the first attempt using biological quality element to assess the ecological status of shallow lakes in the view of eutrophication at the regional scale and could provide complementary information to traditional water quality assessment for the development of management strategies.

AB  - Leaf area density is a biologically appealing index of forest tree health because it can provide an assessment of foliage loss or retention; however, it is difficult to measure directly. In contrast, the ratio of crown length to sapwood area (CL:SA) is quite amenable to objective field measurement, and could be interpreted as an index of crown sparseness. CL:SA was computed for Douglas-fir trees from 70 plots covering a range in average size, stand density, site quality, and crown condition in the Oregon Coast Range. When expressed as cm:cm(2), the index ranged from 2 to 100 for individual trees and from 2 to 11 for plot averages based on the 200 largest trees per ha. In general, individual trees with a high CL:SA had a lower relative height within the stand. The index also increased with increasing severity of needle loss on sites where Swiss needle cast (SNC) is causing premature loss of foliage. After correcting for stand density and stand age, plot basal area growth increased significantly with a decrease in plot average CL:SA across a gradient in Swiss needle cast severity. CL:SA has strong potential for discriminating effectively among stands with varying degrees of foliage loss and growth reduction due to other disturbances as well, such as air pollution and defoliating insects.

AB  - Factory Creek is a major tributary to Shoal Creek (Tennessee River drainage) and drains 311 km(2) in Lawrence and Wayne counties, TN. We conducted a fish survey of Factory Creek in 2017 and calculated index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores using the "30 + 2" sampling method of the Geological Survey of Alabama for Tennessee River Valley streams. Our collections yielded 58 fish species, with a mean of 27 species per collection and with Erimyzon claviformis (Western Creek Chubsucker) reported for the first time from Factory Creek. Including historical records, the known fish fauna of Factory Creek comprises 75 species. Index scores varied from 42 to 58 out of 60 (good to excellent) with a mean of 52 (excellent), which reflects a relatively undisturbed and intact fish community. Factory Creek is located in the Pickwick Lake subbasin, a hotspot for aquatic biodiversity in the southeastern United States. Because much of Factory Creek has excellent IBI conditions, we recommend continued biological monitoring and adherence to best land-use management practices to ensure proactive conservation of the fish fauna.

AB  - In Senegal, two stocks of white shrimp (Penaeus notialis) are intensively exploited, one in the north and another in the south. We used surplus production models including environmental effects to analyse their changes in abundance over the past 10 years and to estimate their Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and the related fishing effort (E-MSY). First, yearly abundance indices were estimated from commercial statistics using GLM techniques. Then, two environmental indices were alternatively tested in the model: the coastal upwelling intensity from wind speeds provided by the SeaWifs database and the primary production derived from satellite infrared images of chlorophyll a. Models were fitted, with or without the environmental effect, to the 1996-2005 time series. They express stock abundance and catches as functions of the fishing effort and the environmental index (when considered).
   For the northern stock, fishing effort and abundance fluctuate over the period without any clear trends. The model based on the upwelling index explains 64.9% of the year-to-year variability. It shows that the stock was slightly overexploited in 2002-2003 and is now close to full exploitation. Stock abundance strongly depends on environmental conditions; consequently, the MSY estimate varies from 300 to 900 tons according to the upwelling intensity. For the southern stock, fishing effort has strongly increased over the past 10 years, while abundance has been reduced 4-fold. The environment has a significant effect on abundance but only explains a small part of the year-to-year variability. The best fit is obtained using the primary production index (R-2 = 0.75), and the stock is now significantly overfished regardless of environmental conditions. MSY varies from 1200 to 1800 tons according to environmental conditions. Finally, in northern Senegal, the upwelling is highly variable from year to year and constitutes the major factor determining productivity. In the south, hydrodynamic processes seem to dominate and determine the primary production and the white shrimp stock productivity as well. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Merauke Regency is located in the southern part of Papua, directly adjacent to Papua New Guinea. It has a mangrove ecosystem that is still good (pristine) which is quite extensive and rich in molluscs and crustaceans which are key fauna in the mangrove ecosystem. The aims of this research were to know the structure of molluscs and crustaceans community in mangrove ecosystem in this area. A study was conducted in October 2019 in 13 stations. Molluscs and crustaceans sample were collected in each location using a plot measuring 10 x 10 m. Samples were taken for 20 minutes by the same two people in each plot at low tide. From this study found 11 species of the crustaceans and 6 species of the molluscs. Cerithidea obtusa, Littoraria scabra and Cassidula angulifera of the molluscs group were macrobenthos that had a relatively wide distribution. The highest abundance was found in MRKM22 station (5.67 individuals/m(2)) and the lowest was in MRKM33 (0.25 individuals/m(2)). The molluscs and crustaceans found in this study were common species in mangrove ecosystem. The value of species diversity index (H') ranged from 0.63 to 1.56. This value indicated the diversity of molluscs and crustaceans species was of low-moderate condition. Evenness index (J') ranged from 0.56 to 0.99 and dominance index (C) ranged from 0.24 to 0.56. In general, these ecological values showed that the molluscs and crustaceans community in each station is in a relatively stable condition.

AB  - Grain legume-cereal intercropping can be of a great interest in Mediterranean croplands where severe climatic conditions and intensive agricultural practices exacerbate the process of soil degradation and decline of soil fertility. This study aimed to investigate the impact of leguminous intercrops in soil dynamics of various C and N pools and bacterial community structure. A field experiment including grain legume (pea, faba bean)-barley intercropping as compared to the respective sole crops (P100, F100 and B100) was carried out on a sandy clay loam soil in a Mediterranean environment. Row intercrops were established in an additive (P100/B50 or F100/B50) or replacement (P50/B50 or F50/B50) design. Soil chemical, biochemical and ecophysiological variables together with shifts in the bacterial community structure by DGGE community fingerprinting were determined at three sampling times over the cropping season. The impact of intercropped legumes upon the soil fertility status was assessed by calculating the IBF. Crop biomass production and weed suppression at the harvest stage were also determined. Results showed that the soil fertility status was not significantly increased and a few soil C and N-related biochemical variables were affected by the legume-based intercropping during the cropping season, suggesting that legume root-derived substrates stimulate microbial mineralization thus leading to an increase of the available-N pool in soil. The bacterial community structure was resilient to crop treatments. Pea-barley intercropping in replacement design provided a more stable yield (in terms of aboveground biomass production) and a lower weed infestation.

AB  - Green infrastructure (GI), a network of nature, semi-natural areas and green space, delivers essential ecosystem services which underpin human well-being and quality of life. Maintaining ecosystem services through the development of GI is therefore increasingly recognized by policies as a strategy to cope with potentially changing conditions in the future. This paper assessed how current trends of land-use change have an impact on the aggregated provision of eight ecosystem services at the regional scale of the European Union, measured by the Total Ecosystem Services Index (TESI8). Moreover, the paper reports how further implementation of GI across Europe can help maintain ecosystem services at baseline levels. Current demographic, economic and agricultural trends, which affect land use, were derived from the so called Reference Scenario. This scenario is established by the European Commission to assess the impact of energy and climate policy up to 2050. Under the Reference Scenario, economic growth, coupled with the total population, stimulates increasing urban and industrial expansion. TESI8 is expected to decrease across Europe between 0 and 5 % by 2020 and between 10 and 15 % by 2050 relative to the base year 2010. Based on regression analysis, we estimated that every additional percent increase of the proportion of artificial land needs to be compensated with an increase of 2.2 % of land that qualifies as green infrastructure in order to maintain ecosystem services at 2010 levels.

AB  - Socio-economical conditions profoundly influence terrestrial ecosystems, especially the agroecosystems. However, the effects of large-scale "top-down" socio-economical changes on patterns of vegetation production and C sequestration in pastures remain largely unclear. The contrasting institutional and policy shifts in 1990s over the two sub-region of Temperate Eurasian Steppe (TES), i.e., the Kazakh Steppe (KS) and the Mongol Steppe (MS), provide a unique opportunity to illustrate the human and natural interactions. Combining multiple information from remote sensing, land model, climate and inventory data, this study investigated how the regional trend and inter-annual variability (IAV) of leaf area index (LAI), net primary productivity (NPP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP) were associated with different institutional and policy shifts. From 1997 to 2016, climate is the primary control factor to the IAV of the ecosystem indexes (EIs, i.e., LAI, NPP, NEP) at a regional view. Highly contrasting impacts of human appropriation indexes (HAIs, i.e., livestock number and agricultural GDP) to the EIs were found for the two sub-region. The effect of HAIs on EIs was weak in the MS, but significant negative correlations between HAIs and EIs were found in the KS. Further decomposition into administrative divisions showed that the swift rise of human appropriation in China was accompanied with increases in grassland NPP and NEP, owing to the policy shift to sustainable management. But the institutional shift to market-driven economy and increasing human appropriation generally acted as a negative factor to EIs in various countries over the KS, especially in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Regional evidences revealed the importance of large-scale socio-economic shifts in shaping the pattern of important ecosystem properties of grasslands and emphasized the importance of sustainability development in managing pasture systems.

AB  - An active biomonitoring study was carried out on the Algerian west coast using wild reference mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) sampled from the Kristel (K) site and transplanted in net cages during one month (between May and June 2007) to Oran Harbour (OH) and Mostaganem Harbour (MH), areas characterised by high levels of urban and industrial pollution. The biological response of the mussels was evaluated by their condition index and the use of a general stress biomarker (evaluation of lysosomal membrane stability: the neutral red retention time (NRRT) method), a genotoxic effects biomarker (determination of micronuclei (MN) frequency) and a neurotoxic effects biomarker (determination of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) concentration).
   Compared to the K reference specimens, OH and MH caged mussels presented a significant decrease of NRRT in lysosomal haemocytes (56.45 +/- 26.48 min and 67.25 +/- 22.77 min, respectively) (78 +/- 16.97 min for K mussels), an MN frequency respectively 7.3 and 9 times higher in the haemocytes and the gill cells of the OH caged mussels, and 7.2 and 6.4 times higher in the two tissues of the MH caged mussels. Significant inhibition of AChE activity was noted in the gills (16.93 +/- 3.1 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1) and the digestive gland (7.69 +/- 1.79 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1)) of the OH mussels, but only in the gills (23.21 +/- 5.94 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1)) of the MH mussels, compared to the organs of the K control specimens (35.9 +/- 6.4 nmol min(-1) mg prot(-1) in the gills and 11.17 +/- 0.49 mnol min(-1) mg prot(-1) in the digestive gland).
   This study reflects the interest in such in situ biomonitoring assays and the utility of these biomarkers for assessing the effects of pollution in the Algerian coastal marine environment.

AB  - The composition and diversity of benthic communities, as well as the current ecological state of Vychegda River in the zone of influence of wastewater from pulp and paper production, are characterized. A high diversity of benthic fauna and quantitative indicators of its development that atypical for benthic biocenoses in the middle reaches of Vychegda River were registered. In the zoobenthos composition, 23 taxonomic groups of benthic invertebrates were identified. For the seven model groups, 125 species and forms were identified, as well as a persistent complex of species that predominate in the studied section of the river. Indicator species of o-beta- and beta-saprobic conditions were dominant in the model groups. In general, indices for water-quality assessment based on the composition and structure of benthic invertebrate communities characterize the state of the river at the monitoring site as satisfactory. An exception was the wastewater-discharge points, where the role of indicator species of alpha- and polysaprobic conditions was higher and the values of most of the indices were significantly lower.

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop an index of biological integrity (IBI) for national-level monitoring of watersheds as an ecosystem health assessment methodology for the South Korean government. A 10-metric IBI model (IBIKW) was developed for watershed management and then applied to 76 streams in four major watersheds in Korea. The model assessments showed that 32.9% of all streams were judged to be in 'excellent-good' condition, whereas 67.1% were in 'fair-poor' condition, indicating severely impaired ecological health. Nutrient analyses of stream water revealed a two- to fivefold increase in nutrient and biological oxygen demand (BOD) levels in urban- and cropland-dominant streams compared to forest-dominant streams. The guild structure within the watersheds indicated that tolerant species were predominant in severely degraded regions (BOD > 6 mg L-1), and sensitive species were distributed in regions with BOD < 2 mg L-1. Factors affecting ecosystem health (IBIKW scores) included chemical water quality parameters, physical habitat parameters and land use around the stream. In particular, land use was one of the major factors influencing ecosystem health, as indicated by the strong relationships between the percentages of urban and forest streams and the IBIKW scores. The integrated ecosystem health assessment technique developed here can be applied for both regular bioassessments and post-restoration assessments.

AB  - Biochar, a stable, carbon-rich solid produced during biomass pyrolysis, has been widely used in soil conditioning. A promising option to alleviate the problem of sludge management. In this study, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cd, As, Pb and Cu were studied owing to their relatively high content in the sludge and their potential to cause environmental damage. Sludge-biochars were produced at different temperatures (300 degrees C, 350 degrees C, 400 degrees C and 450 degrees C) by microwave pyrolysis. BCR (European Community Bureau of Reference: a sequential extraction) analysis reveals that speciation distribution varied largely with the different heavy metals. Three risk analysis models were adopted to evaluate the risk of heavy metals: the risk assessment code (RAC), geo-accumulation index (I-geo) and potential ecological risk index (Er). The heavy metals risk in the biochar were lower compared with the sludge except for Pb (sludge: 4.3, biochar: 9.4-15.6) as assessed by RAC analysis. The Er result shows that risk from heavy metals decreased except for Cd (sludge: 63.53, biochar: 153.53-189.38). The I-geo model indicated that all seven heavy metals were present at higher levels in biochar than in the sludge. Although the total metal concentration in biochar increased after pyrolysis, this result indicates that heavy metal risk of microwave pyrolysis sludge-biochar should be considered alongside local soil backgrounds and speciation distributions.

AB  - Macroinvertebrate community distributions were investigated within the benthic and hyporheic zone of five groundwater-fed streams, on a floodplain terrace, in a glacierized catchment in Alaska, in summer 2008. The streams were characterized by a distinct gradient in environmental instability and provided an opportunity to determine whether the local variability in environmental instability of groundwater-fed streams (reflecting differences in lengths of groundwater flow pathways) are of sufficient magnitude and frequency to influence macroinvertebrate community distribution. Individual measures of surface-water temperature, streamflow, streambed stability and sediment size were incorporated into a multivariate index of environmental instability (IEI), using principal components analysis. In the hyporheic zone, a logarithmic association was observed between macroinvertebrate diversity and IEI and a quadratic association between abundance and IEI. The increase in diversity along the gradient of instability reflected a greater evenness of taxa caused by reduction in abundance of Chironomidae, combined with an increase in abundance of several less dominant taxa (Limnephilidae, Empididae, Baetidae and Simuliidae). At the surface, a quadratic association between diversity and IEI was observed, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Chironomidae, Nemouridae and Empididae presented contrasting surface and hyporheic distributions, indicating use of the hyporheic zone as a refuge. Moreover, covariance in the surface and hyporheic distribution of Limnephilidae and Chloroperlidae suggested the use of the hyporheic zone as an extension of the benthic habitat. The data indicate that local variability in environmental conditions between groundwater-fed streams is sufficient to induce differences in macroinvertebrate communities and in the response of individual taxa.

AB  - We utilized a single metric, the coefficient of community loss (1) to assess the health of fish communities inhabiting 27 low-order Monongahela River tributaries in Pennsylvania. All streams were sampled during summers of 2003 and 2004 utilizing two-pass back-pack electrofishing from the mouth extending 200 m upstream. Environmental stressors observed in and on-stream were habitat alteration and non-point source discharges due to urbanization and agriculture along with point-source discharges of raw and treated sewage, net alkaline mine drainage, and acid mine drainage (AMD). Species richness and 1-metric scores in streams impacted by major AMD and/or untreated sewage were 0 and a, respectively. While those exhibiting minimal cultural stress had species richness totals and I-metric scores of 24 and 0.24, respectively. Values of 1 were negatively correlated with index of biotic integrity scores (-0.951), suggesting that I could provide a rapid comprehensive assessment of the relative health of fish communities within a major watershed.

AB  - Urbanization can cause significant changes in the integrity of fluvial ecosystems, which makes it necessary to assess environmental conditions of areas where population growth rates are high. A study of the environmental quality of Chorrillos River (San Luis-Argentina) and its tributaries was carried out in order to evaluate the potential effect of an urbanization gradient. Six sites were sampled along the main course and tributaries of the river. Urbanization variables were measured and included to calculate an Urbanization Index. Physical-chemical analyses were performed in water samples to evaluate water quality through the use of a simplified index of water quality (SIWQ). Plants, macroinvertebrates, and amphibians metrics were used to assess the biological state of the studied sites. The Urbanization Index varied significantly between sites and was significantly correlated to the SIWQ. However, no significant correlations were found between SIWQ and macroinvertebrates and amphibians variables. Water quality of Chorrillos River and its tributaries is good, but it is affected by anthropic influences as reflected by the declining of SIWQ values. Although biological sampling constitutes an important tool in the assessment of water quality of rivers, in this report biological results were not conclusive.

AB  - Stormwater management is the core of sponge city construction whose essence is to solve the urban water problem by means of seepage, storage, purification, utilization and drainage. From the environmental geology point of view, this paper mainly consider the geological properties of sponge capacity in the construction of sponge city. Based on a large number of in -situ water infiltration tests and boreholes, two indexes that sponge infiltration and sponge storage are put forward to study and analyze the maximum depth of rainfall infiltration and the infiltration velocity of surface soil under the original sponge geological conditions. These two indexes can directly and effectively represent and summarize the environmental geological suitability in the construction of sponge cities. Moreover, these two indexes are easy to understand, have a strong universality, and easy to promote. Finally, taking Xinxiang city in central China as an example, the environmental geological suitability of Xinxiang sponge city construction is evaluated.

AB  - The objective of this work was to classify and map the areas environmentally sensitive to desertification in the Mediterranean island of Crete. Sensitivity to desertification was estimated with a modification of the MEDALUS Environmentally Sensitive Area Index (ESAI) approach, using 15 quantitative parameters divided into four main quality indices: climate, vegetation, soils and management quality. The ESAI methodology was modified to include two additional parameters related to soil quality (water erosion and soil organic matter). According to the results, 37% of the island's area is characterized as critically sensitive to desertification. This percentage varies significantly across the island, with the western part having the least critically sensitive areas, and the eastern part the most critically sensitive. The results of this study also indicate that critically sensitive areas are found in the eastern side of the island mainly due to human-related factors and climatic conditions. It was concluded that the proposed methodology is a valuable tool for regional-scale assessment of areas environmentally sensitive to desertification in Mediterranean environments.

AB  - The Salish Sea ecosystem is a transboundary area of ecological, social, and economic significance shared by Canada and the United States. Accordingly, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Environment Canada have committed to cross-border collaboration on Salish Sea issues. The transboundary ecosystem indicators project was established to support knowledge sharing and to identify common priorities for action. Mixed trends were observed among ecosystem indicators, reflecting the complexity of the system. Improvements were demonstrated among indicators of air quality, freshwater quality, and toxics in the food web. Declining trends were observed among indicators of marine water quality, marine species at risk, Chinook Salmon, and summer stream flow. Variable or neutral trends were observed among indicators of southern resident Killer Whale abundance, access to Shellfish beaches, and access to swimming beaches. While the indicators represent separate ecosystem components, including air, water, species condition, and human wellbeing, these indicators are interrelated through biophysical cycles. Methods and results of tracking transboundary ecosystem indicators are presented to facilitate the identification of primary drivers and pressures of observed trends, and responses that have had positive results on a site specific basis.

AB  - Plastic debris is ubiquitous in the marine environment and many of this is polyethylene based plastic bags. Its potential effect on marine organisms is still understudied. Hence, this study determined the histological changes induced in the intestine and liver of the juvenile rabbit fish, Siganus guttatus. S. guttatus (N = 150) were sub chronically exposed to plastic bag debris suspensions (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg L-1) for 10 days. In addition to histological changes, the condition factor (CF) index of the fishes were assessed. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the CF index of the fishes exposed to varying concentrations of plastic suspensions, there was however histological changes in fishes exposed to 10 mg L-1. The histological changes in the intestine were hyperemia, necrosis, goblet cells hyperplasia, and shortening of the villi. Histological changes in the liver were hyperemic blood vessels and vacuolization. Fishes exposed to 10 mg L-1 exhibited a higher proximal, distal, liver and total organ index as compared to those unexposed (p < 0.05).

AB  - Indices of Biological integrity (IBI) are considered valid indicators of the overall health of a water body because the biological community is an endpoint within natural systems. However, prediction of biological integrity using information from multi-parameter environmental observations is a challenging problem due to the hierarchical organization of the natural environment, the existence of nonlinear inter-dependencies among variables as well as natural stochasticity and measurement noise. We present a method for predicting the Fish Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) using multiple environmental observations at the state-scale in Ohio. Instream (chemical and physical quality) and offstream parameters (regional and local upstream land uses, stream fragmentation, and point source density and intensity) are used for this purpose. The IBI predictions are obtained using the environmental site-similarity concept and following a simple to implement leave-one-out cross validation approach. An IBI prediction for a sampling site is calculated by averaging the observed IBI scores of observations clustered in the most similar branch of a dendrogram -a hierarchical clustering tree of environmental observations- built using the rest of the observations. The standardized Euclidean distance is used to assess dissimilarity between observations.
   The constructed predictive model was able to explain 61% of the IBI variability state-wide. Stream fragmentation and regional land use explained 60% of the variability; the remaining 1% was explained by instream habitat quality. Metrics related to local land use, water quality, and point source density and intensity did not improve the predictive model at the state-scale. The impact of local environmental conditions was evaluated by comparing local characteristics between well- and mispredicted sites. Significant differences in local land use patterns and upstream fragmentation density explained some of the model's over-predictions. Local land use conditions explained some of the model's IBI under-predictions at the state-scale since none of the variables within this group were included in the best final predictive model. Under-predicted sites also had higher levels of downstream fragmentation.

AB  - The community structure of benthic diatoms and water environmental characteristics were extensively investigated to assess the aquatic ecosystem health of the Wutong River (Heilongjiang Province, China). Several diatom indices were calculated, and a benthic diatom index based on biotic integrity (BD-IBI) was developed. Principal component analysis (PCA), Spearman correlation analysis (CA), cluster analysis, redundancy analysis (RDA), and the box plot analysis were used to analyze the benthic diatom communities, assess the river ecosystem health, and compare the applicability of different indexes. The results indicated that Gomphonema parvulum and other tolerant species were the dominant species. Meanwhile, most sites were in poor or very poor condition according to the diatom indexes evaluation, indicating that the river has been disturbed by human activities. The sampling sites of the Wutong River were divided into three groups based on different pollution levels. The derived BD-IBI included four individual metrics of different aspects, showed strong distinguishability for three grouping and robust correlation with environmental variables. Of all the indexes selected, IBI performed the best, followed by the species-level diatom indexes and the genus-level diatom indexes.

AB  - Index systems on river health assessment are difficult for using in practice, due to the more complex and professional indicators adopted. In the paper, some key indicators which can be applied for river health assessment in general were selected, based on the analysis of 45 assessment index systems with 902 variables within around 150 published papers and documents in 1972-2010. According to the fields covered by the variables, they were divided into four groups: habitat condition, water environment, biotic status and water utilization. The adopted number and the accepted degrees in the above systems of each indicator were calculated after the variables were combined into the indicators, some of the widely accepted indicators which can reflect different aspects of river condition were selected as key indicators in candidate. Under the correlation analysis amongst the key indicators in candidate, 8 indicators were finally suggested as the key indicators for assessing river health, which were: coverage rate of riparian vegetation, reserved rate of wetland, river continuity, the changing rate of water flow, the ratio of reaching water quality standard, fish index of biotic integrity, the ratio of water utilization and land use.

AB  - Carotenoids have received much attention from biologists because of their ecological and evolutionary implications in vertebrate biology. We sampled Galapagos land iguanas (Conolophus subcristatus) to investigate the types and levels of blood carotenoids and the possible factors affecting inter-population variation. Blood samples were collected from populations from three islands within the species natural range (Santa Cruz, Isabela, and Fernandina) and one translocated population (Venecia). Lutein and zeaxanthin were the predominant carotenoids found in the serum. In addition, two metabolically modified carotenoids (anhydrolutein and 3'-dehydrolutein) were also identified. Differences in the carotenoid types were not related to sex or locality. Instead, carotenoid concentration varied across the localities, it was higher in females, and it was positively correlated to an index of body condition. Our results suggest a possible sex-related physiological role of xanthophylls in land iguanas. The variation in the overall carotenoid concentration between populations seems to be related to the differences in local abundance and type of food within and between islands. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - 1. When rigorous standards of collecting and analysing data are maintained, biological monitoring adds valuable information to water resource assessments. Decisions, from study design and field methods to laboratory procedures and data analysis, affect assessment quality. Subsampling - a laboratory procedure in which researchers count and identify a random subset of field samples - is widespread yet controversial. What are the consequences of subsampling?
   2. To explore this question, random subsamples were computer generated for subsample sizes ranging from 100 to 1000 individuals as compared with the results of counting whole samples. The study was done on benthic invertebrate samples collected from five Puget Sound lowland streams near Seattle, WA, USA. For each replicate subsample, values for 10 biological attributes (e.g. total number of taxa) and for the 10-metric benthic index of biological integrity (B-IBI) were computed.
   3. Variance of each metric and B-IBI for each subsample size was compared with variance associated with fully counted samples generated using the bootstrap algorithm. From the measures of variance, we computed the maximum number of distinguishable classes of stream condition as a function of sample size for each metric and for B-IBI.
   4. Subsampling significantly decreased the maximum number of distinguishable stream classes for B-IBI, from 8.2 for fully counted samples to 2.8 classes for 100-organism subsamples. For subsamples containing 100-300 individuals, discriminatory power was low enough to mislead water resource decision makers.

AB  - Environmental impact statements (EISs), and the related environmental impact assessments (EIAs) which precede them, have become central elements of environmental management, governance, and policy worldwide since their introduction in the United States in 1970. Assessing environmental impact has a particular force and centrality within modern Antarctic environmental management and governance too. This article investigates the ways in which the United States used EISs and EIAs in Antarctica between 1970 and 1982 - during their first decade of existence in US law and during a geopolitically and scientifically vibrant decade in Antarctic affairs - as a way of illuminating the broader conceptual and historical aspects of this central, though understudied, environmental governance tool and framework. We historicise and draw attention to the EIS - individually, as a regulatory genre, and as a genre that articulates regional, global and planetary environments - as highly influential and powerful documents demanding attention from environmental historians and historical geographers. We argue that the prominence of EISs in Antarctica arose because they appealed to top-down, process-oriented approaches favoured in Antarctic governance - a technocratic environmentalism - and because of their spatial elements, particularly their tendency to upscaling.

AB  - The ecological literature accepts that many policy outcomes cannot be observed directly and must be characterized using indicators. Multiple indicators can often be used to communicate similar ecological outcomes. Previous studies using alternative indicators in stated preference surveys suggest that welfare estimates may be indicator-dependent, casting doubt on whether welfare estimates are sufficiently reliable for cost benefit analysis. We suggest that the reason for such indicator dependence may be that indicators used in these prior studies represented different outcomes valued by respondents. This possibility underscores the need for greater attention to selection of indicators and their properties within stated preference survey design. This paper develops a model introducing the concept of outcome equivalent indicators, defined as indicators that provide alternative representations of identical underlying outcomes. To assess empirically whether welfare estimates are indeed robust to indicator choice when alternative indicators are expected to be outcome equivalent, we analyze data from a choice experiment estimating willingness to pay for migratory fish restoration in Rhode Island, USA. Results demonstrate that welfare estimates are robust to the use of alternative ecological indicators within stated preference scenarios.

AB  - Attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms which are dynamic in nature: states of hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity as core symptoms, and emotion dysregulation as associated feature. Although tremendous work has been done to investigate between-subject differences (how patients with ADHD differ from healthy controls or patients with other disorders), little is known about the relationship between symptoms with triggers and contexts, that may allow us to better understand their causes and consequences. Understanding the temporal associations between symptoms and environmental triggers in an ecologically valid manner may be the basis to developing just-in-time adaptive interventions. Fortunately, recent years have seen advances in methodology, hardware and innovative statistical approaches to study dynamic processes in daily life. In this narrative review, we provide a description of the methodology (ambulatory assessment), summarize the existing literature in ADHD, and discuss future prospects for these methods, namely mobile sensing to assess contextual information, real-time analyses and just-in-time adaptive interventions.

AB  - We evaluated the incidence of microplastics in the digestive tract contents of four fish species: Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardina pilchardus, Callionymus lyra and Mullus surmuletus. Alkaline digestion (10% KOH) was used to degrade the organic matter. The percentage of fish with microplastics was 78% (88% fibres, 12% fragments). The main types of polymers identified by Raman spectroscopy were polyethylene and polypropylene. The diet of the four species was also studied and two feeding types were determined: plankton-feeders and benthic-feeders. The effect of a set of biological variables (Length, Fullness index, Fulton's condition factor and Feeding type) on the number and size of microplastics ingested was studied using Generalised Additive Models (GAMs). A significant increase in the number of microplastics with increasing length was observed. No significant effect of trophic variables (fullness index and feeding type) on the number and size of microplastics was found.

AB  - Watershed integrity is the capacity of a watershed to support and maintain the full range of ecological processes and functions essential to sustainability. Using information from EPA's StreamCat dataset, we calculated and mapped an Index of Watershed Integrity (IWI) for 2.6 million watersheds in the conterminous US with first-order approximations of relationships between stressors and six watershed functions: hydrologic regulation, regulation of water chemistry, sediment regulation, hydrologic connectivity, temperature regulation, and habitat provision. Results show high integrity in the western US, intermediate integrity in the southern and eastern US, and the lowest integrity in the temperate plains and lower Mississippi Valley. Correlation between the six functional components was high (r = 0.85-0.98). A related Index of Catchment Integrity (ICI) was developed using local drainages of individual stream segments (i.e., excluding upstream information). We evaluated the ability of the IWI and ICI to predict six continuous site-level indicators with regression analyses three biological indicators and principal components derived from water quality, habitat, and combined water quality and habitat variables using data from EPA's National Rivers and Streams Assessment. Relationships were highly significant, but the IWI only accounted for 1-12% of the variation in the four biological and habitat variables. The IWI accounted for over 25% of the variation in the water quality and combined principal components nationally, and 32-39% in the Northern and Southern Appalachians. We also used multinomial logistic regression to compare the IWI with the categorical forms of the three biological indicators. Results were consistent: we found positive associations but modest results. We compared how the IWI and ICI predicted the water quality PC relative to agricultural and urban land use. The IWI or ICI are the best predictors of the water quality PC for the CONUS and six of the nine ecoregions, but they only perform marginally better than agriculture in most instances. However, results suggest that agriculture would not be appropriate in all parts of the country, and the index is meant to be responsive to all stressors. The IWI in its present form (available through the StreamCat website; https://www.cpa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat) could be useful for management efforts at multiple scales, especially when combined with information on site condition. The IWI could be improved by incorporating empirical or literature-derived relationships between functional components and stressors. However, limitations concerning the absence of data for certain stressors should be considered.

AB  - The class of restless bandits as proposed by Whittle (1988) have long been known to be intractable. This paper presents an optimality result which extends that of Weber and Weiss (1990) for restless bandits to a more general setting in which individual bandits have multiple levels of activation but are subject to an overall resource constraint. The contribution is motivated by the recent works of Glazebrook et al. (2011a), (2011b) who discussed the performance of index heuristics for resource allocation in such systems. Hitherto, index heuristics have been shown, under a condition of full indexability, to be optimal for a natural Lagrangian relaxation of such problems in which a resource is purchased rather than constrained. We find that under key assumptions about the nature of solutions to a deterministic differential equation that the index heuristics above are asymptotically optimal in a sense described by Whittle. We then demonstrate that these assumptions always hold for three-state bandits.

AB  - Genotype x environment interactions of individual traits have been assessed in numerous experiments with forest trees. However, since breeding programs rarely aim at the improvement of a single trait, the impact of G x E on index or composite traits must also be assessed. In a study with 12-year-old loblolly pine families in the southeastern U.S., GxE variance was of relatively little importance compared to genetic variance for wood density but was of greater significance for several growth traits. An index that combined stem volume and wood density to improve dry weight but maintain wood density constant (restricted selection index) resulted in substantially greater Gx E variance compared to either of the component traits. The interaction variance of an index trait is shown to be a function of the index coefficients and the GxE variances and covariances for its constituent traits. As a result, for some conditions it surpasses the magnitude of G x E variance for each component trait.

AB  - Landscape change associated with urbanization poses major challenges to aquatic ecosystems. Extensive studies have shown that the composition of land cover within a watershed can account for much of the variability in water quality and stream ecological conditions. While several studies have addressed the relationship between watershed urbanization and biotic integrity in streams, few have directly addressed the question of how urban patterns influence ecological conditions. These studies typically correlate changes in ecological conditions with simple aggregated measures of urbanization (e.g., human population density or percent impervious surface). We develop an empirical study of the impact of urban development patterns on stream ecological conditions in 42 sub-basins in the Puget Sound lowland region on a gradient of urbanization. We hypothesize that ecological conditions in urbanizing landscapes are influenced through biophysical changes by four urban pattern variables: land use intensity, land cover composition, landscape configuration, and connectivity of the impervious area. Using community measures of benthic macroinvertebrates as indicators of in-stream biotic integrity we examined the relationships between urban development patterns and ecological conditions in these basins. Significant statistical relationships were found between landscape patterns - both amount and configuration of impervious area and forest land-and biotic integrity of streams suggesting that patterns of urban development matter to aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - This paper presents a brief outline of the theoretical and conceptual fundamentals for the derivation of an ecosystem oriented indicator system to demonstrate the state of ecological entities on a holistic basis. There are two branches of argumentation: on a normative level, the sustainability principle is interpreted from an anthropocentric point-of-view; sustainability in this context means to provide ecosystem services on a broad scale and a long-term basis, including the attempt to avoid unspecific ecological risks. A second line-of-argumentation bases on the principles of ecosystem analysis and the theory of ecological orientation. Consequently, the aspired indicandum is the self-organising capacity of ecosystems, and the indicator sets represents an aggregate of structural and functional ecosystem features in a developing environment. The indicator set is demonstrated by one case study from the Bornhoeved Lakes ecosystem research project. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the impact of environmental factors (index of agricultural production quality, forest cover rate, forest fragmentation index, the share of different habitat types, and selected meteorological factors) on the value of kidney fat index (KFI) and carcass weight of roe deer Capreolus capreolus. The research material consisted of 344 individuals of roe deer C. capreolus over the age of 3 years (296 bucks and 48 does). Roe deer for testing were obtained from 15 forest districts in the Lublin region, Poland. The KFI and carcass weight were measured. A multiple regression model was used to assess the impact of a number of environmental factors on the value of KFI in roe deer. The study showed no significant differences in KFI values between bucks and does. Indicators of the body condition of bucks were positively affected by the share of habitats occupied by fresh mixed deciduous forest and the index of agricultural production quality. The share of habitats with fresh coniferous forest and fresh mixed deciduous forest as well as the fragmentation of forests, had a positive influence on the KFI values and carcass weight of does. This study shows that the management of roe deer populations should take into account the impact of landscape structure and habitat quality.

AB  - There is a growing need to better understand and communicate multi-dimensional river ecosystem processes and properties at the catchment scale for both scientific research and integrated catchment management. Data visualisation is believed as a very useful approach to support this need. However, there is a lack of visualisation applications tailored for river ecosystems, especially for visualising both river environmental data and their spatial and topological relations. To fill up the gap, this paper introduces an R package rivervis, which has been developed as a free, easy-to-use and efficient visualisation solution for river ecosystems. This novel tool is able to visualise riverine data in a compact and comparable way, with retaining the river network topology and reflecting real distance between sites of interest. The rivervis package visualises variables according to their measurement types either quantitative or qualitative/semi-quantitative data. This type-based principle makes the package applicable for a wide range of scenarios with data in forms of index values, condition gradings and categories. By producing topological river network diagrams, the package helps to understand the functioning and interconnections of riverine ecosystem at the catchment scale, especially the longitudinal upstream downstream and tributary-mainstream connectivity and relationships. It can also be used to study the associations between biological communities, physical conditions and anthropogenic activities. The Ballinderry River Basin in the UK, as a data-rich river basin with a reasonable complex river network, is used to demonstrate the rationale, functions and capabilities of the R-package.

AB  - A benthic index for northern Gulf of Mexico estuaries has been developed and successfully validated by the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program for Estuaries (EMAP-E) in the Louisianian Province. The benthic index is a useful and valid indicator of estuarine condition that is intended to provide environmental managers with a simple tool for assessing the ecological condition of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Associations between the benthic index and indicators of hypoxia, sediment contamination, and sediment toxicity were investigated to determine the most probable cause(s) of degraded benthic condition. The results showed that, on a local scale, the associations between the benthic index and potential environmental causes differed among estuaries. In Pensacola Bay, FL, for example, there was a significant association between the levels of toxic chemicals (e.g. DDT, silver, and TBT) in the sediment and the benthic index, especially in the bayous which have known sediment contamination problems. In Mobile Bay, however, degraded benthic communities were more closely associated with eutrophication and hypoxia. Nevertheless, a benthic index is a valuable tool for identifying areas that could be already degraded and tracking the status of environmental condition in large geographical regions.

A case study was applied for the analysis of sand extraction enterprises, in the region of Descalvado and Analandia, inland of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Environmental vulnerability scores were attributed for the indicators related to erosion, hydrological resources and biodiversity loss. This methodological proposal allowed analyzing the local alternatives of certain enterprise with the objective of reducing impacts and at the same time reducing the costs of environmental compensation. The application of the methodology significantly reduced the subjectivity degree usually associated to the most of the methodologies of impact evaluation.

AB  - Landfill leachate contains complex, resistant, and diverse compounds that are considered as an environmental health problem. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of integrated homogeneous catalytic ozonation and electrochemical process for improving the biodegradability of landfill. This experimental study was conducted on real landfill leachate on the laboratory scale. The variables were current density (O-3/H2O2-42.1 mA/cm(2)), ozone concentrations (100-400 mg/h), the initial pH (3-9), and the reaction times (1-6 h). The optimum operating condition was obtained at 1.42 mA/m(2), 400 mg/h of ozone concentration, initial pH of 3, during 3 h. In the proposed integrated catalytic ozonation-electrochemical process, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) concentrations were removed to 3381.9 and 1521.8 mg/L, respectively. Under the optimum condition, the biodegradability index increased from 0.27 to 0.45. The results showed that the electro-catalytic ozonation process has a significant effect on the biodegradability index and could improve the removal efficiency of landfill leachate treatments.

AB  - We examine the sustainability of seawater desalination plants using Inclusive Impact Index light (Triple-I light). This index quantifies the environmental and economic impact of a human activity through estimations of ecological footprint, biocapacity, cost, and benefit. The seawater desalination plants we treated are a multistage flash distillation (MSF) type and a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane type in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Our calculations demonstrate that the indexes for the two plants are raised mainly by large ecological footprints. By conducting a sensitivity analysis with varying a few parameters, we reveal that the total amount of water supply can largely change the sustainability of the plants, and propose that reductions in electric power consumption can be a feasible strategy to keep these plants in sustainable condition. We show that if we can supply about 40-50% of the total power consumption for the desalination plants using renewable energy sources, the sustainable operation is achievable. These percentages can be used as the target value of the introduction of renewable energy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Crabs in Alaska support large fisheries that have been unstable because of wide fluctuations in recruitment. Data from bottom-trawl and pot surveys and commercial fisheries were used directly to derive relative recruitment series for 15 stocks of red king (Paralithodes camtschatincus), blue king (P. platypus), Tanner (Chionoecetes bairdi), and snow (C. opilio) crabs in the Gulf of Alaska, along the Aleutian Islands, and in the Bering Sea. Recruitment to most stocks is periodic and strongly autocorrelated. Year-class strength of red king crab stocks in Bristol Bay, in the northern Gulf of Alaska, and along the Aleutian Islands has similar trends and has been weak since the mid-1970s: year-class strength of Tanner crab stocks in the northern Gulf of Alaska has been weak since the early 1980s. Tanner crab recruitment patterns differ between the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska stocks. Recruitment trends in 7 of 15 crab stocks appear to be related to decadal climate shifts, periods of strong winter Aleutian Lows coinciding with periods of weak recruitment. Strong vertical mixing and an unstable water column associated with a strong Aleutian Low inhibits growth of Thalassiosira spp., diatoms that provide high-quality nutrition to early zoeal stages of crab larvae. Recruitment of many crab stocks may also be influenced by local conditions not indexed by the Aleutian Low. (C) 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

AB  - The state of the environment continues declining despite improved global responses towards environmental protection. This mismatch could be because government policymakers and bureaucrats tend to focus on the tangible and controllable aspects of interventions - such as resources and actions - rather than the consequences of these interventions. We test this assumption by classifying governance indicators in the environmental sector according to a logic model: an evidence-based causal chain articulating the causes, effects and consequences of management interventions. In this paper, we synthesized consensus on logic models and developed a decision tree to classify governance indicators depending on whether they measured inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts. We then applied this decision tree to indicators from the South African government's national environmental outcomes delivery agreement and found that environmental governance indicators tended to be at the activity or output levels. The shortage of indicators at the outcome level may explain why the state of the environment continues declining despite the environmental sector consistently meeting governance targets. Inappropriately aligned environmental governance indicators mean that officials work on interventions without knowing whether these are effective or not. Therefore, the environmental sector should prioritise the monitoring of the effectiveness of government interventions, rather than the interventions themselves.

AB  - Chemical, physical and biological environmental stressors may affect the endocrine system, such as the thyroid hormone (TH) axis in larval amphibians with consequences for energy partitioning among development, growth and metabolism. We studied the effects of two TH level affecting compounds, exogenous l-thyroxine (T-4) and sodium perchlorate (SP), on various measures of development and body condition in larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis). We calculated the scaled mass index, hepatosomatic index and relative tail muscle mass as body condition indices to estimate fitness. Altered TH levels significantly altered the growth, development, survival and body condition in metamorphic larvae in different directions. While exogeno us T-4 reduced growth and accelerated development, SP treatment increased growth but slowed down development. Altered TH levels improved body conditions in both treatments and particularly in larvae of the SP treatment but to the detriment of lower survival rates in both TH level altering treatments. The hepatosomatic index was negatively affected by exogenous T-4, but not by SP treatment indicating a lower lipid reserve in the liver in larvae of T-4 treatment. These altered TH levels as caused by several environmental stressors may have an influence on individual fitness across life, as body condition at the onset of metamorphosis determines metamorphic and juvenile survival. Further research is needed to determine synergetic effects of environmental stressors on TH levels and its effects on physiological traits such as metabolic rate.

AB  - Human activities during recent decades have led to increased degradation of the river water environment in South Asia. This degradation has led to concerns for the populations of the major cities of Nepal, including those of the Kathmandu Valley. The deterioration of the rivers in the valley is directly linked to the prevalence of poor sanitary conditions, as well as the presence of industries that discharge their effluents into the river. This study aims to investigate the water quality aspect for the aquatic ecosystems and recreation of the major rivers in the Kathmandu Valley using the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment water quality index (CCME WQI). Ten physicochemical parameters were used to determine the CCME WQI at 20 different sampling locations. Analysis of the data indicated that the water quality in rural areas ranges from excellent to good, whereas in denser settlements and core urban areas, the water quality is poor. The study results are expected to provide policy-makers with valuable information related to the use of river water by local people in the study area.

AB  - Many tropical wetlands threatened by land use changes, or modifications in hydrological regime require effective management policies and implementation to protect them. The Abras de Mantequilla wetland, located in the Guayas River Basin in Ecuador, is subject to two major environmental disturbances, i.e., short-term agriculture (rice, maize) on the land around the wetland and the effects of planned infrastructure works of the Baba dam in the upper catchment. Both activities are expected to be the main constraints for the future wetland health. The objective of this study was to provide an initial characterization of the biotic communities of the river and wetland habitats before the dam starts operating. Plankton, macroinvertebrates, fishes and associated physical and chemical variables were sampled at 12 sites during the wet season (February 2011).
   Biotic metrics (abundance, taxa richness, diversity and evenness) were computed for the aquatic communities in the wetland and the river. A biotic index (Biological Monitoring Working Party-Colombia/adaptation) was applied to the macroinvertebrate community. Relationships between biotic and abiotic variables indicated nutrients, velocity and sediment type as main drivers. Cluster analysis grouped physico-chemical variables according to river or wetland sites. Similarities regarding the taxa composition among sites were explored with non-metric multidimensional scaling method (NMDS), showing clusters for ichthyoplankton and macroinvertebrates.
   Higher densities of organisms were recorded in the wetland compared with the river. The wetland is an important area of breeding and reproduction for fish communities, with its lentic habitats promoting the development of high densities of ichthyoplankton. In order to achieve sustainable solutions for integrated river-wetland systems, management options should focus on maintaining natural variation in hydrodynamic conditions throughout the entire catchment, as well as implement good practices in agriculture and reforestation using native species. Local and national authorities should support continuous monitoring programmes, taking account of seasonal variation and of future impacts from flow reduction and nutrient enrichment.

AB  - The current study was designed to gain deep insight into the geochemical nature as well as to assess the marine sediment quality of the Alexandria coast along the Mediterranean Sea. The geochemical analysis revealed that calcium carbonate is the predominant form of carbonate in most of the stations compared to magnesium form. Furthermore, total phosphorus has a concentration range of 0.10-0.28% relating to different environmental conditions. The TOC/TN ratio <10 (ten stations) suggesting a predominant marine origin, and the ratio exceeded 10 at five stations reflecting a mixture of terrestrial and marine materials. The Sr/Ca ratio is firstly examined along the Alexandria coast for describing the diagenetic effects of calcite recrystallization. The higher Sr/Ca ratio which was identified at four stations (>8.8 mmol mol(-1)) may coincide with sea level regressions. The studied elements in sediments showed the distribution pattern: Ca>Al>K>Fe>Mg>Ba>Sr>Mn>B>Zn>Pb>Cr>Cu>Ni. The environmental hazards associated with metals were assessed by different approaches. According to sediment quality guidelines (SQGs): none of the studied heavy metals exceeded the probable effect level (PEL) except Cr at Rashid station. The enrichment factor of lead (EFPb) > 10 in 87% of the sites, revealing an anthropogenic input of lead. Based on the ecological contamination index (ECI), all sites except Rashid were classified as uncontaminated. The principal component analysis was applied to understand the sources and pathways of the studied parameters. (C) 2019 National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries. Hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The genotype-environment (GE) interaction of barley doubled haploid (DH) lines was studied in relation to some malting quality characters. DH lines were obtained, using the bulbosum method, from F-1 hybrids between the cultivars 'Grit' and 'Havila'. Thirty DH lines, the parental forms, F-2 and F-3 hybrids of 'Grit' x 'Havila' and the standard cultivar 'Rudzik' were studied in a series of field experiments repeated at six environments. Malt protein content, Kolbach index, extract yield and malt fine-coarse difference were measured. The statistical analysis was performed using the computer program SERGEN. For protein content, it was found that most of the lines studied were stable, i.e. their GE interactions were not significant. Among the malt traits, phenotypic values of Kolbach index and fine-coarse difference were most dependent on environmental conditions. For Kolbach index, only one line was found to be stable, while for fine-coarse difference, all lines displayed interaction with the environment.

AB  - The dissemination of information on water quality for a non-specialist audience is essential to support political and institutional actions for the management of aquatic environments. Therefore, water quality indices have been proposed since they are able to synthesize into a single value or category information, usually described from an extensive set of water quality variables. This research proposes a new water quality index, based on fuzzy logic, aimed at lotic environments, developed through the collaboration of experts in water quality of the Rio de Janeiro Environmental Agency (Instituto Estadual do Ambiente - INEA). The proposed index was applied to water quality data from the Paraiba do Sul River, obtained by INEA, in the years 2002 to 2009. The results of IQA(FAL) showed that the index was able to synthesize the water quality of this stretch of the Paraiba do Sul, satisfactorily matching the assessments of the water quality assessments contained in the reports available. It was also noticed that with this methodology it was possible to avoid the attenuation of the influence of a variable in critical condition was attenuated by the influence of other variables in favorable conditions, producing an inaccurate result in the final index.

AB  - This paper measures the regional oceanic economic performance in China's 11 coastal areas from 2007 to 2014 using a dynamic growth efficiency framework. We construct a new global Malmquist ocean performance index (GMOPI), which integrates the global benchmark technology with the slacks-based measure (SBM) and Malmquist-Luenberger (ML) productivity index. This index can successfully eliminate a common infeasibility problem encountered in ML cross-period problem. Furthermore, the labour input, capital input, economic output, and environmental output contribution indexes are proposed by internally decomposing the GMOPI, which can explain which factor could bias technological progress. The empirical results indicate two different modes of China's oceanic economic growth during the examined time period, i.e., a volatility phase (2007-2010) and a stability phase (2011-2014). Moreover, the factor contribution indexes show that the low contribution scores for environmental integrity and capital in the volatility phase.

AB  - The objective of this study was to biomonitor the effects of potential environmental pollutants in urban-stream waters, on fish health. Pale chub (Zacco platypus), a dominant species in the Korea urban stream waters, was chosen and biomonitoring indicators for the different spatial characteristics were tailored in an urban watershed. Biological responses including biotic-somatic index as well as gonadal development phase and plasma steroids levels, and the biochemical responses, ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, were measured. No significant difference was observed in the length-weight relationship between the up-stream waters and the down-stream waters. However, changes in the gonad-somatic index (GSI) levels, plasma 17 beta-estradiol (E2) levels, and mature oocyte frequencies in the female fish collected during the spawning season were observed in the down-stream waters at each monitoring site. Moreover, intersex condition (testis ova) in the male fish in down-stream waters was recorded, even if it was just one fish. Although no significant difference was observed in the EROD and AChE activities between the up-stream waters and the down-stream waters, changes in the reproductive biomarker levels, including the GSI levels, plasma E2 levels, and gonadal maturation, lead to variable biomonitoring endpoints between the spatial different sites. These results imply that exposure to the down-stream waters can cause reproductive impairment in wild Z. platypus, individual variability in the biological responses further indicate the reproductive health was affected more by the down-stream waters than the up-stream waters. The finding from this study can provide the biomonitoring endpoint on the wild fish health in urban watershed that is crucial to the early risk assessment of its biological impacts. More multibiomarkers studies reflecting the variation in the biological organization of wild fish and, therefore, the effects of urban-stream waters in the fish health are warranted.

AB  - Between 2014 and 2017, the Rivers to Reef to Turtles (RRT) project examined the health of green turtles at two coastal sites impacted by urban and agricultural human activities (Cleveland and Upstart Bays) and one proposed pristine site (Howick Group of Reefs) in northern Queensland, Australia, through blood biochemistry and haematology, plasma protein electrophoresis, and clinical assessments including body condition and barnacle counts. Furthermore, cases of mortality were subjected to comprehensive postmortem examination. In an attempt to advance diagnostics, associations between specific contaminants and health of turtles in this region were tested. No comprehensive health assessments had been conducted at these sites prior to this study.
   The coastal Cleveland and Upstart Bays both demonstrated effects likely to be in response to stressors suspected to be anthropogenic in origin (elevated total white cell counts and creatinine kinase levels across the populations, respectively). This was associated with a suite of trace elements, in particular cobalt. While these indicators of stress resolved by the final year of the study, a chronic stressor was suspected to be persisting with ongoing low albumin: globulin. Necropsies did not elucidate any specific diseases.
   Although body condition index did not closely correlate with site health, barnacle counts in juvenile turtles may prove a reliable indicator of site health. Based on previously established indicators of poor health, barnacle counts showed that 10% of the population was in poor health at Upstart Bay and nearly 20% of the population at Cleveland Bay. This is above what would be expected for a normal population.
   Overall, the health component of this study suggested that the pristine turtle population was healthy and the coastal turtle populations were under active stressors, possibly caused by anthropogenic effectors such as chemical pollutants, when initially examined in 2014. These stressors resolved by the conclusion of the study in 2017; but chronic stressors remained absent in the pristine site and present within each of the studied coastal populations.

AB  - Recent reports have demonstrated gonadal abnormalities in the Lake Van fish (Alburnus tarichi) from Lake Van caused by increasing pollution. In the present study, the fish was collected from an area of Lake Van receiving mainly sewage treatment plant effluent at prespawning period (April) and from a river (Karasu) which is close to the polluted area of the lake and where the fish migrates at spawning period (May). Collected specimens were examined for testicular alterations, gonadosomatic index (GSI), condition factor (CF), and antioxidant defense system biomarkers based on comparison with a reference lake (Ercek) and a reference freshwater inlet (Memedik River). Histological examinations of the testes of fish from the polluted area and the connected river showed various alterations consisting of macrophage aggregates, vacuolation, pyknosis, germ cell degeneration, seminiferous tubule dilation, disorganization of tubules, reduced spermatozoa, and fibrosis. A lower GSI and CF were also observed. Moreover, alterations in the antioxidant system biomarkers were determined in the testis tissues of fish from the Lake Van and Karasu River, indicating oxidative stress. These results suggest that the abnormalities in the testes are causally related to the increased oxidative stress, and pollution in Lake Van may have adversely affected the reproductive health of the lake Van fish.

AB  - This paper reports simulation results of oscillatory cool flame burning of an isolated, submillimeter sized n-heptane (n-C7H16) droplet in a selectively ozone (O-3) seeded nitrogen-oxygen (N-2-O-2) environments at atmospheric pressure. An evolutionary one-dimensional droplet combustion code encompassing relevant physics and detailed chemistry was employed to explore the roles of low-temperature chemistry, O-3 seeding, and dynamic flame structure on burning behaviors. For X-02 = 21% and a range of selective ozone seeding, near-quasi-steady cool flame burning is achieved directly (without requiring hot flame initiation and radiative extinction). Under low oxygen index conditions, but with significant O-3 seeding (X-03 = 5%), a nearly quasisteady cool flame is initially established that then transitions to a dynamically oscillating cool flame burning mode which continues until the droplet is completely consumed. It is found that the oscillation occurs as result of a initial depletion of fuel vapor-oxidizer layer evolving near the droplet surface and its dynamic re-establishment through liquid vaporization and vapor/oxidizer transport. A kinetic analysis indicates that the dynamic competition between the reaction classes- (a) degenerate chain branching and (b) chain termination/propagation - along with continuous fuel and oxygen leakage through the flame location contributes to an oscillatory burning phenomena of ever-increasing amplitude. Analysis based on single full-cycle of oscillatory burning shows that the reaction progression matrices (evolution of heat and species) for QOOH -> chain propagation/termination reactions (here, Q = C7H14-) directly scales with the gas phase temperature field. On the contrary, the QOOH -> degenerate branching reactions undergoes three distinct stages within the same oscillatory cycle. The coupled flame dynamics and kinetics suggest that in the oscillatory burning mode, kinetic processes dynamically cross through conditions characterizing the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) turnover temperature, separating low temperature and NTC kinetic regimes. In addition, a parametric study is conducted to determine the role of O-3 seeding level on the observed oscillation phenomena. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study investigated the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in water and sediment samples of the Diep River freshwater system of Western Cape Province, South Africa. A solid-phase extraction - gas chromatography - flame ionisation detection (SPE-GC-FID) method was utilised to simultaneously determine the 16 United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) listed priority PAHs in water and sediment samples. The seasonal averages of individual PAH detected at the studied sites, ranged between not detected (Nd) and 72.38 +/- 9.58 mu g/L in water samples and between Nd and 16.65 +/- 2.63 mu g/g in the corresponding sediment samples. The levels of PAHs measured in water and sediment samples were subjected to probabilistic risk assessment to predict the possibility of regulatory values being exceeded. The average percentage exceedence of 63.26 was obtained for PAHs in water samples of the Diep River, while the corresponding average percentage exceedence obtained for sediment sample was 63.71. Sufficient exposure of humans and aquatic organisms to the exceedance levels obtained, would cause adverse health effect.

AB  - Despite the identification of early-warning signals precluding ecosystems regime shifts, limited evidence exists that they can be used to forecast the actual timing of a critical shift. Here, we propose a probabilistic Bayesian approach to forecast the timing of a shift by combining uncertain prior information about the ecosystem dynamics (parameters and drivers) and sampled spatial and temporal correlation and variance of ecosystem states, which are well known early-warning signals. For an ecosystem of logistically growing vegetation under linear increase in grazing pressure, we show that the use of sampled early-warning signals results in lower prediction uncertainty in forecasted timing of shifts compared to forecasts made with sampled mean state variables. In addition, we show that uncertainty in ecosystem parameters decreases well ahead of a shift. An important conclusion of our study is that the use of early-warning signals in forecasting of shifts is promising, provided that a large number of samples are collected (n approximate to 10(4) in our study). This explains the limited success of finding early warning signals from field studies of real world ecosystems.

AB  - An important requirement for meeting obligations under the European Water Framework Directive is the development of a fish-based index that is able to predict the ecological status of surface waters, and particularly be able to distinguish between (nearly) pristine and disturbed conditions. The European Fish Index (EFI), based on the concept of the Index of Biological Integrity, was developed alongside alternative models such as the Spatially Based Method on a European level (SBM-EU), for this purpose. A critical issue about these models is that they are simple to use but are able to predict whether a site is disturbed with a high degree of precision. From this perspective, two prediction errors need to be small: falsely declaring a site disturbed when it is not (false-positive error; FP) and wrongly classifying a disturbed site as undisturbed (false-negative error, FN). For the EFI, the overall FP rate was 22% and the FN rate was 19%. The performance was better for the SBM-EU method with a smaller FP rate of 7% and an FN rate of 20%, but the EFI is preferred because, with only marginal loss of precision, it is far less complex. The EFI consists of a single model based on 10 fish metrics, while the SBM-EU comprises 12 models covering 49 metrics. Comparison of the EFI with existing national or regional fish-based assessment methods found major discrepancies that make intercalibration between these methods impractical.

AB  - The electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique is one of the most promising structural health monitoring (SHM) approaches for material damage detection, which is based on impedance measurements of low-cost piezoelectric transducers. However, numerous practical issues such as signal noise effects caused by environmental conditions can alter signal measurements and limit the capabilities of the EMI technique when the characterization of damage is performed using conventional basic indices. Therefore, this paper proposes a new index for structure feature extraction based on the cross-correlation signal processing technique that can be applied in real noisy environment. The proposed index was evaluated in the frequency domain, where the damage detection is performed directly on the electrical impedance measurements of the transducer, as well as on the time domain, which is based on the wavelet transform applied to the transducer response signal. Experimental tests were carried out on a damaged aluminium structure subject to various signal noise levels. Experimental results revealed that the proposed approach for material feature extraction under noisy environments proved to be effective for detecting damage, thus enhancing the reliability and expanding the applicability of the EMI technique.

AB  - Water temperature exhibits a strong influence on the regional variability in activity of the 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) in the liver of dab (Limanda limanda) from the German Eight during the spawning and postspawning seasons. The relationship between EROD activity and water temperature found in situ was, surprisingly, not masked by migrations of dab. Correlations between EROD activity and temperature could not be explained by a direct temperature effect in terms of temperature compensation. Instead, we suppose that temperature influences EROD activity indirectly via its influence on the duration of the gonadal cycle and thus on the time of spawning, which we assume to be coupled with the seasonal variation in EROD activity. Significant negative correlations between EROD activity and the condition factor, gonadosomatic index, and liver-length index could be attributed to the parallel or opposite temporal changes of these parameters. In the liver of spawning females, no linear relationship was detected between the EROD activity and the concentration of the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), which have been previously determined.

AB  - Droughts pose significant economic and ecological concerns, and considering climate change projections, timely monitoring and early warning based on satellite observations must be realized at regional to global scales. Nevertheless, whether data reconstruction is necessary to produce high-quality satellite-based time series data for drought monitoring and the data reconstruction approaches to be applied, if necessary, remain unclear. We attempted to fill this knowledge gap by investigating three widely used data reconstruction approaches, i.e., the Savitzky-Golay filter, harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) and Whittaker Smoother, across the Lancang-Mekong river basin through the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD13Q1 and MOD11A2 products for 2001-2018 and Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Several remote sensing drought indices based on the unreconstructed and reconstructed vegetation indices (VIs) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were retrieved for basin-wide drought detection. The performance of the examined reconstruction approaches was evaluated using three statistical indices (coefficient of determination (R2), standard deviation of bias (BIAS(std)) and mean squared error (MSE)), spatial consistency with the reference dataset and capability to characterize the drought events. Data reconstruction considerably enhanced the drought index performances for drought detection; however, reconstruction was not necessary in all situations. The reconstructed drought indices exhibited higher R2 values (by 10.6-10.8%), lower BIAS(std) values (by - 1.7- -12.5%), and smaller MSE values (by - 5.8- -13.4%) compared to those of unreconstructed indices. For most evaluation indicators, HANTS outperformed the other methods, and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) outperformed the other drought indices. The findings highlight the importance of data reconstruction to detect and characterize drought events and the dependency of the performance of reconstruction methods on drought indices and evaluation metrics when using MODIS time series data.

AB  - SFG and physiological rates were measured in wild mussels from the Spanish Marine Pollution monitoring program (SMP) in order to determine seawater quality. It consists of 41 stations, covering almost 2500 km of coast, making the SMP the widest-ranging monitoring network in the Iberian Peninsula's Atlantic region. Results of the 2007 and 2008 surveys when 39 sites were sampled: (20 in 2007 and 19 in 2008, being 8 sites sampled both years) were presented. Chemical analyses were carried out to determine the relationships between physiological rates and the accumulation of toxic compounds. Data presented are the first to become available on the use of SFG as a biomarker of the marine environment on a large spatial scale (>1000 km) along Spain's Atlantic seaboard.
   SFG values enable significant differences to be established between the areas sampled and between the two years surveyed. The integration of biological and chemical data suggests that certain organochlorine compounds, namely chlordanes and DDTs, may have a negative effect on SFG, although such an effect is of a lesser magnitude than that associated with certain biological parameters such as condition index and mussel age. These variables act as confounding factors when attempting to determine the effect of chemical compounds present in the marine environment on mussel SFG. Further research is therefore needed on the relation between these confounding factors and SFG in order to apply the relevant corrective strategies to enable this index to be used in monitoring programs. The effect of these confounding factors is more clearly revealed in studies that cover a wide-ranging spatial and time scale, such as those carried out within the SMP. These results do not invalidate the use of biological data in monitoring programs, but rather point to the need to analyze all the factors affecting each biological process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The influence that catchment development has on the growth and survival of the Sydney rock oyster, through its effect on the quality and quantity of seston was investigated in Brisbane Water and Lake Macquarie. Developed locations recorded elevated levels of dissolved nitrogen (NH3 and NQ(x) and chlorophyll a compared to undeveloped locations. Total particulate matter (TPM), particulate inorganic matter (PIM), particulate organic matter (POM), particulate carbon (PC) and particulate nitrogen (PN) were All significantly higher at developed locations in both estuaries. The PC/Chl a ratios were high, indicating that the seston was comprised of detrital matter as opposed to living phytoplankton, yet the C/N ratios were low compared to those expected of estuarine conditions. Sydney rock oysters cultured at the developed locations attained a greater mean shell length and live weight than those,cultured at undeveloped locations however higher mortality rates were observed at developed locations. In Brisbane Water, seston quantity measures (TPM, PIM, POM, PC, PN) were positively related to live weight growth rate (GR) while shell length GR was negatively related to salinity. In Lake Macquarie, POM had a positive relationship with oyster live weight GR while shell length GR also had an inverse relationship with salinity. Thus, elevated seston loads associated with low salinities contributed to increased oyster growth at the developed locations where run-off is high. The concentration of the seston was therefore the controlling factor in the growth of oysters cultured in Brisbane Water and Lake Macquarie. The seston quality ratios indicated that the detrital, particulate component of the seston was high-quality food for bivalves, possibly due to associated microbial biomass. In New South Wales (NSW), a high proportion of oyster leases are located in estuaries sourced by developed catchments and the results of this study will be of interest to resource managers and oyster farmers.

AB  - Caged compounds are molecules whose biological function is masked until UV light induces a photo-chemical reaction that converts the molecules into a biologically active state. These probes provide very powerful tools in cell biology research, since the activation can be precisely controlled temporally and spatially by limiting their exposure to light. This report describes a simple caged compound illuminator that can be attached to an inverted microscope; it can simultaneously provide both sufficient UV illumination for photoactivation and epifluorescence excitation to monitor indicator fluorescence. As an example, we show that the cytoplasmic calcium level can be raised very rapidly by the photoactivation of a new caged compound, caged calcium ionophore DMNPE-A23187, and that this [Ca2+](i) increase is associated with tail retraction of motile keratocytes.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present a proposal of forest monitoring and an evaluation system adjusted for tropical forest restoration initiatives in support of decision-making, tracking and management in an offsetting policy context. This study is framed by the case study of the Rio de Janeiro State Environmental Agency (INEA RJ) in Southeastern Brazil. We tested a set of indicators to evaluate restoration projects up to 4 years since planting. After the data were collected, we developed a scorecard and tested it in the field, allowing the evaluation of project development on a scale from 0 to 10. This analysis indicates conformity or a need for adequacy. We measured 7853 individuals on 205 sample plots. The projects had an average age of 32 months in the range of 14-48 months. The average scorecard value was 5.87 points, and we adequately assessed ecosystem structure, composition, function, species composition and organization. We create an evaluation tool to support decision-makers as also the restoration practitioners' decisions. The main innovation was to popularize the forest monitoring among stakeholders independent of the technician's experience background, by offering a simple, accessible, and robust protocol.

AB  - Urban comprehensive carrying capacity is an important guarantee and external representation of regional sustainable development. Based on urban comprehensive carrying capacity, this paper constructed a performance evaluation index system of urban comprehensive carrying capacity, and used entropy method, urban comprehensive carrying capacity measurement model and urban sustainable development model to measure spatial and temporal comprehensive carrying capacity of Harbin City in Heilongjiang Province from 2012 to 2017. The results show that: 1) index weight analysis suggested the regional development mode in Harbin still followed an epitaxial development mode, which pursued the expansion of scale and the growth of total amount of regional development, neglecting the effective utilization of resources and the improvement of structural benefits. 2) In the pressure system, the index of resource support has dropped sharply. The index of environmental capacity and social progress has risen circuitously, while the degree of agglomeration and the value of transportation facilities have risen steadily; in the pressure system, the index of population development and economic growth tended to fluctuate, while energy consumption and environmental pollution showed a more synchronous change in characteristics, and the livable demand remained at a high level. 3) The carrying capacity index of resources and environment in Harbin has been declining, and the acquired carrying capacity index fluctuated. The long-term regional development model has severely impaired the carrying capacity of resources and environment. 4) The comprehensive carrying capacity of Harbin has clear spatial differentiation characteristics. Finally, the paper proposes that location conditions, economic development level, government regulation, and science and technology are the main factors influencing the spatial differentiation of urban comprehensive carrying capacity.

AB  - Three indexes of spatial aggregation are developed and used to examine the aggregation pattern of sardine (Sardinops sagax) and anchovy (Engraulis ringens) in the Peruvian Humboldt Current System, determined from 36 acoustic surveys conducted from 1983 through 2003 by the Peruvian Marine Institute (IMARPE). Each index assesses a different aspect of aggregation: the concentration, the percent occupancy of space and the clustering of high-fish abundance. Both time-series correlation and tree-based clustering-regression method, classification and regression trees (CART), were used to relate each of the indexes to environmental variables (season, temperature anomaly and year). Additionally, a measure of onshore-offshore distribution, the average distance from the coast, and abundance variables (the average acoustic backscatter per occupied sampling unit, and the acoustically estimated total abundance of sardine and anchovy from IMARPE) were related to environmental factors by using CART. We show that the 1983-2003 time series can be divided into three different periods: with shifts in 1992 and in 1997-98. Sardine and anchovy showed large differences in both abundance and aggregation among these periods. Although upwelling ecosystems support dramatic and sudden changes in environmental conditions, fish responses are sometimes smoother than usually suggested and there are transition periods with concomitant high biomasses of anchovy and sardine, but with different spatial aggregation patterns. Observed relationships between environmental proxies and aggregation patterns support the habitat-based hypothesis that environmentally mediated alterations in range lead to population changes.

AB  - The objective of this article is to address aggregate performance indicators in National Systems of Entrepreneurship from an efficiency perspective. Our assessment is based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) applied to data from the Index of Dynamic Entrepreneurship (IDE) for a sample of 60 countries. Besides providing information on the efficiency score of each country, this approach allowed the identification of benchmarks for best practices and the construction of an efficiency ranking. Findings offer guidance for refined entrepreneurship-oriented policies that take into account characteristics of heterogeneous socioeconomic contexts. Surprisingly, top-performing countries in the IDE ranking have relatively inefficient ecosystems while countries in the lowest positions generally demonstrate higher efficiency scores. Implications of our research encompass the need for policymakers to develop more in-depth knowledge concerning their own entrepreneurial ecosystems' attributes and productivity. Efficient systemic outcomes can be obtained through different configurations, so a hierarchical view of attributes limits the adequacy of policies for different contexts.

AB  - The concept of population viability is probabilistic in nature, usually being expressed through such indicators as 'expected extinction time', or 'probability of survival for 1000 years'. Such one-dimensional indicators might be adequate to characterize empirically-derived extinction risk in steady-state circumstances, such as in a long-established and undisturbed reserve. But they do not serve as well for evaluating viability in dynamically changing environments, nor for appraising the circumstantial evidence of risk provided by computer simulation of a stochastic population model. To characterize risk adequately in these circumstances requires describing a qualitative pattern of risk, sorting out short-term effects, due to initial population size and environmental state, from longer-term effects related to the character and quality of habitat. Furthermore, the relevant time-scales for the analysis depend upon the processes of change present in the habitat, including persistent effects from deliberate or inadvertent anthropogenic habitat manipulation. In the present study, alternative extinction risk indices and sustainability profiles are suggested, appropriate for formulating a risk management strategy in a dynamically changing environment. The concepts presented are applied to the problem of viability assessment of the endangered northern spotted owl, in the harvested temperate rainforest landscape of the U.S. Pacific Northwest.

AB  - The coastal ecosystems are recognized worldwide by their ecological an economic importance. In these ecosystems, aquatic life is governed by the abiotic variations, therefore, the interactions between natural stressors and anthropogenic pollution (multiple stressors) may represent an additional threat. Thus, considering these combined effects with the climate change scenarios, it is urgent to develop cost-effective tools to assess the impact of pollution on sensitive and important ecosystems, such as estuaries and coastal lagoons, and implement mitigation plans to prevent the environmental and human health degradation. In order to contribute to this crucial issue, the central objective of this study was to validate and propose an integrated methodology, including ecological and ecotoxicological parameters, to evaluate the effects of natural stressors and pollution on key estuarine fish in real scenarios, using the common goby Pomatoschistus microps (Kroyer, 1838), an important estuarine intermediary predator, as a bioindicator and a North Atlantic coastal lagoon (the Aveiro lagoon; NW coast of Portugal) as a case study area. The methodology included fourteen water quality variables, sediment characteristics, the concentrations of nine metals in sediments and in the fish body, fish condition indexes, eight biomarkers and multivariate statistics (Redundancy (RDA) and Principal Response Curves analysis (PRC)) to integrate the information provided by different parameters. The study was conducted over one year with seasonal sampling (winter, spring, summer and autumn) at four sampling sites with different contamination histories. The integrated approach suggested significant differences between the reference site and the remaining ones, both in biological and environmental descriptors. Bioaccumulation factors suggested that fish bioaccumulated some metals, especially Zn. The overall integration of all selected parameters and methods discriminated locations with different contaminated levels and associated health status of the selected species with multiple stressors. The present work represented a case-study, highlighting the use of biomarkers as early warning indicators of ecosystems health and stressing the importance of using an integration approach through multivariate analysis in biomonitoring studies, providing an important baseline and integrated information that may be used as scientific support for conservation and management and ecological models of estuarine and coastal lagoon systems.

AB  - Wooded biomes converted to human-modified landscapes (HML) are common throughout the tropics, yielding small and isolated forest patches surrounded by an agricultural matrix. Diverse anthropogenic interventions in HMLs influence patches in complex ways, altering natural dynamics. Assessing current condition or ecological integrity in these patches is a challenging task for ecologists. Taking the Brazilian Atlantic Forest as a case study, we used the conceptual framework of the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), a multimetric approach, to assess the ecological integrity of eight small forest patches in a highly disturbed HML with different configurations and histories. The IBI was developed using bird assemblages found in these patches, and its performance was compared with analytical approaches commonly used in environmental assessment, such as general richness and Shannon's diversity index. As a first step, the IBI procedure identifies an existing gradient of human disturbance in the study region and checks which biotic characteristics (candidate metrics) vary systematically across the gradient. A metric is considered valid when its' relationship with the gradient provides an ecological interpretation of the environment. Then, the final IBI is elaborated using each valid metric, obtaining a score for each site. Over one year of sampling, 168 bird species were observed, providing 74 different bird candidate metrics to be tested against the disturbance gradient. Seven of them were considered valid:richness of threatened species; richness of species that use both "forest and non-forest" habitats; abundance of endemics, abundance of small understory-midstory insectivores, abundance of exclusively forest species; abundance of non forest species, and abundance of species that forage exclusively in the midstory stratum. Each metric provided complementary information about the patch's ecological integrity. The resulting IBI showed a significant linear relationship with the gradient of human disturbance, while total species richness and Shannonis diversity index did not. Application of numerical approaches, such as total species richness and Shannon's diversity, did not distinguish ecological traits among species. The IBI proved better for assessing and interpreting ecological and environmental condition of small patches in highly disturbed HML. The IBI framework, its multimetric character, and the ease with which it can be adapted to diverse situations, make it an effective approach for assessing environmental conditions in the Atlantic Forest region, and also for many other small forest patches in the tropics.

AB  - The ecosystem services (ESS) approach seeks to identify and characterize links between ecosystems and human welfare. The DESSINESS evaluation framework is a novel methodology that has been developed to operationalize ecosystem service assessment, with a focus on urban freshwater settings. This paper describes an application of the framework to a retrospective case study in Aarhus, Denmark, which was used to test the framework and make suggestions for improvement. River restoration and wastewater management measures enhanced ecosystem state and the provision and use of purification and recreation ESS for selected beneficiaries, including increased economic values. Feedback from this case study suggests a missing link between science-based ESS approaches, which often have a normative basis in ecosystem status, and the real-world provision and use of ESS in urban settings. In the urban context, many ESS result from a combination of human and ecosystem inputs, and the human inputs can often be significant. Quantifying ESS provision and use therefore requires understanding how ecosystem and human inputs work together to make contributions to human welfare. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Attempts to increase European biodiversity by restoring rivers and floodplains are based on inadequate data on natural systems. This is particularly the case for NW European rivers because all catchments have been impacted by agriculture and river engineering. If river restoration is to have an ecological, as opposed to 'cosmetic' design basis then baseline models are required. However, this poses three questions; (a) what is the natural river-floodplain state, (b) how can it be defined and modelled and (c) can this state be recreated today? The first two questions can only be addressed by using palaeohydrological and palaeoecological data. A second and equally vital consideration is the stability/ instability of any restored system to change in external forcing factors (e.g. climate) and in this context it may not be realistic to expect baseline models to provide equilibrium solutions but instead to define process-form domains. Over the last two decades evidence has accumulated that the natural state of lowland rivers in much of NW Europe was multi rather than single thread-braided, anastomosing or anabranching. Until recently our knowledge of floodplain palaeoecology was generally derived from pollen diagrams, which have source-area of problems and lack of taxonomic specificity. The precision and breadth of palaeoccological reconstruction (including richness and structure) has been greatly increased by the use of multiple palaeo-indicators including macrofossils, diatoms and beetles. The dynamics of small to medium sized, low-energy, predeforestation floodplains were dominated by disturbance (windthrow, beavers, etc.) and large woody debris. In order to compare the hydrogeomorphological basis of floodplain ecology, both temporally and spatially, a simple index of fluvial complexity is presented. Palaeoecological and geomorphological investigations have the potential to provide in-depth models of the natural range of channel conditions and sensitivity to external change that can be used to provide a scientific basis for floodplain restoration. There is also the possibility that floodplain-channel restoration may be a valuable tool in the mitigation of future geomorphological change forced by climatic instability.

AB  - Absrtact The ecological state of the southern part of Lake Baikal was assessed in 2017 based on the phytoplankton and bacterioplankton structure. Nineteen functional groups were identified, five of which played the main role: Z (picocyanobacteria from oligotrophic lakes), L-O (dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria typical of mesotrophic lakes in summer), X1 (species typical of nutrient-rich shallow lakes), MP (mero- and tycho-planktonic species, mainly diatoms), and E (phytoflagellates typical of oligotrophic lakes). The values of community index Q, obtained on the basis of data on the structure of phytoplankton, indicated the excellent ecological status of the lake. Waters of the southern part of Lake Baikal were characterized as oligotrophic and oligosaprobic, while the waters on sites "Shamansky Cape" and "City of Baikalsk" tended to the mesotrophic and beta-mesosaprobic status according to the data on the chlorophyll a content and microbiological parameters. The absence of significant correlations between phyto- and bacterioplankton parameters may also indicate the oligotrophic status of coastal waters in the southern part of Lake Baikal.

AB  - The concept of naturalness is one of the more studied concepts in landscape preference research and describes how close a landscape is to a perceived natural state. In this study we explored the relationship between landscape preference and three landscape indicators of naturalness (level of succession, number of woodland patches and shape index of edges). We used computer-generated visualisations of a hypothetical landscape containing pasture and broadleaved woodland. In the landscape simulations we altered the values of the naturalness indicators between the levels of low, medium and high, creating 27 different visualisations. The survey wits distributed as an on-line survey in seven different languages and obtained 703 respondents. The study showed a strong relationship with preference for both the level of succession and number of woodland patches, and a weaker relationship with shape index of edges. The two demographic factors which were shown to contribute most to the formation of preference were gender and having a landscape related profession. The results suggest that the selected indicators are more important drivers of preference than demographic factors. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The time taken for ecosystems to recover from drought (drought recovery time) is critically important for the ecosystem state. However, recent literature presents contradictory conclusions on this feature: one study concludes that drought recovery time in the tropics and high northern latitudes is shortest (<4 months) but another concludes that it is longest (>12 months) in these regions. Here we explore the reasons for these contradictory results and revisit assessments of drought recovery time. We find that the study period, drought identification method and recovery level definition are main factors contributing to the contradictory conclusions. Further, we emphasize that including droughts that did not decrease ecosystem production or using a period of abnormal water availability to define ecosystem recovery level can strongly bias drought recovery time estimates. Based on our refined methods, we find the drought recovery time is also longest in some tropical regions but not in high northern latitudes during 1901?2010. Our study helps to resolve the recent controversy and provides insight for future drought recovery assessments.

AB  - The common whelk, Buccinum undatum L., was selected as a model host-parasite system in a seasonal study at an 'accumulating' sewage-sludge dump-site in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, where marked spatial concentration gradients exist for a variety of trace contaminants in the sediments. A total of 2808 whelks was examined from seven sites over 18 months. The prevalence of larval digenean parasites increased significantly with distance from the dump site from approximately 2% on its periphery to 15.1% at a reference site 3 km from the centre. At a second reference site, 13 km from the dumping area, 19.7% of Buccinum were parasitized. The effects of site, season, sex and parasitism on growth and condition of Buccinum and exposure to sewage sludge on the age-prevalence relationship and host response to infection were examined. Age-frequency distributions of Buccinum were used to compare various sources of mortalities (natural, fishing, pollution and parasite-induced). Patterns in parasite prevalence recorded at the dump site were not correlated with any natural environmental or host-related factors that were examined. The gradient in parasitism in Buccinum is considered to result principally from the toxic effects of trace metals on the miracidium, reducing parasite transmission to the molluscan host. The Buccinum-parasite system may therefore provide a sensitive and valuable biologically-based index of the dispersal of these contaminants around the sewage-sludge dump-site, and may have wider applications for marine environmental monitoring.

AB  - The relative condition factors (Kn) of the fishes Astyanax paranae, Phalloceros harpagos and Poecilia reticulata were used as a means of assessing the influence of environmental conditions on the well-being of sub - populations of these species, with the eventual aim of using them as bioindicators of disturbance in tributary streams of the Monjolinho River, in Sao Carlos - SP. The power-law curve generated by the length-weight relationship indicated a positive allometric growth for the three species studied. Overall, the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) positively correlated average Kn of A. paranae with well oxygenated and oligotrophic environments, typical of conserved areas or near the natural state. For the average value of Kn obtained for Phalloceros harpagos species, there was no significant difference between natural and disturbed areas. However, the CCA positively correlated the mean Kn of the species P. reticulata from similar environments with higher trophic level, suggesting that this species is indicative of disturbance.

AB  - Ecological integrity is a term often used to describe the state of ecosystems subjected to anthropogenic pressures. It is usually defined closely to the literal definition of integrity: being whole or unimpaired. Considering the deep changes our world is undergoing, we argue here for ecological indicators that are not restricted to naturalness targets. We propose a conceptual framework for so-called level-2 indicators of ecological integrity, that evaluate how the integrity of ecosystems is preserved given their naturalness context. We develop reference relationships between indicator and contextual variables and then assess how an ecosystem is doing, compared to others in similar contexts, by its distance to this reference. We explore two such relationships: the amount of aboveground phytomass an ecosystem stores in a given volume (biomass packing efficiency) and the mean patch size given the total habitat amount in the landscape (habitat connectivity). Using datasets at the national and worldwide scale, we show that these indicators are objective measures of ecological integrity that allow the comparison of plant stands and landscapes across different environmental and naturalness contexts. This framework provides a basis to evaluate if the state of an ecosystem is degrading and paves the way to a triage system prioritizing conservation and restoration actions.

AB  - Numerous methods have been developed to support the assessment of environmental flow requirements for rivers. Most methods are based around models of hydrologic time series rather than models of the ecological endpoints of interest. Important limitations that arise from this include (1) an inability to represent the state dependency of response to future conditions (i.e. the effects of current ecosystem condition on future condition), (2) the inability to predict ecological states through time under alternative flow regimes and (3) limited sensitivity to compare the differences between flow regimes with similar return intervals of ecologically important events, but different sequencing of those events. Here we outline a simple state-and-transition modelling approach to assess differences in ecological responses to alternative sequences of floodplain inundation events in a lowland river system. Our approach explicitly incorporates the state dependency of biotic response to flooding, thereby representing the influences of both antecedent conditions and current condition (in this case population state; good>medium>poor>critical). Our approach thus captures the influence of the entire historical sequence of flow events via a first-order Markov chain process. We use prior data and expert opinion to determine state transitions for a broad suite of ecological indicators. Despite being implemented with deterministic transitions, and drawing heavily on expert opinion, this approach greatly improves on existing methods used in environmental flows planning, particularly when comparing scenarios with the different sequencing of ecologically relevant flow events. The outputs from these models are testable, and the approach is readily extensible to incorporate probabilistic state transitions and uncertainty, mechanistic links (via increased model complexity) and quantitative measures of population state (e.g. measures of abundance or tree condition). Most importantly, the adoption of such a framework represents a fundamental shift to modelling ecological endpoints rather than relying on just quantifying hydrologic surrogates to compare environmental flow scenarios.

AB  - Pollution effects on haematological parameters in Pelophylax ridibundus individuals were investigated; animals were collected from two sites in Southern Bulgaria: the Tsalapitsa rice fields (RF) and the Vacha river (reference site, RS). Blood analysis showed significant differences between the haematological parameters of RBC, WBC, Hb, packed cell volume (PCV) and frogs' leucogram from RF and those from RS. These findings provide information on long-term background pollution of the habitat (RF) under investigation. In our view, the erythropenia, leucopenia, hypochromia, lower values of PCV, St-neutrophilia, Sg-neutropenia, basopenia, eosinophilia, monocytosis and lymphopenia that were found in Pelophylax ridibundus individuals inhabiting the Tsalapitsa rice fields were probably caused by the pesticides and fertilizers that enter the paddy cages during the rice production process. The present study proves the practical usefulness of haematological parameters of Pelophylax ridibundus individuals in bioindication analyses for environmental assessment of agroecosystems.

AB  - For the Balkan Peninsula lakes ecosystems the phenomenon of water quality deterioration has been evident since the early 1980's. These lakes arc one of the hot spots along the Bulgarian Black sea coastal zone and coastline in Macedonia. The ecological state of the lakes is strongly influenced by the process of anthropogenic presses. A long, the lake coast are located many Sources of pollution such as rivers, ports, chemical industry. It has significantly influeneed fishing, aquaculture, tourism and caused enormous economic losses. The paper presents the results of investigations of lakes with different trophic status in Bulgaria (the Varna and Beloslav lakes) and Macedonia (the Ohrid and Prespa lakes). Seasonal and inter-annual variabilily of species composition, predominating groups. abundance and biomass of microalgae in both areas are analysed. Considering, the hydrological connection of the Ohrid and Prespa lakes, one of the oldest lakes oil earth. comparative investigations were carried out on the basic trophic parameters particular attention to the phytoplankton community as the most sensitive indicator of changes oil trophic condition in the lakes.

CP  - CONF ON SUSTAINABLE POLICIES AND MAKING THEM WORK
AB  - Broadening the framework of environmental impact assessment (EIA) involves an examination of the principles and policies which should underlie ecologically sustainable development.  To work effectively, EIA procedures need to be located within a broad framework of policies and environmental objectives, standards and monitoring.  This paper discusses the political and environmental context in Australia within which the debate on sustainable development is occurring.  Some important principles which underlie an ecologically sustainable development policy framework are discussed.  These include inter-generational equity, conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity, maintenance of natural capital and a recognition of the biophysical limits on natural resource use.  Economic policy needs to emphasise the qualitative aspects of development as opposed to the quantitative growth in resource use.  Several key aspects of a broad Australian policy framework are discussed, including reform of Federal/State environmental arrangements and the establishment of a Federal Environment Protection Agency; development of a systematic means of measuring progress towards an ecologically sustainable development; materials, natural resources, energy, waste, transport and urban development policies.  The overall objective of these policy areas would be to bring the scale of human activity in Australia within the carrying capacity of the environment.

AB  - The impacts of the modern, agrochemicals based agriculture that threatens the overall systems sustainability, need to be monitored and evaluated. Seeking for agroecosystems monitors, the present article focus in the occurrence and abundance of aquatic macroinvertebrates, that have been frequently used as bioindicators of water quality due to their relationship with land use. Some of these organisms are on the top of the food chain, where bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes can be observed, and they can turn into secondary pollution sources of systems and terrestrial organisms as well. Odonate nymphs, which belong to the functional group of predators, were selected for this study. A methodology to determine 73 pesticide residues in odonate nymphs by LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS was developed. A QuEChERS sample preparation strategy was adapted. As it is complex to obtain samples especially in disturbed ecosystems, the method was minimized to a sample size of 200 mg of fresh nymphs. The method was validated and good recoveries (71-120%) with RSDs below 20% for the majority of the studied pesticides at least at two of the assayed levels 1, 10 and 50 mu g kg(-1) were obtained. For 32 analytes the limit of quantitation was 1 mu g kg(-1) and 10 mu g kg(-1) for the others. The lineal range was observed between 1-100 mu g kg(-1) in matrix-matched and solvent calibration curves for most of the assessed pesticides. LC-MS/MS matrix effects were evaluated, 40% of the analytes presented low or no signal suppression. Only flufenoxuron presented high matrix effects. The obtained methodology is adequate for pesticide multi residue analysis in aquatic macroinvertebrates (odonates) aiming to contribute to the ecological state evaluation of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - The Eocene Horsefly locality in British Columbia has yielded many fossil fishes, insects, and plants. Its varved sediments make it ideal for study of temporal changes in environment and fish morphology. Several intervals of diatomaceous varves indicate a deep, stratified lake setting. Earlier studies focused on morphological and taphonomic change during the 700-year H2 interval and morphological change during the 10 000-year H3 interval. The present study uses taphonomy as an index for environmental change during the ten millennia represented by H3, comparing taphonomic changes with the morphologic changes found earlier. The H3 interval records deposition in deep water, indicated by dominance of the fish genera Amyzon and Eohiodon. Quiet water conditions are indicated by minimal fin disarticulation. Hypoxia at the time of fish death is confirmed by open mouths of most fish specimens, while cool water on the lake floor prevented full flotation of fish carcasses. Water depth, temperature, and oxygenation fluctuated during H3 deposition. Periods of cooler, deeper, more hypoxic water are indicated by greater numbers and size of Amyzon specimens and by less disarticulation of skull and abdominal bones. Periods of warmer, shallower, more oxygenated waters are indicated by more disarticulation, less fin tetany, smaller fish specimens, and greater diversity of species. Correlations between the taphonomic changes and morphological changes in A. aggregatum are weak. Therefore, the morphological changes are not easily explained as ecophenotypic or short-term evolutionary responses to changes in physical lake conditions.

AB  - Benthic communities represent a powerful tool for the detection of natural and anthropogenic disturbances, as well as for the assessment of marine ecosystem stability. This paper shows that bivalve assemblages could serve as excellent indicators of disturbance and ecosystem instability. The goal of this study was to compare two sets of data in order to determine the differences between two different periods belonging to bivalve assemblage in the muddy detritic bottom of the northern Adriatic Sea in the post-anoxic period during December 1989, 1990, 1991 and quite a while later, during 2003, 2004 and 2005. Abundances of some indicator species such as Corbula gibba, Modiolarca subpicta and Timoclea ovata were detected during the post-anoxic period. Recruitment in the quality of bivalve assemblages was proved by the ecologic and biotic indexes during 2003, 2004 and 2005, during a period of relatively stable ecological conditions. Fluctuation in bivalve diversity due to the ecological quality of the marine ecosystem in the eastern part of the northern Adriatic Sea is also discussed.

AB  - A commercial feed additive, OmniGen-AF (R) (OMN; Phibro Animal Health, Teaneck, NJ), has shown positive impacts on thermoregulation and milk production in confined dairy cows. This study was carried out to evaluate whether OMN has similar effects on grazing dairy cows. For the latter purpose, feed intake, milk production, blood metabolites, and body temperature (including surface, rectal, and thermal imaging) were assessed. This study was performed in a commercial dairy farm at Mato Grosso do Sul State in Brazil and lasted for 84 d. Thirty-six multiparous Holstein cows (136 +/- 52 days in milk, 23.8 +/- 4.96 kg/d milk yield, and 518 +/- 65 body weight, at the start of experiment) were enrolled to a completely randomized experiment and assigned either to control (0 g/d of OMN) or OMN (50 g/d). Cows were maintained under a rotational grazing system in pens uniformly covered with Panicum maximum (cv. Mombasa). After milking, cows were fed fixed amounts of corn silage with concentrate level adjusted according to average milk yield from the previous wk. OMN was top dressed and hand mixed in the upper portion of corn silage and concentrate mixture. The average temperature humidity index (THI) throughout experiment was 77.8 (29.8 degrees C air temperature and 52 +/- 15.6% relative humidity), suggesting that heat stress (THI > 68) likely impacted cows. OMN increased pasture intake, milk and milk fat yields, and milk fat content. OMN decreased urea N concentration and somatic cell count in milk. Treatments neither influenced body weight nor body condition score. OMN increased blood glucose and ionized calcium concentrations, and decreased blood aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase concentration. OMN reduced rectal temperature, body surface temperature, and respiration rate of cows. This study showed evidence that OMN improves performance and reduces signs of heat stress of grazing cows under an environment with high THI.

AB  - The green-lipped mussel Perna viridis is distributed widely in estuarine and coastal areas of the Indo-Pacific region and is regarded as a cultured mussel or by-product in aquaculture. However, in estuarine and coastal waters where salinity varies with freshwater input and rainfall during the wet season, hypoxia frequently occurs, especially when waters are highly eutrophic. The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of two key environmental factors in estuarine and coastal waters dissolved oxygen (DO) and salinity-on growth and body composition of juvenile green-lipped mussels P. viridis. Parameters studied included shell length (SL), tissue dry weight (TDW), condition index (CI), specific growth rate (shell length, SGR(L); tissue dry weight, SCR(W)), moisture content (MC), crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), crude carbohydrate (CC), crude ash (CA), and energy content (EC). Mussels were cultured for 6 wk at 4 salinities (15, 20, 25, and 30) and 3 dissolved oxygen concentrations (1.5 +/- 0.3, 3.0 +/- 0.3, and 6.0 +/- 0.3 mg O(2)/L) in a 4 X 3 factorial design. All growth parameters (SL, TDW, Cl, SGR(L), and SGR(W)) decreased under reduced DO and salinities, but interactive effects between these 2 factors were statistically indistinguishable except for SGR(W). Higher percentages of CF and CP, and lower percentages of CC were obtained at reduced salinities and DO. When changes in biochemical content (weight per individual) were compared, both CP and CC content decreased significantly as salinity or DO decreased, whereas no pattern was observed for CF. EC (calories per gram) was not significantly different among DO treatments, but varied significantly with salinity. Total energy content (calories per individual), however, increased significantly with both DO and salinity, but the interaction between salinity and DO was statistically indistinguishable.

AB  - Slope failures are catastrophic in nature, resulting in widespread loss of lives and infrastructure. Consequently, stability analysis of slopes has gathered considerable attention by the research community across the globe. In practice, limit equilibrium approach forms the underlying principle for majority of the conventional slope stability analysis methods. One of the major limitations of the limit equilibrium methods is that they fail to account for inherent variability of in situ soil and its influence on the assessment of slope stability. As a contribution to this important aspect, the current study presents a reliability-based slope stability analysis of a natural slope of an infinite extent. The slope is analyzed in the following four states of the natural slope, namely, dry state, fully submerged state, with steady seepage, and under seismic loading. The reliability analysis is performed using Hasofer-Lind first-order reliability method. The in situ soil properties considered as variables include in situ soil cohesion, angle of internal friction, and unit weight. The analyses results are presented with respect to different levels of in situ soil variability, slope angles, depths of potential failure plane, and magnitude (and its variability) of seismic loading. Evidently, the study provided a better insight and different perspective into the stability analysis of infinite slopes.

AB  - The condition and feeding behaviour of burbot, a widespread potamodromous species in riverine and lacustrine environments, were compared in order to evaluate the importance of both in three artificial systems. Subadult burbot were sampled in three temperate reservoirs in spring, and one of them also in summer and autumn. Standardised abundance and sizes of burbot were comparable between the reservoirs, but the conditions were significantly different. The Clark's condition coefficient and index of fullness were independent of burbot size and individuals. Feeding behaviour in terms of abundance and composition of consumed food was environment-dependent. The most common prey category was aquatic insect larvae, dominating in the riverine environment. Permanent water invertebrates, microcrustaceans, beetles and crayfish were less common food and eaten more often in the lacustrine environment. Prey-fish were usually the most common species of suitable size. The food analyses demonstrated opportunistic feeding behaviour with selection of prey associated with benthic habitat and suitable size. Burbot is therefore flexible not only in environments utilisation, but also feeding strategy.

AB  - In this paper, an analytical approach for nonlinear buckling and post-buckling behavior of stiffened porous functionally graded plate rested on Pasternak's elastic foundation under mechanical load in thermal environment is presented. The orthogonal and/or oblique stiffeners are attached to the surface of plate and are included in the calculation by improving the Lekhnitskii's smeared stiffener technique in the framework of higher-order shear deformation plate theory. The complex equilibrium and stability equations are established based on the Reddy's higher-order shear deformation plate theory and taken into account the geometrical nonlinearity of von Karman. The solution forms of displacements satisfying the different boundary conditions are chosen, the stress function method and the Galerkin procedure are used to solve the problem. The good agreements of the present analytical solution are validated by making the comparisons of the present results with other results. In addition, the effects of porosity distribution, stiffener, volume fraction index, thermal environment, elastic foundation horizontal ellipsis on the critical buckling load and post-buckling response of porous functionally graded material plates are numerically investigated.

AB  - Soil cracks formed by natural processes play a key role in water and gas transfer. Patterns of soil cracks are, however, difficult to characterize. Our aim here is to assess the effectiveness of three-dimensional electrical resistivity surveys in detecting soil crack networks. A three-dimensional electrical survey was carried out by a square array quadripole with Cu-CuSO4 electrodes (electrode spacing of 3 cm). The measurements were made with two orientations (0degrees and 90degrees) on a block (26 cm x 30 cm x 40 cm) of soil while it dried for 18 days under controlled conditions. Two indexes, calculated from the apparent resistivity values, were evaluated to detect the degree of soil heterogeneity: (i) an anisotropy index based on the ratio between the apparent resistivity at 0degrees and that at 90degrees; and (ii) the angle-array orientation corresponding to the preferential anisotropic orientation (maximum resistivity). The anisotropy index provided information on the presence of cracks and the orientation for crack width > 1 mm in the first pseudo-depth (i.e. depth of investigation), while the angle-array orientation provided information on crack extension for the whole pseudo-depth. Information about the presence, position, orientation and extension of cracks can be obtained from an analysis of apparent resistivity obtained by a three-dimensional electrical survey. Such direct analysis will help the resistivity inversion to detect the crack network.

AB  - The optimal concentrations of ethanol, Fe3+ and rice husk (RH) to enhance sludge dewaterability were determined by response surface methodology (RSM). Results showed the optimal concentrations of ethanol, Fe3+ and RH were 22.2 g/g DS, 239.9 mg/g DS and 348.9 mg/g DS, respectively, and the CST reduction efficiency reached 72.3%. The transformation behavior and mechanism of the heavy metals (HMs) during conditioning process were determined in terms of total HMs content, leaching tests, and fraction distribution. The environmental risk of HMs was quantitatively evaluated after conditioning in terms of bioavailability and ecotoxicity, potential ecological risks, and pollution levels. Results showed that the high ecological risk of HMs in raw sludge cake is primarily dominated by Cd and the use of Fe3+ alone negatively affected the immobilization of HMs and reduction of leaching toxicity. However, after repeated conditioning with Fe3+ and ethanol, the total HMs content reduction values in sludge cake were 75%, 93%, 100%, 91%, and 74% for Pb, Cr, Cd, Zn, and Cu, respectively. The potential ecological risk index (PERI) and geoaccumulation indicated low or no overall environmental risk after repeated conditioning. Particularly, the risk of Cd was reduced from high risk to low risk after repeated conditioning according to the PERI. Ethanol/Fe3+-RH can effectively reduce HMs risk from the sludge cake in the dewatering tests.

AB  - Most accounts of environmental treaty ratification emphasize the boundedness of states, characterizing ratification as a calculated "choice" of interested rational actors. Here I present an alternative to this view; depicting nation-states as constructed of globally legitimated models, including those seen to promote environmental protection. Countries with dense connections to world society are most likely to embody global models of nation-state environmentalization regardless of measures of national interests, such as natural degradation, economic development, scientific capacity, or political openness. I test the alternative views in a series of structural equation models with latent variables, analyzing cross-national variation in the number of international environmental treaties ratified during the periods 1900-1945, 1946-1962, 1963-1972, and 1973-1990. In every analysis a nation-state's linkage to world society is the strongest predictor of its number of ratifications. The results lend support to the notion that nation-states are constituted within a wider world social system, in which environmental protection forms a central and highly legitimate node of discourse and activity.

AB  - Measuring and controlling emissions across the logistics network is an important challenge for today's firms according to increasing concern about the environmental impact of business activities. This paper proposes a bi-objective credibility-based fuzzy mathematical programming model for designing the strategic configuration of a green logistics network under uncertain conditions. The model aims to minimize the environmental impacts and the total costs of network establishment simultaneously for the sake of providing a sensible balance between them. A popular but credible environmental impact assessment index, i.e., CO2 equivalent index is used to model the environmental impact across the concerned logistics network. Since transportation mode and production technology play important roles on the concerned objectives, the proposed model integrates their respective decisions with those of strategic network design ones. In addition, to solve the proposed bi-objective fuzzy optimization model, an interactive fuzzy solution approach based upon credibility measure is developed. An industrial case study is also provided to show the applicability of the proposed model as well as the usefulness of its solution method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization has resulted in remnant natural patches within cities that often have no connectivity among themselves and to natural reserves outside the urban area. Protecting ecological connectivity in fragmented urban areas is becoming crucial in maintaining urban biodiversity and securing critical habitat levels and configurations under continual development pressures. Nevertheless, few studies have been undertaken for urban landscapes. This study aims to assess ecological connectivity for a group of species that represent the urban desert landscape in the Phoenix metropolitan area and to compare the connectivity values along the different urban gradient. A GIS-based landscape connectivity model which relies upon ecological connectivity index (ECI) was developed and applied to this region. A GISbased concentric buffering technique was employed to delineate conceptual boundaries for urban, suburban, and rural zones. The research findings demonstrated that urban habitats and potential habitat patches would be significantly influenced by future urban development. Particularly, the largest loss of higher connectivity would likely to be anticipated in the "in-between areas" where urban, suburban, and rural zones overlap one another. The connectivity maps would be useful to provide spatial identification regarding connectivity patterns and vulnerability for urban and suburban activities in this area. This study provides planners and landscape architects with a spatial guidance to minimize ecological fragmentation, which ultimately leads to urban landscape sustainability. This study suggests that conventional planning practices which disregard the ecological processes in urban landscapes need to integrate landscape ecology into planning and design strategies.

AB  - Poultry litter is a mixture of excreta, feed, feathers, and bedding material. Poultry litter is useful as a fertilizer due to the presence of nitrogen phosphorus, and potassium. Litter is commonly used for growing corn, soybeans, potatoes, tomatoes, leafy vegetables, and cover crops. The aqueous leachate of poultry Litter has been shown to exhibit toxicity to a variety of indicator organisms. The objective of this research was to identify classes of toxicants in the litter aqueous leachate. The aqueous extract of poultry Litter was subjected to toxicity identification tests approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency that use Ceriodaphnia dubia as the test organism. Tests performed included pH adjustment, filtration, aeration, C-18 solid-phase extraction, EDTA addition, sodium thiosulfate addition, and extraction through zeolite. Zeolite extraction, filtration at low pH, and aeration at low pH reduced overall toxicity by 68, 20, and 22%, respectively. The major sources of toxicity appear to be ammonia and anionic organic compounds. Toxicity was apparently not due to the presence of heavy metals or oxidants.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities may lead to the accumulation of inorganic and organic compounds in topsoils. Biota living in close contact with contaminated soils may experience stress at different levels of biological organization throughout the continuum from molecular to community level. Biological responses observed at the individual or infra-individual level of biological organization led to the development of biomarkers. The development of biomarkers consists often in evidencing biological modifications following a contaminant stress in laboratory conditions, using naive organisms and it is sometime proposed to use the biological state of individuals from sentinel species collected in the field to evaluate the level of environmental exposure. However, considering the possibility of local adaptation following long-term exposure, organisms response sampled in the field may substantially differ from laboratory specimens. In this review, we discuss this point focusing on the definition and validity of molecular biomarkers of metal pollution using earthworms of the Lumbricidae family. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper investigates environmental drivers of U.S. West Coast petrale sole (Eopsetta jordani) recruitment as an initial step toward developing an environmental recruitment index that can inform the stock assessment in the absence of survey observations of age-0 and age-1 fish. First, a conceptual life history approach is used to generate life-stage-specific and spatio-temporally specific mechanistic hypotheses regarding oceanographic variables that likely influence survival at each life stage. Seven life history stages are considered, from female spawner condition through benthic recruitment as observed in the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (age-2 fish). The study area encompasses the region from 40 to 48 degrees N in the California Current Ecosystem. Hypotheses are tested using output from a regional ocean reanalysis model outputs and model selection techniques. Four oceanographic variables explained 73% of the variation in recruitment not accounted for by estimates based exclusively on the spawning stock size. Recruitment deviations were (a) positively correlated with degree days during the female precondition period, (b) positively correlated with mixed-layer depth during the egg stage, (c) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the larval stage, and (d) negatively correlated with cross-shelf transport during the benthic juvenile stage. While multiple mechanisms likely affect petrale sole recruitment at different points during their life history, the strength of the relationship is promising for stock assessment and integrated ecosystem assessment applications.

AB  - Ecosystem managers and policy-makers need ecological indicators that have a sound scientific basis and that can inform them about the ecological state of the marine environment. In this study, we integrate existing data on seabird reproductive performance into 2 simplified indices in the eastern Bering Sea and use these indices to test hypotheses concerning the effects of environmental conditions on this suite of predators. We used principal components analysis to integrate 17 data sets on the reproductive effort of common murres Uria aalge, thick-billed murres U. lomvia, black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla, red-legged kittiwakes R. brevirostris, and red-faced cormorants Phalacrocorax urile. Two strong patterns were evident in the leading principal components (PC). In general, PC1 represented the hatch timing and reproductive success of diving foragers; PC2 represented kittiwake reproductive success trends. Together, PC1 and PC2 accounted for 65.2% of the variability in the seabird reproductive performance data. Time series analysis of these indices against selected environmental variables showed significant, but in most cases, lagged relationships. Warmer bottom and surface temperatures, greater wind mixing, and higher stratification correlated with delayed and lower productivity for most seabirds up to 2 yr later. Later ice retreat was correlated with lower kittiwake productivity 2 yr later, whereas higher local abundances of age-1 walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma were linked to higher kittiwake productivity the following year. Since the observable impacts of environmental forcing on seabirds may be delayed, oceanographic and prey variables may serve as leading indicators of seabird breeding activity in the eastern Bering Sea.

AB  - Parasites can play an important role in biological invasions. While introduced species often lose parasites from their native range, they can also accumulate novel parasites in their new range. The accumulation of parasites by introduced species likely varies spatially, and more parasites may shift to new hosts where parasite diversity is high. Considering that parasitism and disease are generally more prevalent at lower latitudes, the accumulation of parasites by introduced hosts may be greater in tropical regions. The Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans) has become widely distributed across the Western Atlantic. In this study, we compared parasitism across thirteen locations in four regions, spanning seventeen degrees of latitude in the lionfish's introduced range to examine potential spatial variation in parasitism. In addition, as an initial step to explore how indirect effects of parasitism might influence interactions between lionfish and ecologically similar native hosts, we also compared parasitism in lionfish and two co-occurring native fish species, the graysby grouper, Cephalopholis cruentata, and the lizardfish, Synodus intermedius, in the southernmost region, Panama. Our results show that accumulation of native parasites on lionfish varies across broad spatial scales, and that colonization by ectoparasites was highest in Panama, relative to the other study sites. Endoparasite richness and abundance, on the other hand, were highest in Belize where lionfish were infected by twice as many endoparasite species as lionfish in other regions. The prevalence of all but two parasite species infecting lionfish was below 25%, and we did not detect an association between parasite abundance and host condition, suggesting a limited direct effect of parasites on lionfish, even where parasitism was highest. Further, parasite species richness and abundance were significantly higher in both native fishes compared to lionfish, and parasite abundance was negatively associated with the condition index of the native grouper but not that of the lionfish or lizardfish. While two co-occurring native fishes were more heavily parasitized compared to lionfish in Panama any indirect benefits of differential parasitism requires further investigation. Future parasitological surveys of lionfish across the eastern coast of North America and the Lesser Antilles would further resolve geographic patterns of parasitism in invasive lionfish.

AB  - Mangroves are multi-functional ecosystems providing resource provisions and various ecosystem services, all of which are critical to the local livelihood and national economy. However, unsustainable anthropogenic activities continue to undermine the health of these ecosystems resulting in environmental adversities and declining resources. This study aimed to formulate a Mangrove Quality Index (MQI) which took into consideration the mangrove forest, contributing components of a mangrove forest, soil, surrounding marine ecosystem, hydrology and the socio-economic variables. Three major sites representing the least, moderately and most-disturbed mangrove ecosystems in Matang, Malaysia were selected. These areas were used to assess the contribution of 43 variables from five categories, namely, mangrove biotic integrity, mangrove soil, marine-mangrove, mangrove hydrology, and mangrove socio-economic factors. Two types of indices were developed to indicate the status of each category, 1) Mangrove Quality Index for a specific category (MQISi) and, 2) Overall MQI to reflect the overall health status of the ecosystem. The indices for the five different categories were Mangrove Biotic Integrity Index (MQIS1), Mangrove Soil Index (MQIS(2)), Marine-Mangrove Index (MQIS3), Mangrove-Hydrology Index (MQIS4) and Mangrove-Socio-economic Index (MQIS(5)). Using Principle Component Analysis, ten variables representing all the five categories were selected to formulate the overall MQI. They are aboveground biomass, crab abundance, soil carbon, soil nitrogen, number of phytoplankton species, number of diatom species, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, education level, and time spent fishing. We developed the overall MQI based on the total score obtained from each category. The health status of mangroves is ranked from 1 to 5 viz. 1 (worst), 2 (bad), 3 (moderate), 4 (good), 5 (excellent). In the Matang Mangrove, the health status of the least disturbed area is ranked 5, moderate disturbed area is ranked 4, while the most disturbed area is ranked 2. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) supported the overall MQI developed. The NDVI for the least disturbed area in Matang ranged from -0.689846 to 0.652204, for the moderately disturbed area, it ranged from -0.732508 to 0.638625, while the most disturbed area ranged from -0.916667 to 0.314991.

AB  - This article examines the impact of democracy on environmental conditions in a large sample of developing countries for the period 1976-2003. This relationship is explored empirically using three indicators of environmental quality: carbon dioxide emissions, water pollution and deforestation damage. We find evidence that democracy is conducive to environmental improvement but that this result depends on the measure of the environmental quality that is used. We also find remarkable differences in results across our different sub-samples. The conclusion therefore is that there is no uniform relationship between democracy and the state of the environment.

AB  - Within the past decades, the karst region in the Guangxi province in southwest China has been in the focus of large scale ecological restoration projects. In this study, we adapt the pressure-state-response (PSR) framework (which includes measures for human pressure, the current state of the ecosystem and the human response) and propose a remote sensing based ecosystem health (ESH) index (0-1; 250 m spatial resolution), evaluating the pressure and state of the fragile karst ecosystem. We further apply inventory data of recovery actions (restoration areas at county level resolution) as response to ongoing degradation to test the impact of ecological restoration on the ESH. Our analysis was conducted for the years 2000, 2010 and 2016, and the results showed that 73% of the study area experienced an increase in the ESH (from 2000 to 2016) which was related to the improvements in vegetation vigor, organization, resilience, ecosystem service provisioning which offset a deterioration in fragmentation and population density. From 2000 to 2016, areas of increase in ESH were slightly larger in karst than in non-karst (37.5% and 35.1%, respectively), but also larger areas of decrease in ESH were observed in karst as compared to non-karst (16% and 11%, respectively). The results further showed that the share of areas with a high ESH (greater than 0.7) had increased by similar to 3% (from 67.16% to 70.21%) during the 17 years period. At county level, we found a clear relationship between increases in ESH and ecological restoration areas (r = 0.58, p = 0.004), with a high recovery rate (ratio between areas with increased ESH and restoration areas in a county) in karst than in non-karst. We conclude that restoration projects have caused a large scale transformation of farmland into forested areas (similar to 5500 km(2)), which has caused a general improvement in ecosystem parameters related to ESH.

Benzophenone (BZP) and [1-(diphenylmethyl)piperazine] (DPP) were reported to be the most toxic impurities for dimenhydrinate (DMH) and cinnarizine (CIN), respectively. Additionally, there is no reported HPLC method for the simultaneous determination of DMH, CIN and their toxic impurities. A custom experimental design was adopted to estimate the optimum conditions that achieved the most acceptable resolution with adequate peak symmetry within the shortest run time. Desirability function was used to define the optimum chromatographic conditions and the optimum separation was achieved using XBridge (R) HPLC RP-C18 (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 mu m), acetonitrile: 0.1% sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) in water (90 : 10, v/v) as a mobile phase at flow rate 2 mL min(-1) and UV detection at 215 nm. Method validation was carried out according to ICH guidelines and linearity was achieved in the ranges of 2-25, 1-25, 1-12.5, and 1-12.5 mu g mL(-1) for DMH, CIN, BZP and DPP, respectively. By application of the proposed method to the market dosage form, no interference from excipients was observed. Moreover, the greenness of the method was evaluated using the National Environmental Method Index (NEMI), Analytical Eco-Scale and Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) metrics and the results revealed the green environmental impact of the developed method.

AB  - In 1999, the United States Environmental Protection Agency Gulf Ecology Division initiated a pilot study to assess the condition of nearshore coastal resources. Near-shelf areas associated with coastal beaches are susceptible to land based activities, but are not consistently monitored. Additionally, few or no marine water quality criteria exist for evaluating these waters. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the ecological condition of Gulf of Mexico near-shelf resources using a probability-based survey design. Data are used to generate a baseline assessment of condition in coastal nearshore areas and provide a comparative tool for evaluating future trends in condition. Water quality, sediment quality and benthic diversity data can provide a baseline assessment for managers to evaluate the potential for future problems such as nutrient over-enrichment, sediment contamination and degraded biological condition. We present results from a probability-based survey demonstration assessing near-shelf resources along the Florida panhandle.

AB  - Although key factors for vegetation composition and structure, site and soil condition have received little attention as predictors of habitat suitability in wildlife ecology to date. Using the example of capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), an indicator species for open, well-structured forest habitats, we evaluated the potential use of ecological forest site mapping for the identification of areas where the preferred vegetation structures are supported by the prevailing soil conditions. These are sites that we, therefore, expected to be of long-term relevance to the species.
   Employing an expert model, we evaluated data from the state's forest site and soil condition database including soil texture, soil type, humus type, nutrient status and hydrological regime. The data were aggregated to a soil condition index (I-s), quantifying the potential to support capercaillie-relevant types. First, we assessed the correlation of I-s with the current vegetation conditions in the study area. Subsequently, we evaluated the short-term (15 years) and long-term (100 years) changes to the capercaillie distribution with respect to I-s, at different spatial scales and calculated a threshold for the prediction of long-term capercaillie presence.
   Although the vegetation structure in the study area was largely influenced by forestry, I-s was correlated with all investigated vegetation structure variables that determine habitat suitability for capercaillie. Soil condition proved to be an important indirect predictor of long-term capercaillie inhabitation, performing best when considering an area exceeding the size of a large capercaillie home range. The long-term range contractions corresponded significantly with the spatial pattern of suitable soil conditions, the short-term development demonstrated a similar trend. The results indicated an ongoing retreat from degenerating secondary habitats, created by historic land use techniques on sites with low I-s, to sites with high I-s, values, which should be considered when defining priority areas for conservation. Forest ecological site mapping provides detailed, area-wide data that allow for a spatially explicit evaluation of the vegetation development. Therefore, it can facilitate the integration of conservation targets in forest management, for species dependent upon specific vegetation conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The mustard production and productivity of the hot arid region of Rajasthan is dominated by both genetic makeup and environmental conditions. An experiment was conducted with four mustard varieties (RGN-73, RGN-229, RH-30 and Pusa bold) in two growing environments (open environment and neem shade). Pusa bold gave significantly higher plant height than other varieties. Among varieties, RGN-73 had significantly higher number of branches per plant, dry matter accumulation per plant, siliquae per plant, seed yield, stover yield, biological yield, harvest index and heat use efficiency than other varieties. However, significantly higher test weight was in Pusa bold variety. Under open environment condition, significantly higher growth, yield attributes, yield, harvest index and heat use efficiency were found as compared to neem shade environment. The results revealed that variety RGN-229 took more days for completion of life cycle as compared to other varieties, hence RGN-229 variety required significantly more degree days than other varieties. The pheno-thermal index was significantly higher in open condition.

AB  - Recent headlines highlight disparities in childhood lead poisoning in urban areas yet discourse does not address the lack of primary prevention options. Previous geographic information systems (GIS) approaches, concentrated on census tracts or ZIP codes, miss contextual understanding of lead exposure and make intervention impractical. Through the combination of electronic medical record (EMR) data from an urban children's hospital and spatial video geonarrative (SVG), we show how blood lead level researchers, clinicians, and public health planners can become more proactive in prediction and intervention strategies through the development of an environmental lead index (ELI). Kernel density estimation (KDE) clusters of geocoded locations of children with elevated blood lead (EBL), from 2012 to 2014, were identified using GIS. Analyses identify an increased relative risk for African American and Asian patients compared to white patients and Nepali and non-English-speaking patients compared to English-speaking patients. Fine-scale analyses of EBL clusters reveal nuances of exposure and environmental characteristics that are not identifiable at an aggregate level. Initial testing of the ELI was conducted using identified locations of EBL and non-EBL test results. The mean ELI score was higher among EBL parcels, and comparison proportions of ELI variables between EBL and non-EBL parcels found a statistically significant increase in four variables. Preliminary results support the use of the ELI as a predictive tool; further validation is needed. The technology and the method are translatable to other environments and health conditions.

AB  - We determined the best predictors of an index of amphibian biotic integrity calculated from 54 shrub and forested wetlands in Ohio, USA using a two-step sequential holdout validation procedure. We considered 13 variables as predictors: four metrics of wetland condition from the Ohio Rapid Assessment Method (ORAM), a wetland vegetation index of biotic integrity, and eight metrics from a landscape disturbance index. For all iterations, the best model included the single ORAM metric that assesses habitat alteration, substrate disturbance, and habitat development within a wetland. Our results align with results of similar studies that have associated high scores for wetland vegetation indices of biotic integrity with low habitat alteration and substrate disturbance within wetlands. Thus, implementing similar management practices (e.g., not removing downed woody debris, retaining natural morphological features, decreasing nutrient input from surrounding agricultural lands) could concurrently increase ecological integrity of both plant and amphibian communities in a wetland. Further, our results have the unexpected effect of making progress toward a more unifying theory of ecological indices.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) is anticipated to interact with the more frequently occurring hypoxic conditions in shallow coastal environments. These could exert extreme stress on the barnacle-dominated fouling communities. However, the interactive effect of these two emerging stressors on early-life stages of fouling organisms remains poorly studied. We investigated both the independent and interactive effect of low pH (7.6 vs. ambient 8.2) and low oxygen (LO; 3 mg l(-1) vs. ambient 5 mg l(-1)) from larval development through settlement (attachment and metamorphosis) and juvenile growth of the widespread fouling barnacle, Balanus amphitrite. In particular, we focused on the critical transition between planktonic and benthic phases to examine potential limiting factors (i.e. larval energy storage and the ability to perceive cues) that may restrain barnacle recruitment under the interactive stressors. LO significantly slowed naupliar development, while the interaction with low pH (LO LP) seemed to alleviate the negative effect. However, 20-50% of the larvae became cyprid within 4 d post-hatching, regardless of treatment. Under the two stressors interaction (LO LP), the barnacle larvae increased their feeding rate, which may explain why their energy reserves at competency were not different from any other treatment. In the absence of a settlement-inducing cue, a significantly lower percentage of cyprids (similar to 15% lower) settled in LO and LO-LP. The presence of an inducing cue, however, elevated attachment up to 50-70% equally across all treatments. Post-metamorphic growth was not altered, although the condition index was different between LO and LO-LP treatments, potentially indicating that less and/or weaker calcified structures were developed when the two stressors were experienced simultaneously. LO was the major driver for the responses observed and its interaction with low pH should be considered in future studies to avoid underestimating the sensitivity of biofouling species to OA and associated climate change stressors.

On the basis of the analysis of temporal and spatial monitoring data, a comprehensive assessment of the environmental status of the Inhulets river (Ukraine) waters by hydrochemical indicators was carried out. The study performed a comparative analysis of the river water quality assessment using different methods: an integrated assessment based on the calculation of water pollution indexes, pollution rate. A result of the evaluation of water quality in certain classes: in terms of ammonium ions and BOD5 - III quality class, the water is slightly polluted; phosphate content - V quality class, water is very low in the bottom; according to the content of suspended solids, in phosphates and BOD5 - III class of water quality, water is polluted; by a concentration of chlorides - V class of quality, degree of purity - very dirty; the value of suspended solids and chlorides - III class; in terms of the sulfate content - IV class. In general, the very excessive concentration of substances in the middle course remains stable, the environmental state is poor (quality class IV).

AB  - Growth of biomass sorghum under semi-arid conditions in Mediterranean regions is mainly hindered by water deficit. This study aimed at evaluating sorghum genotypes for biomass performance and drought resistance at the seedling stage and in field conditions in Italy. Data from seventy-five lines and two hybrids revealed that tropical sorghum landraces could achieve high levels (33-51 t ha(-1) under irrigation, and 20-29 t ha(-1) under rain-fed experiments) of total aboveground dry biomass yield. Certain of them displayed contemporarily tolerance to water deficit stress at the seedling stage and in open-field. Performance tinder rain-fed conditions was significantly associated with green leaf area retention (r: -0.47; P: 0.001), plant height (r: 0.50; P: 0.001), and maturity (r: 0.61; P: 0.001). Differences in biomass potential contributed to dry matter yield differences tinder water limiting conditions. Tolerance index of seedling shoot and that of root, respectively tinder mild drought and warm and high water shortage-stressed environments, proved interesting indicators of drought resistance and aboveground biological yield in open-field conditions. A stay-green source (SDS 1948-3) along with two senescent types (IS 23509 and IS 33350) were identified and would be of greater interest in drought resistance breeding research.

AB  - Floods are extreme weather events that can rapidly change water quality in receiving estuaries. The delivery of nutrients to the coastal zone via floods may stimulate productivity; however, in urban areas, the degradation of water quality and influx of contaminants can negatively affect inhabiting biota. Determining flood effects on inhabiting biota is important for informing catchment management practices. We investigated the body condition response of a commercially important prawn species, the brown tiger prawn Penaeus esculentus, to a large cyclone-driven flood in an urbanized subtropical coastal bay. Prawns were caught 10 days before the flood, 11 days after the flood, and 53 days after the flood in bare substrate areas of central Moreton Bay in Australia. Stable isotopes (delta N-15 and delta C-13) were determined for prawn muscle tissue, and lipid content and a length-weight (Fulton's K) index were used to assess prawn body condition. There were two distinct isotope signatures of tiger prawns living in either riverine or marine influenced areas, suggesting different residency areas within the bay. A flood signal (lower delta C-13 values post-flood) was detected in prawns in the southern area closest to the Logan River. Condition indices showed a short-term increase in condition of prawns in these southern sites, with no apparent condition change in prawns at other sites. A concurrent pulse in benthic primary productivity (chlorophyll a biomass) was measured in this southern area. Our results suggest that nutrients from the flood stimulated benthic primary production that was transferred through the food web, with positive impacts on prawn nutrition at southern sites. With an expected increase in unpredictable weather, including floods, under a changing climate, understanding short- and long-term ecosystem responses in modified catchments is important for mitigating sediment erosion and estuarine and coastal infilling effects, while maintaining productivity benefits to fisheries in receiving estuaries.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that mating with multiple males can be beneficial for females and her offspring even if males contribute nothing but sperm. This was mainly established for species in which sperm from several males mix in the reproductive tract of the female, thus allowing sperm competition and/or female sperm choice. However, in species with last male sperm precedence, female re-mating decides against the previous male by strongly limiting his reproductive success. We tested the effect of female re-mating behaviour using the cellar spider Pholcus phalangioides, which shows strong last males sperm precedence and moderate levels of polyandry under natural situations. We predicted that females prevented from remating even though they are receptive would show reduced reproductive success compared to females that accept two copulations and females that reject a second male, since the latter two treatments were allowed to behave according to their decisions. However, if the number of matings per se had an effect on oviposition or on offspring performance, double-mated females should perform better compared to both treatments of once-mated females. We measured female fecundity and fertility over a period of 140 days, comparable to the species' natural reproductive peak season. Two thousand one hundred and fifty-two offspring from 67 first egg sacs were reared under two feeding levels. We registered development time and survival, and measured offspring adult size and mass. We found a positive effect of double mating, as in this treatment, oviposition probability was higher compared to the other treatments. Interestingly, adult female offspring of the DM treatment that were raised under low food level had a higher condition index compared to those from FS and RM, but development time, size and mass at adulthood were not affected by mating treatment. Female choice only seemed to affect hatching latency of the offspring. Overall, the main predictor of female reproductive output and success was female body size.

AB  - The source of information about the state of our environment can be both the abiotic part of the environment (water, soil, air) and samples of the biotic part, including tissues and body fluids of humans, who are continuously exposed to a wide spectrum of xenobiotic chemicals.
   The investigation of human body fluids (mainly blood and urine) can be a useful and interesting way to obtain information about the state of the environment.
   However, in order to examine the composition of physiological fluids such as urine or blood, collected samples have to be pretreated prior to final determination, because they have a very complex matrix, precluding direct determination of analytes by any of the available analytical methods.
   This paper is a review of the literature regarding:
   analyte isolation and/or enrichment techniques from samples of human urine prior to their final determination;
   final determination methods for a wide variety of analytes (both organic and inorganic) in urine samples.
   The review includes both the primary form of pollutants that entered the human body as a result of environmental or workplace exposure and the products of their metabolism in the organism.
   The determination of metabolites (biomarkers) in urine is often used as a quantitative indicator of exposure to a given substance (so-called biomonitoring).

AB  - The bay scallop Argopecten irradians, a warm-water and hermaphroditic bivalve species, is native of the Atlantic coast of North America and was introduced for aquaculture to the Chinese coast in 1982 and, in turn, to the Korean coast in 1996. The present study analyzed the gross biochemical composition and stable isotope ratios of separated organs (i.e., the adductor muscle, digestive gland, gonad, mantle, and gill tissues) of the scallop over a culturing cycle (September 2015 to May 2016), to understand its energy-storage allocation strategy in association with reproductive success for survival in the new habitat. The condition index (CI) of the bay scallop increased slowly but steadily from the beginning of deployment in the grow-out area in September and peaked in the following month of March. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) increased rapidly in April and peaked in May, when the CI decreased drastically. The seasonal somatic growth, as defined by dry tissue weight, of whole tissues and individual organ tissues differed from each other. Most of the energy reserves were stored in the adductor muscle in the summer-fall period. The subsequent sudden decreases in proteins and carbohydrates in the adductor muscle suggested that these reserves were used as catabolic substrates during winter maintenance in the December-January period, and during spring spawning in the April-May period. The delta C-13 values of all the lipid-free organ tissues displayed seasonal fluctuations in parallel with those of phytoplankton. Seasonal fluctuations in gross weights of biochemical constituents as well as delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of individual organ tissues confirmed a mobilization of proteins from the digestive gland to the gonad, suggesting that gonadal growth is catabolized by recently assimilated food (i.e., phytoplankton). Overall, our results clearly indicate that, although the bay scallop in a newly introduced coast of Korea possessed slightly different energy-gain-allocation processes vs the native US populations, they might adapt to new environments and keep an intrinsic trait of fast growth and reproductive success through a slight modification of adaptive strategy for survival.

AB  - Nanotechnologies are already interacting with the environment. Scientists and engineers are manipulating matter at the nanoscale, and these nanoscale processes and products are being used by industry in commercially available products. These products are either applied directly to the environment or end up in the environment through indirect pathways. This review examines the state of current environmental risk assessment of nanotechnologies. Nanotechnology is described generally, then both the possible benefits of nanotechnology and the risks are reviewed in a traditional way. Subsequently, a philosophical criticism of the traditional way of looking at risks is offered.

AB  - This study was carried out over a period of 84 days to examine the effects of three levels of environmental temperature (18 degrees, 23 degrees, and 28 degrees C) on the growth performance of hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x M. chrysops). Sixty juveniles of 31 g were placed into each of six tanks (2.4 m(3)/tank) with two replicates per treatment. Fish were fed to satiation twice a day with a commercial floating pelleted diet. Specific growth rate (SGR) and feed intake both increased with increasing temperatures. The feed conversion efficiency (FCE) was much lower at 18 degrees C than at 23 degrees and 28 degrees C; the highest FCE was obtained at 23 degrees C and slightly dropped at 28 degrees C. With increasing temperature, there was a significant decrease in muscle moisture, but an increase in lipid content. The liver glycogen at 28 degrees C was markedly lower than at other temperatures, while the hepatosomatic index and condition factor were slightly lower at 18 degrees C than those at the higher temperatures. The variance in harvest size distribution was much larger at 28 degrees C than at the lower temperatures. In terms of SGR and FCE, it can be concluded that the most economical temperature for aquaculture of this species is between 23 degrees and 28 degrees C.

AB  - Knowledge of intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with survival rates and the underlying causes of mortality is essential to understand both population dynamics and the causes of population declines. We studied the influence of habitat variables and body condition on survival of 151 radio-tracked Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa in four areas of Spain, representing a gradient from natural unmanaged areas to highly managed areas. We examined the effects of differences in game management practices, and seasonal and geographical variations in survival and causes of mortality over 4 years, from 1999 to 2002. Monthly survival rate was consistently over 90% for both sexes in the natural area. However, in two areas managed intensively for both hunting and agriculture, survival was low during the hunting period (72% for females and 79% for males), high during the breeding period for males (99%), and intermediate for females (89%) due mainly to diseases. Hunting was the main cause of Red-legged Partridge mortality in both hunting areas where driven partridge shooting was performed, affecting 50% of radio-tagged individuals, and was the main cause of mortality over all areas during both breeding and hunting periods. Disease was the next most common cause of mortality in managed areas, affecting mostly females during the breeding period, whereas predation was the main cause of mortality in unmanaged populations. Finally, we compared the habitat associations and body condition of living and dead individuals with varying causes of mortality. In general, high survival rates were associated with diverse vegetation, habitat edges and a good body condition index. Habitat diversity and a high edge index were also negatively associated with mortality due to predation and diseases. On the other hand, hunting mortality decreased with the proportion of scrubland and increased with the proportion of agricultural land. These results suggest that preventing declines of wild Red-legged Partridge populations might best be achieved by increasing landscape complexity and connectivity, and promoting game management practices to limit both partridge bags and long-term densities.

AB  - The goal of this study is to quantify variability of daily light use efficiency (LUE) based on radiation absorbed by photosynthetically active vegetation (LUEgreen) in C3 and C4 crops. Data contained GPP, fAPAR, total and green leaf area index taken over 16 site years of irrigated and rainfed maize and 8 site years of soybean in 2001-2008 including years with quite strong drought events. LUEgreen in irrigated and rainfed sites were statistically indistinguishable showing low sensitivity to water availability. Seasonal changes of LUEgreen remained remarkably small over a wide range of water supply, leaf area index and weather conditions. The magnitude and composition of incident radiation affected the magnitude of the day-to-day LUEgreen change - increases in incident PAR caused statistically significant decreases of LUEgreen. Convergence of LUEgreen to a narrow range in irrigated and rainfed crops brought important implications for understanding mechanisms of plant response to stress and remote estimation of primary production in crops.

AB  - Ovaries of 1159 Trachinocephalus myops were examined, and six oocyte stages were histologically identified whereby each stage of ovary development was observed almost every month. The sex ratio was not different from 1 : 1 (P > 0.01). The weight-length relationship was estimated as BW = 0.0077FL(3.1207) (r(2) = 0.976, n = 2256). Monthly composition of the oocyte stages gonadosomatic index (GSI), and condition factor (CF) were examined. The spawning season had two peaks: February to April and August to October. Sizes at 50% maturity were estimated at 18.0 and 18.7 cm FL for females and males, respectively. Fecundity estimates ranged from 11 100 to 426 200 (mean: 178 600), based on an oocyte diameter >0.2 mm. Batch fecundity was estimated to range from 1724 to 120 951 (mean: 60 200), germinal vesicle migration and mature oocytes >0.8 mm in diameter were counted, and the relative fecundity was estimated to range from 346 to 3115 (mean: 1087). The results suggest that reproductive activity occurred throughout the year, suitable for the highly variable environments utilized by this species.

AB  - Improvement of grain yield (GY) at farm level, which is closely related to GY potential, seems to be the main alternative to increase wheat (Triticum aestivum L) production. The aim of current research was to assess the genetic progress of GY potential and associated physiological traits as well as the GY stability under diverse environments of cultivars released to the Argentine market during the last five decades (1971-2011). Ten cultivars, classified into two groups of five according to the time to anthesis in late cycle (LC) and early cycle cultivars (EC), were grown under twelve environments (E1 to E12) in Pergamino, Argentina. The environmental index of GY (average of cultivar's GY in each environment) ranged from 174 to 602 g m- 2. Under potential conditions (E1 to E3, 602 to 548 g m- 2), GY improved at 0.74 % per year of release (YOR) (or 4.20 g m- 2 per YOR) across all cultivars. The harvest index (HI), particularly in LC, and total biomass produced at physiological maturity (BTPM), associated with crop growth rate during stem elongation (CGRSE) and total biomass produced at anthesis (BTA), particularly in EC, were improved by breeding explaining the GY potential increase. Maximum HI reached 0.46, suggesting it can be further improved in both groups, but pre-anthesis growth should continue increasing in EC, as it seemed to be a yield-limiting trait for these cultivars. Grain number per m- 2 (GN) increased by recent breeding in both groups with no change in grain weight (GW). This was a consequence of greater grain number per spike (GNS) in EC, as expected, but higher spike number per m- 2 (SN) in LC. Fruiting efficiency (FE, grains g-1 of spike dry weight at anthesis -SDWA-), rather than SDWA, seems to have been improved by recent breeding, turning it a key trait to further increase GN. Finally, modern cultivars out-yielded the old ones in a wide range of environments, suggesting that wide adaptation is a valid breeding strategy for Argentine conditions.

AB  - This study documented the environmental properties of precipitation systems that produced the July 2018 Heavy Rainfall event in Japan. The gridded analysis data were used to diagnose the potential for the development of convective systems in terms of thermodynamic environmental indices. Precipitable water vapor was extremely larger than that seen in the climatology of warm-season quasi-stationary convective clusters (QSCCs). Such an extreme moisture content was realized by very humid conditions at the middle-levels. In contrast, temperature lapse rate in a convectively unstable layer was not so significant in comparison to the QSCC climatology. Among the environmental indices, K Index was shown to describe the potential for the rainfall development. Based on the analysis, the roles of moisture content and profile on the convection development were discussed. It was suggested that the middle-level high humidity contributes to the occurrence of the present heavy rainfall by minimizing negative effects of environmental mixing and by decreasing vertical displacements to reach levels of free convection. In regions where heavy rainfall occurred, an automated algorithm detected the development of QSCCs, which were mostly categorized as a linear type.

AB  - The development of offshore wind farms (OWFs) in the North Sea has increased considerably to create alternatives for fossil fuel energy. Activities related to the construction of OWFs, in particular gravity-based foundations (GBFs), are mainly associated to dredging, causing direct effects to the macrofauna in the seabed. The sediment characteristics and macrofauna were studied before and after construction (2005-2010) of six GBFs in an OWF in the Belgian part of the North Sea. We distinguished natural from anthropogenic-related fluctuations in macrofaunal communities by analysing a long-term dataset (1980-2012). The analysed sandbanks are characterised by sandy substrates and a community with low species abundance (180-812 ind m(-2)) and diversity (6-15 species per 0.1 m(2)). Strong temporal variations were observed possibly related to variable weather conditions in the area. Significant differences in community composition were observed due to the installation of six GBFs in the construction year of the OWF followed by a rapid recovery a year later and confirmed by the benthic ecosystem quality index BEQI. Even though the construction of GBFs creates a physical disturbance to the seabed, the macrobenthic community of these sediments have illustrated a fast recovery potential.

AB  - To protect the endangered Chinese White Dolphins in Xiamen coastal waters, an ecological risk assessment was made. This assessment was based on an evaluation framework using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response method, integrated with the guidelines given by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Aside from chemical stressors, other factors (including environmental investment, sewage treatment and others) were also taken into account. An integrated ecological risk assessment was applied using quantitative methodology, including eleven indicator parameters. The results demonstrated that the ecological risk for dolphins had increased with the urbanization process and economic development during 1996-2007. The highest risk occurred in 2003, and the lowest in 1996. Interestingly, the risk decreased significantly from 0.5629 in 2006 to 0.4745 in 2007. It was discovered that there were several crucial risk sources, including fishery outputs, port throughput, industrial effluent, and domestic sewage. These results could serve as a guide for protecting Chinese White Dolphins and other marine species that are being harmed by the booming urbanization process.

AB  - With minimal moral hazard and adverse selection, weather index insurance promises financial resilience to farmers struck by harsh weather conditions through swift compensation at affordable premium. Despite these advantages, the very nature of indexing gives rise to production basis risk as the selected weather indexes do not sufficiently correspond to actual damages. To address this problem, we develop a stochastic yield model, built upon a stochastic soil moisture model driven by marked Poisson rainfall. Our analysis shows that even under similar temperature and rainfall amount yields can differ significantly; this was empirically supported by a 2-year field experiment in which rain-fed maize was grown under very similar total rainfall. Here, the year with more intense, less-frequent rainfall produces a better yielda rare counter evidence to most climate change projections. Through a stochastic yield model, we demonstrate the crucial roles of rainfall intensity and frequency in determining the yield. Importantly, the model allows us to compute rainfall pattern-related basis risk inherent in cumulative rain index insurance. The model results and a case study herein clearly show that total rainfall is a poor indicator of yield, imposing unnecessary production basis risk on farmers and false-positive payouts on insurers. Incorporating rainfall intensity and frequency in the design of rain index insurance can offer farmers better protection, while maintaining the attractive features of the weather index insurance and thus fulfilling its promise of financial resilience.

AB  - There is observational evidence that hydrometeorological extremes, such as heavy rainfall events, have become more frequent and intense in the last decades around the world. In Brazil, intense rainfall events that triggered flash floods and landslides were responsible for 74% of the deaths related to natural disasters in the 1991-2010 period. To evaluate Brazil's hot spots of vulnerability to these disasters, two indices were developed using three data sets: (1) climate, with IPCC climate extreme indices; (2) environmental, including land use, drainage systems, relief, slope, road density and hydrography; and (3) socioeconomic, including the Gini coefficient, Human Development Index, housing conditions and a poverty-related index. Simulations at high resolution were carried out using the Eta 20-km regional climate model nested within two global climate models: HadGEM2 ES and MIROC 5 IPCC AR5 models. For the baseline period of 1961-1990, the vulnerability indices were adjusted by means of an iterative process and were validated by comparing them to the Brazilian National Disasters Data. The two indices were also used to estimate the vulnerability up to the end of the twenty-first century, using the representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 from the IPCC AR5 RCP scenarios. The results indicate a large increase in Brazil's vulnerability to landslides and flash floods in the context of climate change.

AB  - Implementation of ISO 14001:2004 (environmental management system) has been executed for reverse osmosis desalination plants for the first time in Iran at Noor Vijeh Company (N.V. Co), a water and wastewater firm based in Tehran. The scope of work was the activities and product of company's BWRO desalination plant in the city of Qom (3000 m(3) per day) and SWRO desalination plant in Assaluyeh, Pars Special Economic and Energy Zone, Iran. The aims of this project were in line with company's approach to sustainable development and its direction towards conducting environmental friendly activities and production characteristics.
   Initially the famous PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) was used to identify the aspects and evaluate their effects. The significant aspects of each plant affecting the environment are then identified and preventive control measures and reducing their probabilities of loss are anticipated. These cover the normal activities within each plant and those aspects arising from emergency conditions such as earthquakes, fire, etc.
   Elements of this system are
   Environmental policy and its targets and programmes
   Practical methods for environmental management system processes
   Executive manuals for implementing special activities
   Tables and indexes for environmental aspects for each plant
   Organizational charts, positions, qualifications, and necessary trainings for the involved personnel.
   Environmental aspects are evaluated through their interaction with and effects over, releases to water, emissions to air, land contamination, waste management, energy use, and use of natural resources and raw material.

AB  - Without monitoring anthropogenic pressures on the water environment, it is difficult to set realistic river restoration targets in relation to water quality. Therefore a more holistic approach is needed to systematically explore the links between socio-economic drivers and observed water quality-related impacts on river ecosystems. Using the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State of the Environment-Impacts-Responses) framework, this study linked ecological river restoration with the socio-economic sector, with the focus on promoting a pressure-oriented water quality monitoring system. Based on the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and relevant literature, it was found that most water quality-related indicators employed today are state/impacts-oriented, while very few are pressure-oriented. As a response, we call for more attention to a DPR (Drivers-Pressures-Responses) framework in developing an industrial ecology-based pressure-oriented water quality monitoring system for aiding ecological river restoration planning. This approach is characterized in general by accounting for material-related flows throughout the socio-economic sector in relation to river ecosystem degradation. Then the obtained information would help decision makers take appropriate measures to alleviate various significant human-induced wastes and emissions at their sources. We believe that such a pressure-oriented monitoring system will substantially complement traditional state/impacts-oriented environmental and ecological monitoring and help develop more proactive planning and decision-making processes for specific river restoration projects and general water quality management.

AB  - The juvenile demersal fish assemblage along the Pacific Northwest coast has received little attention relative to adult life history stages since pioneering work in the 1970s. Increasing severity of hypoxia along the Oregon coast in recent years has prompted investigations into the response of biota in this region. We used summer data (2008-2013) from a beam trawl survey targeting juvenile demersal fishes in soft-bottom habitats along the Oregon coast to describe patterns of distribution and abundance at fixed sampling stations (from 30 m to 100 m depth). We relate the assemblage and abundance of the common species to environmental variables and analyze condition of recently settled fish (<50 mm SL). Most of the captured fishes were young-of-the-year flatfishes, dominated by Butter Sole (Isopsetta isolepis), English Sole (Parophrys vetulus), Speckled Sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus), and Pacific Sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus). Community analysis of the full dataset showed some variation in species richness among years and high evenness across all sampling sites and years. Depth was a structuring variable for the community, indicated by multivariate nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis. Generalized additive models for common flatfish species abundances during the summer months indicated depth preferences, with Butter Sole, English Sole, and Speckled Sanddab at shallower locations and Pacific Sanddab occurring at deeper locations farther offshore. Additionally, while most common species were collected in high abundances in hypoxic conditions, dissolved oxygen was a significant factor in determining flatfish abundance. Condition factor was weakly negatively impacted by low dissolved oxygen for the species assessed, but the strength of the relationship varied by species. Increased sampling frequency and spatial coverage would improve our understanding of this community, especially in light of changing environmental drivers such as decreasing pH, warming water, and episodic periods of low dissolved oxygen coinciding with settlement for many species.

AB  - Phytophthora infestans is an important pathogen of potato and tomato worldwide. Knowledge of the fitness components (FCs), such as pathogenicity, virulence, latent period, lesion area and sporulation of isolates with different mating types from the same region, is important for improved understanding of the evolutionary potential of P. infestans and its short- and long-term management. The FCs and a Compound Biological Fitness Index (CBFI) of 12 strains of P. infestans collected from the central area of Mexico, with different mating types (A1, A2 and self-fertile), were compared under controlled conditions in growth chambers. All P. infestans strains were pathogenic, indicating that the conditions of the bioassays were adequate for disease development. FCs varied significantly among and within the three mating types, indicating that each group maintains substantial levels of genetic variation among and within isolates. The self-fertile group was significantly more fit in all FCs and CBFI, followed by groups A2 and A1. These results indicate that self-fertile strains are the most aggressive and have the greatest evolutionary potential in central Mexico. All FCs showed significant correlations with one another, indicating that these parameters can be used to estimate the biological fitness of P. infestans. These results provide fundamental information for the integrated management of this pathogen in central Mexico, as well as for understanding its evolutionary potential.

AB  - Coastal waters corresponding to macrotidal systems are among the most variable marine biotopes. Sessile animals as bivalve mollusks may however be found forming intertidal beds at high densities, as allowed by full adaptation to local conditions. A better knowledge of adaptive responses to environmental factors is required to foresee possible adverse effects of global change. At the sub-cellular level, transcriptional responses are among the earliest signals of environmental disturbances and they can reveal subtle and meaningful changes in organism exposed to stress. Three blue mussel (Mytilus spp.) populations inhabiting the Bay of Brest (France) in sites exposed to different levels of chronic pollution, from low to moderate, were surveyed upon a seasonal schedule, with special attention to the reproductive cycle. Major seawater parameters were monitored over a full-year in the framework of the S! RANO project, based on an automatic high frequency acquisition system installed aboard a ship of opportunity. The health status of mussels has been assessed by measuring a condition index and gametogenesis has been followed by histology. Selected biological responses to environmental stress were detected using a multimarker approach including expression of genes involved in chemical stress response and energetic metabolism, and cellular immune parameters. Environmental parameters showed deep seasonal variations which differed among sites. Most biological responses followed a seasonal pattern. Late winter and spring corresponded to an active reproduction period in the Bay of Brest. Earlier spawning was observed in harbor areas compared to the oceanic site and an altered physiological state was assumed in commercial harbor mussels during the reproductive period, suggesting that their health is compromised at this time of year. However, no signs of severe chemical stress were detected in both harbor mussel populations, which could reflect adaptive responses to adverse environmental conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Socioeconomic inequalities are major health determinants. To monitor and understand them at local level, ecological indexes of socioeconomic deprivation constitute essential tools. In this study, we describe the development of the updated version of the European Deprivation Index for Portuguese small-areas (EDI-PT), describe its spatial distribution and evaluate its association with a general health indicator-all-cause mortality in the period 2009-2012. Using data from the 2011 European Union-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey (EU-SILC), we obtained an indicator of individual deprivation. After identifying variables that were common to both the EU-SILC and the census, we used the indicator of individual deprivation to test if these variables were associated with individual-level deprivation, and to compute weights. Accordingly, eight variables were included. The EDI-PT was produced for the smallest area unit possible (n = 18084 census block groups, mean/area = 584 inhabitants) and resulted from the weighted sum of the eight selected variables. It was then categorized into quintiles (Q1-least deprived to Q5-most deprived). To estimate the association with mortality we fitted Bayesian spatial models. The EDI-PT was unevenly distributed across Portugal-most deprived areas concentrated in the South and in the inner North and Centre of the country, and the least deprived in the coastal North and Centre. The EDI-PT was positively and significantly associated with overall mortality, and this relation followed a rather clear dose-response relation of increasing mortality as deprivation increases (Relative Risk Q2 = 1.012, 95% Credible Interval 0.991-1.033; Q3 = 1.026, 1.004-1.048; Q4 = 1.053, 1.029-1.077; Q5 = 1.068, 1.042-1.095). Summing up, we updated the index of socioeconomic deprivation for Portuguese small-areas, and we showed that the EDI-PT constitutes a sensitive measure to capture health inequalities, since it was consistently associated with a key measure of population health/development, all-cause mortality. We strongly believe this updated version will be widely employed by social and medical researchers and regional planners.

AB  - A first mass balance food web model was developed to parameterize and characterize the structure and func-tioning of the upwelling ecosystem in the Southern Taiwan Strait (STWS). The model representing the ecosystem state and trophic flows in 2001 includes 50 functional groups from primary producer to marine mammal and 6 fishing fleets. The basic outputs and trophic flows in the ecosystem are analyzed using ecological indicators. Results indicate that phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos and shrimps are structuring groups while dolphins, top predatory fishes, seabirds, lizard fish, hairtail and mantis shrimps are the keystone groups within the ecosystem. Based on the maturity indicators, STWS is at a mature state. An analysis of control mechanisms in-dicates that the top-down effect was the primary ecosystem control mechanism, although bottom-up effect was also in play. In addition, fishing impacts were analyzed throughout the food web. Such modelling of the structure and functioning of ecosystem provides basic information for stakeholders and policy-makers to implement ecosystem-based management.

AB  - The Ga-Selati River has been systemically impaired by increasing human activities in its catchment, resulting in contamination by mining, industrial and agricultural effluents and domestic waste, and as a result significantly impacting the water quality of the river. The study aimed at investigating the ecological state of the Ga-Selati River and the impact of water quality on the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities was conducted in 2014 and 2015. Five sites along the Ga-Selati River were selected for sampling macroinvertebrates. The family composition, based on abundance and diversity, was evaluated in relation to environmental variables. The levels of dissolved oxygen, conductivity, total dissolved solids, turbidity and nutrients affected the distribution of tolerant taxa. The number and diversity of macroinvertebrates were found to be higher at less degraded upstream sites compared to more degraded downstream sites. A canonical analysis clearly grouped the various macroinvertebrates with the physico-chemical parameters having an influence on their distribution. The relatively high influence of environmental factors in the abundance and distribution of the sensitive taxa highlights the importance of environmental variation on macroinvertebrate assemblages.

AB  - The presence of toxic heavy metals and metalloids in aquatic environments constitutes a major risk and there is an urgent need for continuous monitoring of such pollutants. This study assesses the concentrations of arsenic (As) in surface sediments from 15 locations on the Lagos Lagoon, Nigeria during the wet and dry seasons to determine the degree of contamination. The results showed that the mean total As concentration in sediment (2.44 mg kg(-1) dry weight) did not exceed the Canadian Interim Sediment Quality Guideline (CISQG) value of 7.24 mg kg(-1) dry weight during the wet and dry seasons. Based on the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and ecological risk assessment using the enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (CF) and geo-accumulation index (I-geo), the study's results indicate two things: firstly, low to moderate and significant levels of enrichment from As; and secondly, low to moderate degree of contamination in Lagos Lagoon during the study period.

AB  - Large river bioassessment protocols lag far behind those of wadeable streams and often rely on fish assemblages of individual rivers. We developed a regional macroinvertebrate index and assessed relative condition of six large river tributaries to the upper Mississippi and Ohio rivers, Midwest USA. In 2004 and 2005, benthic macroinvertebrates, water chemistry, and habitat data were collected from randomly selected sites on each of the St. Croix, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Scioto, Wabash, and Illinois rivers. We first identified the human disturbance gradient using principal components analysis (PCA) of abiotic data. From the PCA, least disturbed sites showed strong separation from stressed sites along a gradient contrasting high water clarity, canopy cover, habitat scores, and plant-based substrates at one end and higher conductivity and nutrient concentrations at the other. Evaluation of 97 benthic metrics identified those with good range, responsiveness, and relative scope of impairment, as well as redundancies with other metrics. The final index was composed of Diptera taxa richness, EPT taxa richness, Coleoptera taxa richness, percent oligochaete and leech taxa, percent collector-filterer individuals, predator taxa richness, percent burrower taxa, tolerant taxa richness, and percent facultative individuals. Each of the selected metrics was scored using upper and lower thresholds based on all sites, and averaging across the nine metric scores, we obtained the Non-wadeable Macroinvertebrate Assemblage Condition Index (NMACI). The NMACI showed a strong response to disturbance using a validation data set and was highly correlated with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination axes of benthic taxa. The cumulative distribution function of index scores for each river showed qualitative differences in condition among rivers. NMACI scores were highest for the federally protected St. Croix River and lowest for the Illinois River. other rivers were intermediate and generally reflected the mixture of land use types within individual basins. Use of regional reference sites, though setting a high level of expectation, provides a valuable frame of reference for the potential of large river benthic communities that will aid management and restoration efforts.

AB  - The ecological behaviors of a network of pure evergreen oak stands (Quercus suber L. and Quercus ilex L.) in the Central-Western Mediterranean Basin were investigated toward climatic and edaphic factors implemented with the application of topographic wetness index (TWI). A Categorical Principal Component Analysis (Catpca) using climatic and soil physico-chemical parameters was performed on 23 cork oak and holm oak pure stands with the aim to understand better the effectiveness of TWI for characterizing soil ecology of the two species. Catpca pointed out that, although cork oak and holm oak are able to growth in similar Mediterranean conditions, they show different behaviors in terms of needs and tolerance to soil water content. TWI confirmed such results at local scale, allowing highlighting some interesting features of the species differential ecology. Although both species confirmed to be drought-tolerant, the heliophilous cork oak revealed to dominate the landscape on wettest soils with high TWI values-indicating the capacity to tolerate stresses due to periods of waterlogging-, while the shade-tolerant holm oak prevails for low-medium TWI values-drier and mesophilous sites. Despite the application of TWI to vegetation science and ecology is relatively recent, results are encouraging and suggest considering this user-friendly and synthetic index in ecological investigations and modeling.

AB  - In a set of field and laboratory experiments, the relative importance of (1) direct predation (measured as mortality in the prey populations), (2) physical disturbance of the sediment (sand and mud), and the combined effects of disturbance and predation, and (3) sublethal siphon cropping, were tested on an infaunal food web in the low-saline northern Baltic Sea. The predators used (Saduria entomon and Crangon crangon) are the major epibenthic crustacean predators of the northern Baltic coastal waters. and the prey organism in the experiments (the bivalve Macoma balthica) is, by frequency of occurrence and by biomass, the dominant infaunal organism among the zoobenthos. In the field the predatory effect of Saduria was tested on the entire infaunal community.
   The field experiment on direct predation by Saduria on the entire infaunal assemblage significantly reduced the density of the polychaete Manayunkia aestuarina. Aquarium experiments show that although direct predation by Saduria or physical sediment disturbance alone had little effects on juvenile (< 3 mm) Macoma, the combined effects of these factors were significant, and more important than the sum of the two single factors, demonstrating synergistic negative effects. Experiments with Saduria and Crangon in relation to adult (7-17 mm) Macoma showed sublethal effects on length-weight relationships and on a general index of condition in the mussels. The experiments illustrate that intricate combinations of biotic and physical (environmental) mechanisms may play important roles in the organization of zoobenthic communities.

AB  - The current trend of climatic alterations will accelerate the modification of the ocean system by, among other aspects, changing the metal speciation and its bioavailability which may have an impact in their accumulation by marine organisms. Understanding the impact of these potential changes is essential for future risk assessment of metal contamination. In the present study, we selected the species Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) as the main European aquaculture production bivalve and due to its widespread use for biomonitoring purposes. A long-term test (2 months) was carried out to explore the impact that global change in the marine environment (warming and CO2 increase) may exert on the accumulation of dissolved trace metals (Cu, Co, Pb, Cd, Cr, As and Ni) in different body parts of mussels (foot and rest of soft tissues).
   Studied mussels were collected at two different climatic locations (Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea) and exposed to unspiked, unpolluted seawater from the Vigo Ria (NW Iberian Peninsula). Results showed that under the global change conditions proposed in this study (1100 pCO(2) and 25 degrees C), the increase in temperature resulted in a lower condition index and byssus strength for mussels from Atlantic Sea, while Mediterranean sea mussels, adapted to higher temperatures, did not show remarkable variations. According to trace metals accumulation in different body parts of the studied mussels, it was observed that the effect of increasing CO2 alone did not show to have an impact in the bioaccumulation, but the combined stressors (increase in CO2 and temperature) may lead to an increase in the bioaccumulation for some elements. The increase in temperature resulted in a decrease of the Cu content of foot tissue (byssus gland) in mussels from Atlantic Sea, which is in accordance with the lower byssus strength observed under such conditions. Our results indicate that the expected seawater temperature increase, which will be produced gradually during next decades, should be further study to ensure the species adaptability and aquaculture production.

AB  - Two Australian cladocerans, Moina australiensis Sars and a species of Ceriodaphnia, were evaluated as possible biological indicator organisms to assess the toxicity of irrigation supply and drainage water of the Murrumbidgee and Coleambally Irrigation Areas. M. australiensis, being large (similar to 2000 mu m) and orange, was initially chosen to overcome visibility problems in highly turbid Australian inland waters. However, the organism responded erratically in culture. Mortality was high and neonate production was unpredictable when cultured under recommended United States Environmental Protection Agency protocols. Attempts to improve culture performance by optimizing food (quality and quantity), water (control source, hardness, volume) and temperature were only marginally successful. Similar difficulties were not evident when Ceriodaphnia sp. was used as the test organism. Although Ceriodaphnia sp is small (similar to 1000 mu m), grey and more difficult to see in turbid water its responses were more predictable and reliable than those of M. australiensis. Results of initial trials comparing the two organisms suggest that Ceriodaphnia sp. was a better test organism and more suited to local requirements.

AB  - In this study, we screened oxidative-coupling and electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions for developing simple, economic, and environment-friendly spectrophotometric methods for three widely prescribed phenolic drugs; salbutamol sulfate (SLB), terbutaline sulfate (TBT), and thymol (THY). Methods IA and IB rely on the oxidative-coupling reaction of SLB and TBT with p-phenylenediamine in the presence of an oxidizing agent in carbonate buffer while Method II depends on electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of THY with sodium nitroprusside/hydroxylamine hydrochloride in phosphate buffer (pH 12.0). Different experimental conditions controlling the derivatization reactions were optimized and the reaction products were quantified at 552, 400, and 700 nm, for SLB, TBT, and THY, respectively. Beer's-Lambert law was obeyed over wide linearity ranges with limits of detection from 6 to 126 ppb for the target analytes. Furthermore, the developed methods were validated as per ICH guidance. In addition, profiling of the methods greenness was conducted by adopting the National Environmental Methods Index and the analytical eco-scale score approaches. The two approaches elucidated the excellent greenness of the developed methods which emphasized their applicability for quality control analysis. Thus, the developed methods were efficaciously used for the determination of the three drugs in different dosage forms with excellent accuracy, where % found ranged from 98.86%-102.77%, and no interference from additives in the formulations.

AB  - We have implemented a specific data mining process to explore the relationship between biological indices and physico-chemical pressures in rivers. Data were collected in the framework of the French National monitoring network set up to assess the ecological status of rivers under the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). Chemical parameters and biological indices were collected regularly from 1.781 locations in metropolitan France from 2007 to 2013. The sequential pattern mining process generates closed partially ordered patterns representing a succession of physico-chemical events that precede a given biological index in a given status, validated using a subset of data. This paper focuses on the patterns and their occurrence. We showed that biological statuses depend on these temporal successions of alterations and not only on the last alterations. The physicochemical statuses of water bodies usually appeared to be higher than their biological statuses, suggesting synergism between toxicants and/or an additive impact of other stressors related to hydromorphology or hydrology. Patterns found in the highest biological status for the biological indices based on macroinvertebrates, diatoms, macrophytes or fish, were characterised by the constancy of a high physico-chemical status over time. By contrast, before indices based on macroinvertebrates and macrophytes, two types of patterns were observed for bad biological status: (1) a chronic multi-pressure pattern, in which pressure categories such as nitrates, pesticides and other organic hydrocarbons, in moderate, poor or bad status, repeated themselves several times over time, or (2) a single occurrence of a degraded pressure category, such as one moderate nitrogen, excluding nitrate, or one poor oxidizable organic matter, among other pressure categories in good status. Extracting such patterns is a promising solution both to disentangle the effects of the different stressors on water quality, and to identify the key temporal sequences among them in a context of multi-stress conditions, which is a challenge currently facing the WFD.

AB  - In order to assess the biological effects of the Prestige oil spill (POS), mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), European hake (Merluccius merluccius) and European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) were sampled between April and September 2003 in various geographical areas of Bay of Biscay: Galicia, Central Cantabrian and East Cantabrian. In mussels, several cell and tissue biomarkers were measured: peroxisome proliferation as induction of acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) activity, lysosomal responses as changes in the structure (lysosomal volume density, Vv(L), surface-to-volume ratio, S/V-L, and numerical density, Nv(L)) and in membrane stability (labilization period, LP), cell type replacement as relative proportion of basophilic cells (volume density of basophilic cells, Vv(BAS)) in digestive gland epithelium, and changes in the morphology of digestive alveoli as mean luminal radius to mean epithelial thickness (MLR/MET). Additionally, flesh condition index (FCI) and gonad index (GI) were measured as supporting parameters. In hake and anchovy, liver histopathology was examined to determine the prevalence of parasites, melanomacrophage centers, non-specific lesions (inflammatory changes, atrophy, necrosis, apoptosis), early non-neoplastic toxicopathic lesions (i.e., hepatocellular nuclear polymorphism), foci of cellular alteration, benign and malignant neoplasms. In mussels, AOX induction was noticeable in April except in Galicia. LP values were low in all the geographical areas studied, indicating disturbed health, especially in Galicia. Alike, lysosomal enlargement was observed in most stations as shown by the extremely low S/V-L values. Vv(BAS) and MLR/MET values were markedly high. Overall, employed biomarkers detected exposure to toxic chemicals and disturbed health in mussels from Bay of Biscay, with impact decreasing from April to September. Although hepatocellular nuclear polymorphism and nematode parasitization in fish liver were remarkably prominent in some areas, they cannot be hitherto related to POS, since we lack historical data to determine whether the prevalences found were normal or significantly raised after POS.

AB  - This study investigates the basic characteristics and proposes a concept for the complex system of geographical conditions (CSGC). By analyzing the DPSIR model and its correlation with the index system, we selected indexes for geographical conditions according to the resources, ecology, environment, economy and society parameters to build a system. This system consists of four hierarchies: index, classification, element and target levels. We evaluated the elements or indexes of the complex system using the TOPSIS method and a general model coordinating multiple complex systems. On this basis, the coordination analysis experiment of geographical conditions is applied to cities in the Henan province in China. The following conclusions were reached:. According to the pressure, state and impact of geographical conditions, relatively consistent measures are taken around the city, but with conflicting results.. The coordination degree of geographical conditions is small among regions showing large differences in classification index value. The degree of coordination of such regions is prone to extreme values; however, the smaller the difference the larger the coordination degree.. The coordinated development of geographical conditions in the Henan province is at the stage of the point axis.

AB  - Across the western United States, environmental water transaction programs (EWTPs) restore environmental flows by acquiring water rights and incentivizing changes in water management. These programs have evolved over several decades, expanding from relatively simple two-party transactions to multiobjective deals that simultaneously benefit the environment and multiple water-using sectors. Such programs now represent an important water management tool and provide an impetus for collaboration among stakeholders; yet, most evaluations of their effectiveness focus exclusively on environmental outcomes, without adequate attention to impacts on other water users or local economies. To understand how these programs affect stakeholders, a systematic, multiobjective evaluation framework is needed. To meet this need, we developed a suite of environmental and socioeconomic indicators that can guide the design and track the implementation of water transaction portfolios, and we applied them to existing EWTPs in Oregon and Nevada. Application of the indicators quantifies impacts and helps practitioners design water transaction portfolios that avoid unintended consequences and generate mutually beneficial outcomes among environmental, agricultural, and municipal interests.

AB  - Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) was ultilized as a core and functionalized with the rhodamine hydrazide receptors for incresing the sensitivity of Hg2+ sensing. The POSS sensor (T10Rh) was synthesised, and its sensing behaviors toward metal ions were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The sensor provided chromogenic and fluorogenic changes upon Hg2+ detection as well as served as a "naked-eye" indicator by a noticeable color change of the aqueous solutions (from colorless to pink-red color). The selective binding resulted in the change in the structures from the spirolactams (non fluorescent forms) to the non-cyclic forms (fluorescent forms) of T10Rh as indicated by the OFF-ON fluorescence signal upon Hg2+ binding and was shown to discriminate Cu2+, Ag+, Pb2+, Al3+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Li+, Na+, Ba2+, Ca2+ and K+, with ultra detection limit of 0.63 ppb which was lower than drinking water permission concentrations by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and World Health Organization (WHO).

AB  - Molecular methods were used to study variation in the taxonomic structure of bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities in soil samples taken along a salinity gradient from a solonchak in the vicinity of Lake Akkol' (Shingirlau, Kazakhstan). Soils from arable fields located 195 km from the solonchak served as the control. Total DNA was isolated from every sample and analyzed by T-RFLP and real-time PCR. Salinization was found to be the main ecological factor determining the structure of soil microbial community in the study region. The values of Simpson's index characterizing the diversity of this community proved to be similar in all the samples, which, however, significantly differed in the taxonomic composition of microorganisms. A significantly increased content of archaea was revealed in the sample with the highest salinity. The results of this study show that the structure of soil microbial community reflects specific features of a given soil and can be used as an indicator of its ecological state.

AB  - Ecological vulnerability assessment is a key approach to adaptation to and mitigation of environmental degradation. To assess the ecological vulnerability of Yinma River Basin in cold mountain region of China, the ecological vulnerability index (EVI) model was established based on the integrated system dynamic (SD) model and driving force-pressure-state-impact-response-management (DPSIRM) framework. Using multi-sources data including meteorological, remote sensing, basic geographical, sample and socio-economic data, the values of EVI were calculated. The assessment results indicated that the overall ecosystem vulnerability conditions in the study area experienced a degenerating trend. The extremely, heavily and moderately vulnerable zones were mainly distributed in the north-central and southwest parts of the basin. The slightly and lightly vulnerable areas were distributed in the southeast part of the basin. For the distribution of ecological vulnerability grades, in administrative regions, the high rate of slightly vulnerable level and light vulnerable level appeared in Shuangyang district and Panshi city while the largest area rate of moderately, heavily and extremely vulnerable level were distributed in Dehui city, Nongan county, jiutai district and Yitong county. The study demonstrated that the SD model could efficiently reflect the dynamic mechanism of the basin ecological vulnerability and the results gained closely reflected the reality of the study area.

AB  - This work proposes a vibration-based damage detection approach for axially loaded beam-type structures. The potential of the adopted approach is shown with an application to structural health monitoring of tie-rods: these elements, widely used in civil structures to balance horizontal forces in arches, are normally subject to a significant change of the axial load under environmental and operating conditions. The related changes in the modal parameters are usually greater than those caused by damage, at least at an early stage, making it hard to separate the different effects. In this work, the confounding effect of environmental factors is filtered out by considering more than one vibration mode at a time, thus framing damage detection as a multivariate outlier detection problem. Two damage indexes are presented, based on modal parameters (eigenfrequencies and mode shapes) and a multivariate metric (the Mahalanobis squared distance). The reasons behind the potential of the proposed framework are shown on simulated data first. Then, this strategy is validated on data coming from experimental tests, where two nominally identical tie-rods have been monitored for several months under the effects of realistic environmental and operational conditions. Both indexes proved to be weakly influenced by environmental variations, mainly related to temperature, and thus suitable for automatic damage detection.

AB  - The requirements of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), aimed at an integrative assessment methodology for evaluating the ecological status of water bodies are frequently being achieved through multimetric techniques, i.e. by combining several indices, which address different stressors or different components of the biocoenosis. This document suggests a normative methodology for the development and application of Multimetric Indices as a tool with which to evaluate the ecological status of running waters. The methodology has been derived from and tested on a European scale within the framework of the AQEM and STAR research projects, and projects on the implementation of the WFD in Austria and Germany. We suggest a procedure for the development of Multimetric Indices, which is composed of the following steps: (1) selection of the most suitable form of a Multimetric Index; (2) metric selection, broken down into metric calculation, exclusion of numerically unsuitable metrics, definition of a stressor gradient, correlation of stressor gradients and metrics, selection of candidate metrics, selection of core metrics, distribution of metrics within the metric types, definition of upper and lower anchors and scaling; (3) generation of a Multimetric Index (general or stressor-specific approach); (4) setting class boundaries; (5) interpretation of results. Each step is described by examples.

AB  - The aim of the researches was to reveal the particularities of natural varroa-resistance of honey bees of Carpathian race from the Moldavian Codri and their use in the selection and genetic amelioration of the local bee subpopulation. Scientific researches were a part of the SMARTBEE / FP7. Eu-KBBE. 2013.1.3-02 Sustainable Management of Resilient Bee Populations project, in collaboration with the Institute for Beekeeping Research and Development in Bucharest, Romania. In order to achieve the purpose, at the experimental apiary of the Institute of Zoology of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova an experiment was carried out, on a batch of 25 bee families, choosed randomly, supplemented with young queens, obtained conducting from the same apiary. The experiment lasted three years (March 2015-March 2018), in which the queens were not replaced, and the bee families during the entire experimental period were not subjected to any anti-varroa or other disease treatment, nor additional feeding in spring or autumn with nutritional stimulators has not been applied. It was found that under natural conditions, without anti-varroa drug interventions and without the change of queens, from 25 colonies at the begining of experiment only 11 survived, which is 44%. In the bee families that survived in the third year of experiment, the index of natural Varroa mite fall during September-October was higher, compared to the first-year bee families by 42.7-43.0% (td=2.3-1.3; P<0.05 and P>0.1) and 2.7-3.0 times compared to the bee families of the second year (t(d)=4.9-3.0; P<0.001 and P<0.01). Infestation degree of bees with Varroa mite increased, reaching peak values in the third experimental year, up to 4.81 +/- 1.00 mites/10 grams of bees, which led to the inhibition of the main physiological functions of reproduction and developing of bee families. The infestation of capped brood cells with Varroa mite progressed in the third year of experiment, being significantly higher in September by 11.5% (t(d)=2.9; P<0.01), compared with the same month of the previous year, which lead to a decrease in the quantity of capped brood, of the colonies strength and the weakening of the vital activity of the bee families as a whole. Queens prolificity declined significantly in October from 700 eggs/24 hours in the first year, to 234 eggs/24 hours in the third year, being less in the last year with 466 eggs/24 hours, or 66.6% (td=5.1; P<0.001). Out of the 11 bee families, which survived in natural conditions for three years, 5 more valuble families were selected in the breeding batch for reproduction. The bee families of the breed batch significantly exeeded the families from experimental batch after the queens prolificity-with 18.4% (P<0.05), the amount of capped brood-with 18.6% (P<0.05) and honey production - with 6.8% (P<0.01). At the same time, in the bee families of the breeding batch, the degree of infestation with mites was lower, the index of natural mites fall and the colonies strength-higher, as well as the boosted wintering resistance, ranging from 82.3-89.0%.

AB  - Ungulates are key components in ecosystems and economically important for sport and subsistence harvest. Yet the relative importance of the effects of weather conditions, forage productivity, and carnivores on ungulates are not well understood. We examined changes in elk (Cervus canadensis) recruitment (indexed as age ratios) across 7 states and 3 ecotypes in the northwestern United States during 1989-2010, while considering the effects of predator richness, forage productivity, and precipitation. We found a broad-scale, long-term decrease in elk recruitment of 0.48 juveniles/100 adult females/year. Weather conditions (indexed as summer and winter precipitation) showed small, but measurable, influences on recruitment. Forage productivity on summer and winter ranges (indexed by normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI] metrics) had the strongest effect on elk recruitment relative to other factors. Relationships between forage productivity and recruitment varied seasonally and regionally. The productivity of winter habitat was more important in southern parts of the study area, whereas annual variation in productivity of summer habitat had more influence on recruitment in northern areas. Elk recruitment varied by up to 15 juveniles/100 adult females across the range of variation in forage productivity. Areas with more species of large carnivores had relatively low elk recruitment, presumably because of increased predation. Wolves (Canis lupus) were associated with a decrease of 5 juveniles/100 adult females, whereas grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) were associated with an additional decrease of 7 juveniles/100 adult females. Carnivore species can have a critical influence on ungulate recruitment because their influence rivals large ranges of variation in environmental conditions. A more pressing concern, however, stems from persistent broad-scale decreases in recruitment across the distribution of elk in the northwestern United States, irrespective of carnivore richness. Our results suggest that wildlife managers interested in improving recruitment of elk consider the combined effects of habitat and predators. Efforts to manage summer and winter ranges to increase forage productivity may have a positive effect on recruitment. (C) 2018 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - P>1. State-and-transition models (STMs) synthesize and communicate knowledge about the alternative states of an ecosystem and causes of state transitions. Data supported narrative descriptions within STMs are used to select or justify management actions. State transitions are characteristically heterogeneous in space and time, but spatial heterogeneity is seldom described in STMs, thereby limiting their utility.
   2. We conducted a review that indicates how spatially explicit data can be used to improve STMs. We first identified three spatial scales at which spatial patterns and processes are manifest: patches, sites and landscapes. We then identified three classes of spatial processes that govern heterogeneity in state transitions at each scale and that can be considered in empirical studies, STM narratives and management interpretations.
   3. First, spatial variations in land-use driver history (e.g. grazing use) can explain differences in the occurrence of state transitions within land areas that are otherwise uniform. Secondly, spatial dependence in response to drivers imposed by variations in soils, landforms and climate can explain how the likelihood of state transition varies along relatively static environmental gradients. Thirdly, state transition processes can be contagious, under control of vegetation-environment feedbacks, such that the spatiotemporal evolution of state transitions is predictable.
   4. We suggest a strategy for considering each of the three spatial processes in the development of STM narratives. We illustrate how spatial data can be employed for describing early warning indicators of state transition, identifying areas that are most susceptible to state transitions, and designing and implementing monitoring schemes.
   5. Synthesis and applications. State-and-transition models are increasingly important tools for guiding land-management activities. However, failure to adequately represent spatial processes in STMs can limit their ability to identify the initiation, risk and causes of state transitions and, therefore, the appropriate management responses. We suggest that multi-scaled studies targeted to different kinds of ecosystems can be used to uncover evidence of spatial processes. Such evidence should be included in STM narratives and can lead to novel interpretations of land change and improved management.

AB  - Prioritizing and assessing the condition of sites for conservation action requires robust and ergonomic methodological tools. We focus here on prioritizing freshwater sites using two promising biodiversity indices, the Dragonfly Biotic Index (DBI) and Average Taxonomic Distinctness (AvTD). The AvTD had no significant association with either species richness or endemism. In contrast, the DBI was highly significantly associated with species richness and endemism, although the strengths of the associations were weak. These associations are related to how the sub-indices in the DBI are weighted, and how species are distributed geographically. Additionally, the DBI was found to be very useful for site selection based on its ability to measure ecological integrity, combined with level of threat, at multiple spatial scales. The AvTD was found to be useful principally for regional use. As the DBI is a low-cost, easy-to-use method, it has the additional use as a method for assessing habitat quality and recovery in restoration programs. The DBI operates at the species level, and is therefore highly sensitive to habitat condition and has great potential for environmental assessment and monitoring freshwater biodiversity and quality. Practical, worked examples of river restoration are given here. In view of the ease and versatility by which the DBI can be employed, we recommend its testing and possible integration into freshwater management and conservation schemes elsewhere in the world.

AB  - A comfortable outdoor thermal environment is very important for pedestrian's health and safety. Many specific design scenarios were well documented in previous studies. However, simulation studies about microclimate for one month/season are still lacking. In this paper, an hourly simulation system for outdoor thermal environment was developed to study more about the impact of time dependent parameters on outdoor microclimate. To evaluate pedestrians' thermal comfort condition, thermal indexes for hourly evaluation were proposed. A comfortable outdoor environment was defined as an environment in which pedestrians can reach comfort by adjusting their clothes insulation. A simple case of a 100 m x 100 m block with six 16-floor buildings was studied and results of different time durations were analyzed. From simulation results of each season, it can be concluded that both the radiation and ventilation conditions are the main aspects of outdoor thermal environment design. Simulation results of two typical summer hours and the "average temperature day" differ from that of one month. If only one hour or one day is considered, the designers will be misled by the simulation. In this case, simulation system for hourly evaluation is more informative. Results of statistical sampling method were compared with hourly simulation. The comparison shows that designers can reduce the calculation time by only simulating the sampled hours at the preliminary design stage.

AB  - Recently, prednisolone has been used in treating many medical conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. It is also prescribed to mitigate the respiratory complications caused by COVID-19 infection. It can cause some health complications, such as GIT ulcers, so it should be co-administered with proton-pump inhibitors, such as esomeprazole, to prevent the risk of ulcers. This work aims to develop an ecofriendly and sensitive TLC method for simultaneous determination of esomeprazole and prednisolone in their binary mixtures and spiked human plasma. Separation was performed using a mixture of ethyl acetate, methanol, and ammonia (9.5:0.5:0.1, v/v/v) as an eluting system with UV scanning at 245 nm. Dapoxetine was used as an internal standard to correct the variation during sampling. The resulting R-f values for plasma, esomeprazole, prednisolone, and dapoxetine were 0.03, 0.51, 0.72 and 0.85, respectively. Four greenness assessment tools-national environmental method index, eco-scale assessments, analytical greenness metric approach (AGREE), and green analytical procedure index (GAPI)-were used to evaluate the greenness characteristics of the proposed method to the environment, and the results were acceptable and satisfactory. Validation parameters were checked according to the US FDA guidelines to achieve the international requirements for bioanalytical method validation, and the results were within the accepted ranges.

AB  - The change of animal biometrics (body mass and body size) can reveal important information about their living environment as well as determine the survival potential and reproductive success of individuals and thus the persistence of populations. However, weighing individuals like marine turtles in the field presents important logistical difficulties. In this context, estimating body mass (BM) based on body size is a crucial issue. Furthermore, the determinants of the variability of the parameters for this relationship can provide information about the quality of the environment and the manner in which individuals exploit the available resources. This is of particular importance in young individuals where growth quality might be a determinant of adult fitness. Our study aimed to validate the use of different body measurements to estimate BM, which can be difficult to obtain in the field, and explore the determinants of the relationship between BM and size in juvenile green turtles. Juvenile green turtles were caught, measured, and weighed over 6 years (2011 2012; 2015 2018) at six bays to the west of Martinique Island (Lesser Antilles). Using different datasets from this global database, we were able to show that the BM of individuals can be predicted from body measurements with an error of less than 2%. We built several datasets including different morphological and time-location information to test the accuracy of the mass prediction. We show a yearly and north - south pattern for the relationship between BM and body measurements. The year effect for the relationship of BM and size is strongly correlated with net primary production but not with sea surface temperature or cyclonic events. We also found that if the bay locations and year effects were removed from the analysis, the mass prediction degraded slightly but was still less than 3% on average. Further investigations of the feeding habitats in Martinique turtles are still needed to better understand these effects and to link them with geographic and oceanographic conditions.

AB  - In recent years, suboptimal environmental conditions have been frequently reported to negatively impact on aquaculture organisms. Salinity is an important environmental factor, and its fluctuation will affect survival, growth and, potentially, the meat quality of the organisms with narrow salt tolerance cultured in coastal and inner bay. The aim of the study was to ascertain and report the influence of sub-low salinity (28 and 30) on the production traits and nutrient composition of the Pacific abaloneHaliotis discus hannai(DD), and two of its hybrids (DF and SD). In view of this, 360 abalones were subjected to four salinity levels (28, 30, 32 and 34) for ninety days. The data showed that the weight gain and the specific growth rates in wet weight between the groups followed the trend of DF > SD > DD. DF recorded the highest meat yield, which was significantly higher than SD and DD (p < .05). The sub-low salinities tested did not influence moisture content, crude protein, total lipid and total carbohydrate (p > .05). Whilst lipid levels were fairly higher in SD and DF than in DD, at sub-low salinities, the opposite was true for carbohydrate content. Total minerals (ash), however, were influenced by salinity (p < .05). Individuals reared at 28 significantly differed from those of the other three treatments, but there was no significant difference between the groups (p > .05). Further analysis showed sodium and potassium as the predominant minerals-with a higher concentration of sodium at higher salinities, though no significant difference was found between individuals treated at 30, 32 and 34. Zinc was the only mineral not affected by salinity (p > .05), and the accumulation of discrete minerals by the species significantly differed from one mineral to the other and proved to be species-specific. Notwithstanding, SD demonstrated superior content of most essential minerals over DF and DD. The results in this paper infer that the Pacific abalone and its hybrids could maintain good meat quality and survival under a range of 28-34 of salinity, promoting the growth of cultured abalone under the sub-low salinity of 28.

AB  - Block is the basic unit for studying the urban activities of residents, and block vitality is the concrete expression of urban dynamics at the block level. The quality of the block's residential environment is a crucial medium to satisfy the residents' pursuit of high-quality life; good block quality is essential for fostering the block vitality and further enhancing the overall vitality of the city. This study used the distribution density of cellular signaling data to quantify block vitality and constructed a block environment index system covering four dimensions-block accessibility, block function, block development degree, and human perception of block environment-innovatively introducing the elements of block environment from the human perspective. Considering the variability of block vitality between workdays and weekends, and between downtown and suburban blocks, this study used a geographically weighted regression model to show the mechanism of the spatial and temporal influence of indicators on block vitality, as well as to suggest how to enhance block vitality at different times of the day based on the influence mechanism. This study was conducted in Wuhan, China. The findings suggest that block vitality exhibited significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity. A high-vitality block can be created by enhancing the block's accessibility, increasing the degree of block construction, and enriching the functional density and mix of functions in the block. A pleasantly green environment with a moderate degree of openness exerted a significant impact on promoting human activity and enhancing block vitality. The creation of high-vitality blocks should also consider the differences in the impact of various elements on block vitality between weekend and workday. For example, amid the surge in travel demand for education venues on weekends, enhancing the accessibility of blocks can significantly increase the vitality of blocks on weekends. We can truly realize the people-oriented approach to build a livable and high-vitality city by adapting to local conditions and time.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the nature of anisotropic spherically symmetric relativistic star models in the framework of f(R,T) gravity. To discuss the features of compact stars, we consider that in the interior of the stellar system, the fluid distribution is influenced by MIT bag model equation of state. We construct the field equations by employing Krori-Barua solutions and obtain the values of unknown constants with the help of observational data of Her X-1, SAX J 1808.4-3658, RXJ 1856-37 and 4U1820-30 star models. For a viable f(R,T) model, we study the behavior of energy density, transverse as well as radial pressure and anisotropic factor in the interior of these stars for a specific value of the bag constant. We check the physical viability of our proposed model and stability of stellar structure through energy conditions, causality condition and adiabatic index. It is concluded that our model satisfies the stability criteria as well as other physical requirements, and the value of bag constant is in well agreement with the experimental value which highlights the viability of our considered model.

AB  - Sources of pollution discharges and water quality samples at 27 stations in 2006 in the coastal waters of Hebei Province, western Bohai Sea, have been analyzed in this study. Pollutant loads from industrial sewages have shown stronger impact on the water environment than those from the general sewages. Analysis indicates that pollution of COD is mainly resulted from land-based point pollutant sources. For phosphate concentration, non-point source pollution from coastal ocean (fishing and harbor areas) plays an important role. To assess the water quality conditions, Organic Pollution Index and Eutrophication Index have been used to quantify the level of water pollution and eutrophication conditions. Results show that pollution was much heavier in the dry season than flood season in 2006. Based on COD and phosphate concentrations, results show that waters near Shahe River, Douhe River, Yanghe River, and Luanhe River were heavily polluted. Water quality in the Qinhuangdao area was better than those in the Tangshan and Cangzhou areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous work had indicated that the Virginian Province Index did not perform well in a smaller estuarine complex. While it was hoped that the existing Chesapeake Bay Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity, with its greater number of metrics and habitat separation would be more adaptable, this index also did not perform well outside of Chesapeake Bay. In this study we assembled additional metrics and applied different methods of index compilation to explore the indices relative strengths and weaknesses. Three different approaches were utilized - two multimetric indices (Chesapeake Bay IBI and the Mebane IBI) and a statistical logistic regression technique. The data were subdivided by habitat (salinity and grain size), and indices compiled using the same initial group of benthic metrics. Each approach was examined for its classification accuracy for both reference and impaired sites for the entire Virginian Province. The Chesapeake Bay IBI approach did not perform well in this study. In contrast, another multimetric approach, the Mebane IBI approach, performed well, as did the statistical logistic regression approach. Both techniques have promise for index development and could be useful in applying a biological condition gradient to estuaries. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Growth of seed mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Bivalvia: Mytilidae) from two origins (rocky shore and collector ropes) placed on raft culture was compared. Mussel seed were cultivated following the commercial culture phases commonly used in Galician Rias: (a) from seeding to thinning-out and (b) from thinning-out to harvest. Differences in growth rate were clearly related to the phase of the culture, being significant during the first phase from seeding to thinning out (January-November 1998). In the latter phase, weight values observed for collector rope mussels were significantly higher than those for rocky shore individuals (0.65 vs 0.45 g total dry weight, 0.11 vs 0.08 g tissue dry weight, 0.53 vs 0.37 g shell dry weight and 0.09 vs 0.07 g tissue organic weight per month, respectively; P < 0.001). Neither shell length nor weight (soft tissue or shell) growth rate showed differences during the second phase of the culture from thinning out to harvest (November 1998-july 1999; P > 0.05). Nevertheless, in terms of output, the higher number of individuals above 70 mm (77% vs 61%) and the heavier soft tissue (and total) weight (23-30%) for collector ropes mussels when compared to rocky shore ones at harvest, highlighted the importance of choosing the former stock. Condition index (CI) did not differ at the onset of the culture between both origins (P 0.05), but mussels from collector ropes showed significantly higher values than those from the rocky shore from May to November 1998 (P < 0.001) before thinning- out was undertaken. No differences in CI were observed from thinning out to harvest between both types of mussels (P > 0.05). Although both populations showed normal (unimodal) size distributions at the onset of the culture, mussels from rocky shore origin fitted better to bimodal profiles throughout the first phase of the culture. These bimodal distributions of rocky shore population did disappear during the second phase suggesting a more uniform size spectrum as a consequence of the thinning out process, which involves a selection of size.

AB  - This paper presents an approach for preparing a comprehensive national marine ecosystem assessment and its application to the marine and coastal areas of the State of Kuwait. The approach is based on a set of principles to enable diverse data sources, of differing data quality and salience, to be combined into a single coordinated national assessment of marine ecosystem status to support the implementation of ecosystem-based management. The approach enables state assessments for multiple components of the marine ecosystem to be undertaken in a coordinated manner, using differing methods varying from quantitative to qualitative assessments depending on data and indicator availability. The marine ecosystem assessment is structured according to 6 major themes: i) Biodiversity, ii) Commercial Fisheries, iii) Food and Water Quality for Human Health, iv) Environmental Pollution, v) Eutrophication and Harmful Algal Blooms, and vi) Coastal Process and Oceanography. Comprehensive ecosystem assessments are an essential part of implementing the ecosystem approach, however detailed data directly related to clear, specified numerical management targets covering all aspects of a marine ecosystem are rarely available. The development of a State of the Marine Environment Report (SOMER) for Kuwait demonstrates that a coordinated comprehensive ecosystem assessment can be conducted using disparate data, and in relation to partially specified regulatory management objectives. The Kuwait SOMER highlighted the issues of coastal pollution, particularly sewage, for human health and the environment. It shows that the rapid urbanization of Kuwait has led to significant changes in the ecology, with clear impacts on coral reef health, the availability of nesting locations for turtles and habitats for migratory birds. Long-term changes in nutrient input, via waste water and modified freshwater inputs is resulting in demonstrable impacts on a range of marine species and habitats within Kuwait marine waters. It also supports the move towards a regional approach required due to transboundary properties of many of the ecosystem components, drivers and pressures.

AB  - Natural biotoxins and anthropogenic toxicants pose a significant risk to sea turtle health. Documented effects of contaminants include potential disease progression and adverse impacts on development, immune function, and survival in these imperiled species. The shallow seagrass habitats of Florida's northwest coast (Big Bend) serve as an important developmental habitat for Kemp's ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtles; however, few studies have been conducted in this area. Our objectives were (1) to evaluate plasma analytes (mass, minimum straight carapace length, body condition index [BCI], fibropapilloma tumor score, lysozyme, superoxide dismutase, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, plasma protein electrophoresis, cholesterol, and total solids) in Kemp's ridleys and green turtles and their correlation to brevetoxins that were released from a red tide bloom event from July-October 2014 in the Gulf of Mexico near Florida's Big Bend, and (2) to analyze red blood cells in Kemp's ridleys and green turtles for toxic elements (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, selenium, thallium) with correlation to the measured plasma analytes. Positive correlations were observed between brevetoxins and alpha(2)-globulins in Kemp's ridleys and alpha(2)- and gamma-globulins in green turtles, indicating potential immunostimulation. Arsenic, cadmium, and lead positively correlated with superoxide dismutase in Kemp's ridleys, suggesting oxidative stress. Lead and mercury in green turtles negatively correlated with BCI, while mercury positively correlated with total tumor score of green turtles afflicted with fibropapillomatosis, suggesting a possible association with mercury and increased tumor growth. The total tumor score of green turtles positively correlated with total protein, total globulins, alpha(2)-globulins, and gamma-globulins, further suggesting inflammation and immunomodulation as a result of fibropapillomatosis. Lastly, brevetoxin concentrations were positively related to tumor score, indicating potential tumor promotion by brevetoxin. These results signify that brevetoxins and toxic elements elicit various negative effects on sea turtle health, including immune function, oxidative stress, and possibly disease progression.

AB  - Background and aims: Recognizing the relationship among the composition, structure and functionality of an ecosystem leads us to deduce that the services derived from them are vulnerable to changes in land use. Owing to that, the sustainable development of populations cannot only be achieved with the management of economic and social capitals but must be integrated with an adequate management of natural capital. In the mountain ranges of the south of Cordoba (Argentina), the accelerated anthropization process has modified the natural landscape of the upper basin of the Rio Cuarto river, reducing ecosystem services, so this study aims to characterize its vegetation and assess its conservation status.
   M&M: Vegetation censuses were carried out in the different environments and the environmental units were digitized. Then, the Integral Environmental Assessment Index was applied in order to define the conservation value.
   Results: Seven vegetation units belonging to the biogeographic province of Chaco and three to Comechingones were defined. One hundred ninety-six environmental units (UA) were digitized, 8% of which were in very good condition covering large areas. Thirty-nine percent of the defined UA were in poor condition and are located below 850 meters above sea level.
   Conclusions: These results allowed us to generate new knowledge to complete the landscape scenario of one of the most important basins in the Cordoba province as well as providing higher resolution information to be used by conservation agency in the implementation of Law 9814 on the territorial planning of the native forests.

AB  - Eightysix genotypes of quality protein maize (Zea mays L.) including 12 parents, their 66 crosses and 7 checks were evaluated for morpho-physiological traits in four environments created by withdrawing irrigation at different crop growth stages in winter (rabi) season of 2009-10. Hybrids exhibited higher grain yield/plant and low chlorophyll stability index in stress condition, were found good for stress environments. The traits under investigation were governed by additive and non-additive gene action and thus could be improved through selection, followed by hybridization. Among the good general combining inbreds with high per se performance for grain yield was P7 and P12. Among the hybrids, P9 x P12 and P4 x P12 were found best for all the environments but P10 x P12, P1 x P7, P1 x P4 were best only in well irrigated environments. The above hybrids also exhibited higher estimates of specific combining ability effects, economic heterosis and per-se performance in all the environments for grain yield/plant and chlorophyll stability index (CSI).

AB  - Procurement auctions have been the main mechanism to ensure the deployment of utility-scale solar photovoltaic installations (USSPVI) in Brazil. To participate in the auction, investors must comply with all established requirements. In the solar case, the criteria incorporate State environmental licensing regulations (EL). The procurement auctions are a nationwide competition whereas the environmental licensing for those projects are under state jurisdiction. The lack of national guidance to licensing USSPVI might cause significant movement of projects to States whose EL procedures require fewer studies. This work examines the role of environmental licensing in the energy planning for USSPVI in Brazil. Analysing the 27 state regulations establishing the screening requirements that subject EIA to USSPVI, there are uneven threshold criteria to determine whether the plant will go through simplified licensing or regular process. There is also a need for studies tackling strategic environmental assessment for wind and solar expansion in Brazil. Specifically, incorporation of community concerns, public participation, and environmental constraints into the early stages of decision-making to prevent impacts and conflicts.

AB  - Entry into the viable but nonculturable (VNC) state is a survival mechanism that bacteria can adopt when they find themselves in an adverse environment. When in this state, bacteria are still viable but are unable to form colonies on growth medium. The possibility of Gram-positive species entering the VNC state when environmental conditions are adverse and remaining viable and capable of resuming active growth is demonstrated for the first time in this study by using exponential-phase cultures of Enterococcus faecalis inoculated in filtered, sterilized water from Lake Garda (Italy). Over the 60-day study, the number of total cells stained with a fluorescent stain or counted with a Coulter Counter remained constant, while the number of cells capable of forming colonies on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) declined rapidly from 10(6) CFU/ml on day zero to 10(3) CFU/ml on day 4. On day 14 no colonies could be observed when 50 ml of inoculated lake water were plated. E. faecalis cells conserved their viability while in the VNC state, as can be demonstrated by active uptake of amino acids, which are also incorporated into proteins, and by continuous detection of E. faecalis specific DNA by PCR throughout the experiment. The possibility of revival of the E. faecalis cells in the VNC state when returned to conditions supporting its cell growth has also been demonstrated. The data obtained in this study lend further support to recent criticisms of the traditional methods used to evaluate water quality based on plate counts, assessing fecal contamination indicators such as Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci.

AB  - The occurrence of 14 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency was investigated in surface seawater of Yangpu Bay, China in November 2013 (winter) and May 2014 (summer). Seventy-two samples were collected from 12 sampling sites. The total concentrations of PAHs in Yangpu Bay showed obvious variations in different seasons, which varied from 582.8 to 2208.3 ng L-1 in winter and 952.4 to 1201.7 ng L-1 in summer, respectively. Two-ring PAHs accounted for more than 91.6% of total PAHs in winter, and three-ring PAHs were dominant with 81.6% of total PAHs in summer. Molecular indices analyses indicated that the main source of PAHs in Yangpu Bay could be petrogenic contamination. The ecological risk assessment by Risk quotients (RQ(NCs) and RQ(MPCs)) showed a potential ecological risk of PAHs in Yangpu Bay, indicating a close attention should be paid to pollution of PAHs in the coastal area of Yangpu.

AB  - Industrial ecosystem is an important approach for sustainable development. In an industrial ecosystem, a group of industries are inter-connected through mass and energy exchanges for mutual benefits. However, some mass and energy exchange activities may cause unexpected environmental impacts. Therefore, it is vital to evaluate the environmental impacts of the symbiosis in order to provide a clear guidance for the decision-makers and stakeholders.
   The agro-chemical complex in the Lower Mississippi River Corridor with thirteen chemical and petrochemical industries emits huge amount of carbon dioxide. A bi-level design methodology is used to reconfigure this complex for utilizing surplus carbon dioxide. By using a superstructure-based approach, a new design scheme for this industrial ecosystem is proposed. In this paper, an LCA-type environmental impact assessment of different design schemes for this complex is conducted using the software TRACI, a tool developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This analysis compares various environmental impacts of different designs and identifies the potential trade-offs in different environmental impact categories. This information provides deep insight about the environmental sustainability of industrial ecosystems and facilitates the development of the most eco-effective symbiosis for recycle, reuse and resource conservation.

AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars grown in the southern Great Plains of the U.S.A. are exposed to a wide range of moisture conditions due to large fluctuations in the amount and frequency of rainfall. Yield stability under those conditions is therefore a desirable trait for wheat breeders. Our primary objective was to quantify various genetic parameters for grain production in drought-stressed and irrigated environments. We also attempted to predict and measure yield responses when selection is practiced in either drought-stressed or irrigated environments, or both. Seventy F2-derived lines from the cross, TAM W-101/Sturdy, were evaluated at Goodwell, OK, under irrigated and naturally drought-stressed conditions in 1987 and 1988. Genetic variance and heritability estimates were higher in the irrigated environment than in the drought-stressed environment. The genetic correlation coefficient for yields in the two environments was 0.20 +/- 0.16, indicating that selection of widely adapted genotypes requires testing in both environments. Based on the genetic variance/covariance structure of this particular population, the linear index which maximized the combined expected gain in both environments was 0.66Y1 + 0.34Y2, in which Y1 and Y2 are yields in the irrigated and drought-stressed environments. This index is not expected to apply across all populations; rather, it further supports the hypothesis that testing in either environment alone (drought stressed or irrigated) may not be most effective for increasing either mean productivity or yield under drought stress.

AB  - This article deals with the development of a new model for measuring job quality based on the intrinsic components of work, an European Intrinsic Job Quality Index. The objective is measure job quality on the basis of the characteristics inherent to the labour activity itself, and not from its financial rewards. First, we review the existing literature on current measurement models and justify the need for an index of this nature. Secondly, we explain the fundamental methodological decisions adopted for the construction of the index, and present the descriptive model, the indicators that make up each dimension, and the empirical model. Finally, we present the index scores by European Union countries within the framework of institutional theories. In this work, we have used a quantitative methodology, based on social indicator systems, and it has been carried out mainly with data from the European Working Conditions Survey (2015). The fundamental contribution of this article is the construction of a new model for measuring the quality of work, robust, valid and reliable, which will allow us to monitor the intrinsic job quality of the member countries, and thus provide relevant information that contributes to the framework of public policies.

AB  - The fish assemblage in the Noetsie Estuary, a temporarily open and closed estuary on the southern coast of South Africa, was sampled using multiple gears. A total of 12 species from 8 families were recorded. Collectively, estuarine-dependent marine species dominated seine net catches numerically and in terms of biomass for both sampling seasons. Estuarine round herring (Gilchristella aestuaria) was numerically the dominant species in late summer, while juvenile Mugilidae dominated catches in winter. Size class distributions of various fish species indicate that the estuary both serves a nursery function for important euryhaline marine species and supports estuarine resident taxa. Application of the Estuarine Fish Community Index indicates the ecological condition of the estuary to be 'good'. This study contributes to the species list for the estuary while also reporting the presence of an alien invasive freshwater species, Gambusia affinis. Recommendations include the development of a management plan and the formalisation of an estuarine management committee.
   Conservation implications: The Noetsie Estuary serves a nursery function for important euryhaline marine species, while supporting healthy populations of estuarine resident taxa. The presence of one alien invasive fish species is documented with potential implications for the conservation of biodiversity in the estuary.

AB  - Due to the excessive use of natural resources in the contemporary world, the importance of ecological and environmental condition modeling has increased. Wetlands and cities represent the natural and artificial strategic areas that affect ecosystem conditions. Changes in the ecological conditions of these areas have a great impact on the conditions of the global ecosystem. Therefore, modeling spatiotemporal variations of the ecological conditions in these areas is critical. This study was aimed at comparing degrees of variation among surface ecological conditions due to natural and unnatural factors. Consequently, the surface ecological conditions of Gomishan city and Gomishan wetland in Iran were modeled for a period of 30 years, and the spatiotemporal variations were evaluated and compared with each other. To this end, 20 Landsat 5, 7, and 8, and 432 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), monthly land surface temperature (LST) (MOD11C3) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (MOD13C3) products were utilized. The surface ecological conditions were modeled according to the Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index (RSEI), and the spatiotemporal variation of the RSEI values in the study area (Gomishan city, Gomishan wetland) were evaluated and compared with each other. According to MODIS products, the mean of the LST and NDVI variance values for the study area (Gomishan city, Gomishan wetland) were obtained to be 6.5 degrees C (2.1, 12.1) and 0.009 (0.005, 0.013), respectively. The highest LST and NDVI temporal variations were found for Gomishan wetland near the Caspian Sea. According to Landsat images, Gomishan wetland and Gomishan city have the highest and lowest temporal variations in surface biophysical characteristics, respectively. The mean RSEI for the study area (Gomishan city, Gomishan wetland) was 0.43 (0.65, 0.29), respectively. Additionally, the mean Coefficient of Variation (CV) of RSEI for the study area (Gomishan city, Gomishan wetland) was 0.10 (0.88, 0.51), respectively. The surface ecological conditions of Gomishan city were worse than those of the Gomishan wetland at all dates. Temporal variations in the surface ecological conditions of Gomishan wetland were greater than those of the study area and Gomishan city. These results can provide useful and effective information for environmental planning and decision-making to improve ecological conditions, protect the environment, and support sustainable ecosystem development.

AB  - There are many applications for encapsulated algae but the use as an indicator of the trophic state of aquatic environments has not been explored in-depth. In this paper, the effects of different nutrient concentrations in two encapsulated algae, Scenedesmus obtusus, and Parachlorella kessleri, were analyzed both in the laboratory (batch systems) and in field experiments; the latter were carried out in four wetlands in the city of Bogota. Linear models with heterogeneous variance (LMHV) were used to assess differences in the algal growth rates under different nutrient concentrations, and multivariate general linear models (MGLM) were used to relate the influence of abiotic factors under field conditions. The laboratory results showed an increase in growth rates with higher nutrient concentrations, while the field results were less clear, but differences were observed in physical variables between the wetlands and the growth rates over time. The combined analysis revealed variability in the growth rates under field conditions, making it difficult to relate each wetland with a respective nutrient concentration. These results are preliminary, and more research is needed, but they suggest that encapsulated algae growth rates could be used to evaluate the trophic status of aquatic environments.

AB  - Sixteen progeny lines of common beans obtained from single crosses made between two parents, GLP2 and KAT B1, were grown in randomized complete block design in a rainout shelter at the Agricultural and Mechanization Research Institute, Machakos, Kenya. The experiment was conducted to study inheritance of traits associated with drought stress adaptation and to establish if significant variation for those traits was existing in order to carry out selection for drought tolerance. The calculated mean values were used to estimate heritability, genetic advance, and correlation study for each trait. Water stress had a significant (p <= 0.01) effect on the number of pods per plant, grains per plant, 100-seed weight, and yield per plant. The highest values for genotypic coefficient of variation (36.11%) and phenotypic coefficient of variation (36.70%) were recorded for pods plant(-1) under stress condition. Highest broad-sense heritability estimates (96.54%, 94.97%, and 93.16%) coupled with high genetic advance as percent of the mean (22.32%, 34.97%, and 26.32%) were obtained for the number of pods plant(-1), days to maturity, and yield plant(-1), respectively, showing that selection of these traits together could lead to yield improvement under stressed conditions. Harvest index showed a significant and positive relationship with biomass aboveground (r=0.86) and the number of pods plant(-1) (r=0.86) indicating the possibility of identifying high performing lines of common beans for drought stress environment for further studies on these traits.

AB  - San Jorge Bay (23 degrees S) is characterised by a permanent coastal upwelling front and a thermal front that influence water circulation into the bay. This bay constantly receives effluents from different mining activities. Several studies have demonstrated different levels of heavy metals in waters and sediments within the bay. The clam Protothaca thaca is a bivalve with sedentary habits, which is distributed along the Peruvian and Chilean coasts and is exploited commercially. During 2010, clams were collected inside the bay: north (La Chimba), centre (Paraiso) and south (Llacolen), as well as from a site outside the bay (Bolsico). Haematological parameters, condition factor index, lesions, parasites and pathogens and heavy metal concentrations in clam tissues were determined. The health indicators of clams inhabiting the bay varied between sites. Clams inside the bay showed higher prevalence and intensity of parasites and lesions than those clams inhabiting the site outside the bay, which could be indicating the presence of some environmental stressor (e.g. heavy metals). This study is the first to evaluate the health status of organisms from San Jorge Bay, and our results support the hypothesis that clams P. thaca can be used to evaluate environmental quality.

AB  - Successful establishment and functioning of the digital economy is possible only in an adequate digital ecosystem, but the semantic and structural content of this system has not been defined adequately yet. Such uncertainty can be found at different levels (federal, regional and local) and in various aspects: subject-related, branch, segment, technical and others. At the same time, the need to implement effective measures for the development of regional digital ecosystems requires not only an understanding of their qualitative content, but also an accurate quantitative assessment. Our paper analyzes conceptual approaches to the definition of a digital ecosystem, provides our own understanding of its full content, which allows us to build a sufficiently verifiable assessment of digital ecosystems development at the regional level. We present a technique for assessing the development of regional digital ecosystems; according to this technique two integrated indices are calculated, and on this basis we carry out an analysis on 82 constituent entities of Russia over the period of two years. The study reveals the existence of significant differentiation between the regions according to the level of development of digital ecosystems; it also helps identify a number of characteristic types of regions in this context. Our assessment has shown that, along with the majority of the regions where the development of digital ecosystems is defined as average, some regions show opposite trends. There are regions, for example, the Belgorod and Kirov oblasts, in which the conditions for the digital environment are below average, but the level of ecosystem development in them is average or higher. There are regions where the situation is the opposite, i.e. the conditions are quite high, but the level of development of the digital ecosystem as a whole leaves much to be desired. Such a negative example is the Moscow Oblast. We also identify leading regions and problem regions. We hope that a reliable assessment of development of digital ecosystems using our technique will help work out effective solutions for successful promotion of the digital economy in Russia.

AB  - The honeycomb worm Sabellaria alveolata is capable of building extensive bioconstructions, including what are currently considered Europe's largest biogenic reefs. The size and volume of these bioconstructions, however, vary greatly, such that not all habitats engineered by S. alveolata may be easily identified as reefs. Given that European environmental legislation protects marine habitats that are classified as "reefs", it is important to identity a clear set of definition criteria. Furthermore, quantifiable and unequivocal criteria are also needed to evaluate the ecological (health) state of these reefs, in order to best monitor and protect them. Here we propose new terminology to describe the physical appearance of these bioconstructions and attempt to link these physical criteria to the physiological state of the tube-building polychaete. We tested whether a bioconstruction displaying outward signs of growth is built by "healthy" worms devoid of physiological stress by analysing three macromolecules (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids), four polar lipid fatty acids, six neutral lipid fatty acid markers and three metabolic enzymes (citrate synthase, catalase and superoxide dismutase). The worms were sampled in bioconstructions of different "Type" (veneer vs. hummock), "Phase" (progradation vs. retrogradation), and "Shore Level" (high shore vs. low shore) at Champeaux in Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, France. Our results show that worms sampled in retrograding reefs (i.e. displaying signs of erosion and colonisation by epibionts such as oysters or mussels), were less physiologically stressed than worms sampled in prograding bioconstructions, possibly due to lower intraspecific competition and hence greater food availability. We therefore suggest management measures should encompass the whole mosaic of biogenic construction Types and Phases. We propose the inclusion of the polar lipid fatty acid arachidonic acid, in combination with the activity of two metabolic enzymes, citrate synthase and superoxide dismutase, as the three key biochemical markers to consider for quantitative information on the physiological state of this particular ecosystem engineer. Our results also revealed the influence of both sex and size on fatty acid and enzyme levels, highlighting the importance of taking into account both these variables when sampling and subsequently pooling individuals by sex and size category for laboratory analyses. Once seasonal and site variation have been addressed, these biochemical indicators could be examined in parallel with S. alveolata bioconstruction physical criteria as part of a European-wide protocol for monitoring ecological status in this potential reef habitat.

AB  - Different cultivation practices with mulching materials have been applied in the semi-arid areas of China. However, there is still insufficient systematic research on its eff ;ects on ecological indexes and crop water productivity. Therefore, a field trial was carried out in three consecutive study years (2015-2018) to evaluate ecological productivity, crop water productivity, and wheat production under six different treatments: CT: conventional flat tillage without mulching; TSM: conventional flat tillage with gravel mulching; TPM: conventional flat tillage with plastic film mulching; RP: ridges covered with plastic film and furrows without mulching; RSM: ridges covered with plastic film and furrows with gravel mulching; RPM: ridges and furrows covered with plastic film mulching. We found that different cultivation and mulching materials practices considerably improved soil moisture content, crop productivity, ecological eff;ects and evapotranspiration (ET) rates. The RP cropping system with different mulching practices significantly increased soil moisture and ecosystem CO2 and NO2 emissions during the three consecutive study years. The RP cropping system with gravel or plastic film mulching on the furrows improved the dry matter per plant and LAI at the late growth stage, and it improved crop water productivity. Compared to the CT cultivation practice, the annual net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) were significantly increased by 13% and 70%, respectively, with the RPM. In the RPM treatment, the CWPeco and CWPyield were significantly improved by 66% and 84%, respectively, relative to the CT cultivation practice. In addition, RPM treatment improved the spike partitioning index by 16%, maintained a fruiting efficiency that was 12% higher, increased water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) in the stem, increased apparent translocation (amount and ratio), and ultimately achieved an 89% higher grain yield. Taking into account the ecological eff ;ects, wheat production and ET rate, RPM treatment is an eff ;ective approach for saving water and improving CWP and production in semi-humid conditions.

AB  - This study analyses the suitability of remote sensing data from different sources (Landsat 7 ETM+, MODIS and Meteosat) in evaluating the effect of fuel conditions on fire severity, using a megafire (11891ha) that occurred in a Mediterranean pine forest ecosystem (NW Spain) between 19 and 22August 2012. Fire severity was measured via the delta Normalized Burn Ratio index. Fuel conditions were evaluated through biophysical variables of: (i) the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index and mean actual evapotranspiration, as proxies of potential live fuel amount; and (ii) Land Surface Temperature and water deficit, as proxies of fuel moisture content. Relationships between fuel conditions and fire severity were evaluated using Random Forest models. Biophysical variables explained 40% of the variance. The Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index was the most important predictor, being positively associated with fire severity. Evapotranspiration also positively influenced severity, although its importance was conditioned by the data source. Live fuel amount, rather than fuel moisture content, primarily affected fire severity. Nevertheless, an increase in water deficit and land surface temperature was generally associated with greater fire severity. This study highlights that fuel conditions largely determine fire severity, providing useful information for defining pre-fire actions aimed at reducing fire effects.

AB  - Assessing the water quality of the Kebir-Rhumel watershed by the use of benthic macroinvertebrates and physico-chemical analysis is the aim of this work. Thirteen physicochemical parameters and macroinvertebrates fauna were collected monthly in 15 stations located along the catchment area in the two principal wadis: El Kebir and Rhumel. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to study the relationships between physico-chemical parameters and macroinvertebrates. Biotic indices Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP '), Global Biological Normalized Index (IBGN), EPT index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera), and %EPT/Chironomidae, based on benthic macroinvertebrates, have been applied in assessing the biological water quality. According to the results, a majority of the physicochemical parameters measured during the study period show spatial heterogeneity (Kruskal-Wallis,Pvalue < 0.05), indicating that Rhumel wadi is more polluted compared with El Kebir wadi; the NO2-, NO3-, PO4-3, Cl-, and SM contents are very high consequences of human and industrial anthropogenic actions. Canonical correspondence analysis has shown that the environmental parameters measured during this study influence the dynamics of macroinvertebrates, and the polluo-resistant taxa (Chironomidae) predominate in sites very rich in organic matter with low oxygen conditions. Sensitive taxa have a vulnerability to pollution. The biotic indices used confirm the diagnosis of the physicochemical analysis demonstrating a very degraded quality at Rhumel wadi. The EPT index and %EPT/Chironomidae results are closer to the scores of the BMWP ' index.

AB  - Nightjars are considered human-tolerant species due to the population densities reached in strongly managed landscapes. However, no studies have been done evaluating metal-related effects on physiology, condition or fitness in any nightjar species. The main aim of this study was to evaluate how metal exposure affects physiology and condition in red-necked nightjar (Caprimulgus ruficollis) populations inhabiting three different environments in southeastern Spain: agricultural-urban area (n = 15 individuals), mining area (n = 17) and control area (n = 16).
   Increased plasma mineral levels (magnesium and calcium) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were observed in breeding females, and ALP was significantly higher in young birds due to bone growth and development. In the mining-impacted environment, nightjars showed decreased retinol (17.3 and 23.6 mu M in the mining area and control area), uric acid (28.8 and 48.6 mg/dl in the mining area and control area) and albumin (16.2 and 19.6 g/l in the mining area and control area), probably impaired by a combination of toxic metal exposure and low prey quantity/quality in that area. Moreover, they showed increased plasma tocopherol levels (53.4 and 38.6 mu M in the mining area and control area) which may be a response to cope with metal-induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Blood concentrations of toxic metals (As, Pb, Cd and Hg) were negatively associated with calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, ALP, total proteins and body condition index. This could lead to metal-related disorders in mineral metabolism and ALP activity that may potentially increase the risk of skeletal pathologies and consequent risk of fractures in the long term, compromising the survival of individuals. Further studies need to be carried out to evaluate potential metal-related effects on the antioxidant status and bone mineralization of nightjars inhabiting mining environments.

AB  - A 60-day feeding trial was carried out to investigate the effects of dietary oleoresin inclusion on skin colour intensity, carotenoid content, growth performance and digestive enzyme activities of a high value marine ornamental clown fish, A. ocellaris. Experimental diets were formulated with natural oleoresin pigments namely, paprika, turmeric and chlorophyll, with dietary inclusion at the rate of 20 gkg(-1) in the diets. Experimental units were set in triplicates with six numbers of fish in each tank and maintained in filtered sea water of 20 parts per thousand salinity in a recirculatory system. Clown fish with average initial weight of 150.6 +/- 0.10 mg and initial length of 8 mm were fed five different diets viz., control/basal diet (C), diets with inclusion at the rate of 20 gkg(-1) each of paprika (PAP), turmeric (FUR) and chlorophyll (CHL) oleoresins and combination of oleoresins (COM) at the rate of 20 gkg(-1). Skin colour intensity in terms of red and yellow hues and total carotenoid levels differed significantly (P < .05) and highest intensity was recorded in fishes fed the PAP, followed by the COM group. Fish fed with the diet containing COM showed significantly higher final body weight, specific growth rate, weight gain % and feed efficiency as compared to other treatments and was followed by the PAP group. The whole body carotenoid content was highest in COM and PAP groups. There were no significant differences (P > .05) with respect to feed efficiency, digestive enzyme activities, viscero somatic index, visceral length index, condition factor and whole body proximate composition among different treatments. These results suggested that the dietary pigments have a direct influence on the skin pigmentation in A. ocellaris without adverse effects on digestive functions and body condition. Colour imparted in fish skin due to paprika oleoresin was found to be superior.

AB  - Copper fungicides and mycoinsecticides based on entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria spp. are the most common pesticides used in organic crop production systems. The in vitro effects of the copper fungicides copper oxide, copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride, copper sulphate, dicopper chloride trihydroxide and tribasic copper sulphate were investigated for mycelial growth, sporulation and conidial germination of the ATCC 74040 commercial strain of Beauveria bassiana. Mycelial growth was evaluated on potato dextrose agar plates with 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25% and 0% of the recommended application rates of each fungicide at 15 and 25 degrees C. Sporulation and conidial germination were determined at the recommended field doses of each fungicide at 25 degrees C. All copper fungicides had fungistatic or fungicidal effects on B. bassiana that varied according to the dose. Only in two cases, copper oxide at 15 degrees C and copper hydroxide at 25 degrees C, at the lowest concentration of 6.5%, was mycelial growth not statistically significantly inhibited. Inhibition of mycelial growth depended both on the fungicide and its concentration, and partly on temperature. Both sporulation and conidial germination of B. bassiana were significantly inhibited by all fungicides. All fungicides inhibited the sporulation in a similar way (99.8%-100%). With the exception of copper oxychloride (inhibition, 13.6%), the other fungicides showed high detrimental effects on conidial germination (inhibition, 91.7%-100%). The fungus was strongly affected by some fungicides even at the lowest doses. The biological index used for the B. bassiana with copper fungicides ranged from 0.6 (copper sulphate) to 18.1 (copper oxychloride). Therefore, the tested fungicides were classified into the upper half of the highly toxic (T) category and are considered incompatible with the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana strain ATCC 74040 under in vivo experimental conditions. These results need to be further verified in vitro under both greenhouse and open-field conditions.

AB  - The physiological condition of juvenile birds can be influenced by multiple ecological stressors, and few studies have concurrently considered the effects of environmental contaminants in combination with ecological attributes that can influence foraging conditions and prey availability. Using three temporally distinct indices of physiological condition, we compared the physiological response of nestling great egrets (Ardea alba) and white ibises (Eudocimus albus) to changing prey availability, hydrology (water depth, recession rate), and mercury exposure in the Florida Everglades. We found that the physiological response of chicks varied between species and among environmental variables. Chick body condition (short-term index) and fecal corticosterone levels (medium-term) were influenced by wetland water depth, prey availability, region, and age, but not by mercury contamination. However, mercury exposure did influence heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in egret chicks, indicating a longer-term physiological response to contamination. Our results indicate that the physiological condition of egret and ibis chicks were influenced by several environmental stressors, and the time frame of the effect may depend on the specialized foraging behavior of the adults provisioning the chicks.

AB  - The Espiritu Santo Island (ESI) has the highest elasmobranch richness among the Gulf of California islands, exemplifying its importance for conservation. In the present study, we assessed the temporal variation of the batoid assemblages captured in the southern ESI. Using the monthly artisanal fishing fleet catch data between 2013 and 2015, we applied three methods to evaluate changes in diversity: descriptive (i.e., richness, dominance, evenness, and Shannon-Wiener index), taxonomic diversity, and functional diversity. Four orders, ten families, ten genera, and 15 species were identified. Mobula munkiana, Hypanus dipterurus, Narcine entemedor, and Rhinoptera steindachneri were the most numerically abundant (dominant) during the study period. The Biological Values Index of these species indicated temporary changes mainly attributable to sea surface temperature. Diversity and average taxonomic distinctiveness values were high, indicating stability in the batoids assemblage assessed. Further, we identified nine functional groups classified mainly into two life history types, benthic and pelagic. The former group was characterized as having small- to medium-sized species and circular and oval body shape with preferences to remain buried or on sea bottom. The second group was formed by large-body size species and rhomboid body shape with high motility in the water column and with migrations. The ESI community of batoids has a stable taxonomic structure over time, whose functional groups have adapted to the ESI environmental conditions and available resources. This study confirms and highlights the importance of ESI as a critical site for these batoid species within the Gulf of California and thus their conservation.

AB  - Highways provide key social and economic functions but generate a wide range of environmental consequences that are poorly quantified and understood. Here, we developed a before-during-after control-impact remote sensing (BDACI-RS) approach to quantify the spatial and temporal changes of environmental impacts during and after the construction of the Wujing Highway in China using three buffer zones (0-100 m, 100-500 m, and 500-1000 m). Results showed that land cover composition experienced large changes in the 0-100 m and 100-500 m buffers while that in the 500-1000 m buffer was relatively stable. Vegetation and moisture conditions, indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), respectively, demonstrated obvious degradation-recovery trends in the 0-100 m and 100-500 m buffers, while land surface temperature (LST) experienced a progressive increase. The maximal relative changes as annual means of NDVI, NDMI, and LST were about -40%, -60%, and 12%, respectively, in the 0-100m buffer. Although the mean values of NDVI, NDMI, and LST in the 500-1000 m buffer remained relatively stable during the study period, their spatial variabilities increased significantly after highway construction. An integrated environment quality index (EQI) showed that the environmental impact of the highway manifested the most in its close proximity and faded away with distance. Our results showed that the effect distance of the highway was at least 1000 m, demonstrated from the spatial changes of the indicators (both mean and spatial variability). The approach proposed in this study can be readily applied to other regions to quantify the spatial and temporal changes of disturbances of highway systems and subsequent recovery.

AB  - Here we use coupled climate model forecasts of Nino 3.4 and a regional (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana) tornado environment index (TEI) to examine the modulation of US severe thunderstorm activity by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The large number of forecast initializations, leads, and ensemble members reduces sampling variability and increases detail in the analysis. The strongest negative relations between TEI and concurrent Nino 3.4 are found in February and March. Both the average of TEI and its spread are larger during cool ENSO conditions, which raises the question of how predictability differs between warm and cool conditions. Predictability is measured using perfect-model skill scores. For a deterministic skill score, which is equivalent to signal-to-noise ratio, larger spread during cool conditions means less predictability. On the other hand, perfect-model probabilistic skill scores are slightly higher (higher predictability) during February and March for cool conditions than for warm conditions due to larger probability shifts.
   Plain Language Summary In our work, we address the question of whether sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific, in particular the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, can influence the frequency of tornadoes in the United States. If ENSO does change the frequency of US tornadoes, the size of the change is relatively small and hard to detect in the tornado reports and ocean measurements that we have from the last 30 or 40 years. Therefore we looked at over 8,000 years of synthetic data from a computer model that simulates the Earth's oceans (including ENSO) and atmosphere (including weather but not tornadoes). Since there are no tornadoes in the computer model, we looked instead at weather conditions that tend to go along with tornadoes in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. We found that the relation between ENSO and tornado weather conditions in the computer model is strongest in February and March. The relation in the computer model suggests that more tornadoes than normal are expected during La Nina conditions but that the exact number is highly uncertain.

AB  - That observed behaviours conflate information processing with resulting responses presents a challenge for understanding how social information contributes to adaptive behaviour in animals. Here, we develop a mathematical model that isolates how individuals assess their environment and use it to examine how social information impacts those assessments. We consider the influences of personal and social sampling efforts, how individuals combine these sources of information, group size, social sampling practices and types of environmental variation. Our analyses lead to predictive formulas that show that social information often improves but sometimes impairs environmental assessments and that the magnitude of improvement or diminishment increases with the extent of environmental variation. We also show that the weight an individual gives to social information affects both whether it improves or degrades its assessment as well as the size of that effect. Simulation results show that group size does not affect the influence of social information on average but does affect the variability of those influences.

AB  - Land-use change from native forests to agriculture, livestock and exotic forest plantations is a main factor affecting riparian vegetation and aquatic communities. The aim of this study was to assess responses of aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages to riparian cover change in Murocomba protective forest, Valencia, Ecuador. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected and physicochemical variables were measured during dry (June-October 2014) and rainy (December-April 2015) seasons along three creeks with different riparian cover: native forests Q1-CBN, pasture for agricultural and livestock activities Q2-CAG, and exotic forest plantations Q3-CPF. According to the Macroinvertebrate Family Biotic Index (FBI) and the Biological Monitoring Working Party Index (BMWP/Col) the best conditions existed in the creek Q1-CBN, while the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera Index (EPT) decreased in the creek Q2-CAG during the rainy season. The Shannon-Weaver index showed higher values in Q1-CBN and Q3-CPF in the dry period, and the dominance increased in the Q3-CPF in rainy season. A total of 6 583 macroinvertebrates were collected. Trichoptera was the most abundant order and Hidropsychidae the most abundant family. The Coleoptera order showed greater abundance in Q1-CBN and Diptera in Q2-CAG, while Hemiptera showed the lowest abundance in Q3-CPF. Psephenidae, Chironomidae, Leptophlebiidae, Veliidae, Simuliidae, Baetidae and Leptohyphidae were associated with the highest values of total dissolved solids and pH, as well as higher values of IBF and lower values of EPT, BMWP, and depth of the channel in Q2-CAG, whereas Leptoceridae, Elmidae, Ptilodactylidae and Philopotamidae were associated with higher values of EPT, BMWP and depth of the channel in Q1-CBN and Q3-CPF. A negative influence of anthropic activities on the physicochemical variables and structure of the macroinvertebrate assemblages was evidenced. This indicates that the riparian vegetation is a factor that determines the establishment and structure of aquatic communities.

AB  - Water quality, diatom species composition and biomass estimates were performed in the Gharasou River in western Iran. Five sites along the River Gharasou were sampled every month from April to September 2005. Physical and chemical factors (pH, NO3-N, PO4-P, dissolved oxygen, total suspend solids, total dissolved solids, conductivity, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand) were measured along with biological properties of the periphyton including biomass, ash-free dry mass, chlorophyll-a concentration and the taxonomic composition diatom assemblages. Information from the diatom assemblage was used to calculate the Trophic Diatom Index and biovolume. The TDI was significantly correlated with measures of human disturbance at the sites (e.g. PO4-P, NO3-N and dissolved oxygen) as well as to biomass measures (chlorophyll a, ash-free dry mass and biovolume). The sensitivity of the TDI and its component metrics to environmental stressors supports the use of this index for monitoring ecological conditions in streams in Iran and to aid diagnosis of the cause of their impairment.

AB  - In this work Ta1 - xOx coatings were deposited by DC magnetron sputtering in an Ar + O-2 atmosphere. The influence of the oxygen partial pressure on the morphology (SEM), structure (XRD), chemical bonding (XPS), thermal oxidation and optical response (FTIR and spectroscopic ellipsometry) of Ta-based films was study.
   Cross-section morphology revealed that the increase of oxygen content in the coatings change the columnar morphology to featureless. Likewise, structural results showed that the small increase of oxygen amount leads to a change from Ta stable phase (alpha-Ta: bcc) to a mixture of phases achieving oxide phases with large amounts of oxygen. Whereas at room temperature the oxide coatings mainly revealed an amorphous character, at 700 degrees C the coating reached the crystallization Ta2O5 orthorhombic phase, which is promoted by the temperature. Further, although not observed in XRD, for the coatings deposited close to the reactive mode threshold IR showed absorption bands corresponding to amorphous phase containing some crystals embedded on it, while for the coatings deposited in the poisoned regime the IR suggests a marked amorphous nature. Refractive index varied between 2.09 and 2.27 at 0.65 mu m,within the range reported for Ta2O5 thin films. The changes in refractive index are correlated with the different crystallinity of the coatings, which is corroborated with the IR results.

AB  - We investigated the change in physical condition of males during paternal care in a natural population of a stream goby Rhinogobius sp. LD. Hepatosomatic index (HSI) and Condition factor (K) of males guarding an egg mass were higher than those of non-breeding males. In the first brooding cycle, the HSI of males decreased with the progress of embryo development. Moreover, in the second brooding cycle, both the HSI and K decreased, suggesting that the energy reserves in the somatic tissue were used when the liver reserves were exhausted as a source of energy for paternal activities. After paternal care, males showed reduced K and were unable to recover HSI immediately. Comparisons of the physical condition between non-guarding males after the first brooding cycle and males guarding an early stage clutch in the second brooding cycle indicated that males which could recover HSI and K were able to have a second brooding cycle. This suggested that the physical condition determines participation in breeding activity and the number of brooding cycles, greatly influencing male reproductive success.

AB  - Environmental or land quality indicators are being developed internationally as a means whereby the 'State of the Environment' (SoE) can be assessed and trends monitored. In Australia, the use of indicators in SoE reporting is in its early stages of development. Indicators have been developed, in relation to agriculture, for flora and fauna, soil, chemical contamination, surface waters and groundwater. Internationally, the World Bank has listed 'indicators of pressure' on the land, 'indicators of state and impact: and 'indicators of response' for each of seven major issues of land degradation. Late in 1996, an 'indicators of catchment health' workshop in Australia identified a relatively small number of key indicators relating to farm productivity, soil health, water quality and 'landscape integrity: later adding social indicators, and also distinguishing between indicators at farm and catchment scales. A broad range of other indicators was also considered by various participants in the workshop, which concluded by supporting a nationally co-ordinated effort and the establishment of a national steering committee. Although most indicators are static measures, those from which predictions can be made require a greater emphasis on the functioning of the system. This implies that indicators are only one aspect of system modelling, and that environmental or land assessment needs to progress further than the search for quality indicators. Since this involves both biophysical and human processes, geographers should be playing a central role.

AB  - The extreme variability in the topography, altitude and climatic conditions in the temperate Grassland Mountains of Southern Africa is associated with the complex mosaic of grassland communities with pockets of woodland patches. Understanding the relationships between plant communities and environmental parameters is essential in biodiversity conservation, especially for current and future climate change predictions. This article focused on the spatial distribution of woodland communities and their associated environmental drivers in the Golden Gate Highlands (GGHNP) National Park in South Africa. A generalized linear model (GLM) assuming a binomial distribution, was used to determine the optimal environmental variables influencing the spatial distribution of the woodland communities. The Coefficient of Variation (CV) was relatively higher for the topographic ruggedness index (68.78%), topographic roughness index (68.03), aspect (60.04%), coarse fragments (37.46%) and the topographic wetness index (31.33) whereas soil pH, bulk density, sandy and clay contents had relatively less variation (2.39%, 3.23%, 7.56% and 8.46% respectively). In determining the optimal number of environmental variables influencing the spatial distribution of woodland communities, roughness index, topographic wetness index, soil coarse fragments, soil organic carbon, soil cation exchange capacity and remote-sensing based vegetation condition index were significant (p < 0.05) and positively correlated with the woodland communities. Soil nitrogen, clay content, soil pH, fire and elevation were also significant but negatively correlated with the woodland communities. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was 0.81. This was indicative of a Parsimonious Model with explanatory predictive power for determination of optimal environmental variables in vegetation ecology.
   Conservation implications: The isolated woodland communities are sources of floristic diversity and important biogeographical links between larger forest areas in the wider Drakensberg region. They provide suitable habitats for a larger number of forest species and harbour some of the endemic tree species of South Africa. They also provide watershed protection and other important ecosystem services. Understanding the drivers influencing the spatial distribution and persistence of these woodland communities is therefore key to conservation planning in the area.

AB  - Crassostrea virginica is an epibentic filter-feeding bivalve of economical importance in coastal lagoons of the Gulf of Mexico, locations with increasing inputs of heavy metals such as cadmium that have become environmental stressors. In this study, feeding and assimilation of the species were evaluated as physiological indicators of cadmium exposure. For this purpose, the filtration rate (FR), food assimilation (A) and assimilation efficiency (AE) of oysters from the Mandinga Lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico, were examined under sublethal and environmentally realistic cadmium concentrations (95 and 170 mu gCd L-1). Semi-static, 12-day bioassays were conducted with organisms placed into individual chambers and fed daily with Tetraselmis suecica. FRwas calculated by measuring the depletion in algal density. Caloric contents of food and feces produced were also obtained. Condition Index (CI) and morphometric parameters were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the assay. Total cadmium concentrations were quantified in water and tissue, and the metal bioconcentration factor (BCF) was calculated. Cadmium exposure significantly reduced FR in oysters (mean value: 0.64 L h(-1) and 0.44 L h(-1)) from control values (1.17 L h(-1)). Extreme values among results demonstrate the existence of a high FR (over 4 L h(-1)) mainly in control oysters, and this was associated with a better physiological condition; a low FR (under 2.5 L h(-1)) indicated metabolic stress as a consequence of Cd exposure. A and AE were significantly modified due to cadmium external levels, and time of exposure. FR and A were linearly related, and both decreased as metal BCF increased. Cadmium bioaccumulation was linearly related with external metal levels. The physiological deterioration of native C. virginica from Mandinga Lagoon was reflected in the alteration of FR, A and AE due to cadmium exposure in concentrations considered sublethal, lowering the feeding and assimilation capability of the organisms. The weight loss and mortality recorded in the oysters exposed to the highest metal concentration, was the final consequence of the overall adverse effect of cadmium exposure.

AB  - Ocean acidification may interfere with the calcifying physiology of marine bivalves. Therefore, understanding their capacity for acclimation and adaption to low pH over multiple generations is crucial to make predictions about the fate of this economically and ecologically important fauna in an acidifying ocean. Transgenerational exposure to an acidification scenario projected by the end of the century (i.e., pH 7.7) has been shown to confer resilience to juvenile offspring of the Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum. However, whether, and to what extent, this resilience can persist into adulthood are unknown and the mechanisms driving transgenerational acclimation remain poorly understood. The present study takes observations of Manila clam juveniles further into the adult stage and observes similar transgenerational responses. Under acidified conditions, clams originating from parents reproductively exposed to the same level of low pH show a significantly faster shell growth rate, a higher condition index and a lower standard metabolic rate than those without prior history of transgenerational acclimation. Further analyses of stable carbon isotopic signatures in dissolved inorganic carbon of seawater, individual soft tissues and shells reveal that up to 61% of shell carbonate comes from metabolic carbon, suggesting that transgenerationally acclimated clams may preferentially extract internal metabolic carbon rather than transport external seawater inorganic carbon to build shells, the latter known to be energetically expensive. While a large metabolic carbon contribution (45%) is seen in non-acclimated clams, a significant reduction in the rate of shell growth indicates it might occur at the expense of other calcification-relevant processes. It therefore seems plausible that, following transgenerational acclimation, R. philippinarum can implement a less costly and more efficient energy-utilizing strategy to mitigate the impact of seawater acidification. Collectively, our findings indicate that marine bivalves are more resilient to ocean acidification projected for the end of the century than previously thought. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Numerical modelling is becoming a major tool for supporting environmental studies at different scales, thanks to the ability of up-to-date codes to reproduce the complex mechanisms of the natural environment in quite a reliable manner. In evaluating the habitat diversity of anthropized rivers, however, many issues are rising because of the intrinsic complexity of the physical processes involved and the limitations associated with numerical models. Using a reach of the Po River in Italy as a case study, the present works aims to provide a qualitative description of the changes of the Eco-Environmental Diversity index as a response to different constant flow discharges typically observed along this reach. The goals are achieved by means of two solvers of the freeware iRIC suite, applied in cascade to first simulate the 2D fluvial hydrodynamics and subsequently provide a qualitative estimate of the habitat conditions. Despite the several simplifications intrinsically present in the modelling cascade and the ones introduced for practical purposes, the results show that an extremely strong and long-lasting reduction of the flow discharge, like the one very recently observed, can ultimately threaten the overall biological status of the river. Because of the modelling uncertainties, these preliminary outcomes are only qualitative and show the need for more research, both in terms of data acquisition and numerical schematization, to adequately and quantitatively evaluate the effects of transient hydrology on the river ecosystems. Moreover, additional field surveys are necessary to calibrate and validate the used biological parameters, aiming to obtain sufficiently reliable estimates.

AB  - The thermal post-buckling responses of Functionally Graded Material shell structures are reported in this paper. Geometrically nonlinear analysis based on a modified First order Shear Deformation Theory are proposed. The modified theory takes into account the shear strains with a parabolic shape function and it verifies a zero shear stresses condition at the top and bottom surfaces. For the numerical computation, four nodes shell elements are implemented. The large displacement is described by Green-Lagrange nonlinear strains. Moreover, it is assumed that the shell structures are exposed to uniform, linear and nonlinear temperature distributions through the thickness direction. The thermal and the mechanical properties are described according to a power law distribution and either temperature-independent or temperature-dependent material properties are considered. Two numerical examples of functionally graded plates and cylindrical shells are presented to highlight the effectiveness and the accuracy of the present finite element procedure. The effect the geometrical parameters, the volume fraction index and boundary conditions on nonlinear responses are performed.

AB  - The phasor approach to fluorescence lifetime imaging has become a common method to analyze complicated fluorescence signals from biological samples. The appeal of the phasor representation of complex fluorescence decays in biological systems is that a visual representation of the decay of entire cells or tissues can be used to easily interpret fundamental biological states related to metabolism and oxidative stress. Phenotyping based on autofluorescence provides new avenues for disease characterization and diagnostics. The phasor approach is a transformation of complex fluorescence decays that does not use fits to model decays and therefore has the same information content as the original data. The phasor plot is unique for a given system, is highly reproducible, and provides a robust method to evaluate the existence of molecular interactions such as Forster resonance energy transfer or the response of ion indicators. Recent advances permit quantification of multiple components from phasor plots in fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, which is not presently possible using data fitting methods, especially in biological systems.

AB  - This study explores the usefulness of a frame-based modelling approach in the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem, with four frames describing observed small pelagic fish dominance patterns. We modelled the dynamics of sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus populations under the influence of the small pelagic fishery and climate variability, performed extensive sensitivity analyses and exercised the model prototype in scenarios based on realistic management objectives. Model outputs were seen to roughly parallel observed dynamics. Frame dynamics were reasonably sensitive to frame switching rules. Reduced sardine recruitment in the 'low' frames had a strong negative impact on stock recovery, and bycatch of juvenile sardine from the modelled anchovy fishery could also greatly impair sardine recovery. Specific tests included exploring the robustness of fisheries management strategies under highly stochastic recruitment and uncertainty around long-term environmental forcing. The respective frame of the model is suggested as a composite indicator of ecosystem state. The model approach shows promise for evaluating small pelagic fisheries management strategies in an ecosystem context incorporating long-term environmental variability.

AB  - BackgroundStructures and functions of ecosystems and, subsequently, their services for human societies may be influenced by climate change and atmospheric deposition. Jenssen et al. (UBA Texte 87/2013: 1-381, 2013) developed a spatially explicit evaluation system enabling the evaluation of ecosystems' integrity. This methodology is based on a spatially explicit ecosystem classification of forests. Based on the six ecological functions, the methodology enables to compare the ecosystem type-specific integrity at different levels of ecological hierarchy for a reference state (1961-1990) with the further development of the forest ecosystem types as measured for the years 1991-2010 and as modelled for the period 2011-2070. The present study aimed at deepening the methodology and developing it into a practical system for assessing and mapping forest ecosystem integrity and services. The objectives of this advanced investigation were: (1) to quantify the reference conditions for a total of 61 forest ecosystem types; (2) to test the possibility of supplementing the quantification of ecosystem integrity by information on soil biocenoses as yielded by soil monitoring; (3) to model chemical soil indicators and to compare the respective results with those derived by Ellenberg's indicator values for nutrient state; and (4) to verify the indicator modelling.ResultsReference states related to the time prior to 1991 have been quantified for a total of 61 forest ecosystem types covering 85% (81,577 km(2)) of the mapped forest area of Germany. The reference states comprise statistical indicators for the plant-species diversity (habitat function), for nutrient and water balances and further ecological information as net-primary production and carbon storage. The assignment of lumbricide communities as soil biocenosis indicators was attempted but not succeeded because of insufficient data availability. The nutrient cycle types of the elaborated reference states were characterized by humus form, C/N ratio in topsoil and N indicator values according to Ellenberg et al. (Scr Geobot 18:1-262, 2001). Applying the developed methodology, for 83 out of 105 study plots the reference states prior to 1991 could be determined.ConclusionsFor complementing forest ecosystem reference states by soil biocenosis indicators it is necessary to further evaluate the primary literature looking for missing observation data. The W.I.E. indicator value applied in this paper to determine topsoil C/N ratios in forests is well suited for area-covering mapping of both near-natural forest-soil states and deposition-induced disharmonic state changes, in which C/N value and base saturation are no longer correlated.

AB  - Evaluation of genotype x environment interaction (GEI) is an important component of the variety selection process in multi-environment trials. The objectives of this study were first to analyze GEI on seed yield of 18 spine safflower genotypes grown for three consecutive seasons (2008-2011) at three locations, representative of rainfed winter safflower growing areas of Iran, by the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model, and second to compare AMMI-derived stability statistics with several stability different methods, and two stability analysis approaches the yield-stability (Ysi) and the GGE (genotype + genotype x environment) biplot that are widely used to identify high-yielding and stable genotypes. The results of the AMMI analysis showed that main effects due to genotype, environment, and GEI as well as first six interaction principle component axes (IPCA1 to 6) were significant (P < 0.01). According to most stability statistics of AMMI analyses, genotypes G5 and G14 were the most stable genotypes across environments. According to the adjusted stability variance (s(2)), the high-yielding genotype, G2, was unstable due to the heterogeneity caused by environmental index. Based on the definition of stable genotypes by regression method (b = 1, S (d) (2) = 0), genotypes G11, G9, G14, G3, G12 and G13 had average stability for seed yield. Stability parameters of Tai indicated that genotype G5 had specific adaptability to unfavorable environments. The GGE biplot and the Ysi statistic gave similar results in identifying genotype G2 (PI-209295) as the best one to release for rainfed conditions of Iran. The factor analysis was used for grouping all stability parameters. The first factor separated static and dynamic concepts of stability, in which the Ysi and GGED (i.e., the distance from the markers of individual genotypes to the ideal genotype) parameters had a dynamic concept of stability, and the other remaining parameters had static concept of stability.

AB  - The Yellow River Delta is the most intact estuary wetland in China and suffers from great pressure of metals. Seventy-seven surface sediment samples were collected in the delta, and contents of Cu, Pb, Cd, Cr, Zn, Ni, and Mn were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry and those of Hg and As by atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The results showed that means of metal contents (ppm, dry weight) were as follows: Hg, 0.04; Cr, 61.72; Cu, 20.97; Zn, 60.73; As, 9.47; Pb, 21.91; Cd, 0.12; Ni, 27.24; and Mn, 540.48. 43.8% of Hg and 14.3% of Cd were from the allogenic source while others from the authigenic source. The results of the geoaccumulation indexes appeared that 6.5% of sites from the estuarine and the Gudao areas were moderately polluted by Hg. All ecological risk index values of Hg and 37.7% of Cd were more than 40, which were the main factors of strongly and moderately potential ecological risks of 37.7% of sites in the delta. High Cd contents may be due to the alkaline conditions of the delta and the unreasonable management of the farmland, while the abnormal distribution of Hg to the wet or dry deposition and the erosion of the seawater. It was suggested to monitor Hg content in the atmosphere of the Yellow River Delta. The results were expected to update the pollution status of metals in the delta and created awareness of preserving the sound condition of the Yellow River Delta.

AB  - This paper defines transit access incorporating the system attributes, viz, availability of access modes, their availability distance from residence, the difference in detour and airline distance to transit station and the condition of fixed facilities and flow entities, the shift potential under the effect of policies and the economic implications of pollution loading. The analysis is based on revealed and stated preference data. A maximum information procedure is developed to identify the shift potential due to the provision of better access conditions. A model is developed using joint estimation approach for the prediction of mode shares under policy effects. The environmental transit accessibility index, defined in this study, considers the effect of socioeconomic characteristics of the commuter, the economic and environmental implications and the behaviour of commuter under the hypothetical scenarios. The index is defined both for base year and for scenario year. A scale for evaluating environment transit accessibility is proposed. The approach is found defining transit accessibility satisfactorily for the study area. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impact of early rearing environment on phenotypic development in teleosts has been reasonably well-documented, but only recently has attention been paid to sturgeon raised for conservation purposes. In the present study, we hypothesized that rearing environment will result in the development of distinct metabolic phenotypes in age-0 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and that these phenotypes will drive differential survival rates during a simulated overwintering event. Lake sturgeon gametes were fertilized and raised in one of three different environments: 16 degrees C+ 100% dissolved oxygen (DO), 14 degrees C+ 100% DO, and 16 degrees C + 80% DO, each with or without substrate. We measured standard metabolic rate, forced maximum metabolic rate, metabolic scope, energy density, hepatosomatic index, Fulton's condition factor, and enzyme activities associated with ATP production. Our results suggest that subtle changes in abiotic environments during early life history result in the development of distinct metabolic phenotypes during the first year of life. These have important implications for survival of age-0 lake sturgeon when stocked in the fall of their first year.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effects of spatially and temporally varying abiotic conditions on the nekton residing in tidally influenced streams and determine the comparability of the assemblage response across the various gears needed to fully characterize the biota. Three tidal streams were sampled seasonally for 2 years for chemical (physiochemical profiles), physical (in-stream and riparian habitat classification), and biological (nekton sampled with bag seines, trawls, and gill nets) components of ecosystem integrity. Multiple sampling stations on each stream encompassed the transitional character of the tidally influenced ecosystem, from the freshwater of the river to the saltwater of the bay. Instead of characterizing the biota with traditional fish-based indexes of biotic integrity, analysis methodologies relying heavily on multivariate ordination techniques were used. This study showed that the temporal and spatial relationships among nekton assemblages and abiotic environmental conditions were quite gear dependent. The greatest degree of difference in indicators of ecosystem health all involved upstream-downstream gradients that appear to be driven by salinity structure. Based on the results of this study, dissolved oxygen concentration does not appear to be a major structuring factor in the physical, chemical, or biological component of ecosystem integrity.

AB  - We used fish community data from trawl samples collected from >100 estuaries, bayous, and coastal lagoons of the Louisianan Biogeographic Province (Gulf of Mexico) to develop indicators of large-scale ecological condition. One data set, from which we derived reference values for fish community indicators, was based on bottom trawl samples collected from 367 randomly located sites during the summers of 1992-1994. A second trawl data set with similar geographic scope from 2000 to 2004 was used to test the robustness of the indicators derived from the reference data set to new data. We constructed a fish community index (FCI) from three basic indicators: number of species per trawl, total abundance per trawl, and an index of trophic balance among three common feeding guilds. The FCl was not correlated with salinity over a range from freshwater to marine and hypersaline conditions (052 psu). Direct correlations between the index and environmental variables generally were weak, although some were significant (p < 0.05). The FCl was negatively correlated with water clarity (secchi depth), water column depth, and sediment toxicity; correlations of the FCl with pH, sediment organic carbon, and sediment silt + clay content were positive. There was a hyperbolic relationship between dissolved oxygen and maximum values of the index, and no significant correlation with watershed land cover at the whole-estuary or estuary-complex scale. Values of all indicators increased between the two time periods. The FCl is a broad indicator of ecological condition for estuaries within the Louisianan Province, with data aggregated at scales ranging from large estuaries to the entire region. Sample density was insufficient to judge performance of the indicators or index at smaller scales. Published by Elsievier Ltd.

AB  - Upper-middle reaches of Luanhe River Basin belongs to Haihe River Basin and it is a pretty important water source to North China, especially to Tianjin and Tangshan Cities, Hebei. Based on control units of the water function areas and the sub-basins the working units were produced. The index system for environmental risk source hazard was constructed by adopting the pressure state response (PSR) environmental analysis model. The environment risk sources are identified, and their hazard grade assessment is performed. In the environmental risk source hazard an assessment index system, namely downstream characteristics of environmental risk sources is added by taking the fact into account that environmental risk sources themselves are affected by different functional areas (working units) downstream of the rivers. Through collecting hazard data, determining their standards and weights for environment risk sources, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is used to calculate the risk source hazard grades and the vulnerability grades of the working units. Using the one-dimensional exponential decay river model for pollutants in rivers, the hazard grade evaluation method of working units is established. This consists of two parts: (1) The risk source hazard grade of the working unit itself, and (2) the impact of the risk sources upstream on the working unit downstream of the rivers. Combining the hazard grade with the vulnerability grade of the working unit, the risk grade of the working unit is evaluated through the risk matrix. The risk zones of the watershed are realized by merging working units in the same control units of the water function areas with the same risk grades. The risk zoning of sudden water pollution incidents in the upper and middle reaches of Luanhe River Basin is obtained by applying the above risk zoning method. It is found that there are 55 risk zones in total, including three highest risk zones, 15 higher risk zones, 14 lower risk zones, 23 lowest risk zones. These results indicate that the upper and middle reaches of River Luanhe are overall at low risk. The corresponding management methods for the different risk zones are suggested.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to provide ecological and chemical characterization of lakes located in the Muraviovka Park, where more than 300 species of birds nest, rest and winter. High concentration of dissolved oxygen in the water of lakes that comes with as high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) indicates that reservoirs experience eutrophication. Concentration of biogenic organic substances is caused to fluctuate by seasonal changes in water temperature. The fires make the hydro-chemical indicators of wetlands change. Lead concentration in the water is high because it enters the water, moving from the surface layers of soil when natural areas transform into cultivated lands. Macrophytes contain an excess concentration of lead and manganese. Heavy metal concentration in fish is below permissible limits. Despite significant differences in the biology of bird species, birds living in the Muraviovka Park have great amounts of iron, copper and zinc in their feathers. Feather lead concentration was also high. The ecological state of lakes located in the Muraviovka Park is necessary to investigate in order to undertake actions to regulate economic activities.

AB  - Water resources are indispensable resources that human society depends on for survival and development, and it is of great significance to maintain the sustainability and promote the sustainable development of water resources. In this study, the emergy ecological footprint model was adopted to evaluate the sustainability of water resources in Guiyang city from 2009 to 2018. Results showed that water resources in Guiyang during the study period were in an ecological surplus, were relatively secure, and had weakly sustainable status. The emergy ecological carrying capacity of water resources had fluctuated greatly with the annual average rainfall. Both the emergy ecological footprint of water resources and the emergy ecological footprint of water resources per 10,000 yuan GDP had declined. Both the ecological tension index and the sustainable utilization index of water resources had shown a rising trend since 2012, indicating that the socio-economic pressure on water resources has been increasing. And the sustainability of water resources in Guiyang may not be maintained in the future. The sustainability of water resources in Guiyang was affected by an ecological environmental mechanism based on its physical geography conditions and special hydrogeological structures, and a society mechanism based on its feature of growth of population, land utilization, and urbanization. Therefore, suggestions like transforming the traditional economy development model, optimizing the current allocation of water resources, and protecting the ecological environment are conducive to promoting the sustainable development of water resources in Guiyang.

AB  - Available international experience involving expert assessments of the sensitivity and resistance of European soils to the impact of acid conditions could be used to compile specialized forecast maps for soil geochemistry. Mathematical models based on balance equations for sulfur, nitrogen, and strong acids in the soil have deficiencies stemming from both the unsatisfactory reliability of a number of parameters and the absence of others. As an integral indicator for monitoring the stable geochemical state of the soil and landscape-geochemical systems as a whole, it is proposed that we use the mass ratio of elements (sulfur, nitrogen, etc.) in atmospheric precipitation, hydrochemical runoff, and the biogeochemical cycle, expressed in the form of special coefficients of the quasi-steady-state and destabilized state of natural systems.

AB  - The distribution and body condition of juvenile northern rock sole (NRS), Lepidopsetta polyxystra, and yellowfin sole (YFS), Limanda aspera, were studied in relation to prey availability across the coastal shelf at the Alaska Peninsula boundary of the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) to assess spatial variability in habitat quality. Juveniles of <= 20 cm and adults of >= 30 cm total length were collected from bottom trawl catch samples at stations located 10 to 120 km from the Alaska Peninsula coast, and in bottom depths of 28 to 85 m. Stomach contents and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from muscle tissue were analyzed to describe diet composition. The quantity and quality of prey did not significantly affect the distribution of juvenile NRS and YFS. Spatial mismatch between the diet composition and the infauna prey assemblage suggested that prey availability was not limiting across the area, allowing fish to select for prey, presumably to maximize net energy gain. The body condition of juvenile NRS was higher in the eastern section of the area (Bristol Bay) - where they shared spatial and dietary niches with juvenile YFS, than in the west section (Unimak Island) where juvenile YFS were largely absent A difference in body condition suggests that habitat quality may be higher in Bristol Bay. For NRS, stomach contents and stable isotopes in muscle tissue indicated an ontogenetic diet shift from amphipods to polychaetes from juvenile to adult stages. In contrast, for YFS, amphipods seemed to remain the primary prey and polychaetes the least important prey from juvenile to adult stage. Given that the high prey availability found in this south coastal area of EBS extends to areas across the EBS shelf, favorable habitat for juvenile flatfishes should be extensive. However, much of this potential juvenile habitat is underutilized by NRS, which were mainly limited to Bristol Bay and the Alaska Peninsula, whereas YFS did extend north over 500 km from Bristol Bay along the inner shelf domain (<= 50 m deep). Abiotic factors, particularly ocean currents and water temperature, may be more significant than prey availability in the spatial distribution of juveniles. Thus, changes in the hydrographic and thermal regime of the EBS are likely to impact juvenile flatfish distribution and habitat productivity. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil washing is one of the permanent techniques to remove heavy metals, and washing agent is a key influence factor for this technique, but there is still lack of high-efficiency, eco-friendly, and inexpensive agents. In this study, four wastes including pineapple peel (PP), soybean straw (SS), broad bean straw (BBS) and tea residue (TR) were employed to remove cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) in contaminated soils. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated that hydroxyl, carboxyl, amine, carbonyl and amide groups were involved in the interaction with metal ions by complexation or ion exchange. We then investigated the influences of various conditions including washing solution concentration, pH, and washing time. The metal removal efficiencies with these agents increased as the concentration augmented from 5 to 80 g L-1, decreased or presented an asymmetric V-shaped curve with increasing pH from 2.5 to 7.5, and fit intraparticle diffusion or Elovich model with washing time increasing. PP has the highest removals for Cd (90.1%), Pb (18.6%), and Zn (15.2%) in soil A, and 85.8, 24.8, and 69.4% in soil B, respectively. The relatively high metal removal was mainly attributed to effective removal of the exchangeable and acid soluble fractions. Moreover, single washing not only lowered the potential ecological risk of the heavy metals, but moderated the effects on soil chemical properties. Therefore, PP was a feasible washing agent to remediate soils contaminated by heavy metals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) constitute an ecologically important component of the ecosystem and support both recreational and commercial fisheries. Over the past 40 years, Saginaw Bay has experienced multiple ecosystem-level changes (e.g., non-indigenous species introductions, reduced nutrient loading and variable temperatures). In turn, abundances and growth rates of yellow perch and their predators and prey have fluctuated. Recent changes to Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron foodwebs have potential to influence prey composition and subsequently, growth and condition for yellow perch; but a complete description of yellow perch diet composition across seasons has not been undertaken in recent years. We calculated mean relative weight (We), an index of condition, of age-1 and older yellow perch in Saginaw Bay annually for 1970-2011. We found high interannual variation in condition and documented low mean We during 1978-1991. We developed regression models to explain this variation using phosphorus load, temperature, forage fish density, and yellow perch density as potential explanatory factors. Patterns of We were associated with changes in yellow perch densities, although interannual variation was not significantly associated with any of the available explanatory variables. Diet analysis of yellow perch collected in 2009 and 2010 demonstrated that age-1 and older yellow perch consumed a fundamentally different diet from a previous study (1986-1988), exhibiting a greater reliance on non-indigenous prey (e.g. Bythotrephes longimanus).

AB  - There has recently been a great deal of interest in the development of algorithms that objectively measure the integrity of video signals. Since video signals are being delivered to human end users in an increasingly wide array of applications and products, it is important that automatic methods of video quality assessment (VQA) be available that can assist in controlling the quality of video being delivered to this critical audience. Naturally, the quality of motion representation in videos plays an important role in the perception of video quality, yet existing VQA algorithms make little direct use of motion information, thus limiting their effectiveness. We seek to ameliorate this by developing a general, spatio-spectrally localized multiscale framework for evaluating dynamic video fidelity that integrates both spatial and temporal (and spatio-temporal) aspects of distortion assessment. Video quality is evaluated not only in space and time, but also in space-time, by evaluating motion quality along computed motion trajectories. Using this framework, we develop a full reference VQA algorithm for which we coin the term the MOtion-based Video Integrity Evaluation index, or MOVIE index. It is found that the MOVIE index delivers VQA scores that correlate quite closely with human subjective judgment, using the Video Quality Expert Group (VQEG) FRTV Phase 1 database as a test bed. Indeed, the MOVIE index is found to be quite competitive with, and even outperform, algorithms developed and submitted to the VQEG FRTV Phase 1 study, as well as more recent VQA algorithms tested on this database.

AB  - Soil macroarthropods are organisms considered as key factors to sustain soil quality and sustainability due to their services to soil ecosystem. The community structure and seasonal variation of soil macroarthropods in 5-year cultivation of green manure plant species in the Brazilian semi-arid, Areia, Paraiba, Brazil were investigated between June and December 2018. Soil samples and macroarthropod specimens were collected using soil cores and Provid-type traps, respectively, during rainy and dry seasons. We characterized both soil chemical properties and macroarthropod community under ten green manure plant species:Brachiaria decumbensStapf. cv. Basilisk, Canavalia ensiformis(L.) DC,Crotalaria junceaL.,Crotalaria ochroleucaG. Don,Crotalaria spectabilisRoth,Lablab purpureus(L.) Sweet,Mucuna pruriens(L.) DC.,Neonotonia wightii(Wight & Arn.) J.A. Lackey,Pennisetum glaucumL., andStilozobium aterrimumPiper & Tracy. The highest values of richness, diversity and dominance in the macroarthropod community during the rainy season were found on the plots whereC. spectabilisandM. prurienswere cultivated, whereas during the dry season the highest values were found in the plots whereC. ochroleuca,C. spectabilis, andS. aterrimumwere cultivated. In the plots whereB. decumbensandP. glaucumwhere cultivated, we found lower values of richness, diversity, and dominance in the macroarthropod community compared to the leguminous plant species during rainy and dry seasons. Our findings suggest that: 1) green manure practice and seasonality changed soil macroarthropod community, trophic structure, and ecological processes in semi-arid conditions; and 2) abundance of predators, ecosystem engineers, decomposers and herbivores was promoted by plant species from Fabaceae family. The results highlight the importance to consider plant species from Fabaceae family as habitat and food resources for soil fauna community.

While many studies have reported a decline in fitness-related traits of offspring with increasing maternal age, the study of senescence in maternal effect through age-specific changes in offspring physiological condition is still at its infancy. We assessed the influence of maternal age and body mass on offspring physiological condition in two populations of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) subjected to markedly different environmental conditions. We measured seven markers to index body condition and characterize the immune profile in 86 fawns which became recently independent of their known-aged mothers. We did not find striking effects of maternal age on offspring physiological condition measured at 8 months of age. This absence of evidence for senescence in maternal effects is likely due to the strong viability selection observed in the very first months of life in this species. Offspring physiological condition was, on the other hand, positively influenced by maternal body mass. Between-population differences in environmental conditions experienced by fawns also influenced their average body condition and immune phenotype. Fawns facing food limitation displayed lower values in some markers of body condition (body mass and haemoglobin levels) than those living in good quality habitat. They also allocated preferentially to humoral immunity, contrary to those living in good conditions, which allocated more to cellular response. These results shed a new light on the eco-physiological pathways mediating the relationship between mother's mass and offspring condition.

AB  - The seismic vulnerability of Kashmir basin is evident from the historical and instrumental earthquake records in general and the capital city of Srinagar in particular. An attempt is made here to deliver the seismic microzonation map of this scenic city. To do so, probabilistic and geotechnical hazard representing the primary seismic hazard, secondary seismic hazard and site conditions are used as input themes. The themes considered for the holistic integrated hazard quantification are the peak ground acceleration at engineering bedrock, shear wave velocity distribution representing site conditions, liquefaction potential index, site amplification ratio and predominant frequency distribution. All these themes have been assigned appropriate weights and their features. The highest weight was given to peak ground acceleration, followed by shear wave velocity distribution, liquefaction potential index, site amplification ratio and predominant frequency themes. These weighted themes are then integrated in the GIS environment to generate seismic microzonation map of the Srinagar city. This map is expressed in terms of the Seismic Hazard Index (SHI) and is accordingly grouped into two classes: very high and severe. The results demonstrate that Srinagar city is susceptible to very high seismic hazard, especially when predicted peak ground acceleration is of the order of 0.605-0.63 g at the bedrock.

AB  - Mass death of farmed brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis reared in raceway culture on a commercial fish farm was recorded in May. The condition was caused by natural infection with external signs of Flavobacterium columnare. Haematological analyses were carried out from peripheral blood from 10 fish from each group. Anaemia was characterized by a reduced erythrocyte count and lower haemoglobin levels; the values of mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin were higher and the values of mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration were decreased. Clinical chemistry analyses in blood plasma indicated decreased levels of total protein, glucose and total calcium and an increase in the urea level. Among the four enzymes analysed, a catalytic activity reaching multiples of the normal level was found in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase. The catalytic concentration of alkaline phosphatase was decreased. Electrophoretic analyses of the plasma protein indicated a reduced level of albumin. The moribund fish had a higher hepatosomatic index and their condition coefficient after Fulton and after Clark was also higher.

AB  - We examined the response of bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) body condition to summer sea ice conditions and upwelling-favorable winds. We used a long-term dataset collected from whales of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas (BCB) stock to estimate various body condition indices (SCI's) for individual whales that were harvested by Alaskan Eskimos. A series of offshore regions frequented by bowhead whales in summer were delineated and used to quantify interannual summertime environmental conditions including: (a) mean open water fraction, (b) duration of melt season, (c) date of continuous freeze-up, and (d) mean upwelling-favorable wind stress. Body condition was analyzed relative to these metrics for both the preceding summer feeding season and the previous three seasons combined. Our analysis indicates a significant increase in the long-term trend in an axillary girth-based body condition index (BCIG) over the study period (1989-2011). The increase in BCIG is likely associated with the trend in overall reduction of sea ice, including increased duration of open water, changes in upwelling potential (wind stress), and possibly higher primary production in the Pacific Arctic marine ecosystem favoring water-column invertebrates. We found strong significant positive correlations between BCIG and late summer open water fraction in the Beaufort Sea and smaller nearshore areas off the Mackenzie Delta and west of Banks Island. Additionally, BCIG was positively and significantly correlated with duration of melt season, later date of freeze-up in the Beaufort Sea, and upwelling-favorable winds on the Mackenzie shelf and west of Banks Island. A strong seasonal difference in BCI's was noted for subadult bowheads, presumably associated with summer feeding; however, yearlings were found to drop in BCI over at least the first summer after weaning. Our results indicate an overall increase in bowhead whale body condition and a positive correlation with summer sea ice loss over the last 2.5 decades in the Pacific Arctic. We speculate that sea ice loss has positive effects on secondary trophic production within the BCB bowhead's summer feeding region. While not part of this study, the abundance of BCB bowheads increased markedly over the same period. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Starvation is a ubiquitous process in nature as all animals depend on finite resources to survive. Limited food resources can lead to starvation-induced mortality and, depending on the scale of the limitation, population-level consequences may emerge. However, attempts to model starvation-induced mortality are rare as it is difficult to isolate the effects of specific sources of natural mortality. Using commonly collected data on body condition, we develop a statistical approach to index starvation-induced mortality by estimating the proportion of individuals experiencing severe emaciation in a fish population. This approach accounts for seasonal patterns in body condition, allowing data collected at any time of year to be included. Using Canada's Northern cod (Gadus morhua) stock as a case study, we found a positive association between rates of natural mortality estimated by an integrated population model and the index of mortality derived from proportions of cod in poor condition. This index is also associated with the availability of two key prey species, capelin (Mallotus villosus) and Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis). Taken together, our results indicate that starvation-induced mortality represents an important component of the natural mortality experienced by Northern cod, supporting the idea that insufficient food contributed to the collapse of the stock in the early 1990s and, subsequently, limited its recovery. These implications highlight the practical relevance of explicitly considering prey availability (e.g., through body condition or prey abundance indices) to improve stock assessment modeling and aid the development of actionable ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies.

AB  - Studies on the unique terrestrial ecosystems of Antarctica's ice-free areas have potential to enhance the understanding of the soil/vegetation interplays and ecological relationships of endangered polar environments. Studies that have emphasized the plants distribution and diversity increase the knowledge on the Antarctic vegetation and controlling factors, enabling better conservation strategies for these fragile ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the composition and distribution of plant communities in association with soil characteristics, landscape elements (altitude and geomorphological variations), and local faunal influence. We related these factors to plant species richness along topographic gradient on a typical maritime Antarctica landscape. We hypothesized that plant species distribution responds to soil and topographical variations; further, we postulated greater plant diversity in ornithogenic areas of increasing age and higher organic matter content. Ten plant communities and a bare-soil reference located at Thomas Point, King George Island, were identified, selected and mapped for the study. Plant cover was analyzed using phytosociological data from 132 squares across the area to evaluate frequency, coverage degree, and the ecological significance index. These values determined the type of community observed. We also determined general soil physical and chemical attributes. The microscale variations in sheltering of the different environments directly impacted floristic composition across the landscape. Vegetation composition and floristic characteristics significantly varied along the topographic gradient, according to soil attributes, in which ornithogenesis (phosphatization) and drainage conditions played a key role. Both factors are likely to be greatly affected by recent warming trend in this part of Antarctica.

AB  - Twenty-four cotton varieties and advance breeding lines were evaluated for their resistance to cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD; Multan/Burewala) under natural field and in glasshouse conditions for two consecutive years. Resistance was based on symptom expression and disease severity index. All the cotton genotypes exposed to the vector whitefly in the field and artificially infected by grafting manifested a high level of resistance against CLCuD (Multan) with the exception of genotype NIAB-999 that was moderately resistant. All the test varieties/breeding lines were highly susceptible to CLCuD (Burewala) both in the field and the glasshouse. However, substantial differences were noted between genotypes for disease index under field conditions. Graft inoculation studies showed that all genotypes inoculated with CLCuD (Burewala) developed disease within 9-13 days whereas those graft-inoculated with CLCuD (Multan) developed symptoms from 15 to 22 days after grafting. Severe reduction occurred in plant morphology, fibre and yield parameters of cotton variety NIAB-111 following inoculation with CLCuD (Burewala) as compared with CLCuD (Multan).

AB  - During routine histological examination of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) from Great Bay, New Hampshire, USA, a high prevalence and intensity of ciliate xenomas has been noted since sampling began in 1997. Xenomas are hypertrophic lesions on the gills of bivalve molluscs caused by intracellular ciliates, likely Sphenophrya sp. Although not known to cause mortality in oysters, xenomas have not previously been reported at this high abundance. The objectives of this study were to characterize the xenomas, describe the ciliates, and gather baseline epizootiological data with correlations to environmental and biological parameters.
   Upon gross examination, xenomas appeared as white nodules, up to 3 mm in diameter, located in the gill tissue and occasionally fusing into large masses along the gill filaments. Light microscopy of histological sections revealed xenomas located in the gill water tubes, which they often completely blocked. Higher magnification revealed dual nuclei, eight kineties, and conjugation of the ciliates. Transmission electron microscopy revealed dual nuclei that varied in density, a maximum of twenty cilia in each kinety radiating from the oral apparatus to the posterior, and a 9 + 2 axoneme structure within the cilia. These traits place the ciliates into the Order Rhynchodida, but insufficient molecular data exist to confirm classification of this ciliate to the Genus Sphenophrya. Since 1997, xenoma prevalence has fluctuated with peaks in 2000, 2004, and 2011. Infected oysters generally contained <30 xenomas, but 2.1% contained >100, sharply contrasting the rare prevalence and low intensity reported elsewhere. Prevalence increased with oyster size, leveling off near 50% in oysters >60 mm. Infection intensity peaked in 70-90 mm oysters and declined in larger oysters. Individual oyster condition was not associated with xenoma intensity, but sites with oysters in higher condition generally had a greater prevalence and intensity of xenoma infections. Seasonal data indicated an infection cycle increasing from summer to fall, peaking at 55-65% in November and dropping to <10% by spring. The oyster population in Great Bay, NH warrants further examination to understand the mechanisms and conditions controlling xenoma formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, CHLA, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), turbidity (TB), and Secchi depth (SD) collected by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the National Lakes Assessment in the continental USA were analyzed. Statistical analysis showed that water quality variables in natural lakes have strong patterns of autocorrelations than man-made lakes, indicating the perturbation of anthropogenic stresses on man-made lake ecosystems. Meanwhile, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) with fuzzy c-mean-clustering algorithm (ANFIS_FC), ANFIS with grid partition method (ANFIS_GP), and ANFIS with subtractive clustering method (ANFIS_SC) were implemented to model CHLA in lakes, and modeling results were compared with the multilayer perceptron neural network models (MLPNN). Results showed that ANFIS_FC models outperformed other models for natural lakes, while for man-made lakes, MLPNN models performed the best. ANFIS_GP models have the lowest accuracies in general. The results indicated that ANFIS models can be screening tools for an overall estimation of CHLA levels of lakes in large scales, especially for natural lakes.

AB  - There is evidence that exposure to negative news is making people feel bad, but not much is known about why this only affects some people or whether this also applies to everyday news exposure. This study examined the direct and indirect effects of daily news exposure on people's affective states. Using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), 63 respondents (24 men and 39 women) reported their news exposure and affective states five times a day for 10 days. In addition, personal relevance of the news and personality characteristics, neuroticism and extraversion, were assessed. Results showed that negative news perceptions were related to more negative affect and less positive affect, and these effects were moderated by personal relevance, but not personality characteristics. The implications of these outcomes are discussed.

AB  - Rice growth and productivity are greatly affected by cold stress, which is likely to become more of a hindrance for high and stable rice yields. To identify cold tolerance at the booting and flowering stages in rice, a recombinant inbred line was developed by crossing a cold-tolerant japonica cultivated variety, Jileng1, with a cold-sensitive indica cultivated variety, Milyang23. The seed setting rate (SST) of the parents and RIL population were investigated under different temperature environments, and the SST and cold stress tolerance index under natural low temperature were used to evaluate cold tolerance and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Fifteen QTLs were detected on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 12, with log-likelihood values ranging from 2.64 to 4.76. These QTLs account for 3.34% to 12.02% of the phenotypic variance explained. Three QTLs, qCtb1, qCtb5 and qCtb12, were repeatedly detected in different conditions, and they were considered stably expressed QTLs. qCtb5 was localized to chromosome 5 marker between CMB0526.3 and ID5014265. In this interval or nearby, many cold-resistance QTLs have been identified in previous studies, so qCtb5 is considered a major cold-tolerance QTL. Thirteen QTLs with environmental interactions were also detected, and QTLs detected in single environment were all found to be involved in environmental interactions. These results show that environmental interactions have a significant effect on cold tolerance in rice. Stable expression of major QTLs will help to fine mapping cold-tolerance genes and provide gene resources to cultivate cold-tolerance rice varieties.

AB  - Assessment of the historical, present, and future states of marine ecosystems and the effects that humans and climate have on the state of an ecosystem are crucial to the scientific advice required to implement an ecosystem-based fishery management system. Management of federal groundfish fisheries in Alaska considers not just the target fishery, but also the possible impact those fisheries might have on other species and the ecosystem. Management actions have ranged from providing protection of endangered species in the region to preventing new fisheries from starting on key foodweb components such as forage fish. A scientific framework for providing ecosystem-based advice that puts the ecosystem first has been evolving over the past few years. This framework provides a way of assessing ecosystem factors that influence target species, the impact the target fishery may have on associated species, and ecosystem-level impacts of fishing. An indicator approach that describes ecosystem status, and trends and measures of human and climate influence has been developed to provide advice to fishery managers. This approach is now being expanded to utilize a variety of models to predict possible future trends in various ecosystem indicators. Future implementation challenges include the refinement of these predictive models, and the inclusion of climate into the models. Identification of sensitive and meaningful ecosystem indicators is also required before a more formalized decision-making process, one that includes ecosystem considerations, can be developed. Most important, the culture of fishery management and research organizations needs to change to embrace the ecosystem-based protections already mandated by various laws.

AB  - Chitinase and surfactin-mediated biocontrol of Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium oxysporwn causing wilt and root rot of Fagopyrwn esculentum respectively has been studied in this communication. Bacillus pumilus MSUA3 as a potential bacterial strain strongly inhibited the growth of R. solani and F. oxysporwn involving the chitinolytic enzymes and an antibiotic surfactin. Plant growth promoting attributes seem to be involved in plant growth promotion and yield attributes. The action of cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) was found deleterious to F. oxysporum and R. solani even in the heat-treated (boiled/autoclaved) CFCS. The possible involvement of surfactin in disease control was revealed by colony PCR amplification of SrfA. Chitinolytic enzyme and antibiotic surfactin evidenced differential biocontrol of F. oxysporum and R. solani by B. pumilus MSUA3. A significant reduction in disease index under gnotobiotic conditions and productivity enhancement of F. esculentum using vermiculite-based bioformulation revealed B. pumilus MSUA3 as a successful potential biocontrol agent (BCA) and an efficient plant growth promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) for disease management and productivity enhancement of buckwheat crop.

AB  - In Mediterranean climates soil water deficit occurs mainly during the spring and summer, having a great impact on cereal productivity. While previous studies have indicated that the grain yield (GY) of triticale is usually higher than bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), comparatively little is known about the performance of these crops under water-limited conditions or the physiological traits involved in the different yields of both crops. For this purpose, two sets of experiments were conducted in order to compare a high yielding triticale (cv. Aguacero) and spring wheat (cvs. Pandora and Domo). The first experiment, aiming to analyze the agronomic performance, was carried out in 10 sites located across a wide range of Mediterranean and temperate environments, distributed between 33 degrees 34' and 38 degrees 41' S. The second experiment, aiming to identify potential physiological traits linked to the different yields of the two crops, was conducted in two Mediterranean sites (Cauquenes and Santa Rosa) in which crops were grown under well-watered (WW) and water-limited (WL) conditions. The relationship between GY and the environmental index revealed that triticale exhibited a higher regression coefficient (Finlay and Wilkinson slope), indicating a more stable response to the environment, accompanied by higher yields than bread wheat. Harvest index was not significantly different between the two cereals, but triticale had higher kernels per spike (35%) and 1000 kernel weight (16%) than wheat, despite a lower number of spikes per square meter. The higher yield of triticale was linked to higher values of chlorophyll content, leaf net photosynthesis (An), the maximum rate of electron transport (ETRmax), the photochemical quantum yield of PSII [Y(II)] and leaf water-use efficiency. GY was positively correlated with Ci at anthesis and Delta C-13 in both species, as well as with gs at anthesis in triticale, but negatively correlated with non-photochemical fluorescence quenching and quantum yield of non-photochemical energy conversion at grain filling in wheat. These results revealed that triticale presented higher photosynthetic rates that contributed to increase plant growth and yield in the different environments, whereas wheat showed higher photoprotection system in detriment of assimilate production.

AB  - During the summer of 2007 several Greek regions suffered periods of extreme heat, with midday temperatures of over 40A degrees C on several consecutive days. High temperatures were also recorded on the east coast of central Greece, where a complex sea breeze circulation system frequently develops. The more intense events occurred at the end of June and July. The highest temperatures were observed on 26 June and 25 July, while the sea breeze developed only on 25 July. Meteorological data collected at two sites-a coastal urban location and an inland suburban site that is not reached by the sea breeze flow-as well as pollution data collected at the urban site, were analysed in order to investigate the relationship between sea breeze development and the prevailing environmental conditions during these two heat wave events. The analysis revealed that sea breeze development affects temperature and pollution levels at the shoreline significantly, causing a decrease of similar to 4A degrees C from the maximum temperature value and an increase of similar to 30% in peak PM10 levels. Additionally, several stress indices were calculated in order to assess heat comfort conditions at the two sites. It was found that nocturnal comfort levels are determined mainly by the urban heat island effect, the intensity of which reaches up to 8A degrees C, while the applied indices do not demonstrate any significant daytime thermal stress relief due to sea breeze development.

AB  - We assessed the impacts of exposure to an environmentally representative concentration (0.83 mg/L) of the explosive cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) on fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) in one-year and multigenerational bioassays. In the one-year bioassay, impacts were assessed by statistical comparisons of females from breeding groups reared in control or RDX-exposure conditions. The RDX had no significant effect on gonadosomatic index or condition factor assayed at 1 d and at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months. The liver-somatic index was significantly increased versus controls only at the 12-month timepoint. RDX had no significant effect on live-prey capture rates, egg production, or fertilization. RDX caused minimal differential-transcript expression with no consistent discernable effect on gene-functional categories for either brain or liver tissues in the one-year exposure. In the multigenerational assay, the effects of acute (96 h) exposure to RDX were compared in fish reared to the F-2 generation in either control or RDX-exposure conditions. Enrichment of gene functions including neuroexcitatory glutamate metabolism, sensory signaling, and neurological development were observed comparing control-reared and RDX-reared fish. Our results indicated that exposure to RDX at a concentration representing the highest levels observed in the environment (0.83 mg/L) had limited impacts on genomic, individual, and population-level endpoints in fathead minnows in a one-year exposure. However, multigenerational exposures altered transcript expression related to neural development and function. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:1852-1864. (C) 2011 SETAC

AB  - The Actor-Network Theory is used to reflect relevant issues of local interaction and involvement in this paper's analysis of Tehran. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods is used in the project to investigate non-human and human factors. The Perceived Residential Environment Quality Index was used to study 422 residents of Bagh-Shater, and community semi-structured interviews and interviews with key informants were performed using an interpretive approach. According to the analysis, a diagnosis of the current state of local interactions and involvement is given by transposing the situation in Bagh-Shater into elements that can demonstrate successive urban changes. These components form a single collection when combined with macro and main networks. Our concentration is on the urban situation, which is a place where changes occur at a time when modern aspects of Tehran's urban life align with local characteristics and country structures, or vice versa. As a result, the dominant model in Tehran's development could be machine-centered rather than human-centered, and people, both elites and lower classes may hold a favorable opinion of it and use it to further their own interests. Convergence may be motivated by a variety of factors, as well as community-based conservation projects. The city government has begun the process of implementing the oriented-community strategy. Nevertheless, many such plans due to some facts like the fact that urban technocrats and bureaucrats do not have the adequate motivation, ability, and knowledge to be able to use culture as a great resource for improving urban conditions also they have wasted resources and expanded bureaucracy.

AB  - Water deficit and high temperature are important environmental factors restricting plant growth and photosynthesis. The two stresses often occur simultaneously, but their interactions on photosynthesis and nitrogen level have been less studied. In the present experiment, we measured photosynthetic parameters, stomatal density, and nitrogen levels, as well as soluble sugar content of leaves of a perennial grass, Leymus chinensis, experiencing two day/night temperature regimes of 30/20 degrees C and 30/25 degrees C, and five different soil moisture contents (the soil relative-water content ranged from 80% to 25 %). Leaf relative water content, leaf biomass, whole plant biomass, the ratio between the leaf biomass and total plant biomass, and the photosynthetic rate, as well as water-use efficiency decreased at high night temperature, especially under severe water stress conditions. Stomatal index was also increased by soil water stress except very severe water stress, and high nocturnal temperature decreased the leaf stomatal index under soil water stress. Nocturnal warming decreased nitrogen concentration in the leaves and increased it in the roots, particularly when plants were subjected to severe water stress. There were significant positive correlations between the photosynthetic rate and both soluble sugar concentration and nitrogen concentration at low nocturnal temperature. It is suggested that nocturnal warming significantly exacerbates the adverse effects of soil water stress, and their synergistic interactions might reduce the plant productivity and constrain its distribution in the region dominated by L. chinensis, based on predictions of global climate change.

AB  - In this paper, it will be shown that the nonlocal theory of Eringen is not generally suitable for analysis of functionally graded (FG) materials at micro/nano scale and should be modified. In the current work, an imaginary nonlocal strain tensor is introduced and used to directly obtain the nonlocal stress tensor. Similar to the stress tensor in Eringen's nonlocal theory, the imaginary nonlocal strain tensor at a point is assumed to be a function of local strain tensor at all neighbor points. To compare the new modified nonlocal theory with Eringen's theory, free vibration of FG rectangular micro/nanoplates with simply supported boundary conditions are investigated based on the first-order plate theory and three-dimensional (3-D) elasticity theory. The material properties are assumed to be functionally graded only along the plate thickness. The effects of nonlocal parameter and material gradient index on the natural frequencies of FG micro/nano plates are discussed. The present developed nonlocal theory can be used in conjunction with different analytical and numerical methods to analyze mechanical response of micro/nano structures made of FG materials.

AB  - Population structure, growth, length-weight relationship, mortality and stock size of tench, Tinca tinca (L.), was studied in Lake Beysehir, Turkey in 2005. Totals of 3360 tench (1865 males; 1795 females) were captured with gill- and trammel-nets of various mesh sizes. Male to female ratio was 1.04 : 1. The study covered length year classes. Fork lengths and total weights ranged from 9 to 37 cm and 13 to 815 g. For all individuals, the von Bertalanffy growth equation and length-weight relationship were L-t = 54.2[1-exp(-0.1350(t + 1.0281)] and W = 0.0151 L-2.9993, respectively. Growth performance index and mean condition factor of the tench population were 2.598 and 1.513, respectively. Mortality rates were Z = 1.97 year(-1), M = 0.29 year(-1) and F = 1.68 year(-1) for total, natural, and fishing mortality, respectively. The exploitation rate was E = 0.85, and the percentage of surviving fish was 13.9%. Tench stock was assessed as about 6-7 million individuals and 1450-1500 tonnes in biomass. It was determined that maximum sustainable yield could be obtained with an 80% level of the current fishing effort.

AB  - In our previous studies we assessed the biochemical response of juvenile seabream to the exposure to three selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (phenanthrene, pyrene and fluorene) in short-term laboratory experiments. Since in the analyses conducted in the field it is much more natural to expect the presence of multiple contaminants at the same time, the objective of this study was to analyse the reaction of seabream to the exposure to a mix of the three PAHs tested previously. The proportions of the individual components in the PAH mix used in our experiments were constant and determined on the basis of the concentration addition concept.
   We measured a set of hepatic biomarkers: 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lipid peroxidation; as well as biliary fluorescent aromatic compounds (FACs) metabolites. Moreover, we calculated the biotransformation index, the condition factor and the hepatosomatic index. Only a few of these indicators provided statistically significant response to the tested exposures, while FACs showed very strong increase with increasing concentration of the tested mix of PAHs.
   The results of this research are expected to contribute to the establishment of a good biochemical index of exposure to mixtures of PAHs in laboratory experiments, which can be further useful in field studies dealing with the impact of organic pollutants on marine organisms.

AB  - Increased anthropogenic disturbances affecting streams worldwide have resulted in declines of freshwater biodiversity. Mediterranean ecoregions are very sensitive to such disturbances because of their high levels of natural hydrological variability and increasing trends in human population growth. The use of aquatic macro invertebrate assemblages as bioindicators is a commonly applied approach for evaluating water body condition. However, extensive use of macroinvertebrates across similar ecoregions may be limited because of natural local differences in biodiversity and differing anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we present a multi-metric index (MMI) based on macroinvertebrate assemblages from Chilean Mediterranean streams. To evaluate the relative level of disturbance among sampling sites with respect to multiple anthropogenic perturbations, we used an integrated disturbance index based on catchment and local scale disturbances. We sampled 95 sites from streams and rivers during the 2016 austral summer including 26 least-disturbed reference sites, 13 highly disturbed sites, and 56 intermediately disturbed sites. In addition, we re-sampled 14 sites during winter and spring to validate our findings. Using a set of screening criteria, we evaluated 74 candidate macroinvertebrate metrics, representing diversity, composition, trophic structure, and tolerance to pollution. The resulting MMI included Diptera taxa richness, total macroinvertebrate density, number of Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera individuals, and predator taxa richness. The final MMI scores classified the 95 sampling sites into three categories of biotic condition, including good (n = 46), fair (n = 18), and poor (n = 31). Our approach is transferable to other rivers in the region and is a sufficient tool to evaluate the condition of sites affected by several human perturbations at both local and catchment scales in Chilean Mediterranean streams.

AB  - Pollution is a major problem in all countries, even developed ones. It is the major environmental negative impact of anthropogenic activities affecting ecology. There are two major ways for assessment of negative impact of motor transport flow intensity and pollution level: monitoring the air or modeling pollutant dispersion. It is very important to estimate different unknown air modeling programs. In this work modeling is to be executed by the US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) the so-called "the best possible existing software for strategic environmental assessment". That is also recornmended by the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Lithuania. In this work pollution modeling, was executed for the northern part of Vilnius (the network of streets Gelezinis Vilkas-Ozas-Kalvarijos). For motor vehicle pollution mathematical modeling, it is necessary to evaluate meteorological parameters like temperature, humidity, the wind direction and speed. Modeling software can also estimate relief conditions. Pollution emission measurements were used, and Pollution dispersion modeling was performed. The main target was to evaluate pollutant dispersion from motor transport in the analysed area of Vilnius. During investigation maximum hourly, daily and annual concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter were observed.

AB  - In Mali Ston Bay, located on the eastern Adriatic coast, mussels and oysters have traditionally been cultivated. However, previous studies showed that water and sediments from Mali Ston Bay contain elevated levels of some trace metals, which was attributed to natural processes of sedimentation and drainage. In order to assess the bioavailability of trace metals in the bay, and to assess the health risk of consumption of shellfish species from Mali Ston Bay, a passive monitoring program was carried out in the period from December 1998 to August 2005. Samples of the whole soft tissue were collected seasonally at 4 shelfish breeding farms and analyzed for essential (Cu, Zn) and non-essential (Cd, Cr THg, Pb) metals. Mean concentrations of analyzed metals in the edible tissue of mussels (Cd: 1.15 mg kg(-1) d.wt.; Cr: 1.65 mg kg(-1) d.wt.; Cu: 5.6 mg kg(-1) d.wt.; THg: 0.15 mg kg(-1) d. wt.; Pb: 1.09 mg kg(-1) d wt.; Zn: 139 mg kg(-1) d wt.) fell in the range of values usually found in low to moderately contaminated marine coastal areas. Examination of the spatial pattern of contaminants showed that there were no statistically significant differences among stations in Mali Ston Bay regarding trace metal content. Concentrations of Cd, Cu, Cr and THg were significantly higher during the autumn-winter period, while concentrations of Pb and Zn did not depend on the sampling season. Among six analyzed metals, only concentrations of Cd and THg were significantly negatively correlated with the condition index of the mussels. Analysis of temporal trends during the 7 years of monitoring showed that metal concentrations had not changed with time. According to EU and WHO legislation, consumption of the edible tissue of the mussels was not harmful for humans since all the values were well below the permissible limits for fresh seafood. In addition, results of the evaluation of the risks to human health associated with consumption of the mussels containing trace metals suggest that there is no health risk for moderate shellfish consumers.

AB  - The aim of this article is to find an exact analytical solution for free vibration characteristics of thin functionally graded rectangular plates with different boundary conditions. The governing equations of motion are obtained based on the classical plate theory. Using an analytical method, three partial differential equations of motion are reformulated into two new decoupled equations. Based on the Navier solution, a closed-form solution is presented for natural frequencies of functionally graded simply supported rectangular plates. Then, considering Levy-type solution, natural frequencies of functionally graded plates are presented for various boundary conditions. Three mode shapes of a functionally graded rectangular plate are also presented for different boundary conditions. In addition, the effects of aspect ratio, thickness-length ratio, power law index, and boundary conditions on the vibration characteristics of functionally graded rectangular plates are discussed in details. Finally, it has been shown that the effects of in-plane displacements on natural frequencies of functionally graded plates under different boundary conditions have been studied.

AB  - Reproductive maturation of wild caught female and male southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) (SBT) held under captive conditions at two locations were examined: (1) production SBT (n = 132) held in sea cages located offshore of Port Lincoln, South Australia; and (2) broodstock SBT (n = 24) held in an onshore breeding facility at Arno Bay, South Australia. With the exception of one large female specimen sampled from the sea cages offshore of Port Lincoln, there was no overlap in size range (fork length), and very little overlap in the range of whole body weight of the fish sampled at the two locations (production SBT 17 to 101 kg and 98 to 155 cm; broodstock SBT 97 to 152 kg and 160 to 182 cm). Production SBT were assumed to be aged 1 to at least 7 years old and broodstock SBT were aged between 8 and 12 years old. The production and broodstock SBT were generally heavier for a given length compared to that predicted for wild SBT and the broodstock SBT were younger in age for a given fork length compared to that determined for wild SBT. Therefore, predictions from wild stocks may not be a reliable indication of the age of captive reared fish or their capacity to reproduce in captivity. Gonadal histology showed that female and male production SBT were mostly sexually immature. Female and male broodstock SBT were sexually mature. Sexually mature female SBT were observed from 101 kg in body weight and 155 cm in fork length, while male SBT were sexually mature at a smaller size (51 kg body weight and 128 cm fork length) compared to female SBT. Gonadosomatic and gonad index generally increased with increasing stages of maturation for female and male SBT; however, there was no relationship between general condition index, fat-body index or hepatosomatic index and stages of maturation. Furthermore, the study showed that SBT sourced from the wild and held in the captive environment for up to 9 years can achieve sexual maturity. The production SBT found at advanced stages of maturation indicates that future broodstock can be sourced directly from the Great Australian Bight without the need for long term holding.

AB  - Due to their hydrophobicity and relatively large surface area, microplastics (MPs) can act as carriers of hydrophobic pollutants in the ocean and may facilitate their transfer to organisms. This study examined effects of dietary exposure to polystyrene MPs of 0.5 and 45 mu m alone and with sorbed benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) on mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis in order to elucidate the effects of MP size and the presence of sorbed BaP on the organism. MPs were provided daily, mixed with algae, during 26 days at equivalent mass (0.058 mg/L), corresponding to 1000 particles/mL for 4.5 mu m MPs and to 7.44 x 10(5) particles/mL for 0.5 mu m MPs. Effects were determined on early cellular biomarkers in hemocytes, structure and cell type composition of digestive tubules (DTs), histopathology and whole organism responses (condition index (CI), clearance rate (CR), food absorption efficiency (AE), respiration rate (RR) and scope for growth (SFG)). BaP concentrations in mussels increased with time, in particular when sorbed to smaller MPs. Large MPs were abundant in the lumen of stomach and DTs, but were also occasionally found within epithelial cells. Effects in all treatments increased with exposure time. MPs with sorbed BaP were more toxic than MPs alone according to hemocyte viability and catalase activity and to the quantitative structure of DT epithelium. Higher toxicity of small MPs compared to larger ones was recorded for DNA damage and cell composition of DTs. At tissue level a slight increase in prevalence of inflammatory responses occurred in all exposed groups. At whole organism level a compensatory effect was observed on absorption efficiency across MP treatments at day 26, resulting in increased SFG in mussels exposed to small MPs with sorbed BaP. This could be related to an increased energy need to deal with stress observed in biomarkers. Further work is required to understand the Trojan horse effect of a variety of plastic type, size, shape combinations together with a wide variety of pollutants. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The ability to predict energy and protein allocation to different body condition parameters according to environmental constraints is a key component in understanding the processes underlying population dynamics. We investigated the influence of a proxy of population density and environmental factors on individual body condition parameters of female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) based on long-term monitoring (2002-2013) of autumn harvest on Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada. We used dressed body mass, peroneus muscle mass, and rump fat thickness to evaluate the nutritional status of 3,123 adult females. Density index and winter precipitation negatively affected fat reserves in autumn. We detected the negative effect of winter precipitation on fat reserves only at low density likely because individuals at high density were already in bad condition. High normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in spring (May-Jun) reduced body mass, and this influence was more pronounced under high population density, probably because individuals at high densities were less likely to be buffered against environmental fluctuations when resources were scarcer than resources at low population density. Using different body condition parameters, our results provide additional insights on how northern ungulates influenced by food limitation may respond to future environmental changes. We recommend managers to collect long-term data on multiple physiological indicators of body condition. These data could be used as an index of ecological changes and provide a quantitative basis to help setting harvest objectives or supporting adaptive management. (c) 2020 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - The present paper focuses on some aspects of the hydro-geomorphological modelling processes, with impact on the evolution of Romanian Black Sea coastal ecosystem, in the context of new climate changes, the vulnerability of coastal ecosystems caused by the processes of sedimentation/erosion, induced by the marine and fluvial hydrological regime, under the direct action of marine agitation factors. The paper presents certain results of hydro-geological and hydro-bio-geomorphological studies conducted on river, delta, marine and coastal environment, the assessment of ecosystem state, under the influence of atypical climatic regime, in the last decades. The research highlights the evolution of marine agitation factors that are determinants in formation of marine deltas and estuaries, by extending a complex analysis on the coastal response processes due to the action of marine agitation factors producing a hydro-morphological and ecological impact. The final results of the hydro-bio-geomorphological study of the shallow areas allow the advised intervention and management of biotic and abiotic resources of the coastal system, based on changes at different scales of climate condition, reflected in different status of coastal ecosystem indicators.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressure on flow regimes has been recognized as a significant threat to the health of rivers in Canada and elsewhere. Yet while we know that the historical hydrological conditions prevailing at river sites can be assigned to runoff regime types, the implications of this hydrological structure on biological community composition have been poorly studied. Here we support the improvement of guidelines for flow management by exploring the relationship between biota and runoff regime types for selected rivers in British Columbia. One thousand six hundred biological samples were extracted from Environment Canada's Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network (CABIN) database and a matching procedure was undertaken to associate biological samples to the long-term hydrometric monitoring stations stored in the HYDAT National Water Data Archive. A practical approach for spatial matching of hydrometric and biomonitoring sites was presented, which permitted matching of a sufficient number of samples to assess the structure of biological communities across the four regime types identified. By examining multivariate and univariate biological descriptors, including the recently developed Canadian Ecological Flow Index, differences in macroinvertebrate community composition between the runoff regimes were observed. In conclusion, we have developed a practical approach to match hydrological and biomonitoring data and we have forwarded guidelines on how to improve integration between hydrometric and biomonitoring networks. Moreover, we have provided the first ecological validation of runoff regime types in Canada, confirming the need to account for antecedent hydrological conditions in the assessment of ecological quality using biomonitoring data.

AB  - One hundred and ninety-two samples from six species of mollusks classified into the following taxonomic classes: Gastropoda (Patella aspera, Patella candei crenata), Bivalvia (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Ensis directus), and Cephalopoda (Abraliposis morisii, Pyroteuthis margatifera) were investigated. Samples were collected in the Atlantic Ocean (Canary Islands and Galicia). The concentrations of Al, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn were determined by ICP-OES. Statistical analysis verified that the classes of benthic organisms had the highest concentration of elements. However, the Cephalopoda class had the highest Cd (1.685 +/- 0.929 mg/kg) and Pb (0.826 +/- 1.104 mg/kg) content. On the other hand, the values obtained in this study were compared with studies conducted in other parts of the world to verify the environmental state of the Atlantic Ocean using the organisms studied as bioindicators.

AB  - Hydrozincite [Zn-5(CO3)(2)(OH)(6)] precipitation from Naracauli waters (SW Sardinia) is, among other things, promoted by a microbial community made up of a filamentous cyanobacterium (Scytonema sp.) and a microalgae (Chlorella sp.). Hydrozincite bioprecipitation is responsible for the natural removal of harmful metals, especially Zn, from the stream waters. Thus, hydrozincite could be used to attenuate metal pollution in mining waters. Information on environmental conditions which promote the biomineralization process is fundamental for the development of remediation strategies. This paper aims to investigate the variables controlling the biomineralization process, and seasonal variation of the hydrochemical factors that affect hydrozincite precipitation. Hydrozincite morphology varies depending on the environmental conditions. Specifically, changes were observed between samples collected in late spring and samples collected in summer, and among samples precipitated under different water flow conditions. According to field observations, correlated with speciation and equilibrium calculation, the maximum intensity in hydrozincite precipitation occurs in the late spring during rainy years. In these conditions, the hydraulic regime in the stream reaches stationary conditions, and saturation index values with respect to hydrozincite reach their highest values. Concomitantly, the Zn2+/CO32- molar ratio reaches values close to 1, indicating that kinetic processes have a role on the hydrozincite biomineralization process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An indicator system closely connected with eco-environment, in which indicator involves in such fields as society, economy, resources, environment and ecology, is first proposed for eco-environmental quality assessment. Then, a hierarchical model with four levels is established by virtue of these indicators and attributes. In the model, weights of indicators and attributes are determined by combining Delphi method with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and a statistic method is used to eliminate the influences arising from the differences in dimension and magnitude of indicators. On these grounds, an AHP-statistics model is provided for regional eco-environmental quality assessment. As a case, such AHP-statistics model is utilized in the dynamic analysis of regional eco-environmental assessment in Chaohu Lake basin. Study results show that natural environmental quality in the watershed was in the declining state while social environmental quality was in a markedly improved situation from 1996, and the synthetic eco-environmental quality was gradually and slowly improved under the common influences of both natural and social environmental factors. Example of application testified the capacities of above methodology to evaluate the real and dynamic state of regional eco-environmental quality.

AB  - Because people wish to preserve their health and do something equivalent for ecosystems, the metaphor of ecosystem health springs to mind. This paper presents the argument that it is a mistake for environmental scientists to treat this metaphor as reality. First, the metaphor fails because it misrepresents both ecology and health science. Ecosystems are not organisms, so they do not behave like organisms and do not have properties of organisms such as health. Also, health is not an operational concept for physicians or health risk assessors because they must predict, diagnose, and treat specific states called diseases or injuries; they do not calculate indexes of health. Second, attempts to operationally define ecosystem health result in the creation of indexes of heterogeneous variables. Such indexes have no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects on one component are eclipsed by responses of other components; and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown. Their only virtue is that they reduce the complex array of ecosystem responses to various disturbances to one number with a reassuring name. A better alternative is to assess the real array of ecosystem responses so that causes can be diagnosed, future states can be predicted, and benefits of treatments can be compared.

AB  - Context. The expansive grassland biome is one of the most extensively transformed in South Africa, yet no strategy for monitoring its integrity is in place. A grassland health program, incorporating different ecosystem levels, was recently initiated. The suitability of three taxonomic groups as indicators has been tested so far: vegetation (by calculating an ecological index value, El), insects (using the South African grassland scoring system, SAGraSS) and small mammals (this study). All of these methods aim to be rapid and easy to perform. Whereas SAGraSS still needs further refinement, several factors already indicate the importance of including small mammal community parameters in integrity assessments.
   Aims. This contribution reports on more than 12 years of results from various studies on small mammals in the Free State Grasslands, with the aim of exploring the utility of small mammal survey for assessment of ecosystem integrity.
   Methods. The hypothesis was based on the outcomes of several short-term studies conducted in the grassland biome. Combining all previous results, this paper re-evaluates the parameters of trap success, species richness, diversity, evenness and individual species as bio-indicators.
   Key results. By combining data from many sites and years, the effect of seasonal and inter-annual variations in habitat and population parameters was diminished, and a more general picture of small mammal community structure revealed. New insights were gleaned into the status of several indicator species. By providing a summary of small mammal community parameter scores and indices, the study establishes a benchmark for future small mammal assessments and monitoring. To be effective, small mammal surveys in the grassland biome of southern Africa should be carried out in autumn and early winter.
   Conclusions. This study suggests that small mammal species richness and diversity decline with habitat degradation; that the generalist rodent Mastomys coucha dominates community numbers at low ecological integrity; that the number of specialist species increases towards ecological climax; and that specific species act as indicators during the successional process.
   Implications. This study should benefit the monitoring, conservation and management of grassland ecosystems, make environmental impact assessments more effective, and identify new topics for ecological research.

AB  - Environmental monitoring is an essential feature of environmental assessment and natural resource management. Whilst the focus of monitoring programs is often on the response of chosen variables to a disturbance of particular concern, it is also important to consider the variability of disturbance pressures in relation to the variability of the ecosystem state. In this paper, we discuss the need to relate environmental variability to disturbance variability in small-scale monitoring programs designed to assess the impact of short-term pulses of visitors on the condition of aquatic ecosystems in protected areas. We use data from protected areas from six Koppen climate zones in Australia to highlight the fact that peaks in visitation do not always coincide with existing monitoring protocols or with optimal times for monitoring on the basis of environmental variability, particularly in relation to rainfall and temperature and, hence, likely biological activity. We highlight how recognising the interaction between disturbance variability and environmental variability will greatly enhance the power of monitoring programs and substantially improve our capacity to detect responses to temporally pulsed disturbances. Analyses of this type, undertaken before the establishment of monitoring programs, will yield higher quality information and a better return on monitoring investment for natural resource managers.

AB  - [1] Interannual variations in the Beaufort Sea summer ice cover influence climatic, ecological, and socioeconomic conditions. Utilizing an ice severity index based on the distance from Point Barrow, Alaska, to the ice edge and characteristics of the shipping season, variations in summer ice conditions are examined from 1953 through 2000 with respect to variations in winter and summer surface and meteorological conditions. Although there is no significant trend in the ice severity index, ice conditions during the 1990s were less severe than in previous decades. Interannual variations in summer ice conditions are related to dynamical mechanisms in the preceding winter and dynamical and thermodynamical processes during summer. In winters preceding light ice summers, high pressure develops over Siberia, leading to increased ice transport across the Transpolar Drift Stream, while the Beaufort Gyre is diminished, resulting in decreased multiyear ice transport into the Beaufort Sea. Air temperatures are also elevated near the Alaskan North Slope, but there is little difference in winter air temperature over the Beaufort Sea. During light ice summers the Beaufort High is strongly defined over the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, enhancing easterly and northerly winds and advecting sea ice out of the Beaufort Sea. Above-normal air temperatures also occur over much of the southern Beaufort Sea. Variations in sea level pressure and winds that result in light and heavy ice summers are closely linked to positive and negative winter Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation phases, as well as negative and positive summer Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation phases.

AB  - Government agencies frequently conduct benthic macroinvertebrate surveys for bioassessment at large spatial scales in a variety of aquatic habitats, including large rivers. However, these data are rarely used by investigators outside the specific regulatory agency. We used data from 150 benthic macroinvertebrate samples collected over a period of 20 y from 10 locations in a large, shallow river system (the Susquehanna River and 2 major tributaries) by personnel in 4 government agencies to explore broad spatial and temporal patterns in benthic assemblages. We standardized sample size and taxonomy to account for differences in sampling, processing, and identification methods among agencies. Invertebrate assemblages were dominated by mayflies and caddisflies (46-83%). Percent Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) and standard diversity measures were inversely correlated, indicating that traditional macroinvertebrate Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) approaches might not be applicable to large rivers. These data showed differences in assemblage composition across sub-basins and revealed effects of the spread of invasive Asian clams and of black fly management on benthic assemblage structure in the river. Large-river invertebrates are understudied and, even with challenges of combining data sets from multiple agencies, we showed the potential utility of applying data from a large river system to reveal ecological patterns across space and time.

AB  - Fish-based indices of biotic integrity have been developed for many lotic systems but remain scarce for lakes. The goal of this study was to assess the responses of lentic fish assemblages to anthropogenic pressures when environmental variability was controlled for and to compare them between French natural lakes and reservoirs. Environmental features, catchment-scale anthropogenic descriptors and fish data were collected from 30 natural lakes and 59 reservoirs throughout France. Functional fish metrics were regressed against both anthropogenic variables and the natural environmental conditions. Our results show that fish assemblages are appropriate ecological indicators for both natural and artificial lakes. They underline the necessity to control for the environment when developing indices at broad geographical scales. The relevant metrics differ between natural lakes and reservoirs, which challenges the attempts to use natural systems as references to assess the ecological potential of artificial ones.

AB  - The concentration and distribution of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Zn and Fe were determined to estimate soil contamination in freshwater wetlands (S1 and S2), brackish wetlands (S3) and salt marshes (S4 and S5). Soil cores with depths up to 50 cm were seasonally collected with three repeats. Our study revealed higher mean concentrations of Cd in top 50 cm soils than corresponding background values in the five wetlands. However, values of As, Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe exceeded background values in surface soils (0-10 cm). Heavy metal concentrations in surface soils were generally higher compared with deeper soils, with the exception of S3. Horizontally, eight heavy metals generally showed a decreasing and then increasing trend in the 0-40 cm soils, with the lowest and highest values in S4 and S5, respectively. Three hotspots of metal accmulation in the top 20 cm soils were observed in the study area.The sediment quality guidelines indicated that occasionally adverse effects of As and Cu can be anticipated. Besides, according to the enrichment factor and geo-accumulation index, Cd exhibited no pollution to moderate pollution level in these wetlands. The potential ecological risk index indicated the moderate pollution degree in soils of five wetlands. Principle component analysis and Pearson correlation analysis showed that eight heavy metals mainly derived from natural source, and SOM and soil texture were main factors influencing the accumulation and distribution of eight heavy metals in the studied wetlands.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Part I of this article reviewed an approach to modeling in scientific geographic information systems (GIS) by digitally synthesizing environmental parameters or phenomena as functions of other data. This interactive approach to global environmental modeling complements the approach of dynamic process models while enabling the scientist to rigorously assess the character of data used as boundary conditions in other models on widely available personal computers and workstations. Part II presents a case history using existing GISs to recreate the AVHRR-based vegetation index using data derived from in situ study on the Earth's surface. The example explores the relationship between the global vegetation index and ecosystems, soils, and precipitation, and defects in our present ability to describe these features. The degree of success of the model shows that GIS and the global change data base can be effective modeling tools, especially when functions are added to enhance the modeling capabilities of GIS. One function, INDEX, developed for this case history, is a simple utility that models a single data set as a function of another data set. A second function THEMCOIN, takes two input categorical data sets, such as vegetation and soils maps, and computes the mean and standard deviation of a third input data set Of numerical values, such as elevation, precipitation, or vegetation index computed from AVHRR data. THEMCOIN outputs a table of these empirical relationships. It also optionally models the numerical data set based on correlations with the categorical data sets. Both of these functions facilitate environmental modeling in GIS. The models begin to approximate vegetation index as a function of ecosystem, precipitation, and soils. Statistical output from the models extends our understanding of relationships between environmental parameters.

AB  - Maintaining ecological integrity is globally acknowledged as a strategic goal, yet there is no consensus on a practical and widely usable methodology to assess it. This study proposes a comprehensive approach to quantify regional ecosystem integrity based on FAIR data, obtained using satellite remote sensing and image analysis. Three variables are central to this approach: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), at-satellite brightness temperature (BT) and vegetation surface heterogeneity (HG), corresponding to ecosystem integrity indicators exergy capture, biotic water flows and abiotic heterogeneity. The indicators are assessed across the vegetation period and a representative Regional Index of Ecological Integrity (RIEI) is proposed to express the integrity of two case study areas and representative land use types. The proposed approach proved powerful in representing the anthropogenic and autopoietic gradient within study regions in high detail. Arable lands and urban areas ranked lowest, while dense forests and wetlands highest, agriculture being the most significant factor reducing regional integrity. Areas with conservation significance ranked either having the highest integrity, when dense vegetation was present, and mediocre or even low in case of e.g., sand dunes, marches and rock formations. Limitations of the method comprise: insufficient representation of biodiversity, sensitivity to cloud cover and demanding in-situ validation. The approach can be scaled from global to local level, adapted to various remote sensing techniques and complemented by a diversity of data (e.g., ecosystem services, geomorphological, dimatic) to provide deeper understanding of landscape ecosystem integrity.

AB  - Fish-based indices monitor changes in surface waters and are a valuable aid in communication by summarising complex information about the environment (Harrison and Whitfield, 2004). A zone-specific fish-based multimetric estuarine index of biotic integrity (Z-EBI) was developed based on a 13 year time series of fish surveys from the Zeeschelde estuary (Belgium). Sites were pre-classified using indicators of anthropogenic impact. Metrics showing a monotone response with pressure classes were selected for further analysis. Thresholds for the good ecological potential (GEP) were defined from references. A modified trisection was applied for the other thresholds. The Z-EBI is defined by the average of the metric scores calculated over a one year period and translated into an ecological quality ratio (EQR). The indices integrate structural and functional qualities of the estuarine fish communities. The Z-EBI performances were successfully validated for habitat degradation in the various habitat zones.

AB  - 1. A multimetric index of fish assemblage integrity was developed and similarity analyses were conducted on fish species in two central Indian rivers and the effects of distance from municipal and industrial effluents on those indices then evaluated.
   2. Five metrics from Karr et al. (1986, Illinois Natural History Survey Special Publication 5, Urbana, IL) were adopted: intolerant species richness, % omnivorous individuals, % top carnivore individuals, total number of individuals and % individuals with anomalies. Seven new metrics (native species richness, native family richness, benthic species richness, water column species richness, % non-native individuals, % tolerant individuals and % herbivorous individuals) were added.
   3. Non-native individuals represented 1-55% of the assemblages at sampled sites which held fish.
   4. Fish were present at eleven sites and not collected at two sites, despite heavy metal concentrations exceeding U.S. Environmental Protection Agency acute criteria at all sites.
   5. Two types of metric scoring were examined. The traditional 5-3-1 method showed the same pattern as continuous scoring from 0 to 10, but produced a higher integrity class at one site.
   6. Scores on our modified index of fish assemblage integrity increased with distance downstream from a major effluent source in each river. Jaccard similarity scores between the least disturbed downstream site and all other sites decreased with increasing distance and disturbance.
   7. It was concluded that Karr's original index and its theoretical foundations are easily adaptable, even to an ichthyofauna containing no species, and only two families (Cyprinidae, Poeciliidae), in common with the midwestern United States.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance of coastal ecosystems has increased the need for comprehensive methods and indicators to assess the health status of marine ecosystems. Biotic indices are important as they indicate different ecological states. In this study, Eco-Exergy-based indices (Exergy and Structural Exergy) and diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener index and Margalef index) were applied in the seas around the Zhoushan archipelago, and correlation analysis between biotic indices and environmental factors was used to test the robustness of these indices in capturing the environment changes, aimed to provide reference in selecting the indices for assessing marine eco-environment quality. Results showed that the benthic indices of Exergy, Shannon-Wiener, and Margalef increased with the distance from the mainland. The Eco-Exergy-based indices and Margalef index were significantly, negatively correlated with dissolved inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate, and significantly, positively correlated with the salinity of seawater. Overall, the marine ecosystem was more stable further away from the coast, where salinity was higher, and pollutants such as nutrients in seawater were lower. In addition, biodiversity and Eco-Exergy was also higher. Generally, Eco-Exergy-based indices were observed to be good indicators for detecting the environment changes in the study area.

AB  - Nowadays forestry faces a complex management situation; the understanding of sustainable forest management (SFM) has gone far beyond the original meaning of sustainable yield of timber. SFM strategies should fulfil ecological, economic and social functions without causing damage to other ecosystems.
   In this understanding, forest management actions cannot be seen as isolated or mono-causal. In this case study, indicators for SFM are arranged in a Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework at forest management unit level. This framework links pressures on the environment caused by human activities with changes of environmental state (condition) parameters. Forest management also responds to these changes by instituting environmental and economic measures to reduce pressures and restore natural resources. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is utilized to evaluate the performance of four management strategies with regard to the PSR framework on SFM. Priorities of indicators and alternatives are modelled with the ANP resulting from the interconnections to other indicators and their respective cumulative importance. The approach allows for more detailed information on the network of human influences and their impacts on forest ecosystems and goes beyond the limitations of flat-dimensioned indicator sets.

AB  - Lake Aygir (Elmali) is located on the body of Mount Karagol on the Giresun Mountains in the Eastern Black Sea region of Turkey. It is a glacial lake at an altitude of 2900 m. In this study, the phytoplankton community and trophic state of Lake Aygir, which is subject to extreme conditions, were examined in the summer season when the lake is not covered with ice. A total of 48 taxa were identified belonging to Bacillariophyta (21), Chlorophyceae (10), Cyanobacteria (7), Ochrophyta (3), Euglenophyta (3), Charophyta (2), Cryptophyta (1) and Miozoa (1). Diatoms dominated both the species diversity and biomass, while among the small centric species, Lindavia (Cyclotella) comensis Grunow showed excessive reproduction. L. bodanica Eulenstein, Achnanthidium minutissimum Kutzing and Diatoma mesodon (Ehrenberg) Kutzing are the other subdominant taxa. The distribution of algae groups in phytoplankton concentration is as follows: Diatoms > Chlorophytes > Cyanophytes > Ochrophytes. Lake Aygir, which has circum-neutral characteristic, was, according to indicator taxa, diversity indices and trophic classification systems (OECD, TSI, TLI), found to be oligotrophic and clean (1st class).

AB  - A index of biotic integrity (IBI) was applied to assess the ecological health at seven sites of ca. 338 km extension of the Paraiba do Sul river, in bracketing a large urban-industrial complex. The aim was to evaluate the index response to changes in environmental quality during two seasons (winter/dry versus. summer/wet). Eight metrics were selected to IBI in three categories: 1) species richness and habitat composition; 2) indicator species; and 3) trophic structure. The IBI, based on the least impacted regional condition, showed the highest value at the most upstream site (Queluz=km 0) - Acceptable, then decreasing downstream and reaching the lowest record at Volta Redonda (km 125) - Impacted; afterwards there was an increasing quality toward the most downstream sites until reaching better scores at Alem Paraiba (km 338) - Moderate Impacted/ Acceptable. During the winter/dry seasons a clearer spatial trend was detected when compared with oscillations in summer/wet. The IN proved to be a suitable tool to evaluate environmental quality in this tropical and very altered large river, since it was sensitive to nonsource point pollution changes, which occurred all over the studied area.

AB  - Potential risks to terrestrial wildlife were estimated from exposure to 2,3,7,8-TCDD/TCDF in paper pulp sludges applied to or disposed of on land. Comparative risks were assessed for land application uses in forests, mine reclamation, and agriculture, versus other disposal methods, such as in landfills and surface impoundments. Potential risks to fish and aquatic wildlife were also estimated for runoff from such land uses and disposal sites.
   The general types of wildlife species predicted as potentially most exposed via eating TCDD/TCDF contaminated prey were terrestrial animals such as shrews, woodcocks, and robins. TCDD/TCDF levels in eggs from several bird species collected from Wisconsin pine plantations amended with such pulp sludges corroborated the transfer of TCDD/TCDF from soil via prey species into avian eggs, particularly robin eggs.

AB  - Urban expansion and the transformation of rural areas into suburban areas along with increasing human pressure can cause major changes in the environment. Typical effects of urbanization include degradation of aquatic ecosystems. However, urban expansion is often accompanied by an effort to provide residents with some contact with nature in the city. Natural waterbodies are the elements of the environment predestined to ensure appropriate conditions for recreation and other ecosystem services key to human well-being. In this study, the changes in the forms of development of a submontane stream catchment area (Carpathians, Poland) against the background of the gradual extension of city boundaries were analysed. In addition, the impact of urbanization on the ecological conditions of the urban stream, and therefore the potential ecosystem to provide ecosystem services, was assessed. Although the extension of the city entailed the development of settlements, it was accompanied by the expansion of the municipal sewage infrastructure, thus improving sewage management. The disappearance of arable lands from the stream catchment due to the decline in agricultural activities initiated the spontaneous process of buffer restoration along the stream. All the biotic indices such as Shannon diversity index, Margalef species richness index and BMWP-PL index, based on macroinvertebrate communities increased, and the fish were more numerous in the late stage of city development compared with the early (rural) stage. Surprisingly, the system has rehabilitated well with no revitalisation actions. It is necessary, however, to improve morphological in-stream conditions, and to make further efforts to improve water quality for the system to develop a semi-natural state. Only reaching full ecological potential can lead to an increase in the ecosystem capacity to provide ecosystem services. The studied ecosystem may provide many different services simultaneously, but their availability depends on the protection of the ecosystem's functioning as a whole.

AB  - Biological indicators for Mediterranean rivers are poorly developed. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the Index of Biotic Integrity approach (IBI) with fish assemblages in the Guadiana catchment, a typical Mediterranean watershed in Southern Portugal. Reference sites were selected from a set of 95 sites, using a multivariate approach. Fifty-five candidate metrics were screened for range, responsiveness, precision and redundancy. Final metrics included: proportion of native fish, number of intolerant and intermediate species, number of invertivore native fish, number of phyto-lithophilic and polyphilic species, and catches of exotics. The IBI scores correlated with composite gradients of human impact and differed significantly between reference and non-reference sites. Application of the IBI to an independent validation set with 123 sites produced results congruent with the development set and repeatable assessments at 22 sites showed concordance in IBI scoring. This application highlights the effectiveness of the IBI approach even with fish assemblages of limited diversity and ecological specialisation as in Mediterranean streams.

AB  - Implementing the Ecosystem Approach in marine ecosystems is moving from preliminary steps-dedicated to defining the optimal features for indicators and developing efficient indicator frameworks-towards an operational phase where multisector marine management decisions are executed using this information. Within this operational context, emergent ecosystem properties are becoming quite promising as they have been demonstrated to be globally widespread and repeatable, and to be quite effective in detecting significant state variations of complex systems. Biomass accumulation across TLs (CumB-TL) combines two important emergent properties of an ecosystem (energy flow, in terms of transfer efficiency, and storage, expressed as biomass), both amenable to detecting rapid ecosystem change. However, for further application, it is crucial to understand which types of drivers an indicator is sensitive to and how robust it is in relation to modifications of the external conditions and/or the system state. Here we address some outstanding questions of these CumB-TL curves related to their sensitivity to various drivers by carrying out a global scale assessment (using data from 62 LMEs) over six decades (1950-2010). We confirm the consistency of the S-pattern across all the LMEs, independent from latitude, ecosystem, environmental conditions, and stress level. The dynamics of the curve shape showed a tendency to stretch (i.e. decrease of steepness), in the presence of external disturbance and conversely to increase in steepness and shift towards higher TL in the case of recovery from stressed conditions. Our results suggest the presence of three main types of ecosystem dynamics, those showing an almost continuous increase in ecological state over time, those showing a continuous decrease in ecological state over time, and finally those showing a mixed behaviour flipping between recovering and degrading phases. These robust patterns suggest that the CumB-TL curve approach has some useful properties for use in further advancing the implementation of the Ecosystem Approach, allowing us to detect the state of a given marine ecosystem based on the dynamics of its curve shape, by using readily available time series data. The value of being able to identify conditions that might require management actions is quite high and, in many respects, represents the main objective in the context of an Ecosystem Approach, with large applications for detecting and responding to global changes in marine ecosystems.

AB  - The article describes main trends of modern changes in the most important parameters of the ecological and climate system of the Republic of Mordovia. Based on the spatio-temporal analysis of the relationship between climate component modifications, the authors formulate general provisions with regard to the changes that are occurring on regional agroecosystems in the studied region. The yield of agricultural crops correlates more with integral indicators such as bioclimatic potential, the modifications of which reflect the complex influence of changes in the regional climate system on the production capacities of agroecosystems rather than the extremes of individual climate parameters.
   The conducted research revealed a tendency to decreasing the bioclimatic potential on the territory of Mordovia against increasing in the sum of active temperatures and an increasing the duration of the vegetative period, which is associated with a decrease in the annual amount of precipitation and, in general, humidification of the territory, which are the main factors in the climate production conditions in Mordovia's current climatic conditions.
   Calculations of the biological efficiency index of the climate showed a significant spatial variability, which is expressed in a decrease the index from the north-west to the south-east of the republic.
   Nevertheless, for most farms in the administrative regions of the republic, you can state a high efficiency of using the ecological and bioclimatic potential of landscapes, which affects the volume of agricultural production.

AB  - In this study, the occurrence and distribution of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), were investigated in surface sediment samples from the Hun River, northeast China. The data was then used to assess the potential ecological risk. The results indicated 15 PAHs were detected in these sediments, and the total concentrations of the 15 PAHs (not including naphthalene) ranged from 82.96 to 39,292.95 ng g(-1) dry weight (dw), with an average value of 3705.54 ng g(-1) dw, and 4-ring PAHs were the dominant compounds at most sites. The diagnostic parameters such as anthracene/(anthracene+phenanthrene), fluoranthene/(fluoranthene+pyrene), and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene/(indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene+benzo[g,h,i]perylene) showed that they had been emitted from a number of different sources, especially the pyrolytic emissions. The results of the ecological risk assessment, which compared the PAH concentrations with the effect range low (ERL) and the effect range median (ERM) values, indicated that several individual PAH concentrations at four sites in the downstream section of the Hun River were higher than the ERM, suggesting that there was a potential ecological risk in these areas.

AB  - Coastal lagoons are ecotones between continents and the sea. Coastal lagoons of Western Greece, subjected to different human pressures, were classified into four different types based on their hydromorphological characteristics and monitored over a three year period for their biotic and abiotic features. Six ecological indices based on water quality parameters (TSI-Chl-a, TSI-TP, TRIX), benthic macrophytes (E-MaQI, EEI-c) and an integrated index TWQI were applied to assess the ecological status of studied lagoons under real conditions. The trophic status ranged from oligotrophic to hypertrophic according to the index applied. The ecological quality of transitional water ecosystems can be better assessed by using indices based on benthic macrophytes as changes in abundance and diversity of sensitive and tolerant species are the first evidence of incoming eutrophication. The multi-parametric index TWQI can be considered appropriate for the ecological assessment of these ecosystems due to its robustness and the simple application procedure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global warming is expected to drive some ectothermic species beyond their thermal tolerance in upcoming decades. Phenotypic plasticity, via developmental or transgenerational acclimation, is a critical mechanism for compensation in the face of environmental change. Yet, it remains to be determined if the activation of beneficial phenotypes requires direct exposure throughout development, or if compensation can be obtained just through the experience of previous generations. In this study, we exposed three generations of a tropical damselfish to combinations of current-day (Control) and projected future (+1.5 degrees C) water temperatures. Acclimation was evaluated with phenotypic (oxygen consumption, hepatosomatic index, physical condition) and molecular (liver gene expression) measurements of third-generation juveniles. Exposure of grandparents/parents to warm conditions improved the aerobic capacity of fish regardless of thermal conditions experienced afterwards, representing a true transgenerational effect. This coincided with patterns of gene expression related to inflammation and immunity seen in the third generation. Parental effects due to reproductive temperature significantly affected the physical condition and routine metabolic rate (oxygen consumption) of offspring, but had little impact on gene expression of the F3. Developmental temperature of juveniles, and whether they matched conditions during parental reproduction, had the largest influence on the liver transcriptional program. Using a combination of both phenotypic and molecular approaches, this study highlights how the conditions experienced by both previous and current generations can influence plasticity to global warming in upcoming decades.

AB  - To evaluate the health status at six different study areas, we used the generalized linear model approach with selected biochemical markers in resident fish from uncontaminated and contaminated sites. We also confirmed the independence between the biochemical indices and the morphometric indices including the hepato-somatic index (HSI), gonado-somatic index (GSI), and condition factor (CF) in fish from the sampling areas. The effect of area on the presence of biotransformation markers (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity; EROD) was significantly high in Masan Bay. The area with the greatest effect on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was Jindong Bay, while there was no significant effect of GSI, HSI, CF, and sex in the EROD model and HSI, CF and sex in the AChE model. These results clarify that fish from Masan, Gwangyang and Jindong Bay were affected by pollutant stress, and the analysis of sensitive biochemical responses allowed for an improved interpretation of the results.

AB  - Accurate characterization of wetland condition at a regional or watershed scale requires an assessment that includes both a quantity and quality component. A probabilistic sampling design can facilitate the implementation of such assessments through its ability to extrapolate results from a random sample of wetlands to the entire population of wetlands over a large geographic area. In 2003 an assessment of the quantity and quality of depressional wetlands in the Redwood River watershed was conducted using a probabilistic sampling design. The number and cumulative area of depressional wetlands in the watershed was estimated relative to the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) by evaluating 146 randomly selected sites. However, limitations of the study design only allowed quantification of wetland loss over the similar to 20-year period (c.1980-2003) following the acquisition of aerial imagery used to produce the NWI in this region. Wetland quality was assessed in 40 randomly selected sample sites using plant and macroinvertebrate indices of biological integrity (IBI). Depressional wetlands included in the NWI have experienced an estimated 56% reduction in number, equivalent to a 21% decrease in area, in the watershed over the last 20 years. Of the remaining wetland area, an estimated 91% was impaired. Thus, management practices with the goal of increasing suitable habitat for native wetland plant and animal communities should focus on restoration of drained wetlands as well as improvement of existing wetlands to maximize outcomes.

AB  - The recent droughts that have occurred in different parts of Ethiopia are generally linked to fluctuations in atmospheric and ocean circulations. Understanding these large-scale phenomena that play a crucial role in vegetation productivity in Ethiopia is important. In view of this, several techniques and datasets were analyzed to study the spatio-temporal variability of vegetation in response to a changing climate. In this study, 18 years (2001-2018) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroscopy (MODIS) Terra/Aqua, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) daily precipitation, and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) soil moisture datasets were processed. Pixel-based Mann-Kendall trend analysis and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) were used to assess the drought patterns during the cropping season. Results indicate that the central highlands and northwestern part of Ethiopia, which have land cover dominated by cropland, had experienced decreasing precipitation and NDVI trends. About 52.8% of the pixels showed a decreasing precipitation trend, of which the significant decreasing trends focused on the central and low land areas. Also, 41.67% of the pixels showed a decreasing NDVI trend, especially in major parts of the northwestern region of Ethiopia. Based on the trend test and VCI analysis, significant countrywide droughts occurred during the El Nino 2009 and 2015 years. Furthermore, the Pearson correlation coefficient analysis assures that the low NDVI was mainly attributed to the low precipitation and water availability in the soils. This study provides valuable information in identifying the locations with the potential concern of drought and planning for immediate action of relief measures. Furthermore, this paper presents the results of the first attempt to apply a recently developed index, the Normalized Difference Latent Heat Index (NDLI), to monitor drought conditions. The results show that the NDLI has a high correlation with NDVI (r = 0.96), precipitation (r = 0.81), soil moisture (r = 0.73), and LST (r = -0.67). NDLI successfully captures the historical droughts and shows a notable correlation with the climatic variables. The analysis shows that using the radiances of green, red, and short wave infrared (SWIR), a simplified crop monitoring model with satisfactory accuracy and easiness can be developed.

AB  - Drought has severe impacts on human society and ecosystems. In this study, we used data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) sensors to examine the drought effects on vegetation in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2018. The MODIS data included the 16-day 250-m composites of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) with Land Surface Temperature (LST) images with 1 km resolution. The TRMM data were monthly rainfalls with 0.1-degree resolution. The relationship between drought and index-defined vegetation variation was examined by using time series, regression analysis, and anomaly calculation. The results showed that the vegetation coverage for the whole country, reaching the lowest levels of 6.2% and 5.5% were observed in drought years 2001 and 2008, respectively. However, there is a huge inter-regional variation in vegetation coverage in the study period with a significant rising trend in Helmand Watershed with R = 0.66 (pvalue = 0.05). Based on VCI for the same two years (2001 and 2008), 84% and 72% of the country were subject to drought conditions, respectively. Coherently, TRMM data confirm that 2001 and 2008 were the least rainfall years of 108 and 251 mm, respectively. On the other hand, years 2009 and 2010 were registered with the largest vegetation coverage of 16.3% mainly due to lower annual LST than average LST of 14 degrees and partially due to their slightly higher annual rainfalls of 378 and 425 mm, respectively, than the historical average of 327 mm. Based on the derived VCI, 28% and 21% of the study area experienced drought conditions in 2009 and 2010, respectively. It is also found that correlations are relatively high between NDVI and VCI (r= 0.77,p= 0.0002), but slightly lower between NDVI and precipitation (r= 0.51,p= 0.03). In addition, LST played a key role in influencing the value of NDVI. However, both LST and precipitation must be considered together in order to properly capture the correlation between drought and NDVI.

AB  - Restoration of estuarine habitats is essential for the conservation and recovery of depressed Pacific salmon populations. However, assessing the functions of recently restored habitat poses a number of problems because of the transitory occurrence of salmonids in any one location. We propose assessment criteria and metrics that are based on the habitat's capacity, opportunity, and realized function to enhance survivability of juvenile salmon. Because of the paucity of data relating capacity and opportunity attributes to realized function (e.g. growth, consumption rate, survival), there continues to he a need for manipulative experiments to assess the developmental status of restoration sites. Such a self-monitoring approach of letting the fish diagnose the ecological state of restoration would effectively address the small-scale, site-specific assessment goals and criteria, but ignores the larger-scale issues relating to the ability of diverse salmon species and life histories to occupy estuarine habitat landscapes. If coastal restoration is going to contribute the recovery of anadromous salmonid populations, a landscape perspective is fundamental to restoration planning, implementation, and particularly assessment.

AB  - Mine tailings are a potential source of environmental pollution because they typically contain potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and the residue of chemical compounds used during extraction processes. The Remance gold mine (NW Panama) is a decommissioned mine with mining activity records dating from the 1800s and several periods of abandonment. Very little remediation work has been performed, and waste is exposed to climatic conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the PTEs and cyanide contents in mine waste after mining operations ceased some 20 years ago, and to evaluate the degree of pollution and the environmental risks they pose with the use of the Pollution Load Index (PLI) and the Ecological Risk Index (RI). Although the total cyanide (T-CN) concentration (1.4-1.9 mg kg- 1) found in most of the study area falls within the limits of gold mining tailing values for American sites (1.5-23 mg kg 1), it is worth noting that the values of the tailings of the last used mining operation exceed it (25.2-518 mg kg 1) and persist at the site. The PLI and RI suggest that the tailings from the mine and mine gallery sediments represent a source of pollution for soils and surrounding areas given their high content of PTEs (As, Cu, Sb, Hg) and T-CN, which pose serious ecological risks for biota. Therefore, it is necessary to draw up a remediation plan for this area.

AB  - Bird populations provide excellent systems to investigate variation in longevity in the wild since individuals can often be monitored over their lifetime. A number of recent studies suggest that the dynamics of protective telomere chromosome caps (telomere length and rate of loss) are indicative of biological state and potentially useful as indicators of future longevity. Currently, Terminal Restriction Fragment (TRF) analysis and relative quantitative PCR (qPCR) are used to measure telomeres in birds, but with limitations. TRF analysis is time consuming, while relative qPCR gives a within-study relative value making it difficult to compare across experiments. Utilising an approach first developed in humans of using synthetic oligomer telomeric (TTAGGG)n and normaliser gene standards of known length to calibrate qPCR values, we describe a methodological adaptation to the avian qPCR telomere assay to make results comparable within, and potentially between, bird species. We evaluate this absolute qPCR method in the Seychelles warbler Acrocephalus sechellensis against relative qPCR measurements on the same samples. Telomere estimates from both methods showed an age-related decline in telomere length, and were highly correlated (r = 0.99). Absolute qPCR avian telomere analysis may prove a useful means of estimating telomere lengths in a calibrated, sensitive, and efficient way using small amounts of archived bird sample.

AB  - Oxidative post-translational modifications of proteins resulting from events that increase cellular oxidant levels play important roles in physiological and pathophysiological processes. Evaluation of alterations to protein redox states is increasingly common place because of methodological advances that have enabled detection, quantification and identification of such changes in cells and tissues. This mini-review provides a synopsis of biochemical methods that can be utilized to monitor the array of different oxidative and electrophilic modifications that can occur to protein thiols and can be important in the regulatory or maladaptive impact oxidants can have on biological systems. Several of the methods discussed are valuable for monitoring the redox state of established redox sensing proteins such as Keap1. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In 2008 the "Forester Creek Improvement Project" was completed near the mouth of Forester Creek, Santee, CA, along a 2-km section historically subject to flooding. With a cost of $36 million (US), the project's goals were to: 1) improve water quality; 2) improve physical habitat and biodiversity; and 3) improve flood control. We evaluated if the project met these goals for water quality, physical habitat, and biodiversity. We evaluated the project's monitoring data, conducted post-project monitoring, and analyzed data from other independent sources to assess goal attainment. The project's required monitoring was insufficient to determine if any goals were met. Our own results found partial success, with only pH and water temperatures improved from pre-project conditions. No improvement was found for total dissolved solids or fecal coliform, for which the creek is impaired, and sediments contained toxic concentrations of urban-use pesticides. While the project's monitoring was insufficient to document goal attainment, the project's formal goals were largely infeasible due to degraded upstream conditions. The project should be considered a partial success in that riparian habitat has improved compared to the erosive and invasive species dominated pre-project condition and the original proposal by the City of Santee to line the creek with concrete. Forester Creek's poor water quality, physical habitat, and biodiversity are driven by flow modification and pollution associated with urban development upstream, which must be addressed at the watershed scale and outside of the stream channel.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to apply wireless sensor modules to measure the environmental conditions in a windowless broiler house. An environmental index monitoring system was established that automatically estimated the temperature-humidity index (THI) and temperature-humidity-velocity index (THVI) according to the collected database. Finally, prediction of the relationships between the THI or THVI and the feed conversion rate (FCR) was studied. Nine sets of temperature, relative humidity, and wind velocity sensors were used for measuring the inside environment. An additional set was located outside the broiler house. The environmental database used this system of wireless sensors for collecting environmental information, quantifying the environmental indices, and establishing a warning system. The system automatically estimated the THI and THVI according to the database and presented the results in a user interface. Two areas of the broiler house were arranged for daily measurement of feed consumption and individual weight of the broilers for two experiments. These data were applied to calculate the daily weight gain and FCR. The first experiment was conducted from 9 September to 9 October (from summer to autumn) in 2016, and the second experiment was conducted from 3 November to 9 December (from autumn to winter) in 2016. During the experiments, there were no errors in the messages sent by the environmental database and warning system. These results serve as important references for predicting the FCR as well as the THI and THVI. The THVI of the first experiment and the THI of the second experiment predicted the FCR with a good relationship. The results show that the indoor and outdoor THI values could be higher than the standard values. In the FCR statistical analysis, the FCR of the second experiment was lower than the FCR of the first experiment, and they were both lower than the criterion FCR. This implies that opportunities exist for improving the broiler house environment in this subtropical climate. The results of this study could become an important reference for predicting the FCR with the THI and THVI. Finally, prediction of the relationships between the THI or THVI and the FCR were conducted. The results of the second experiment (R-2 = 0.8327) were significantly better than the results of the first experiment (R-2 = 0.5184).

AB  - Water quality and stream habitat in agricultural watersheds are under greater scrutiny as hydrologic pathways are altered to increase crop production. Ditches have been traditionally constructed to remove water from agricultural lands. Little attention has been placed on alternative ditch designs that are more stable and provide greater habitat diversity for wildlife and aquatic species. In 2009, 1.89 km of a conventional drainage ditch in Mower County, Minnesota, was converted to a two-stage ditch (TSD) with small, adjacent floodplains to mimic a natural system. Cross section surveys, conducted pre- and post-construction, generally indicate a stable channel with minor adjustments over time. Vegetation surveys showed differences in species composition and biomass between the slopes and the benches, with changes ongoing. Longitudinal surveys demonstrated a 12-fold increase in depth variability. Fish habitat quality improved with well-sorted gravel riffles and deeper pool habitat. The biological response to improved habitat quality was investigated using a Fish Index of Biological Integrity (FIBI). Our results show higher FIBI scores post-construction with scores more similar to natural streams. In summary, the TSD demonstrated improvements in riparian and instream habitat quality and fish communities, which showed greater fish species richness, higher percentages of gravel spawning fish, and better FIBI scores. This type of management tool could benefit ditches in other regions where gradient and geology allow.

AB  - This work studies a set of soil indicators (physical, physico-chemical and biological), evaluated under field and laboratory conditions, in different stages of spontaneous vegetation colonization in abandoned metal(loid) mine tailings from Mediterranean semiarid areas. The results provide evidence about the interest of spontaneous colonization by native vegetation for the phytomanagement of abandoned metal(loid) mine tailings in terms of providing ecosystem functions. Bare soils (B), small groups of pine trees (P), scattered pine trees with shrubs and herbs under the canopy (P + S), and dense patches of pine trees with shrubs and herbs under the canopy (DP + S) were studied inside mine tailings abandoned approximate to 40 years ago. Besides, pine forests next (FN) and away (FA) from the tailings were also studied. Pioneer and nurse plants were mainly found inside the tailings, although ecological indexes in P + S and DP + S were similar to FN and FA. Pedogenesis evidences such as structure development and increase in cation exchange capacity, organic C and N were found in tailing soils from B to DP + S. However, soil metal(loid)s did not follow the same variation pattern. For example (in mg kg(-1)): P showed the maximum total Cu (approximate to 277) and Zn (approximate to 17,860), while P + S of As (approximate to 1250) and Pb B had the maximum water extractable Pb (approximate to 4) and Zn (approximate to 207), while FA of As (approximate to 0.192) and Cu (approximate to 0.149). Soil microbial biomass C, enzyme activity, CO2 emission, organic matter decomposition and feeding activity of soil dwelling organisms indicated similar, or even higher, biological activity in P + S and DP + S than in FN and FA. In fact, FA showed the highest soil ecotoxicity risk (reduced enchytraeid reproduction). Therefore, mine tailing soils can be effectively modified following spontaneous vegetation colonization, achieving conditions with capacity to provide certain ecosystem functions. Hence, phytomanagement of these tailings should be preceded by a detailed knowledge of the existing spontaneously colonized sites, which should be preserved to take advantage of their potentiality.

AB  - We studied fish assemblages within seven streams in the Ridge and Valley ecoregion near Chattanooga, Tennessee. These were all second- to fifth-order streams with small drainage areas (<23 km(2)). Sites were characterized in terms of water quality, habitat and fish assemblages. Relationships among these features and land use were examined at both the riparian and watershed scales. Forty fish species representing nine families were collected by electrofishing. Site-specific findings included the vulnerable flame chub (Hemitremia flammae) and a disjunct population of southern redbelly dace (Phoxinus erythrogaster). Species richness and diversity varied considerably among sites, and index of biotic integrity (IBI) ratings ranged from very poor to fair/good. Species diversity and IBI scores were negatively correlated with watershed urban land use and positively correlated with rocky substrate. Urbanized watersheds were characterized by sites with higher levels of sedimentation and conductivity. Reaches draining well-forested watersheds exhibited more rocky substrate, higher levels of dissolved oxygen, lower temperatures, and more diverse fish assemblages. Riparian forest cover was positively correlated with rocky substrate but not correlated with species diversity or biotic integrity.

AB  - This paper outlines the industrial potential of the city of Irkutsk as the source of pollution of the urban environment and ecological effects. A crucial role is played by the fuel and energy complex (FEC) represented by the energy industries, coal and oil-refining industries as well as by the metallurgical and agro-industrial sector. A major contribution to air pollution of the city (up to 60%) is made by motor transport. It was shown by observations and calculations of the traffic rate in different functional zones of the city that it fluctuates from high (3714 vehicles/hour) in the industrial zone to low (888 vehicles/hour) in the green zone. The social and demographic situation is characterized. The population size of the city is 623.4 thousand. The population density in different administrative districts varies from 1204 to 4558 persons per square kilometer. The birthrate is 17.5% higher than the national average. In situ assessments were made of the ecological status of soils. We determined the level of soil biochemical activity (SBA) and their alkaline acid conditions as integral and informative indicators. Ecologically, high and low SBA values cannot be considered positive because they indicate a tendency for disturbances in the metabolism regulation mechanisms for organic compounds. Content levels of heavy (HM) metals in soils are provided. The findings are presented cartographically.

AB  - Questions: Sustaining ecosystem services for society in the face of global change is a major challenge. Resilience, an ecosystem's ability to absorb disturbance and return to its initial functioning, is critical for this. We assessed the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands following restoration management. Using a novel multi-indicator approach, we asked how different taxonomic and functional facets of biodiversity influence resilience mechanisms. We demonstrated this approach for a case study in subalpine grasslands, asking: how resilient are grasslands dominated by Patzkea paniculata and their agronomic services to changing mowing regimes?
   Location: Villar d'Arene, Hautes-Alpes, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, France. Boundary area of Ecrins National Park.
   Methods: A manipulative experiment tested the reciprocal effects of mowing cessation and mowing resumption for 10 years. We analysed floristic composition data following four steps. First, we used the Community Structure Integrity Index (CSII; Jaunatre et al., ) to obtain qualitative and quantitative summaries of taxonomic responses. The second step focused on taxonomic biodiversity using species richness, Simpson and Pielou indices, and responsive species identified in the first step. Third, we analysed functional diversity responses using functional groups and community weighted mean (CWM) of vegetative plant traits. Finally, we quantified ecosystem services impacts by estimating fodder quantity and quality using trait-based models.
   Results: The mowing manipulation demonstrated the high resilience of P. paniculata grasslands and revealed reversibility of transitions between mown and unmown states. By reducing the abundance of P. paniculata, the resumption of mowing restored forage quality. Supported by a complementary case study on post-disturbance re-sowing in hay meadows, this study demonstrates the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands to management change and explores underlying belowground mechanisms of vegetative regeneration and belowground reserves.
   Conclusion: Our novel multi-indicator approach provides multifaceted mechanistic understanding necessary to anticipate impacts of socio-ecological changes and to maintain the multiple benefits of mountain grasslands. Addressing the different facets of biodiversity from abundance data that are systematically collected in impact or monitoring assessment, this approach provides a common framework, widely applicable to different types of restoration or management interventions, across regions and biota.

AB  - Approximately 7.3 hectares of wetlands, composed of six separate cells, were created to mitigate the loss of a 6-hectare, beaver-influenced, wetland-stream complex destroyed by the construction of a multipurpose impoundment in the Cedar Run watershed in Fauquier County, Virginia, USA. The mitigation action physically replaced the lost wetlands and was judged successful in meeting planned objectives and regulatory requirements (which did not include standards for biota). A pre-project fish survey conducted in 1974 in the wetland-stream complex and three nearby streams provided a baseline condition from which to assess project impacts on fish, as determined from yearly surveys in the cells and the stream reach immediately upstream. In addition, fish communities were sampled at 157 stream locations within the northern Virginia Piedmont from 1997 to 1999 to establish a regional Index of Biotic Integrity (1131) based on fish assemblages. A modification of that IBI was developed to assess the effectiveness of the mitigation based on 22 stream segments that were heavily influenced by beaver. Pre- and post-project conditions were assessed by gauging them against the wetland-stream complexes using this IBI. The IBI score for the mitigation area dropped from the pre-project 34 to 18 the first year after construction and ranged from 18 to 28 over the ten-year post-project monitoring period. A reduction in the number of native species was observed, and there was a dramatic shift in composition and relative abundance within key species groups. In general, the mitigation benefited species favoring lentic environments over those preferring lotic environments and had negative effects on trophic and habitat specialists and less tolerant species. Scores for the mitigation cells were lower than scores for the original wetlands for the following IBI metrics: number of darter species, number of minnow species, percent of the assemblage comprised of the single most dominant species, percent of tolerant individuals, percent of benthic invertivores, and percent of specialist carnivores minus tolerants. Upstream reach IBI scores also diminished over the same 10-year period, although more gradually. The IBI showed that, despite meeting all regulatory requirements, the mitigation failed to replace the original fish community in the wetland-stream complex and adversely impacted additional stream habitat. Using tools such as an IBI to monitor biological condition can help planners effectively mitigate unavoidable project impacts and avoid the unintended loss of important natural resources caused by compensatory mitigation actions.

AB  - We explored land use, fish assemblage structure, and stream habitat associations in 20 catchments in Opequon Creek watershed, West Virginia. The purpose was to determine the relative importance of urban and agriculture land use on stream biotic integrity, and to evaluate the spatial scale ( i. e., whole- catchment vs riparian buffer) at which land use effects were most pronounced. We found that index of biological integrity ( IBI) scores were strongly associated with extent of urban land use in individual catchments. Sites that received ratings of poor or very poor based on IBI scores had > 7% of urban land use in their respective catchments. Habitat correlations suggested that urban land use disrupted flow regime, reduced water quality, and altered stream channels. In contrast, we found no meaningful relationship between agricultural land use and IBI at either whole- catchment or riparian scales despite strong correlations between percent agriculture and several important stream habitat measures, including nitrate concentrations, proportion of fine sediments in riffles, and the abundance of fish cover. We also found that variation in gradient ( channel slope) influenced responses of fish assemblages to land use. Urban land use was more disruptive to biological integrity in catchments with steeper channel slopes. Based on comparisons of our results in the topographically diverse Opequon Creek watershed with results from watersheds in flatter terrains, we hypothesize that the potential for riparian forests to mitigate effects of deleterious land uses in upland portions of the watershed is inversely related to gradient.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop effective tools based on fish assemblages, allowing the development of an effective assessment approach for the ecological status of running waters. Fish samples were collected using gill-nets with mesh sizes of 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 and 80 mm. Forty sites were visited from October 2008 to September 2009 in the Bandama River. A large part of the data set on fish descriptors associated with environmental parameters was compiled from regional databases. For each of the fish assemblage descriptors, stepwise multiple linear regressions with habitat variables were carried out. The residuals of the models obtained were used as candidate metrics independent of natural environmental factors. Student t-tests used to compare each metric in reference and disturbed samples indicated significant difference (P < 0.05) for six metrics. The standard residuals of metrics selected were added to constitute the final index. This multimetric index of fish assemblage integrity could serve as a practical technical reference for conducting cost-effective biological assessments of lotic systems.

AB  - Based on the first-hand data of field investigation, existing literature, books and plant specimens database resources, the complete and available spatial database of wild Akebia trifoliate in China was established firstly. After analyzing the geographical distribution of Akebia trifoliate and its ecological factors, such as climate, soil and topographic characteristics, based on the existing literature, we selected 16 climatic indicators and used statistical analysis to study key climatic variables affecting its growth from a macro perspective. The results show that (1) According to the characteristic roots and contribution rate obtained by principal component method, three principal factors are determined. Their corresponding value of three principal factors were 6.0538 and 37.84%, 4.7487 and 29.68%, 3.3822 and 21.14% respectively. All the characteristic roots indicate that the three principal factors are playing a dominant role in climate variables of influencing the distribution of Akebia trifoliate. (2) The first principal factor is called "heat factor", the most important role determining geographical distribution of Akebia trifoliate, including the variables with larger factor load such as active accumulated temperature (>= 10 degrees C), warm index, biological temperature and annual average temperature. It shows that Akebia trifoliate tends to grow in areas with higher heat conditions. The second principal factor is called "humidity factor", the second role for Akebia trifoliate, including the variables with larger factor load such as evapotranspiration rate, humidity index, annual precipitation, growing season precipitation and relative humidity. So it shows that Akebia trifoliate tends to be in areas with sufficient precipitation and high humidity. The third principal factor is called "illumination factor", including the variables with larger load such as annual sunshine hours, growing season sunshine hours and extreme low temperature. So Akebia trifoliate likes the areas with relatively short sunshine hours. (3) Heat factor and humidity factor are the main limiting factors for its growth. The significant climatic variables offer a basis for the selection of ecological factors and the determination of weight in the suitability analysis of Akebia trifoliate. These results could provide a theoretical basis for the artificial cultivation of Akebia trifoliate. The ideas and methods for wild Akebia trifoliate in this paper could give a reference for the study of other valuable wild plants.

AB  - Benthic diatoms are well known bio-indicators of river pollution by nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). Biological indexes, based on diatom sensitivity for non-toxic pollution, have been developed to assess the water quality. Nevertheless, they are not reliable tools to detect pollution by pesticides. Many authors have suggested that toxic agents, like pesticides, induce abnormalities of the diatom cell wall (frustule). High abnormal frustule abundances have been reported in natural diatom communities sampled in streams contaminated by pesticides. However, no direct link was found between the abundances of abnormal frustules in these communities and the pesticide concentrations in stream water. In the present study, a freshwater benthic diatom community, isolated from natural biofilm and cultured under controlled conditions, was treated with a known genotoxic herbicide, maleic hydrazide (MH). Cells were exposed to three concentrations of MH (5 x 10(-6), 10(-6), 10(-7) M) for 6 h followed by a 24 h-recovery time. After MH treatments, nucleus alterations were observed: abnormal nucleus location, micronucleus, multinuclear cell or disruption of the nuclear membrane. A dose-dependent increase of nuclear alterations was observed. The difference between the control (9.65 nuclear alterations per 1000 cells observed (9.65 parts per thousand), S.D.=4.23) and the highest concentrations (29.40 parts per thousand, S.D.=8.49 for 10(-6) M and 35.96 parts per thousand, S.D.=3.71 for 5 x 10(-6) M) was statistically significant (Tukey test, P<0.05). Diatoms also exhibited frustules with deformed morphology and abnormal ornamentation. Significantly increased abundances of abnormal frustules were observed for the highest concentrations (10(-6) and 5 x 10(-6) M; Tukey test, P<0.05). These two parameters tended to increase together (Pearson correlation=0.702, P<0.05). The results suggest that the induction of abnormal frustules could be associated with the genotoxic effects of MH. The alterations observed could be related to the effects of MH on the synthesis of the proteins involved in frustule formation or in the regulation of the cytoskeleton of the diatom cells.

AB  - We collaborated with 26 groups from universities across the United States to sample 42 sites for 33 trace organic compounds (TOCs) in water and sediments of lotic ecosystems. Our goals were 1) to further develop a national database of TOC abundance in United States lotic ecosystems that can be a foundation for future research and management, and 2) to identify factors related to compound abundance. Trace organic compounds were found in 93% of water samples and 56% of sediment samples. Dissolved concentrations were 10-1000x higher relative to sediment concentrations. The ten most common compounds in water samples with detection frequency and maximum concentration were sucralose (87.5%, 12,000 ng/L), caffeine (77.5%, 420 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (70%, 340 ng/L), cotinine (65%, 130 ng/L), venlafaxine (65%, 1800 ng/L), carbamazepine (62.5%, 320 ng/L), triclosan (55%, 6800 ng/L), azithromycin (15%, 970 ng/L), diphenylhydramine (40%, 350 ng/L), and desvenlafaxine (35%, 4600 ng/L). In sediment, the most common compounds were venlafaxine (32.5%, 19 ng/g), diphenhydramine (25%, 41 ng/g), azithromycin (15%, 11 ng/g), fluoxetine (12.5%, 29 ng/g) and sucralose (12.5%, 16 ng/g). Refractory compounds such as sucralose may be good indicators of TOC contamination in lotic ecosystems, as there was a correlation between dissolved sucralose concentrations and with the total number of compounds detected in water. Discharge and human demographic (population size) characteristics were not good predictors of compound abundance in water samples. This study further confirms the ubiquity of TOCs in lotic ecosystems. Although concentrations measured rarely approached acute aquatic-life criteria, the chronic effects, bioaccumulative potential, or potential mixture effects of multiple compounds are relatively unknown.

AB  - The aim of this study was to better understand the inflection point of RT and BSTs and measure different body surface temperatures (BSTs) under different temperature-humidity index (THI) conditions. A total of 488 Holstein dairy cows were chosen to manually measure rectal temperature (RT) and BSTs including left side of eye, ear, cheek, forehead, flank, rump, fore udder, and rear udder by infrared thermography for 14 times. Those measurements included six times under high THI (THI>78), three times under moderate THI (72THI78), and five times under low THI (THI<72). Results showed that BSTs were affected by THI conditions (P<0.01). The THI conditions where mean and maximum forehead temperatures started to increase rapidly (71.4 and 66.8) were lower than that where RT started to increase rapidly (74.1). The correlation coefficients of mean and maximum forehead temperatures to THI were 0.808 and 0.740, and were 0.557 and 0.504 to RT, all showing the highest as compared to other region temperatures with THI and RT, respectively. Thus, we conclude that BSTs are more sensitive to thermal environment than RT, suggesting the variability of BST to reflect body core temperature. In addition, the forehead is a relatively reliable region to assess the heat stress reflecting RT compared to the eye, ear, cheek, flank, rump, fore udder, and rear udder regions.

AB  - Various ecological and other complex dynamical systems may exhibit abrupt regime shifts or critical transitions, wherein they reorganize from one stable state to another over relatively short time scales. Because of potential losses to ecosystem services, forecasting such unexpected shifts would be valuable. Using mathematical models of regime shifts, ecologists have proposed various early warning signals of imminent shifts. However, their generality and applicability to real ecosystems remain unclear because these mathematical models are considered too simplistic. Here, we investigate the robustness of recently proposed early warning signals of regime shifts in two well-studied ecological models, but with the inclusion of time-delayed processes. We find that the average variance may either increase or decrease prior to a regime shift and, thus, may not be a robust leading indicator in time-delayed ecological systems. In contrast, changing average skewness, increasing autocorrelation at short time lags, and reddening power spectra of time series of the ecological state variable all show trends consistent with those of models with no time delays. Our results provide insights into the robustness of early warning signals of regime shifts in a broader class of ecological systems.

AB  - The faecal streptococci are the most commonly used alternative or adjunct to coliform bacteria as faecal pollution indicators. They are a group of coccoid bacteria, naturally inhabiting the gut of warm-blooded animals and humans. Their potential as faecal pollution indicators was recognised in the 1890s, but it was 50 years before the accumulated knowledge of their taxonomy and sanitary significance, together with the development of isolation and enumeration methods, allowed their practical application in water pollution research and management. There is still much disagreement over the classification of the group. Many workers now place some species in a separate genus, Enterococcus, and it is likely that this revised nomenclature will be incorporated into the next edition of Bergey's Manual. Of the enumeration methods available (plate count, MPN, and membrane filtration), the mE-EIA membrane filtration method, which recovers enterococci (a subset of faecal streptococci) is probably the most important, because it is the basis of current United States Environmental Protection Agency recommendations on bathing water standards. However, there appears to be no universally accepted ''best method'' for the isolation of faecal streptococci from natural waters. Biochemical and serological identification methods are commercially available, and research has begun into the use of DNA-based techniques for identifying faecal streptococcal strains and faecal sources.

AB  - Regarding the obtainment of unprecedented financial means for environment protection many ambitious projects have been planned. Their successful completion is the condition of consuming the assigned UE means, fulfillment of accession commitments and, moreover, the increase of society life level and improvement of nature state.
   The largest investment of the kind are situated on the lists of individual projects. These are large projects concerning fresh water supply, sludge and trash collection, flood protection, nature protection and many others. The present experience on operating the UE funds shows that the access to financial means is not the only factor that guarantees success of a project. The fulfillment of all the administrative procedures (influence on environment assessment, constructing permissions the public orders procedures, competent managing personnel etc.), are equally important.
   In 2011, so called operational programs review will be operated. It will make possible to allocate money among specific priorities. Thus, if there is a danger that a project will not consume all the financial means assigned to it, it will open the possibility to reconstruct the formerly assumed schedules. Provided that all the previously accepted projects on Infrastructure and Environment are completed, about 10 000 km of sludge system and 20 multiregional trash processing plants will be built, and next 13 will be modernized.
   Moreover, about 25 projects of natural danger protection and about 80 projects aiming at protecting different bird, animal and plant habitation.

AB  - The heat stress index (HSI) is a new, comprehensive summer index that evaluates daily relative stress for locations throughout the United States based on deviations from the norm. The index is based on apparent temperature and other derived meteorological variables, including cloud cover, cooling degree-days, and consecutive days of extreme heat. Statistical distributions of meteorological variables are derived for 10-day periods of the annual cycle so that percentile values for each parameter can be determined. The daily percentile values for each variable are then summed, and a statistical distribution is fit to the summed frequencies. The daily HSI value is the percentile associated with the location of the daily summed value under the summation curve. The index is analyzed and spatially verified by comparing intra- and interregional results. Although stations from various climate regions have different criteria defining an excessive heat stress event, neighboring stations typically produce similar HSI results because they are usually affected by the same air mass. To test the effectiveness of the HSI, a relationship between the index results and mortality values is made. Overall, the highest mortality days are associated with the highest HSI values, but high-HSI days are not always associated with high numbers of deaths. A mortality study such as this one is just one of many potential environmental applications of the HSI. Other applications include implementing the index to correlate extreme weather conditions with resource consumption, such as electric-utility load, to determine conditions for which load levels are excessive. The ability to forecast the HSI using a variety of weather forecasting tools has also generated interest within various industries that have a need to issue weather stress advisories, watches, and warnings.

AB  - Most Great River ecosystems (GREs) are extensively modified and are not receiving adequate protection to prevent further habitat degradation and loss of biotic integrity. In the United States, ecological monitoring and assessment of GREs has lagged behind streams and estuaries, and the management of GREs is hampered by the lack of unbiased data at appropriate spatial scales. Properties of GREs that make them challenging to monitor and assess include difficult sample logistics and high habitat diversity. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) has developed a comprehensive, regional-scale, survey-based monitoring approach to assessment of streams and estuaries, but has not yet conducted research on applying these tools to GRE monitoring. In this paper we present an overview of an EMAP research project on the Upper Missouri River (UMR). We summarize the assessment objectives for the study, the design for selecting sample locations, the indicators measured at these sites and the tools used to analyze data. We present an example of the type of statements that can be made with EMAP monitoring data. With modification, the set of methodologies developed by EMAP may be well suited for assessment of GREs in general.

AB  - We developed a set of great-river macroinvertebrate indices of condition (GRMINs) for the littoral benthos of mid-continent great rivers in the US (Missouri, Upper Mississippi, and Ohio). We used a multiscale (site, reach, landscape), multimetric abiotic stressor gradient to select macroinvertebrate assemblage metrics sensitive to human disturbance. We used the same stressor gradient to derive reference expectations by empirical modeling. We developed GRMINs for each of 5 reaches: the upper Missouri River, the lower Missouri River, the unimpounded Upper Mississippi River, the impounded Upper Mississippi River, and the Ohio River. We created 2 versions of each index. One version was based on the absolute value (AV) of the correlation between invertebrate metrics and the stressor gradient and potentially included all types of metrics (e.g., diversity, composition, tolerance to pollution, feeding guild). The second version included no tolerance-value-based metrics (NTV). Each index included up to 10 metrics. The indices were reliable for general assessment of great-river aquatic conditions except in the unimpounded Upper Mississippi River. The AV and NTV versions of the GRMIN were highly correlated (r = 0.94). The indices revealed longitudinal variation in condition on great-river reaches and among-river variation in relative condition. No sites near or <100 km downriver of Kansas City, Missouri, on the Missouri River or Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, on the Upper Mississippi River were in least-disturbed condition. GRMIN indices are an indicator of biotic response to general human disturbance. They are appropriate for local and regional-scale ecological assessments and long-term monitoring.

AB  - Phenanthrene is a tricyclic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and environmental contaminant found in high concentrations around urban catchments and in the vicinity of oil extraction activities. Fish exposed to phenanthrene can exhibit altered reproductive hormone profiles and/or differences within gonadosomatic index and altered gamete proportions, but the mechanisms underlying these changes are not fully understood. In this study, we conducted a sub-chronic bioassay and measured transcriptional responses in the liver, the major tissue involved in generating lipids for oocyte growth. Adult male and female fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) were exposed to an average measured concentration of 202 mu g phenanthrene/L for a 7 week period. Condition factor was reduced in both males and females, while female fish also showed decreased gonadosomatic index relative to control females. In females exposed to phenanthrene, perinucleolar proportions were increased similar to 1.9-fold relative to the control group whereas the proportions of vitellogenic oocytes decreased similar to 8.8-fold. In males exposed to phenanthrene, spermatogonia proportions were increased similar to 2.3 fold in testicular tissues compared to control fish. Thus, gametes were at an earlier stage of maturation in phenanthrene-treated fish compared to controls. However, no differences were detected in the production of 17 beta-estradiol or testosterone from the gonad in either sex. Catalase activity was also assessed in the liver as a measure of oxidative stress and this biomarker did not change in activity in either sex. In addition to endpoints in the ovary, the female hepatic transcriptome was measured, as this tissue produces lipids for oocyte maturation. Transcriptomic responses to phenanthrene exposure suggested a reduction in vitellogenin mRNA, and lipid metabolism and immune system pathways. Comparisons of hepatic transcriptome responses with Part A (72 h phenanthrene exposure) showed that energy homeostasis pathways were consistently altered following phenanthrene exposure over multiple durations and concentrations. We suggest that altered energy homeostasis may be adversely affecting reproductive efforts, as impaired reproduction has been observed in other studies investigating polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

AB  - Maize grain yield is determined by genotype (G), environment (E) and G x E interaction effects that influence the expression of traits along the crop cycle. Inbreds and hybrids may differ in their responses to fluctuations in environmental conditions, determining changes in heterosis levels across environments and consequently the target environment for their evaluation. The objectives of this work were (i) to compare traits related to grain yield, aboveground biomass production and its partitioning in two contrasting genotypic groups (inbreds and hybrids) and (ii) to analyze their performance across environments for the assessment of their phenotypic plasticity as well as environmental effects on the expression of heterosis. We built a balanced environmental index based on normalized plant grain yield (BEINPGY) from 14 contrasting environments using a 6-inbred complete diallel mating design and analyzed the response of the 12 evaluated traits to this index for each genotypic group. This approach allowed us to (i) differentiate among traits with simple linear (grain yield, total biomass, kernel numbers, the anthesis-silking interval and plant reproductive efficiency), bilinear (harvest index, individual kernel weight, prolificacy and apical ear reproductive efficiency) or no response (ear and plant growth rates around flowering as well as their relationship) in phenotypic plasticity of each group to the BEINPGY, and (ii) group traits depending upon their absolute heterosis response (i.e., heterosis plasticity) to the BEINPGY, which varied in sign (positive, null or negative) depending upon the trait. There was a clear and positive relationship between absolute heterosis plasticity and traits plasticities, which was mainly driven by hybrids. Genotypic groups differed in the association patterns of traits values per se as well as of their phenotypic plasticities, indicative of the different genetic bases that determine them. The fact that percent heterosis for grain yield and other relevant secondary traits did not vary across environments, whereas heritability is expected to decrease under stressful conditions, may contribute to guide future breeding efforts aiming to develop superior hybrids with successful performance, particularly in future challenging environmental scenarios.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is considered to be one of the most toxic and ubiquitously distributed metals in the aquatic system. Meanwhile, the temperature increase of water bodies due to global climatic changes, may affect ecosystems through alterations of the metal properties or by affecting the susceptibility of organisms. To study the physiological stress of mercury chloride on grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella at different temperatures, we investigated the effects of water temperature and/or mercury chloride (HgCl2) on growth performance (SGR-the specific growth rate, HSI-hepato-somatic index, CF-condition factor) and the thyroid hormones levels (T3-triiodothyronine; T4-thyroxine), as well as the expression levels of related genes involved growth and hypothalamusepituitaryethyroid (HPT) axis. Fish (45.37 +/- 3.58 g) were acclimated to 15, 20, 25, 30 or 35 degrees C and co-exposed to 0.0 or 0.039 mg/L HgCl2 for 4 weeks in triplicates. Three-way ANOVA revealed that all variables were significantly affected by water temperature, HgCl2 exposure, exposure time and their interactions. It was found that fish reared in Hg-free group at 25 degrees C showed the optimum growth. Otherwise, T4 concentrations were decreased, while T3 levels remained constant following exposure to HgCl2, which was explained by the up-regulation of the dio2 gene. Our data provide evidences that increased temperatures can potentiate HgCl2 toxicity, but the exact mechanism of the effects of temperature coupled HgCl2 on fish is not full clear, which should be give more attention in future.

AB  - Bemisia tabaci, a vector of cotton leaf curl virus disease, is among the most devastating pests causing huge economic losses due to reduced cotton yield and quality. The excessive use of chemical pesticides causes insecticide resistance. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPFs) have a role as mycoinsecticides. The combined use of these insecticides is a promising pest-control option to minimize adverse chemical effects. Thus, we have evaluated 10 EPFs under polyhouse conditions for their virulence against whitefly nymphs and their compatibility with chemical and botanical insecticides. The highest overall biological efficacy index was recorded with Ij-102, followed by Bb-4511, and Ij-089. An in vitro compatibility study was conducted to evaluate the effect of botanical and chemical pesticides on mycelial growth and spore production using the poisoned food technique. The effect of pesticides on the reduction of mycelial growth and conidial production ranged from -169 to 94.1% and -25.6 to 87.6%, respectively. However, Ij-089, Ij-102, Ma-1299, and Bb-4511 were found to be the most compatible with the chemical and botanicals evaluated. Comparatively, spiromesifen, diafenthiuron, buprofezin, pyriproxyfen, and flonicamid were more compatible with EPFs at half doses, as compared to the other chemical pesticides, namely imidacloprid, fipronil, profenophos, and triazophos. These results might provide the basis for future work and indicate that applications of EPFs showing the best virulence and compatibility have the maximum likelihood for the management of B. tabaci in the field in an integrated pest management system.

AB  - A direct, eco-friendly, stability-indicating GC method was developed for the determination of Lacosamide (LCM) in tablet dosage forms in presence of its degradation products as well as in human urine in presence of the co-administered drug Zonisamide (ZON). The assay method in tablets was validated according to the ICH guidelines, while the method for determination of LCM in urine was validated according to FDA; Bioanalytical Method Validation guidance. Linear response (r = 0.9998) was observed over the range of 20-280 mu g/mL of LCM, with detection and quantitation limits of 5.871 and 19.57 mu g/mL, respectively for the tablet assay method. While (r = 0.9999) was observed over the range of 0.5-20 mu g/mL of LCM, with detection and quantitation limits of 67 and 233 ng mL(-1), respectively for the urine analysis method. Under various stress conditions, the investigation of LCM forced degradation behaviour was carried out. Furthermore, monitoring of the drug in urine followed by construction of its urine profile was done after the administration of 50 mg tablet of LCM to three healthy volunteers so as to prove the ability of the method to be applied in assaying LCM in human urine. The method showed also successful separation of LCM and the co-administered drug ZON in urine. Finally, the greenness of the method was assessed using National Environmental Methods Index label and Eco scale methods.

Cultivars had significant effect on plant height at the 0.05 probability. The number of pods per plant and the number of seeds per pod were significantly influenced by cultivars. Cultivars had no significant effect on 1000-seed weight, biological yield, harvest index, seed yield, oil yield and oil percentage. All differences between cultivars about oil percentage were not significant, and no significant trend was found. The maximum oil yield was related to NK Aviator. The maximum and minimum seed yield was achieved in cultivation of Modena and Tassilo, respectively. Modena obtained the maximum biological yield (19310 kg/ha), but its difference with other cultivars was not significant.

AB  - Tailwaters downstream of hypolimnetic-release hydropeaking dams exhibit a unique combination of stressors that affects the structure and function of resident fish assemblages. We developed a statistically and biologically defensible multimetric index of fish assemblages for the Caney Fork River below Center Hill Dam, Tennessee. Fish assemblages were sampled at five sites using boat-mounted and backpack electrofishing gear from fall 2009 through summer 2011. A multivariate statistical approach was used to select metrics that best reflected the downstream gradients in abiotic variables. Five metrics derived from boat electrofishing samples and four metrics derived from backpack electrofishing samples were selected for incorporation into the index based on their high correlation with environmental data. The nine metrics demonstrated predictable patterns of increase or decrease with increasing distance downstream of the dam. The multimetric index generally exhibited a pattern of increasing scores with increasing distance from the dam, indicating a downstream recovery gradient in fish assemblage composition. The index can be used to monitor anticipated changes in the fish communities of the Caney Fork River when repairs to Center Hill Dam are completed later this decade, resulting in altered dam operations.

AB  - Most indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) are designed to represent the biological condition of individual sampling locations in a river or stream. Characterizing the biological condition of an entire stream is often of interest and requires data from multiple sites. The representativeness of these data depends on the variability in the scores between sampling locations. We compared the variability in IBI scores using two parameters whose values can be obtained easily - stream size and ecoregion. The variability in IBI scores tended to be greater in smaller Wisconsin streams (first and second order) than in larger ones (third and fourth order) but there was no difference in the variability between ecoregions. Thus, in order to confidently characterize the true mean IBI score for a smaller stream, essentially a census of the entire stream would be required. In order to confidently characterize the mean IBI score of a larger stream, approximately six scores are necessary, which is equivalent to one station per 2 km of stream given the mean length of third and fourth order streams in Wisconsin.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires European Union Member States to monitor the ecological quality of their water bodies through the responses of key biological compartments to anthropogenic alteration in the aquatic environment. French Guiana is a French overseas department located in the Amazonian part of South America. Despite its geographical remoteness, this department is a European territory like all the other French overseas departments and is therefore subjected to the requirements of the WFD. Previous work over the past decade, especially on benthic diatoms, have led to the development of several new biological indices specifically adapted to the biogeographic conditions (geological substrates, climate, local fauna and flora) of each of these overseas territories. However, work has progressed at a slower rate on the diatoms of French Guiana, due to the particular natural conditions that lead to very specific and still largely unknown diatomic communities.
   Since no convenient local system was available, an evaluation system based on a local adaptation of a generalist diatom index (SPI) has been previously set up to assess the ecological state of French Guiana's watercourses, despite obvious weaknesses linked to the biogeographical mismatch of the ecological profiles of many taxa. The increase in the quantity of data gathered through Guyanese monitoring networks over the past 9 years, as well as the progress made on diatom taxonomy, allowed the development of the new French Guiana Diatomic Index (FGDI) presented in this paper. A methodology adapted to the Guyanese context has been developed based on (i) a reduction in the number of taxa taken into account in diatom communities and on (ii) the search for alert taxa in a multimetric approach. The FGDI allows a relevant and consistent ecological status evaluation of French Guiana's streams based on benthic diatoms following the WFD framework and, due to its multimetric construction, it also allows a comprehensive ecological diagnosis which will be of great benefit for water managers.

AB  - Body condition indices not only are often used as reliable indicators of the nutritional status of individuals but also can they be utilized to provide insights regarding food availability and habitat quality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the connection between the body condition of the demersal species and the environmental features in the water column (i.e. the hydrographic conditions and the potential trophic resources) in two proximate areas, the north and south regions of the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean), viz., the Balearic sub-basin (BsB) and the Algerian sub-basin (AsB), respectively, with different geomorphological and hydrodynamic features. Body condition indices were calculated for individuals of 21 demersal species including 11 teleosts, 4 elasmobranchs, 3 cephalopods and 3 crustaceans, which represented >70-77% of the deep water resources, captured by bottom trawling. The morphometric indices, viz., Relative Condition Index (Kn) and Standardised Residuals (SR) from the length-weight relationship, were used. The results for each one of the 21 species indicated a significantly better condition in terms of Kn and SR in the BsB, for 7 and 9 species, respectively. In addition, a general model, including the 21 species together, showed better body condition in the BsB, and during the summer. The spatial and temporal differences in the body condition are discussed in the context of the environmental variables characterising both the study areas, which showed significant variations, for some of the hydrographic features (chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, salinity, potential density and temperature), as well as for some of the potential trophic resources (mesopelagic and epibenthic fauna). These findings suggest an environmental effect on the body condition of the deep-water resources in the Balearic Islands, one of the most oligotrophic areas of the western Mediterranean, and reveal more suitable environmental conditions for these species on the northern insular margin, off the Archipelago. In addition to these ecological connections, the results also hold interest for the management and conservation of the habitats essential for the sustainability of fisheries. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The relation of fish community composition to riparian cover at two spatial scales was compared at 18 streams in the agricultural Minnesota River Basin. The two spatial scales were: (1) local riparian zone (a 200 meter wide buffer extending 2 to 3 kilometers upstream of the sampling reach); and (2) the upstream riparian zone (a 200 m wide buffer on the mainstem and all perennial tributaries upstream of the sampling reach). Analysis of variance indicated that streams with wooded-local riparian zones had greater fish species richness (means = 20 and 15, respectively) and Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) scores (means = 40 and 26, respectively) than streams with open-local riparian zones. Streams with wooded-upstream riparian zones tended (were not statistically significant) to have greater numbers of species (means = 19 and 15, respectively) and IBI scores (means = 33 and 28, respectively) than streams with open-upstream riparian zones. There was no significant interaction between the riparian zone conditions at the two scales. This study suggests that maintenance of wooded riparian cover along streams could be effective in maintaining or improving fish community composition in streams draining heavily agricultural areas.

AB  - Microorganisms make a significant contribution to reef ecosystem health and resilience via their critical role in mediating nutrient transformations, their interactions with macro-organisms and their provision of chemical cues that underpin the recruitment of diverse reef taxa. However, environmental changes often cause compositional and functional shifts in microbial communities that can have flow-on consequences for microbial-mediated processes. These microbial alterations may impact the health of specific host organisms and can have repercussions for the functioning of entire coral ecosystems. Assessing changes in reef microbial communities should therefore provide an early indicator of ecosystem impacts and would underpin the development of diagnostic tools that could help forecast shifts in coral reef health under different environmental states. Monitoring, management and active restoration efforts have recently intensified and diversified in response to global declines in coral reef health. Here we propose that regular monitoring of coral reef microorganisms could provide a rapid and sensitive platform for identifying declining ecosystem health that can complement existing management frameworks. By summarising the most common threats to coral reefs, with a particular focus on the Great Barrier Reef, and elaborating on the role of microbes in coral reef health and ecosystem stability, we highlight the diagnostic applicability of microbes in reef management programs. Fundamental to this objective is the establishment of microbial baselines for Australia's coral reefs.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the AQUATOX model and to suggest a methodology for its practical use as an ecological toxicity model in Korea. Paldang reservoir was selected as the study area, and the BASINS/WinHSPF watershed model was used in conjunction with AQUATOX model to provide a linked simulation of the Paldang watershed. The AQUATOX model was run based on the simulation results of WinHSPF. AQUATOX was used to perform an analysis of the ecological state and characteristics of the Paldang reservoir and the ecological impact of toxicants; alachlor, paraquat, and copper sulfate. In the case of alachlor, which has been classified as a second-degree toxic material for fish, the biomass of minnow and bass declined considerably when the inflow concentration was above 100 mu g/L. In the case of paraquat, the biomass of minnow and bass declined significantly when the inflow concentration was 10 mu g/L. Biomass of daphnia and bluegill was significantly decreased due to the copper sulfate. The AQUATOX model could be considered to be applicable to water bodies in Korea and can be used with existing watershed models to determine the total maximum daily load (TMDL). Seasonal or monthly ecological monitoring data of common species should be provided to increase its feasibility.

AB  - This study examines the ecological state of epilithic diatom assemblages along the lower stretch of Mandakini, a glacier-fed Himalayan river. The diatoms were sampled at four stations during winter and summer, only once in each season. Valve counts were obtained from Naphrax mounts prepared from each sample. Assemblages were recorded for each location. The software OMNIDIA Ver. 5.3 was used for computing the ecological values from the sample counts. Normally Achnanthidium spp. dominated the assemblages, except Nitzschia fonticola (Grunow) at S1 (Kund) and Encyonema minutum (Hilse in Rabh) at S4 (Rudraprayag), only during summer. The ecological values revealed that the assemblages were in beta-mesosaprobic and mesotraphentic states. However, at S4, trophic state was observed to be eutraphentic. Louis Leclercq index indicated that organic pollution was nonexistent, while the anthropogenic eutrophication was low except at S2 (Tilwara) and S3 (Medanpur) in summer and was moderate at S4 in winter characterized by a lean flow. The most abundant indicator taxa for anthropogenic eutrophication are varied; Cymbella tumida (Brebisson-Van Heurck) at S1, Encyonema minutum at S2, S4 while Surirella aungusta (Kutzing) at S3. Ordination showed that the taxa indicating degradation and anthropogenic eutrophication figured as characteristic taxa at respective locations.

AB  - The draining of mires for silvicultural purposes has caused one of the most dramatic changes in the landscape during the last century in Finland. To study the effects of mire drainage, carabid beetle assemblages were sampled using pitfall trapping in three different mire habitat types. Carabids were sampled from mires in their natural state, drained mires and drained mires with an open power line to see whether the cleared power line can serve as an alternative habitat for mire dependent carabids. The draining of mires greatly increases the species richness of the carabid assemblages. Yet, the conservation value of the environment has dropped following the draining, since only common and abundant forest carabids have benefited from human impact. The role of the open power line as an alternative habitat for mire specialists remains questionable. A few carabid species have, however, benefited from the open habitat of the power line. The vegetation structure had a significant effect in determining the compositions of the carabid assemblages on the studied habitat types. It seems that mire dwelling carabids cannot survive on the drained mires, unless at least some characteristics, other than the mere openness of the cleared power lines, of natural mires remain.

AB  - The reproductive biology of Arca noae (L.) was investigated to assess its aquaculture potential and exploitation as a sustainable fishery. A. noae was sampled monthly from Mali Ston Bay, south Adriatic Sea, from November 2001 to October 2002 and from January to December 2004. A total of 590 individuals ranging in shell length from 9.7 to 80.8 mm was analyzed using standard histological techniques.
   Results indicate that males dominate small shell length categories with females becoming more predominant as size increases suggesting that some individuals may undergo protandric development. The overall male to female ratio was 1.0 : 1.3 (chi(2) = 9.529, p =0.002). A number (2.2%) of hermaphroditic animals were also identified. The smallest sexually mature A. noae had a shell length of 12 mm. Gametogenic development began in October (female) and November (male), with spawning occurring during summer (July to August). Results of a size frequency analysis of oocyte diameters agreed with a qualitative analysis of gonadal development stages, confirming the occurrence of one annual spawning peak. There was no correlation between mean gonad index and environmental conditions. Data on the reproductive characteristics of A. noae obtained in this study give an insight into the biology of this species and are crucial for initiating its aquaculture.

AB  - Native plant community (NPC) classifications typically require on-site visits and in-depth observations by trained ecologists. The goal is to identify unique floristic and environmental characteristics indicative of a particular plant community, ecosystem, or demographic condition. Such data are often desired to inform management decisions on sustainable timber and ecosystem services production over local to large landscapes. Yet, the time and funding needed to identify, assess, catalogue, and map these communities is often limited. Lacking these classifications, we rely on imprecise determinations of the pievarence of various NPCs. Further, extrapolating statewide NPC extent from previously imputed classifications for state managed stands is difficult without a representative sampling design including all ownerships. As a solution to the NPC sample coverage limitation, we describe an extension of a previously reported imputation model to provide the desired statewide classifications and corresponding estimates of the ecological landscape state indicator provided by NPC extent.
   First, NPC observations from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) Division of Ecological and Water Resources for 1964-2015 were linked with MNDNR Forest Inventory Management (FIM) stand data to provide a set of observed polygons for training the imputation model. Then, USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot data, were associated with the observed stands to provide NPC classifications for a subset of plots (e.g., training plots) contained in the FIA database for Minnesota. NPC information was then linked to forest inventory and physiographic layers via spatial association techniques in a geographic information system. Soils data describing drainage, productivity, thickness of the rooting zone, and land position were also used. Finally, validation of resulting imputed classifications shows that application of the model to the statewide FIA inventory will result in an error rate between 8% and 30% with a mean of 83% of imputations correct at the class level.
   We then updated the publicly accessible FIA database for Minnesota with imputed NPC classifications and scripted labeling schemes integrated with the EVALIDator report building tool to produce estimates of forestland extent. Here, we focus on estimates of NPC class by FIA Survey Unit and inventory year. Finally, quantified estimates of landscape state (e.g., NPC extent and condition) are enabled for inventories ending between 1977 and 2014. Imputed data from this series of statewide inventories enables the analysis of landscape change, and facilitates strategic planning to move the bioregional landscape in a desired ecological direction, or to provide specific ecosystem services.

AB  - The lower Wolf River, flowing 164 km from the Shawano Dam to Lake Poygan in east-central Wisconsin, is one of the least degraded large warmwater floodplain river reaches remaining in the United States. Seine and electrofishing samples were collected during 1997-2001 to characterize patterns of fish species composition and biotic integrity. Nearly 14,000 fish in 69 species were collected including the channel shiner Notropis wickliffi, which had not been reported before from the Great Lakes basin. Species distributions and multivariate measures of assemblage composition showed few consistent longitudinal patterns, but there were lateral differences between off-channel and main-channel habitats. Of the 40 most common species, 31 varied in abundance or distribution between main- and off-channel habitats, but only 10 species differed between upstream and downstream segments of the study reach. Index of biotic integrity scores based on main-channel fish assemblages indicated that the overall environmental quality of the study reach was good and that biotic integrity did not vary longitudinally. However, scores from survey sites with natural shorelines were significantly higher than scores from that included rock rip-rap.

AB  - The characteristic ecological risk of Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb metals in sediment sampled from an estuary (Sambreiro River) in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria was assessed with the application of some pollution indices and multivariate analysis under quality-controlled conditions. Concentration of Cd and Cr in the stations was in the trend: Cd - St2 > St4 >St1 > St5 > St9 > St8 > St6 > St3 > St10, Cr - St2 > St7 > St5 > St9 > St4 > St8 > St3 > St10 > St1. The relationship between Effects range low- Effects range median (ERL-ERM) and environmental concentration of the metals [M] showed adverse effect occurring occasionally on the sediment biological (i.e. ERL <= [M] < ERM) is in the order: St2 > St4 > St1 > St5 > St9 > St8 > St6 > St7 for Cd, only St2 for Cr, and St3 for Pb; while other stations revealed minimal effect (i.e. [M] < ERL) for Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb. The values of mean Effects range median Quotient (m-ERM-Q) indicate that St1, St2, St4, St5, St6 and St9 had 21% probability of toxicity; while St3, St7, St8 and St10 had 9% probability of being toxic. The percentage potential ecological risk factor (%) for the metals across the stations correspond to Cd (70.55) > Pb (22.74) > Ni (4.27) > Cr (2.43); indicating the contribution of Cd as highest to the degree of an ecological risk index for the studied river. Multivariate analysis determined that the possible source of metals in this study location was from the boats manufacturing and fabrication activities taking place in the some of the stations.

AB  - Studies focusing on gametophytic competition have focused on differences in pollen performance (e.g., pollen germination rate and pollen tube growth rate) among donors in order to examine genetic sources of variation in siring success among them. Donors that produce the fastest growing pollen tubes are expected to fertilize more ovules relative to donors with slow growing pollen tubes under conditions of gametophyic competition. However,the performance of pollen in the field is known to be influenced by environmental conditions in addition to the genotype of donor planes. This field study of Faramea occidentalis was conducted to: (1) determine the effect of environmental conditions during pollination on pollen performance; (2) measure differences among pollen donors in pollen performance; (3) determine if the pollen of different donors responds differently to a variety of environmental conditions surrounding pollinated flowers; and (4) measure differences among pollen recipients in pollen performance. Single-donor crosses were made between four pollen donors and four pollen recipients under a variety of environmental conditions. Pollen performance was then quantified as the growth rate of the fastest pollen tube, the mean pollen tube growth rate, and by a pollen germination index. Pollination environment (the environment surrounding a pollinated flower) and recipient significantly affected all three measures of pollen performance. Pollen donors did not differ overall in pollen performance. However, there was significant among-donor variation in two of the five pollination environment conditions. Future studies of variation in relative siring success may benefit by considering pollination environment in addition to donor and recipient identity.

AB  - This study investigates the free vibration of a moderately thick rectangular plate, which is composed of functionally graded materials and floating on incompressible fluid. Material properties are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction according to a simple power law distribution in terms of the volume fraction of the constituent. The governing equations of the plate are analytically derived based on the first-order shear deformation theory with consideration of rotational inertial effects and transverse shear stresses. Applied pressure on the free surface of the plate is obtained by the velocity potential function together with Bernoulli's equation. The equation governing on the oscillatory behaviour of the fluid is obtained by solving Laplace equation with satisfying the boundary conditions. The natural frequencies and shape modes of the rectangular plate are determined by decoupling and solving the motion equations system. Then, analyses of the numerical results of free vibrations and the effects of the different parameters such as thickness to length of the plate, boundary conditions, fluid density, index of volume fraction and the height of the fluid on the frequencies are investigated. Finally, the results of this research in limit case is compared and validated with the results of other researchers and finite element model.

AB  - Relationships among agronomic traits and grain yield were investigated in 56 genotypes of durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.). The results indicated the presence of sufficient variability nearly for all measured traits. Heritability and expected genetic gain varied among traits. Aboveground biomass, harvest index, and spike number were the most grain yield-influencing traits. Early genotypes showed above-average grain and biological yields, spike number, and lower canopy temperature. Assessed genotypes were clustered into three groups which differed mainly for biological, economical, straw, and grain yields, on the one hand, and plant height, chlorophyll content, and canopy temperature, on the other hand. Selection for direct use from clusters carrying best combinations of yield-related traits and crosses to be made between genotypes belonging to contrasted clusters were suggested to generate more variability. Selection preferentially for spike number, biological yield, harvest index, and canopy temperature to accumulate favorable alleles in the selected entries for future uses is suggested.

AB  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulagaris L.) is mainly produced in Latin America, and Eastern and Southern Africa where seasonal rainfall is erratic and soil moisture deficit often limits its production. The objectives of this study were to identify superior advanced small red common bean lines with better grain yield under drought, and to identify plant traits that could serve as selection criteria for evaluating drought resistance. Thirty four advanced inbred lines were developed through triple cross and evaluated with two commercial checks (Nasir and Red Wolayita) under drought and irrigated field conditions in two seasons (2009 and 2010) and at two locations (Melkassa and Doni Kumbi Farm) in Ethiopia. Grain yield, pods/plant, seeds/plant and 100 seed weight were reduced by 47, 19, 15, and 9 %, respectively, under the drought conditions compared to the irrigated conditions. Seven genotypes (L62, L5, L20, L79, L12, L41, and L83) had better yield under drought compared to the standard check. Similarly, these genotypes had better predicted genotypic effects, suggesting that they would also be useful as drought resistant donors in common bean cultivar development program. Genotypic variance expressed as proportions to phenotypic variance was higher compared to genotype x environment interaction effects for all traits under drought conditions, suggesting that these genotypes can be used to further improve drought-resistance regardless of environments. Strong correlation between grain yield, canopy biomass and harvest index across environments suggested that canopy biomass and harvest index are repeatable and reliable plant traits to determine drought resistance in common bean.

AB  - 1. Indicators are crucial to many socio-political schemes for portraying environmental influences of society. For example, the OECD model for State of the Environment Reporting uses three different sorts of indicators (pressure, condition, response) to differentiate the present condition of the environment from the anthropogenic pressures upon it and from any societal responses made to alleviate those pressures (thereby improving aspects of the overall condition).
   2. These sorts of indicators have a fundamental technical basis in the science supporting their exposition and usage. However, the criteria used in interpreting the indicator values are likely to be set by considerations that go beyond scientific grounds. That is, indicators are socially determined in the end. However, many scientists find it difficult to involve the public in such reporting.
   3. Scientists who are uncomfortable with this non-technical use of their indicator constructs should recognize that it is merely another manifestation of the overall broadening of environmental concern termed 'ecosystem health'. The emerging field of ecosystem health seeks to take our technical understanding of how the environment functions and combine it with socio-economic goals, using a human health metaphor and an ethical underpinning.
   4. River health might be better served by adopting a veterinary approach rather than the model of human health. This is because, like animals, riverine environments come in many different forms and cannot complain of ill health. Desirable interventions will vary with the uses to which we wish to put a river and our reasons for being concerned about a river's health. A framework for this diagnostic approach is presented.
   5. An enormous challenge lies ahead in integrating the various measurements of riverine attributes that might together constitute 'river health'. We need ways to cater for the pluralism of modern societies, and we need more dynamic assessments of river condition, possibly founded on studies of key ecological processes.

AB  - Safeguarding groundwater from civil, agricultural and industrial contamination is matter of great interest in water resource management. During recent years, much legislation has been produced stating the importance of groundwater as a source for drinking water supplies, underlining its vulnerability and defining the required quality standards. Thus, schematic tools, able to characterise the quality and quantity of groundwater systems, are of very great interest in any territorial planning and/or water resource management activity.
   This paper proposes a groundwater quality classification method which has been applied to a real aquifer, starting from several studies published by the Italian National Hydrogeologic Catastrophe Defence Group (GNDCI).
   The methodology is based on the concentration values of several parameters used as indexes of the natural hydro-chemical water condition and of potential man-induced modifications of groundwater quality. The resulting maps, although representative of the quality, do not include any information on its evolution in time. In this paper, this "stationary" classification method has been improved by crossing the quality classes with three indexes of temporal behaviour during recent years. It was then applied to data from monitoring campaigns, performed in spring and autumn, from 1990 to 1996, in the plain of Modena aquifer (central Italy). The results are reported in the form of space-time classification table and maps.

AB  - Currently, interest is growing in evaluating stream functional integrity while river assessment schemes are still exclusively based on structural indicators determined from various aquatic communities. Although some approaches relying on macroinvertebrate functional groups and combinations of traits have been advocated as means to assess ecosystem function, there has been no attempt to test the reliability of these methods with any direct functional indicator even though litter breakdown has been recently proposed as a functional indicator of stream impairment. The purpose of this study was to compare nine benthic macroinvertebrate-based structural metrics with functional metrics based on leaf litter breakdown in coarse and fine mesh bags in nine streams distributed along a eutrophication gradient. In coarse mesh bags, a 10-fold drop in breakdown rate of alder litter indicated a high sensitivity of this functional indicator to the deleterious effects of ammonium and its associated products, ammonia and nitrite. In contrast, microbial breakdown measured in fine mesh bags did not vary substantially along the gradient. Taxonomic and functional structures of macroinvertebrate assemblages were altered in the most eutrophic streams, as shown by drops in IBGN (French biotic index), BMWP (Britain biotic index) and EPTC (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Coleoptera) richness. Shredder richness and an ecological diversity index calculated from functional groups defined from multiple trait combinations exhibited the highest correlation with litter breakdown rate. Our results indicate that indirect assessment of stream functional integrity by structural indicators is realistic but requires specific metrics not necessarily based on traits or functional groups. Leaf litter breakdown is confirmed as a reliable indicator for direct assessment of streams impacted by eutrophication.

AB  - The accessibility of islands can be largely improved with fixed link to the mainland by the construction of sea cross bridges and tunnels, which results in a rapid increase of tourists and economic income. Meanwhile the accelerated increase of built-up land will change the island land use deeply. As the main anthropogenic disturbance, the rapid change of land use and increase of tourists will set further pressure on the ecological vulnerability of islands. It is urgent to derive the threshold of anthropogenic influence on the island with fixed link to the mainland. Island Ecological Vulnerability Index (IEVI) is used to evaluate the ecological vulnerability of Zhujiajian Island. Land use and tourists change in the next 20 years is simulated to estimate the change of island ecological vulnerability. The main results are: 1) The ecosystem of Zhujiajian Island is in good condition now, with limited area at moderate and severe vulnerable status; 2) With the rapid increase of anthropogenic disturbance, the ecological vulnerability of the island tends to increase. During the research period 2015-2035 the area of severe vulnerability increases by 78%, and the area of mild vulnerability increases by 201 ha (33%). One third of the non-vulnerable area becomes vulnerable; 3) Based on the prediction of ecological vulnerability, the threshold of tourists in Zhujiajian Island is about 16 million per year. The upper limit of built up area is 2500 ha, which means 90% is already used. With the improvement of management effectiveness and waste treatment capacity, the island's anthropogenic disturbance threshold can be raised. The vulnerability based anthropogenic disturbance threshold analysis can provide a basis for viable island ecosystem management strategies.

AB  - Individual specialization is widespread among wild populations. While its fitness consequences are central in predicting the ecological and evolutionary trajectories of populations, they remain poorly understood. Long-term individual foraging specializations occur in male Antarctic (Arctocephalus gazella) and Australian (A. pusillus doriferus) fur seals. Strong selective pressure is expected in these highly dimorphic and polygynous species, raising the question of the fitness payoffs associated with different foraging strategies. We investigated the relationship between individual isotopic niche (a proxy of foraging specialization), body size and condition, and an index of reproductive success (harem size) in territorial males. Individuals varied greatly in their skin and fur isotopic values reflecting a range of foraging strategies within the two populations. However, in both species, isotopic niche was not correlated to body size, condition or mating success (R-2 / p < 0.06). Furthermore, no foraging niche was predominant in either species, which would have indicated a substantial long-term fitness benefit of a particular strategy via a higher survival rate. These results suggest that the fitness consequences of a foraging strategy depend not only on the quality of prey and feeding habitat but also on an individual's hunting efficiency and skills.

AB  - The utility of an index of biotic integrity (IBI) depends on its ability to distinguish anthropogenic effects on biota amid natural biological variability. To enhance this ability, we examined fish assemblage data from least-disturbed stream sites in Virginia to determine the best way to regionally stratify natural variation in candidate IBI metrics and their scoring criteria. Specifically, we examined metric variation among physiographic regions, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ecoregions, and drainage basins to judge their utility as regions in which to develop and use distinct versions of the IBI for Virginia warmwater streams. Statewide, metrics differed most among physiographic regions thus, we recommend their use as IBI regions. Largest differences were found for taxonomic metrics between coastal plain and mountain sites, particularly in numbers of native minnow (Cyprinidae), sunfish (Centrarchidae), and darter (Percidae) species. Trophic and reproductive metrics also differed between coastal plain and more-upland streams, presumably reflecting differences in functional adaptations of fishes to upland versus lowland stream habitats. We suggest three preliminary regional IBIs for Virginia, each having a distinctive set of taxonomic, trophic, and reproductive metrics and corresponding scoring criteria.

AB  - Efficient management of natural resources and environmental assets requires adequate assessment of natural capital on farms. Conceptual frameworks and practical measurement techniques to assess the state of natural capital assets and ecosystem services on farms are not readily available. In this paper, we propose a natural capital adjusted productivity and efficiency technique that can be used in effectively measuring the dynamics of natural capital on farms. This on-farm natural capital indicator is constructed based on the directional distance functions approach. As an empirical application, this newly devised indicator is applied to determine how soil natural capital in farm production systems changes over time. Findings from this study will aid decision making to support maintaining higher farm productivity growth in agriculture and achieving environmental sustainability.

AB  - Impacts of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems are intensifying as urban sprawl spreads across the global land base. The urban stream syndrome (USS) identifies "symptoms" associated with urban development including changes in biotic communities, hydrology, water chemistry, and channel morphology. Direct relationships between road density (as surrogate of urbanization) and indicators of the USS were identified for streams in the Toronto region. Significant negative relationships were revealed between road density and biological (fish and benthic macroinvertebrate) richness, diversity, and fish Index of Biotic Integrity scores. Significant positive relationships were found between road density and tolerant fish/benthic macroinvertbrates, benthos Family Biotic Index scores, mean summer stream temperature, stream flashiness, and several water quality variables. Analysis of biological data showed that only four fish species and a reduced number of benthic macroinvertebrate families remained at the most urbanized sites. Road density was found to be a major determinant in both the fish and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. Global climate change causes transformation in the humidification regime and, as a result, makes adjustments to economic activities and features of water use. In the context of Ukraine, against the background of climate change, the runoff of most domestic rivers is declining, which especially in the limited period exacerbates the issue of balanced use of ecosystem services of aquatic ecosystems and prioritization of needs during resource allocation, control of rivers and establishment of their functioning.
   The purpose of the article. Recognizing the strategic importance of freshwater ecosystems in ensuring sustainable regional and national development, the study of the Southern Bug River was aimed at assessing its ecological status in order to identify sources of negative anthropogenic impact and identify general ecosystem distortions that may affect the functional integrity of the aquatic ecosystem.
   Methods. The research points on the Southern Bug River were determined by the method of randomization. The total length of the route was about 200 km. Also, the spatial location of settlements was taken into account, so that the investigated points were both upstream and downstream. Measurement of physicochemical parameters was performed by instruments: TDS-3, TDS/EC/Temp-meter HM COM-100, pH-meter Ezodo 6011A. The task of hydrobiological research was to find and identify species at the family level. The research was conducted at the end of July 2020, when the river entered to low flow phase.
   Results. On the basis of field research, the assessment of the ecological state of the Southern Bug River in the lower course (from the city of Pivdennoukrainsk) was carried out in the work. Regularities of pH dynamics and mineralization of the aquatic environment are established. The limits of the spatial influence of the Black Sea waters on the Southern Bug, the continental advance of which (upstream) almost 100 km up is due to the high level of regulation of basin runoff, have been specified. The same processes, as a consequence, affect not only biodiversity, but also the features of industrial and domestic water use. Using the stenobiontic approach, the level of ecological safety of the Southern Bug ecosystem in the lower course was assessed. Based on the obtained results of stenobioindication, the zoning of the studied area of the Southern Bug is proposed, which compares quite well with the results of pH and mineralization measurements. Only 1% of the route, which corresponds to the porous section of the river channel, was classified as a "healthy ecosystem". The closer to the mouth, the pH of the water gradually increases, which contributes to the intensification of the eutrophication process.
   Scientific novelty and practical significance. The obtained results are considered to be an integral part of future field research on the identification of sources of negative impact on the aquatic ecosystem of the Southern Bug.
   The novelty of the results obtained is a comprehensive assessment of the ecological state of the river ecosystem in the low flow period, which, in contrast to the concept of maximum permissible concentration, characterizes the state of the Southern Bug not point, but takes into account the cumulative and synergistic effects of anthropogenic impact. The latter are best manifested during the summer season, as a result of which the structure and biomass of the river's food chain change significantly.
   In addition, the analysis of the rational use of water resources of rivers allowed us to state that the modern system of environmental standards, which in particular regulate the quality of the aquatic environment, cannot ensure the preservation of river ecosystems.

AB  - Benthic diatom indices developed in the Europe Union have been widely accepted as indicators of the trophic state and water quality in freshwater ecosystems. In China, most of the benthic diatom-based indices have not been widely tested or evaluated before. For this purpose, the water quality parameters and benthic diatoms community structures at 20 sample sites in the dish lake of Nanjishan Nature Reserve in Poyang Lake were investigated in this study and 18 widely-applied diatom indices were established. The statistical results indicated that most water quality parameters including Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorus (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Chlorophyll (Chl) were highly correlated with each other at a confidence level of 0.05. Water quality sampling sites from 8 lakes could be classified into 4 groups based on the integrated comprehensive scores using principal components analysis (PCA). Monitoring sites could also be divided into 4 groups based on clustering analysis with hierarchical methods for diatom dominant species in 20 sampling sites. According to the status of water ecological health recognition and box plot analysis in different water quality groups and diatom dominant species groups, only 3 diatom indices including the Biological Diatom Index (IBD), Specific Pollution Sensitivity Index (IPS) and Louis Leclercq Diatom Index (IDSE) demonstrated good evaluation suitability and good correlation within different water quality grades at the final stage. The above results revealed that IBD, IPS and IDSE were the most suitable diatom indices for the water quality evaluation of the dish lake in the Nanjishan Nature Reserve, Lake Poyang.

AB  - As the flagship species of biodiversity protection, the giant panda has an umbrella protection function. China is committed to building a natural protection system with national parks as the main body to achieve sustainable development. In this paper, the sustainable livelihood analysis framework is used to study the livelihood of farmers in the surrounding communities of the giant panda protected land. Based on the data obtained from the field survey, the evaluation index of the natural resource dependence of the community farmers is established, and then the measurement model is constructed to analyze the main factors affecting the natural resource dependence of the communities. The results showed that: (1) The food dependence of farmers around the giant panda protected area is the highest (46.32%), followed by energy dependence (37.67%), and income dependence is the lowest (27.91%). (2) In terms of regional characteristics, the natural resource dependence of farmers is the lowest in Minshan and Qionglai, followed by Daxiangling and Xiaoxiangling, and Liangshan is the highest. (3) Physical capital has no significant effect on the natural resource dependence. The influence of human capital, natural capital, and social capital on the natural resource dependence is significant.

AB  - An adaptive thresholding algorithm combined with sensor fusion to detect sweet-peppers with high detection rates for highly variable illumination conditions is presented. The objectives were to develop an algorithm for sweet-pepper detection, robust to illumination changes, with the aim of achieving high detection rates with low false alarms, that was robust to the selected thresholds and noise coming from the camera itself. An algorithm was developed that firstly divided the image into rectangular-shaped sub-images with approximately homogenous lighting conditions. The image was then further divided into amorphous-shaped sub-images and the RGB image was transformed to a 3D natural difference index image; for each sub-image, three thresholds were adaptively calculated and applied. In a final step, morphological operations and fusion with a depth sensor were developed to reduce false positives. Intensive evaluation was conducted on a database with normal lighting conditions. Twenty-five images were found to be the minimum training set required to achieve best performances. The true-positive rate was 0.909 and the false positive rate was 0.046. Added noise up to 2% from the maximum available scale was found to have almost no influence on the performance. Validation using a second database with artificial lighting resulted with a true-positive rate of 1.00 and false-positive rate of 0.061, which suggests the importance of illumination. Fusion was critical for increasing the true-positive rate. The algorithm can also be used for detection in other crops. (C) 2015 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A total of 7563 anthropogenic litter (AL) items, grouped into twelve different typologies, were collected along 25 beaches located on the central Caribbean coast of Colombia. The average AL abundance was 6.05 items/m(2), plastic items being the most common reaching a total percentage of 88.9% with an average density of 5.38 items/m(2). Application of 3 evaluation indices, based on the AL data, placed most of the beaches into the status of unacceptable conditions of cleanness (Dirty to Extremely Dirty), and into mediocre to unsatisfactory environmental status. Hazardous anthropogenic litter (HAL), occurred in considerable amounts with hazardous items reaching a high of 7% (502 items of 7563 total items collected), and an average of 0.40 items/m(2). Beaches were statistically grouped into four specific types that ranged from beaches in good environmental conditions (Group A) to beaches in extremely adverse environmental conditions (Group D). The typology and magnitudes of AL found along the study area suggest a combination of sources that are associated with the multiple usages developed along this region's coast. Anthropogenic litter is mainly related to land-based sources, and these generating source activities can be found in nearby basins and/or on the same beaches where the litter remains. This paper proposes four key actions to specifically reduce AL, as well as an 8-step agenda to address solutions to the broader management of litter problems.

AB  - Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have become increasingly useful for conservation issues. Initially designed to predict distributions of species from incomplete datasets, SDMs may also identify environmental conditions associated with higher occurrences and abundances of widely distributed taxa. Using sighting records of 15 widely distributed mammals from French Guiana, including primates, carnivores, rodents and ungulates, we used three SDMs -based on (i) entropy, (ii) genetic algorithm, (iii) Mahalanobis distance - to investigate relationships between species occurrence and predictive variables such as vegetation, biogeographic units, climate, and disturbance index. Maximal entropy procedures resulted in more accurate projected conditions: the accuracy of the predicted distributions was higher than 90% in nine species among the 15 tested, and predicted occurrences were correlated to field-measured abundances for nine species. The Genetic algorithm implemented with GARP had lower accuracy, with predicted occurrences correlated to abundances for three species only. Finally, Mahalanobis distance had a much lower performance and failed to find any correlation between occurrences and abundances. In the case of MaxEnt modelling, since map projection summarized more appropriate environmental conditions and identified areas likely to act as sources and/or corridors, we propose to use those appropriate environmental conditions as a proxy of conductance for landscape connectivity planning. We provide evidence here that SDMs can identify not only more suitable environmental conditions, but also areas hosting higher abundances for a large set of species with key ecological roles. Further management applications of this environmental suitability index could help in designing corridors between protected areas.

AB  - Substantial declines of Pacific salmon populations have occurred over the past several decades related to large-scale anthropogenic and climatic changes in freshwater and marine environments. In the Columbia River Basin, migrating juvenile salmonids may pass as many as eight large-scale hydropower projects before reaching the ocean; however, the cumulative effects of multiple dam passages are largely unknown. Using acoustic transmitters and an extensive system of hydrophone arrays in the Lower Columbia River, we calculated the survival of yearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) passing one, two, or three dams. We applied a unique index of biological characteristics and environmental exposures, experienced by each fish individually as it migrated downstream, in order to examine which factors most influence salmonid survival. High outflow volumes led to involuntary spill in 2011 and created an environment of supersaturated dissolved gas concentrations. In this environment, migrating smolt survival was strongly influenced by barometric pressure, fish velocity, and water temperature. The effect of these variables on survival was compounded by multiple dam passages compared to fish passing a single dam. Despite spatial isolation between dams in the Lower Columbia River hydrosystem, migrating smolt appear to experience cumulative effects akin to a press disturbance. In general, Chinook salmon and steelhead respond similarly in terms of survival rates and responses to altered environmental conditions. Management actions that limit dissolved gas concentrations in years of high flow will benefit migrating salmonids at this life stage.

AB  - The article presents the concept and modes of measurement of biological diversity as well as its significance as an indicator of sustainable development and ecodevelopment. Estimation of biodiversity can be carried out on various levels of organisation of nature. The majority of currently used indicators are linked to species and ecosystem (landscape) diversity. It has been established that indicators concerning the state of the natural environment are of great importance for evaluation of fulfilment of the assumptions of sustainable development, for which the important goal should be the restriction of the rate of species extinction on Earth.

AB  - In this study, attention was concentrated on the yields of bio-oil and toxicities of heavy metals (HMs) in liquefaction residues (LRs). Liquefaction of sewage sludge (SS) or oil-tea-cake (OTC) or mixtures of SS and OTC were carried out under the condition of supercritical methanol (SCM). Results showed that the addition of OTC extraordinarily increased the yields of oil from 37.9% (SS) to 86.2% (SS+OTC). Furthermore, with the liquefaction of SS and OTC mixture, the bioavailable fraction (F1+F2) of Cd and Cu (F1+F2) was decreased from 2.47 to 1.64mg/kg and from 98.84 to 67.48mg/kg, respectively. However, the bioavailable fraction of Zn (F1+F2) increased from 122.03 to 204.69mg/kg with the liquefaction of SS. The bioavailable fraction (F1+F2) of Pb in LRs was 0%, which did not express any changes during the liquefaction process. Risk assessments of geo-accumulation index (I-geo), risk assessment code (RAC) and modified potential ecological risk index (MRI) were applied to evaluate the bioavailabilities, the potential ecological risks and the pollution levels of HMs. The results show that the OTC in SS can decrease the risk of HMs in LRs. Cd attracted many concerns for the highest risk to the environment among all of the HMs. Here, the good results obtained means that SCM liquefaction of mixture of SS and OTC could be a preferable method for SS treatment.

AB  - Ecotoxicology evolved as a scientific field as awareness of the unintended effects of anthropogenic pollutants in biota increased. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are often the focus of Arctic contaminant exposure studies because they are apex predators with high contaminant loads. While early studies focused on describing and quantifying pollutants, present-day polar bear toxicological papers often incorporate ecological variables. This systematic literature review investigates the ecological and physiological variables that have been integrated in such studies. The systematic literature search resulted in 207 papers, published between 1970 and 2016. Representation of each of the 19 polar bear subpopulations varied from 0 to 72 papers; East Greenland, Barents Sea, Southern Beaufort Sea, and Lancaster Sound had the most published research, with over 30 papers each. Samples were collected between 1881 and 2015, primarily from harvested bears (66%); most from the 1990s and 2000s. Adipose tissue, liver, and blood were the most common tissues examined, and mean number of bears analyzed per paper was 76 (range 1-691). Papers investigating temporal trends did so using a mean sample of 61 bears over a 6-year period. The frequency with which ecological and physiological variables were integrated into toxicological papers varied. Age and (or) sex was the only ecological variable(s) considered in 51% of papers. Further, a total of 37% of the papers included in the review investigated physiological effects in relation to contaminant concentrations. Of the papers, 98% dealt with contaminant exposure at the individual level, leaving population level effects largely unstudied. Solitary subadult and adult polar bears were included in 57% and 79% of the papers, respectively. Younger bears were included in fewer papers: yearlings in 20% and cubs-of-the-year in 13%. Only 12% of the papers examined reproduction relative to contaminants. Finally, body condition was included in 26% of the research papers, whereas variables related to polar bear diet were included in <= 9%. Based on our findings, we suggest future polar bear toxicology studies increase sample sizes, include more ecological variables, increase studies on family groups, and increase the applicability of studies to management and conservation by examining pollution effects on reproduction and survival.

AB  - Drought disaster is one of the major factors restricting the development of vegetation across a wide variety of environments. Monitoring the temporal and spatial dynamics of drought episodes in the study area is crucial for environmental and ecosystem conservation. This study assesses drought disaster by utilising space-based data and R programming for drought years 2003, 2007, 2012 and 2019 in the Free State Province, South Africa. Results revealed that the study area witnessed drought events in the year 2003 where March, August, September, October, November and December were more affected by drought disaster events. It was further observed that February and March were affected by extreme drought conditions in the year 2007. In year 2012, January, October, November and December, there exist moderate to severe drought conditions in the study area where some regions were more affected than the other. Finally, year 2019 witnessed variations in drought event distributions across the months with January, October and November witnessing severe to extreme drought conditions from about 0 to 30% drought values. Overall, this study shows that the 16-day Terra-MODIS composite and EVI products are sensitive to stressors associated with drought. The Vegetation Condition Monitoring Index (VCI) based on MODIS is suited for monitoring drought disasters. The technique used in this study revealed the suitability of MODIS data for assessing drought conditions and their potential environmental impacts.

AB  - Reproductive strategies vary among freshwater fishes. Information on reproductive characteristics is important for water managers' efforts to protect and recover imperiled species. We describe aspects of the reproductive ecology of Pecos Bluntnose Shiner (Notropis simus pecosensis). We determined gonadosomatic index, examined ovarian condition, and counted mature ova to determine the seasonal reproductive timing and duration of Pecos Bluntnose Shiner in the Pecos River, New Mexico. Monthly changes in gonadosomatic index, ovarian stage, and number of mature ova per female suggest that Pecos Bluntnose Shiner has a reproductive season extending from April through September, with a peak occurring in June and July. In July, 93% (n = 44) of female Pecos Bluntnose Shiner were in reproductive condition, regardless of size. The highest number of mature ova counted (1498) was observed in a 59.5-mm (standard length) female from June 2009. Peak spawning activity coincides with sustained water releases from reservoirs; these releases have higher peaks and longer duration than natural rainfall events. Results of this study provide important insight on the reproductive biology of a threatened fish and may be useful in long-term conservation planning.

AB  - Yeast biosensors have become suitable tools for the screening and detection of environmental pollutants because of their various advantages compared to other sensing technologies. On the other hand, many limitations remain with regard to their optimal performance and applicability in several contexts, such as low-concentration samples and on-site testing. This review summarizes the current state of yeast biosensors, with special focus on screening and assessment of environmental contaminants, discusses both pros and cons, and suggests steps towards their further development and effective use in the environmental assessment.

AB  - The effectiveness of Aoki's entropy production indices as ecological indicators of the trophic state is tested here under the changing hydrological conditions of Lake Trasimeno, a shallow freshwater lake in Italy. The analysis leads to a review of Aoki's indices and a definition of a new set of eutrophication indices (c. d, d') based on the entropy production per Surface unit rather than volume unit. which seem to be good ecological indicators for the trophic state of lake ecosystems. The positive correlation between these indices and the trophic state of a small set of lakes suggests that they are able to take into account the influence of the biological productivity on the whole entropy production of the systems. Moreover, the indices d and d' show a good negative linear correlation to the lake mean depth. showing the importance of this morphological parameter in the eutrophication process or succession in lakes. The values of the indices shock that Lake Trasimeno exhibits a trophic state consistent with Carlson's TSI indices and with the results previously obtained by the application of Vollenweider's eutrophication model based on phosphorus loading and the Hillbrich-Ilkowska method, but less compliant with the Vollenweider-OECD classification criterion. The study emphasises the importance of a holistic thermodynamic approach in getting new insight into the fundamental mechanisms of the ecological succession of lake ecosystems.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate temporal trends in changes in vegetation patterns within the Sooretama Biological Reserve and its surroundings, located in Espirito Santo State, Brazil. The evaluation will be performed using the EVI and NDVI index of the MODIS sensor, the Mann-Kendall monotonic trend, Seasonal Trend Analysis methods, and monitoring drought events through the VCI drought index for the years 2007 through 2015. The tools utilized were the EVI and NDVI indexes of the MOD13Q1 product and LST from the MOD11A2 product. These indices were used in order to represent the dynamics of the study area biomass and then to analyze the drought occurrence using the index best-suited to the area of study, identified as VCI. The temporal trends in the data set were examined, pixel by pixel, by application of the Mann-Kendall monotonic technique, treating each pixel in space as a one-dimensional temporal series of 16-day cycles. To evaluate the seasonal trend, the analysis used the STA technique (Seasonal Trend Analysis) implemented in the ETM module. The characterization and spatial distribution of drought events were performed through the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). The use of (a) images and seasonal curves produced by the monotonic trend of Mann-Kendall and (b) analysis of seasonal trends generated the response of the vegetation to climate variations. The VCI indicated a potential for drought occurrence analysis in regions and areas with different vegetation densities. So, the VCI can be used as a powerful tool to compose a comprehensive and early system alert of drought that can accompany the changes in spatial coverage of vegetation and severity of change. Lastly, the analysis of the data from the MODIS NDVI, EVI, and TST images indicated that the data is suitable to a space-time analysis of drought occurrences and vegetation trends.

AB  - The Bohai Sea is characterized as a semi-closed sea with limited water exchange ability, which has been regarded as one of the most contaminated regions in China and has attracted public attention over the past decades. In recent years, the rapid industrialization and urbanization around the coastal region has resulted in a severe pollution pressure in the Bohai Sea. Although efforts from official government and scientific experts have been made to protect and restore the marine ecosystem, satisfactory achievements were not gained. Moreover, partial coastal areas in the Bohai Sea seemingly remain heavily polluted. In this study, we focused on five coastal regions around the Bohai Sea to study the spatial distribution pattern of trace elements in the sediments and their ecological risk. A total of 108 sediment samples were analyzed to determine the contamination degree of trace elements (Cu, Cd, As, Pb, Zn, Cr, and Hg). Contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), geoaccumulation index (I-geo), and potential ecological risk index (PERI) were utilized to assess the pollution extent of these metals. Spatial distribution patterns revealed that the sedimentary environments of coastal Bohai were in good condition, except Jinzhou Bay, according to the Marine Sediment Quality of China. The concentrations of Hg and Cd were considerably higher than the average upper crust value and presented high potential ecological risk and considerable potential ecological risk, respectively. The overall environment quality of the coastal Bohai Sea does not seem to pose an extremely serious threat in terms of metal pollution. Thus, the government should continue implementing pollution control programs in the Bohai Sea.

AB  - Drivers, pressures, state changes, impacts and responses (DPSIR) is a general framework for organising information about the state of the environment. The idea of the framework derives originally from the field of social studies. Now it is being applied on a much wider scale, in particular for organizing systems of indicators in the context of environmental studies and also sustainable development.
   Many datasets on Baltic pollution, the state of its environment, infrastructure, emissions and monitoring networks are available. Yet without suitable tools they cannot be used properly and effectively. This paper contains a review of the current state of the Baltic region and the most useful sources of relevant information. A partial analysis - including only drivers, pressures and state changes - was carried out. To this purpose two tools were utilized: an experts' poll and reports of organizations - providers of the datasets. The former resulted in the following top three Ds, Ps and Ss: D - urban waste (1), transport, shipping (2), agriculture (3); P rivers (1), direct discharges (2), atmospheric deposition (3); and S - decrease in population density (1), individual effects (scope for growth, imposex, endocrine disruption) (2), tissue pathology (3). Moreover, both methods produced similar results, which brings us to the conclusion that instead of providing new analytical/experimental programs, the existing databases could be better utilized. The significance of rivers should also be stressed.
   Limitations in access to the data were specified. These were, first of all, lack or gaps in the datasets both in spatial and temporal scale. Differences in the data formats and the principle of data presentation - tables are preferred over graphs and maps - should also be mentioned.

AB  - Is the seasonal growth of Strangomera bentincki (Clupeidae) and Engraulis ringens (Engraulidae) a consequence of their reproductive strategy to adapt to the seasonal upwelling ecosystem they inhabit? This question is addressed by analysing monthly length-frequency data, gonadosomatic index and condition factor of the species in relation with the seasonal patterns of environmental variables. Modal progression analysis of mean length-at-age of cohorts along the time axis was used to study the growth in the period 1990-1997. A seasonally oscillating growth curve was estimated for both species, with the slowest growth rate occurring between April and May, a few months before the higher reproductive activity occurring in August-September. The reproductive strategy is to spawn when environmental conditions are related with onshore transport in winter (August), favouring the concentration and retention of eggs and larvae. One month later, a moderate upwelling determines an enrichment in food particles and the spawning area is transformed in a nursery area for juveniles. The reproductive strategy is combined with an 'energy storage strategy' during the period of upwelling. The energy stored is used for reproduction several months later, affecting the growth process of the species. It is concluded that the regularity in the seasonal growth in both species is a response, from an evolutionary point of view, of a long-term reproductive adaptation to the seasonal upwelling ecosystem of the central southern area off Chile.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii, a zoonotic food borne parasite that can infect almost all warm-blooded animals including people, and ranks 4th among 24 most significant global foodborne parasites listed by the World Health Organization/United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO/WHO, 2014). Exposure to T. gondii has been reported in wildlife and people in the Canadian North, despite low densities of feline definitive hosts. The ecology of this host-parasite system could be affected by changing climate and landscape in boreal and sub-Arctic regions, and surveillance data are critically needed. Wolverines are an economically and culturally important species in northern Canada due to their valuable fur. Fluid obtained from diaphragmatic muscle of 127 wolverines (Gulo gulo) were tested for antibodies to T. gondii using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A seroprevalence of 62% (Confidence Interval (CI): 53-71%) was observed. This result indicates high levels of exposure, likely either through environmental contamination with T. gondii oocysts shed by infected wild felids, or consumption of carcasses/offal of other intermediate hosts containing tissue cysts with bradyzoites in tissues. We examined factors associated with seropositivity, including age, sex, harvest location, harvest location with respect to treeline, and body condition index. Adult (>= 2 years) wolverines had 5.2 times higher odds of being sero-positive than juvenile (<1 years) wolverines. The highest seroprevalence was observed in wolverines from Sahtu and South Slave regions. Proportion of sero-positive wolverines harvested above and below the tree line was not significantly different (60% vs 65%). Age was the only significant predictor of T. gondii exposure in wolverines (using logistic regression analysis); further studies should target larger sample sizes. This study is an example of how fluid from diaphragmatic muscle can be used for screening for T. gondii antibodies in wolverines. The diaphragm, commonly collected for screening for another food borne parasite, Trichinella, in wildlife harvested for human consumption, can be used for screening of T. gondii exposure in wildlife. Due to their predatory and scavenging lifestyle and high trophic level, wolverines could serve as a sentinel species for T. gondii. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Surface solar radiation (SSR) can affect climate, the hydrological cycle, plant photosynthesis, and solar power. The values of solar radiation at the surface reflect the influence of human activity on radiative climate and environmental effects, so it is a key parameter in the evaluation of climate change and air pollution due to anthropogenic disturbances. This study presents the characteristics of the SSR variation in Nanjing, China, from March 2016 to June 2017, using a combined set of pyranometer and pyrheliometer observations. The SSR seasonal variation and statistical properties are investigated and characterized under different air pollution levels and visibilities. We discuss seasonal variations in visibility, air quality index (AQI), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and their correlations with SSR. The scattering of solar radiation by particulate matter varies significantly with particle size. Compared with the particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 mu m and 10 mu m (PM2.5-10), we found that the PM2.5 dominates the variation of scattered radiation due to the differences of single-scattering albedo and phase function. Because of the correlation between PM2.5 and SSR, it is an effective and direct method to estimate PM2.5 by the value of SSR, or vice versa to obtain the SSR by the value of PM2.5. Under clear-sky conditions (clearness index >= 0.5), the visibility is negatively correlated with the diffuse fraction, AQI, PM10, and PM2.5, and their correlation coefficients are -0.50, -0.60, -0.76, and -0.92, respectively. The results indicate the linkage between scattered radiation and air quality through the value of visibility.

AB  - With population growth and regional economic development, the relationship between estuaries and human activities grows ever closer. Meanwhile, estuaries and adjacent coasts are facing serious threats from excess resource utilization and adverse environmental changes, making it both necessary and urgent to conduct studies on estuarine ecosystem health. This paper developed an approach using the Driver-Pressure-State change-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to evaluation of estuarine ecosystem state, causes of degradation and the legislative and management responses meant to improve conditions. Correlation analysis was used to analyze the linkage of indicators to avoid double counting of the aspects. Sensitivity analysis was also applied to analyze the small changes in indicator values resulting in changes of the integrated health value. The assessment results showed that the health state of the Yangtze Estuary ecosystem has been progressively declined since the late 1990s; and it reached the worst situation in the middle 2000s. The indicators of driver, pressure and impact systems showed the obvious sensitivity to the integrated health value. Due to the implementation of a series of ecological restoration measures, the estuary has shown some improvement trends in the late 2000s.

AB  - This research was conducted as an ambitious eco-project of "National Ecological Health Assessments in South Korea" to diagnose the ecological health of 72 streams and rivers in Geum river watershed by an Index of Biological Integrity Model (IBIKW) based on fish assemblages. The objectives of this study were to know the systematic impacts on the health of the biological systems, identification of impairment and take a snap-shot of the biological community structure. The IBIKW model consists of eight fish assemblages attributes, termed as metrics, that are related to environmental quality, ecosystem integrity and biodiversity of the Geum river watershed streams and rivers: number of native species, number of riffle benthic species, number of sensitive species, proportion of tolerant species, proportion of omnivore species, proportion of native insectivore species, total number of native individuals and proportion of anomalies. Physico-chemical water quality parameters and fish species compositions were greatly influenced by land-use patterns. According to the IBIKW, one stream was classified as ecologically good, nine streams as fair, 61 streams as poor, and one as very poor. Analysis of trophic and tolerance guilds revealed that tolerant species were dominant in polluted regions, whereas sensitive species preferred less polluted areas. Nutrients and organic matter were responsible for the production of algae in the waterbodies, and total phosphorus (TP) was the major key factor. Overall, the ecosystem health assessment by IBIKW gives a clear insight into the biological condition of Korean watersheds and could play a significant role in regular bioassessments, postrestoration assessments, successful management and conservation.

AB  - To help understand the environmental signals for flower-iud initiation, detached unrooted cladodes of the CAM species Opuntia ficus-indica were used, a model system whose gas exchange characteristics were also examined. The number of buds initiated for cladodes detached in the late summer was highest at day/night air temperatures of 15/5 degrees C. A long photoperiod of 14 h enhanced flower-bud initiation for 4 wk of vernalization at 15 degrees/5 degrees C compared with a photoperiod of 10 h, whereas both photoperiods had similar effects for 8 wk of vernalization. Flower-bud initiation did not depend on the net CO2 uptake capability of the cladode, although bud development and survival did. During 12 wk of detachment, cladodes gained 20% in dry mass, reflecting a positive net CO2 uptake despite no water uptake by the unrooted cladodes. Both net CO2 uptake and water loss were maximal at 1 wk after detachment, CO2 uptake decreasing by 48% at 4 wk, 87% at 8 wk, and 93% at 12 wk and transpiration by 43%, 62%, and 72%, respectively. The daily net CO2 uptake during 12 wk of detachment averaged 92 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at 15 degrees/5 degrees C and 123 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at 25 degrees/15 degrees C. Daily net CO2 uptake predicted by an environmental productivity index was in close agreement with the measured values, indicating that net CO2 uptake for detached unrooted cladodes was similar to that of rooted plants under drought conditions.

AB  - A crucial step in the development of a fish-based index for the ecological assessment of water bodies as provided by the European Water Framework Directive is to define a reference list of fish species occurring in pristine rivers. The aim of this study was to elaborate such a list. The reference corresponds to an ecological status that is referred to as Good or Maximal Ecological Potential (GEP/MEP). Based on historically-reported fish survey data of the Zeeschelde estuary (Belgian part of the Schelde estuary) and its tributaries, i.e. an affluent system, under tidal influence, presence/absence reference lists were compiled for different salinity zones and adjusted using information from recent catches. In addition, an MEP list of fishes occurring in the Westerschelde (Dutch part of the Schelde estuary), developed by JAGER & KRANENBARG (2004), is provided to present a complete overview of the Schelde estuary. Inclusion of fish species in the reference lists depended on their natural geographical distribution and ecological demands. These reference lists contain guild-specific information for the different zones within the estuary and its tidal tributaries.

AB  - We examine why organizations that obtain prominent certifications may at times elect not to publicize them. Drawing on the impression management literature, we argue and show that concerns about being perceived as hypocritical may cause organizations to strategically withhold their certification status. Using a longitudinal panel of corporations that were members of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a prominent environmental certification, we show that in the face of reputational threats, organizations are less likely to publicize their certification status when the threat appears to directly contradict the claims implied by the certification. Our findings suggest that the threat of hypocrisy is amplified for firms with stronger reputations in the same domain as the certification and when audience members better understand and value the certification. Our findings delineate new boundary conditions under which firms will make prosocial claims and inspire reconsideration of long-held assumptions about the process of decoupling the implementation and communication of socially valued practices. This study also provides insights for scholars of nonmarket strategy on how corporations strategically communicate with external constituents about their sustainability initiatives.

AB  - This paper develops a methodology for integration of remote sensing and census data within a GIS framework to assess the quality of life in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Environmental variables, i.e. greenness, impervious surface and temperature, were derived from a Landsat ETM+ image. Socio-economic variables, including population density, income, poverty, employment rate, education level and house characteristics from US census 2000, were integrated with the environmental variables at the block group level to derive indicators of quality of life. Pearson's correlation was computed to analyse the relationships among the variables. Further, factor analysis was conducted to extract unique information from the combined dataset. Three factors were identified and interpreted as material welfare, environmental conditions and crowdedness respectively. Each factor was viewed as a unique aspect of the quality of life. A synthetic index of the urban quality of life was created and mapped based on weighted factor scores of the three factors. Finally, regression models were built to estimate the quality of life in the city of Indianapolis based on selected environmental and socioeconomic variables.

AB  - The objective of this study was to know about the depositional environment and petrographic characteristics of lignite deposits of the Nagaur district, Rajasthan, India, and to decipher source rock potential. Lignite samples have been collected from all the working and exposed lignite seams from Matasukh lignite mines of Nagaur following the pillar sampling method. The petrographic study has been done following the International Committee for Coal and Organic Petrology and ISO norms. The study has shown that Nagaur lignites are mostly dominated by the huminite group of macerals followed by liptinite group. The huminite group is mainly represented by attrinite, textinite and ulminite, whereas liptinite is represented mainly by primary liptinites such as resinite, sporinite, suberinite and cutinite. An inertinite group of macerals occurs in the least concentration as compared to the huminite and liptinite group macerals and mainly represented by the semifusinite, funginite and inertodetrinite. In these lignites, carbonate mineral matters are dominating over the pyrite and argillaceous mineral matter. The maceral constituents present in the studied samples indicate a high proportion of type III kerogen and are capable of generating gases only. Based on the reflectance of Euulminite B maceral, Nagaur lignites may be classified as 'Low-rank B' (lignite B). The study reveals that lignites originated in the bog forest under ombrotrophic to mesotrophic hydrological conditions. Gelification Index and the Tissue Preservation Index suggest an accumulation of peat in the marshy environment.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), metal, and chlorine contents of samplesincluding waste mineral oil, engine oil, edible oil, oily waste (industrial/domestic), and number 10 lube (NTL)were investigated to evaluate possible hazards to the environment. Analyses were conducted using Turkish and United States Environmental Protection Agency standards. The results showed an uneven distribution of pollutants among all type of samples or samples that were collected from the same area at different time intervals. Although PCB usage was banned in Turkey many years ago, indicator PCB congeners were observed in NTL samples that were predominantly used as alternative fuel in heavy duty diesel engines. Waste oil and oily waste samples should be recycled as raw materials and/or recovered as an energy source, but the findings of this study yields disposal as a hazardous material due to high metal (Cr) content. The overall results of the study show that uncontrolled combustion of waste oil and oily wastes may cause environmental problems, and use of these wastes and products should be controlled and managed by strict precautions.

AB  - Treatment and final disposal of Municipal Solid Waste can have a significant role in the generation of negative environmental impacts. As a prevention strategy, such activities are subjected to the process of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Still, the follow-up of Environmental Management Plans or mitigation measures is limited, for one due to a lack of methodological approaches. In searching for possibilities, the University of Granada (Spain) developed a diagnostic methodology named EVIAVE, which allows one to quantify, by means of indexes, the environmental impact of landfills in view of their location and the conditions of exploitation. EVIAVE is applicable within the legal framework of the European Union and can be adapted to the environmental and legal conditions of other countries. This study entails its adaptation in Colombia, for the follow-up and control of the EIA process for landfills. Modifications involved inclusion of the environmental elements flora and fauna, and the evaluation of the environmental descriptors in agreement with the concept of vulnerability. The application of the modified EVIAVE in Colombian landfills allowed us to identify the elements affected by the operating conditions and maintenance. It may be concluded that this methodology is viable and effective for the follow-up and environmental control of EIA processes for landfills, and to analyze the associated risks, as it takes into account related environmental threats and vulnerabilities.

AB  - Benthic indices to support aquatic environmental condition assessments have been more effectively developed for higher than lower salinity habitats. Here we quantify agreement among benthic experts using best professional judgment to assess community condition of mesohaline and tidal freshwater samples from the San Francisco Estuary and Delta, and compare that to a previous study for San Francisco Estuary polyhaline samples. Benthic species abundance data from 20 sites in each habitat were provided to 7 tidal freshwater, and 8 mesohaline, experts who ranked the samples from best to worst condition and placed the samples into 4 condition categories. The average correlation among expert's condition rankings was only 0.38 and 0.29 in the mesohaline and tidal freshwater habitats, respectively, compared to 0.92 in the previous polyhaline study. Pair-wise agreement among expert condition categories averaged 41% and 39%, compared to 70% in the polyhaline. Based on post-exercise discussions among the experts, the differences in agreement among habitats appears related to the use of different indicator taxa and to disturbance regimes in the lower salinity habitats that select for higher proportions of tolerant taxa, confounding assessments at the current level of understanding of benthic response in these habitats. Regardless of the reason, the absence of a clear conceptual model and agreement among benthic ecologists about benthic condition makes index development more difficult in low salinity estuarine and tidal freshwater habitats.

AB  - The dominant environmental determinants of aquatic communities have been a persistent topic for many years. Interactions between natural and anthropogenic characteristics within the aquatic environment influence fish communities in complex ways that make the effect of a single characteristic difficult to ascertain. Researchers are faced with the question of how to deal with a large number of variables and complex interrelationships. This study utilized multiple approaches to identify key environmental variables to fish communities of the Fox River Basin in Illinois: Pearson and Spearman correlations, an algorithm based on information theory called mutual information, and a measure of variable importance built into the machine learning algorithm Random Forest. The results are based on a dataset developed for this study, which uses a fish index of biological integrity (IBI) and its ten component metrics as response variables and a range of environmental variables describing geomorphology, stream flow statistics, climate, and both reach-scale and watershed-scale land use as independent variables. Agricultural land use and the magnitude and duration of low flow events were ranked by the algorithms as key factors for the study area. Reach-scale characteristics were dominant for native sunfish, and stream flow metrics were rated highly for native suckers. Regression tree analyses of environmental variables on fish IBI identified breakpoints in percent agricultural land in the watershed (similar to 64 %), duration of low flow pulses (similar to 12 days), and 90-day minimum flow (similar to 0.13 cms). The findings should be useful for building predictive models and design of more effective monitoring systems and restoration plans.

AB  - When analyzing alternatives to locate a new industry or modify a production process that generates gaseous emissions, it is necessary to evaluate and quantify its environmental impacts, thus anticipating future inconveniences in the natural and social environment, in which the activity takes place. Under this framework, the objective of this work was to carry out an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) as an instance before the establishment of a new industry, which was applied to the case study of a lead smelting plant in the province of Entre Rios, Argentina. For this, the projected activity data for said smelting plant were used, using the emission factors suggested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Once the emissions were estimated, the dispersion of the pollutants was modeled using the Industrial Source Complex Short Term version (ISCST3) model, which allowed knowing the distribution of the concentration of atmospheric pollutants in the urban area of Villa Elisa (Entre Rios) and with the results obtained, an ERA was carried out. As a result of this research, a baseline was generated that allows estimating the potential impact on the health of exposed people as a pre-establishment to an industry that generates gaseous emissions.

AB  - Although canopy height has long been a focus of interest in ecology, it has remained difficult to study at large spatial scales. Recently, satellite-borne LiDAR equipment produced the first systematic high resolution maps of vegetation height worldwide. Here we show that this new resource reveals three marked modes in tropical canopy height similar to 40, similar to 12, and similar to 2 m corresponding to forest, savanna, and treeless landscapes. The distribution of these modes is consistent with the often hypothesized forest-savanna bistability and suggests that both states can be stable in areas with a mean annual precipitation between similar to 1,500 and similar to 2,000 mm. Although the canopy height states correspond largely to the much discussed tree cover states, there are differences, too. For instance, there are places with savanna-like sparse tree cover that have a forest-like high canopy, suggesting that rather than true savanna, those are thinned relicts of forest. This illustrates how complementary sets of remotely sensed indicators may provide increasingly sophisticated ways to study ecological phenomena at a global scale.

AB  - During the past decades, land use change has taken place around the Loess Plateau at unprecedented rates. Due to the impact of existing land use policy, great changes have taken place in the land use types in this ecologically vulnerable area. Taking eight counties in Yan'an, Shaanxi province, China, as the study area, this study analyzed the long-term (from 1997 to 2011) changes in land use and ecological vulnerability. Based on thematic mapper (TM) images of Yan'an in 1997, 2004, and 2011, the dynamic changes in land use are analyzed with the application software for remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) since the implementation of the policy of returning farmland to forest. Combined with the land use data, the local socio-economic data, and natural resources condition, ecological vulnerability is evaluated using the spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) model in Yan'an region. Using the natural breaks classification (NBC), the evaluation results are divided into five categories: potential, slight, light, medium, and heavy. The results show that although the regional land use types changed markedly, the ecological vulnerability in the study shows greater than average optimism, and the ecological vulnerability index of the southern four counties is lower than that of the northern four counties. In 1997-2011, the eco-environmental quality gradually improved in most areas. However, it gradually deteriorated in some regions.

AB  - Bivalves, especially mussels, have been pointed as putative species to monitor polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in marine environment. After several environmental PAHs baseline reports, the present study was conducted to assess for the first time the levels of PAHs in native mussels (Brachidontes rodriguezii) collected from a critical industrialized estuary of Argentina. Under this objective, after an 18-month sampling period, 34 pools of mussels were assessed for 17 PAHs, including the 16 compounds prioritized by United States Environmental Protection Agency. By means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, results showed total PAHs concentrations in mussel's tissue ranged from under laboratory detection limits to 482.4 ng/g dry weight. Mussel body burdens were dominated by lower molecular weight PAHs, such as phenanthrene, naphthalene, and pyrene, whereas the overall PAHs profile suggested the predominance of petrogenic sources. Finally, the potential ecotoxicological impact was evaluated by applying Environmental Assessment Criteria and benzo[a]pyrene toxic equivalent factors.

AB  - Species diversity is usually regarded as a key factor of ecosystem resiliency facing human impact and especially fishing pressure. This study analyzed the impact of fishing on fish species diversity. We focused on the Guinean coastal demersal resources which have recently undergoes very fast and significant increase in fishing pressure. Within a period of 15 years, the demersal resources evolved from a "virgin status" to a globally overexploited situation. This quick evolution can be regarded as a "model" of the history of an exploitation. The analysis is based on the data of 18 demersal trawling scientific campaigns carried out in the coastal zone between 1985 and 1992. The level of the species diversity was quantified for each campaign and by trawl using different indices: species richness, the Shannon and equitability indices. The indices by trawl were analyzed by ANOVA methods in order to release a temporal evolution of the indicators. The rank/frequencies diagrams of each campaign were also drawn. The Shannon and equitability indices remained appreciably constant, whereas abundance and species richness decreased significantly during the period. The least abundant species, and particularly species from the Sparidae community, tended to disappear from the samples. Lastly, all diversity indices were weak in 1989. This can be related to suitable environmental conditions for the recruitment of some species. Relevance of the indices used is discussed.

AB  - Dysfunctional affective processes are central to the experience of internalizing disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, and related disorders). Specifically, extreme positive affect and elevated negative affect each have unique and robust patterns of associations with internalizing symptoms. This article examines affect as both an individual difference and a within-person dynamic process that unfolds over time. Recent research is reviewed that clarifies the hierarchical structure of affect and facet-level associations with symptoms, affect-laden traits that confer risk for internalizing psychopathology, models of emotion regulation, and how emotion regulation abilities and strategies contribute to or detract from psychological wellbeing. Several measurement challenges in this literature are identified and discussed, including possible conceptual and content overlap, mood-state distortion, naturalistic assessment in daily life, and the benefits and limitations of self-reported affective experience.

AB  - Management of male infertility has recently shifted from treatment of the subfertile man towards techniques of assisted reproduction (ART). This study aimed to evaluate the possible role of the ultramorphological status of the spermatozoon with respect to sperm selection in vivo and prediction of ART success. Ultramorphological sperm parameters were assessed retrospectively for 92 males with sufficient sperm density (10(7) spermatozoa ejaculate(-1)) whose wives conceived following a stepwise discarding of the female genital tract barriers, using intra-uterine insemination (IUI) (n = 26), in vitro fertilization (IVF) (n = 45) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (n = 21). In parallel, sperm samples of 71 fertile males were examined. Normal ultramorphology of all head and tail subcellular organelles was found to be essential for the ability of spermatozoa to pass the lower female genital tract. The ultramorphological migration threshold for this barrier is apparently higher than that essential for oocyte fertilization. No specific indication associated with passage through the upper genital tract was found. A high prevalence of axonema defects was found to impair the ability of sperm cells to penetrate the oocyte investment. The natural fertility index, based on routine sperm parameters and the ultrastructural status of the spermatozoon's subcellular organelles was confirmed to be beneficial for directing patients to ART. A discriminative score based on axonema integrity was found to contribute additional information for the first choice decision between conventional ART and ICSI (75% prediction ability). Thus it may be helpful in finding the simplest and least expensive procedure with the greatest long-term chance for pregnancy.

KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that upland wetland restorations provide the same quality of wetland, in terms of ecosystem services and biodiversity, as natural wetlands in the St. Lawrence River Valley. Water quality (pH, alkalinity, colored dissolved organic matter, phytoplankton community composition, chlorophyll-a, fecal coliform, total phosphorus, dissolved nitrate, turbidity, specific conductivity) in 17 natural and 45 restored wetlands was compared to determine whether wetland restoration provided similar physicochemical conditions as natural wetlands in the Saint Lawrence River Valley of northeastern New York State. Natural wetlands were more acidic, which was hypothesized to result from the avoidance of naturally acidic regions by farmers seeking to drain wetlands for crop and pasture use. Natural wetlands had significantly greater fecal coliform concentrations. Restored wetlands had significantly greater specific conductivity and related ions, and this is attributed to the creation of wetlands upon marine clay deposits. Other water quality indicators did not differ between restored and natural wetlands. These findings confirm other research at these same wetlands showing no substantial differences between restored and natural wetlands in major biotic indicators. Thus, we conclude that wetland restoration does result in wetlands that are functionally the same as the natural wetlands they were designed to replicate.

AB  - In order to facilitate watershed management, we developed an expansive river health assessment method based on ecological flow hydrology method in this study that estimates the ecological flow of a river by using a probability density curve combined with six levels of river flow in different states of a river ecosystem. We apply the above method to a river health assessment in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The results show that the ecological flow calculated by this method is more accurate than that of the traditional hydrology method and the fish spawning water demand method and can better describe the actual demand of river ecosystems to flow; thus, this method is reasonable for evaluating river health. Moreover, the river health assessment method described in this study covers the different health states of river ecosystems, including all intervals of river flow, and takes into account the influences of extreme flow events and the uneven distribution of flow during the year. It is a reasonable river health assessment method that can evaluate river health status systematically, comprehensively and accurately. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of this method in watershed management. The results show that this method can provide a scientific decision-making basis for river health management in actual watershed management.

AB  - In seasonal environments, a temporal decline in breeding performance (e.g. clutch size, nestling condition, and fledging success) of altricial bird species is a well-known phenomenon. In this study, we present the effect of laying phenology on the physiological condition of nestling great tits (Parus major) in 14 consecutive breeding seasons. We used blood haemoglobin and baseline glucose concentrations as indicators of nestling physiological condition. Nestling blood haemoglobin reflects food base quality and availability during the breeding period. Blood glucose concentration can be used as a supplementary reverse index of condition, since it is negatively related to environmental quality. It might be indicative of the stress caused by unfavourable extrinsic factors, though, due to potential confounding factors such as adverse weather conditions, low food quality, or feeding interruptions, glucose levels should be used in this ecological context with caution. Great tit nestlings from earlier broods were characterised by higher mean haemoglobin concentrations, indicating a seasonal decline in food quality and availability. The blood glucose concentration displayed an opposite pattern, with nestlings from earlier broods being characterised by lower mean concentrations than those from later broods. However, very little of the variation in blood glucose concentration can be explained by the variation in laying date, which suggests that blood glucose concentration is of little importance in the context of breeding phenology. Our results show that the physiological condition of nestlings of this species decreases as the breeding season progresses, most probably due to environmental factors.

AB  - Adequate stores of body fat are essential for survival and reproduction of polar bears (Ursus maritimus). However, polar bear body fat levels can be difficult to quantify in the field. For >30 years, biologists have subjectively estimated relative fatness of immobilized polar bears by assigning individuals a rating from 1 to 5, with 1 being leanest and 5 most obese. Although previous studies suggested this fatness index (FI) rating accurately reflects large-scale differences in body condition, its relationship to more quantitative measures of condition has not been explored. We compared the FI rating of individual polar bears in western Hudson Bay and the Beaufort Sea to 2 quantitative measures of body condition: the Quetelet Index (ratio of mass to length) and the relative lipid content of adipose tissue. We found a significant relationship between FI rating and both Quetelet Index values and adipose lipid content. Our data demonstrate that the FI rating accurately reflects overall body condition, regardless of polar bear age, sex, or nutritional phase. We suggest that continued field use of the FI rating could provide valuable information on ecological effects of large-scale environmental change on polar bear populations.

AB  - In view of the poor integration of environmental issues into agriculture, and due to the impossibility to maintain the high subsidies after the EU-enlargement, far-reaching reforms of the agricultural policy are necessary. An important contribution to improve the inclusion of environmental aspects is provided by the EU-project AEMBAC, which comprises partners in 7 European countries. All relevant ecological, economic and social aspects as well as the specific characteristics of the landscape and the agricultural system are taken into consideration. The methodology is starting from a strong landscape-ecological approach: state and pressure indicators are chosen and analysed, and various landscape functions are assessed. Further steps are the definition of Environmental Minimum Requirements, the evaluation of land use sustainability, the proposal of realistic policy targets, and the development of specific agri-environmental measures. By involving farmers and other stakeholders a transdisciplinary perspective is achieved.

AB  - The research presents the analysis and comparison of environmental tax reforms in the countries of the European Union, which are an effect of political decisions. The main focus in evaluation of environmental tax reforms is put on the results of improvement of environmental quality and maintenance of revenue neutrality that may be used to determine the appropriateness and benefit of the reform in the countries. The following countries which have implemented the environmental tax reforms have been chosen for the empirical study: Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Criteria of evaluation of environmental tax reforms have been determined, namely, the effect of environmental taxes on state revenue; economic-social effects of environmental taxes; the effect of environmental taxes on reduction of environmental pollution. The empirical quantitative and qualitative study has been conducted for analysis of the dynamics of the quantitative indicators by looking at their variation trends, determining the values of qualitative indicators and significance of quantitative and qualitative indicators, and applying the correlation analysis. The results of the study have suggested that the countries which have implemented the environmental tax reforms have achieved environmental, economic, and social aims. Environmental (energy intensity, GHG emissions productivity), economic -social (the share of environmental taxes in state revenue, labour productivity) indicators of the countries have improved during the analyzed period. The environmental tax reforms have not put any significant burden of taxation on the society, while some of the countries (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands) have even achieved the neutrality of state revenue.

AB  - Collapse of soil skeleton due to variation in its loading and boundary conditions impacts the strength and stability of soil in its unsaturated state. The present study is focused on the influence of matric suction on collapsible behaviour and stiffness degradation of compacted unsaturated cohesive soil. Collapse characteristic of unsaturated soil is assessed under sudden inundation and varying vertical stress application. A series of dynamic triaxial, double oedometer and filter paper tests were conducted on unsaturated Ahmedabad cohesive soil under as-compacted conditions at varying dry density and water content to determine cyclic degradation index (delta), collapse potential and matric suction (u(a) - u(w)), respectively. Significant influence of matric suction was observed on collapse potential and stiffness degradation of unsaturated cohesive soil. Larger collapse potential at higher matric suction clarified the meta-stable state of compacted unsaturated cohesive soil under dry conditions. Cyclic degradation index (delta) with number of loading cycles was found to be decreasing with increase in matric suction representing brittle nature of soil possessing higher matric suction signifying soil skeleton to be highly volatile and unsafe under dynamic loading conditions.

AB  - The underlying mechanisms responsible for ecological plasticity and consequent invasive character of non-native freshwater fish species, variations in growth and life history traits in gibel carp Carassius gibelio (Bloch) were compared in natural and artificial water bodies of Turkey. Females significantly outnumbered males in all natural and most artificial waters. Discriminate function analysis differentiated gibel populations into three separate groups (natural lakes, artificial water bodies and running waters), with significant differences among separated groups in growth index, standard length and age at maturity, relative fecundity and gonado-somatic index, but not in egg diameter and both generalised and relative condition. Growth features (e.g. growth index and relative condition) and reproductive features (e.g. relative and absolute fecundity) positively correlated with water body area. No correlations were found for any growth or life history trait with depth, latitude and altitude. With the exception of smaller size at maturity, all traits were higher in populations from artificial water bodies than those inhabiting running waters, suggesting gibel carp is required to exert more reproductive effort to invade natural ecosystems than artificial waters.

It is necessary to constantly monitor its waters using metrics that evaluate environmental degradation and aquatic assemblages. In the present study, we used the Index of Biotic Integrity for Aquatic Macroinvertebrate Associations (IBIAMA), the Visual-Based Habitat Assessment, and the Most Probable State to calculate the conservation status of the river at six sites along the main channel, including an upper site as a reference. A total of 51 474 specimens were identified, the taxonomic composition was comprised of 69 families distributed into four Phyla, eight classes, eight sub-classes, and 18 orders. The best preserved sites were found in the subwatershed headwater zone. The intermediate zone had impacted hydraulic conditions, environmental quality and biotic integrity. The downstream part of the subwatershed showed the resilient capacity of the river to reestablish macroinvertebrate assemblages and environmental parameters. There is a strong correlation among environmental qualities and the IIBAMA. The use of macroinvertebrates in combination with environmental parameters showed that the Chiquito River subwatershed is stable, rich and integral in aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages before entering the city of Morelia, and it conserves the processes that regulate the functional dynamics of the subwatershed.

AB  - The main objectives of this study were to determine how the weir affect spatial and seasonal distribution of fish assemblages and physicochemical water quality as well as chemical and biological health. Summer monsoon was the key determinant in regulating the weir discharge. It regulates the concentration of total phosphorus and total suspended solids in the downstream weir. The water temperature, concentrations of chlorophyll and chemical oxygen demand were increased due to habitat alterations from running to stagnant type. The relative abundance of tolerant fish was the highest in 2012, 2013 and 2014 during spring and fall but in 2017, the relative abundance of intermediate species was the highest during fall only. The constancy value was the highest for tolerant and exotic fish species whereas sensitive and herbivore fish species were disappeared. Due to the construction of weir, the migration of fishes has been disrupted. Therefore, the abundance of lentic type fish species has been increasing whereas lotic type fish species were on the decline. The overall abundance of omnivores and herbivores were dominant in whole study domain. Moreover, the chemical and biological health was in very poor and poor condition, respectively.

AB  - Geoindicators are means adopted for the measurement of geological processes and phenomena that occur at or near the Earth's surface and vary significantly over periods of 100 years or less. These tools have focused on assessing geological impacts and risks over the last three decades. However, the use of geoindicators is not widely known and has not been as greatly exploited as have most environmental indicators. The objective of this study is to contribute to the diffusion of information about and the application of geoindicators. We have defined, in terms of geoindicators, parameters and aspects of coastal environments that are commonly studied or monitored. The geoindicators proposed were designed for assessing coastal physical vulnerability in the case of the coastal beaches of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Four geoindicators were defined and tested: the height and morpho-ecological state of the foredunes, shoreline position, and washout concentrations. An additional socio-environmental indicator was included, sanitary quality. These indicators were brought together to constitute a Physical Vulnerability Index that represented seven locations along the coastline assessed. In addition, the indicators and Index values were used to generate a cartographic map that could be understood by the public and used by decision makers.

AB  - In this study, spatiotemporal dynamics of macrofaunal assemblages and their associations with environmental conditions were examined in Jinhae Bay (10 sites), where the obvious sources of pollution including industries, oyster farms (hanging cultures), and municipal discharges has surrounded. The survey had performed over five consecutive seasons in 2013-2014. Target sedimentary variables included grain size, organic content, C/N ratio, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, and some heavy metals. Five ecological quality indices (EcoQ) were calculated from the benthic community data to evaluate ecological qualities in site-specific manner. Jinhae Bay is a shallow (depths range, 11-24 m) and typical semi -enclosed bay. The benthic environments represented mud dominated bottoms (>70%) with fairly substantial organic content levels (>2%) over all five seasons. Seasonal patterns were observed with peak abundances in the spring and distinctive macrozoobenthos species shifts in the summer. The spring bloom could be explained by drastic increases of some polychaetes, mainly Capitella sp., at certain site, particularly near the shore. The oyster farms situated in the innermost locations seem to provide organic rich bottoms being dominated by opportunistic species and/or organic pollution indicator species, such as Lumbrineris longifolia, Capitella sp., and Paraprionospio patiens. In general, the EcoQ indicators indicated that Jinhae Bay was moderately polluted, with exceptionally poor EcoQ in a few locations during the specific season(s). Overall, adverse effects on benthic community was broadly attributable to contaminations of heavy metals and nearby aquatic farm activities in Jinhae Bay, which requires a prompt action toward ecosystem-based management practice in the given area.

AB  - Early warning signals (EWSs) offer the hope that patterns observed in data can predict the future states of ecological systems. While a large body of research identifies such signals prior to the collapse of populations, the prediction that such signals should also be present before a system's recovery has thus far been overlooked. We assess whether EWSs are present prior to the recovery of overexploited marine systems using a trait-based ecological model and analysis of real-world fisheries data. We show that both abundance and trait-based signals are independently detectable prior to the recovery of stocks, but that combining these two signals provides the best predictions of recovery. This work suggests that the efficacy of conservation interventions aimed at restoring systems which have collapsed may be predicted prior to the recovery of the system, with direct relevance for conservation planning and policy.

AB  - Water quality assessment is essential for water resources management. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of water quality conditions in three urban tributaries of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME-WQI) and Nemerow Pollution Index (NPI) approach were used in this study. Generally, the assessment results of the NPI approach are consistent with that of the CCME-WQI approach. However, the NPI method overemphasized the influence of the most serious pollutant factor, and thus this method should be used with caution for water resources managers. The CCME-WQI values indicated that the water quality conditions in the Wubu River were quite good during the period 2013-2015. Water quality conditions in the upstream sections of Yipin and Huaxi River are good. However, when the river drains through urban areas, water quality conditions greatly deteriorate due to the excessive release of household and municipal sewage, and industrial wastewater, especially for Huaxi River. Thus, waste water management becomes more and more imperative in urban regions of China. Meanwhile, assessment results indicate that the CCME-WQI approach can provide a reference for decision-makers on water resources management.

AB  - The Lancang-Mekong River basin contains a diverse assemblage of freshwater fish species; however, their populations are threatened by current and planned dam construction along the river. Fish assemblages are sensitive indicators of environmental degradation and can be used to assess aquatic ecosystem health. This research compared the fish fauna at the Xiaowan hydropower dam located on the middle reaches of the Lancang-Mekong River at three time periods: in 2008 (before impoundment), 2010 (water storage) and 2011 (full operation). A modified fish index of biological integrity (modified F-IBI) was developed and it synthesized information on the taxonomic composition, trophic guilds, and tolerance levels of the fish and habitat diversity to quantitatively assess the condition of fish populations before and after damming. This index also was used to assess the longitudinal diversity of the fish fauna along the river channel and could assess the barrier effect associated with the dam. Jaccard's index of similarity was used as a feasible tool to assess fish diversity loss and biotic homogenization. The analysis clearly showed a homogenization of the fish communities after damming, and the reservoir impoundment region showed much more serious homogenization than the downstream region. The Xiaowan dam had an immediate and profound effect on the fish fauna in this region of the Lancang-Mekong River. A total of eight cascading dams are planned for development in this region, and, unless conservation mitigation efforts are considered, the results could be devastating on the native fish populations of middle reaches of the Lancang-Mekong River basin.

AB  - The quantity of habitat can be defined by the distribution and abundance of organisms, but it is the quality of the habitat that may have more direct demographic consequences. Habitat quality is best assessed by determining demographic rates and the performance of the focal species residing within a habitat. Using this framework to develop a method for evaluating habitat quality among sites, we used two demographic rates (settlement and survival) and two performance measures (growth and condition) of the giant kelpfish (Heterostichus rostratus Girard) to determine whether eelgrass (Zostera marina L) habitat quality varies spatially (i.e., site quality) within San Diego Bay, California, USA. Seven sites were selected that encompass the northern and central areas of the bay. Settlement was estimated bi-weekly from May to July 2009 with artificial seagrass units (ASUs) and standard monitoring units for the recruitment of fishes (SMURFs). Eelgrass habitat complexity (shoot height and density) was measured at each site, and three complexity treatments were replicated with ASUs in large mesocosms to estimate survival of giant kelpfish after exposure to kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus Girard), a common predator. Growth and condition were derived from juvenile giant kelpfish collected from sites two months after the settlement period using otolith daily growth increments and total lipid content, respectively. Settlement, growth, and condition were evaluated using a multivariate analysis to provide an assessment of habitat quality among sites and a framework for which site quality can be evaluated in different marine habitats. Combined with habitat-dependent survival from predators in laboratory trials that reflected site-specific habitat attributes, sites were ranked along a gradient of habitat quality. The multivariate analysis of site quality based on demographic and performance variables was then overlaid with a similar analysis of environmental variables. Environmental variables that would serve as proxies for habitat quality were not concordant with the suite of demographic and performance variables used to differentiate site quality, suggesting that a pluralistic approach using demographic rates and individual performance is a potentially more appropriate method for evaluating habitat quality, whether among different habitats or among sites of the same habitat.

AB  - The social-ecological systems of rice terraces across Southeast Asia are the result of centuries of long-term interactions between human communities and their surrounding ecosystems. Processes and structures in these systems have evolved to provide a diversity of ecosystem services and benefits to human societies. However, as Southeast Asian countries experience rapid economic growth and related land-use changes, the remaining extensive rice cultivation systems are increasingly under pressure. We investigated the long-term development of ecosystem services and the adaptive capacity of the social-ecological system of rice terrace landscapes using a case study of Banaue (Ifugao Province, Northern-Luzon, Philippines). A set of indicators was used to describe and assess changes in the social-ecological state of the study system. The resilience of the rice terraces and the human communities that maintain them was examined by comparing the current state of the system with results from the literature. Our findings indicate that, although the social-ecological system has not yet shifted to an alternative state, pressures are increasing and some cultural ecosystem services have already been lost.

AB  - The European Environment Agency has started the implementation of a programme of land use and ecosystem accounts, following the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA) guidelines of the United Nations. The purpose is to integrate information across the various ecosystem components and to support further assessments and modelling of these components and their interactions with economic and social developments. This programme reflects the increasing demand for environmental policy integration in Europe, both vertically through thematic policies as well as horizontally across policies in those sectors that contribute most to environmental impacts. The construction of land and ecosystem accounts is now feasible due to continuous improvements in monitoring, collecting and processing data and progress with the development of statistical methods that facilitate data assimilation and integration. The accounts are based on explicit spatial patterns provided by comprehensive land cover accounts that can be scaled up and down using a 1 km(2) grid to any type of administrative region or ecosystem zone (e.g., river basin catchments, coastal zones or bio-geographic areas). Land cover accounts have been produced for 24 countries in Europe and first results published in the European Environment State and Outlook2005 report of the EEA.(1) (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study sets out to examine the potential of a suite of novel molecular biomarkers as early warning indicators of environmental state and damage. Transcriptional responses of four genes, metallothionein 1 and 2, amine oxidase, and the lysosomal associated glycoprotein, were measured in the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus exposed to increasing concentrations of cadmium and copper in OECD soil. These responses were compared to metal body concentrations and lifecycle parameters: survival, cocoon production, and growth. Adverse physiological effects were observed at concentrations 1/3rd to 1/10th those of the artificial soil LC50. Multivariate statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), was used to investigate the correlations between the different variables. Three key components were derived explaining 77.6% of the variance, with component 1 contributing 32.4%, component 2 contributing 26.7%, and component 3 contributing 18.5%. These components were interpreted in terms of population health, pollutant exposure, and detoxification pathways, respectively. It is proposed that the use of such a suite of biomarkers could serve as indicators of the "health" of the soil environment and provide early warning signals of potential danger to the biota or as a means of monitoring soil remediation.

AB  - Swimming pools are popularly used for sport and recreational purposes worldwide. These places influence swimmers' health as they are considered public places. This study attempted to introduce a process mining framework which analyzes the environmental health status in swimming pools. In this context, a new numerical index namely Swimming Pool Environmental Health Index (SPEHI) was developed through which, big data extracted from checklists of environmental health inspection of swimming pools were analyzed in fuzzy environment. The methodology comprises MCDM (Multi- Criteria Decision-Making) approach including fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and fuzzy OWA (Ordered Weighting Average). The performance of this index was evaluated through an applied example on 12 swimming pools in Shiraz, Iran that was run for a three-year sequence from 2015 to 2017. Among 30 evaluation criteria used in this index, the greatest (0.61) and lowest (0.35) group weights were dedicated to "Residual chlorine biological water quality" and "existence of drinking water facilities", respectively. For the study area, SPEHI showed a wide range of environmental health conditions between 37.8 (Relatively good) to 98.19 (Excellent). The extended index could shrink swimming pool's big data to concise values which are interpretable for health experts and managers of sport sector. It helps figuring out the trends of hygiene conditions in a swimming pool over the time and easy access to compare a city's swimming pools as well. The methodology is flexible in structure and thus, it could be applied for other sporting places.

AB  - The objective of this paper was to examine the profit levels, energy use and environmental impacts of two residential development scenarios in a watershed in the Philadelphia region under two zoning assumptions. The two scenarios were based on economic suitability and environmental suitability. A key question was whether these occurred together in the Pennypack Creek Watershed. Suitability analyses in ArcGIS using criteria for profit and for local sustainability parsed out two sets of developable areas. Buildouts to satisfy 2035 population projections in these areas using CommunityViz software were based on actual municipal zoning ordinances. In a unified zoning scheme created by the authors, a density-adjusted number of housing units are placed watershed-wide without municipal restrictions. Profit data for buildings in each zip code were used to compute a Weighted Profit per Square Meter. Household units were associated with a particular type of automobile and average Vehicle Kilometers Traveled in the relevant census tracts. The GREET program was used to compute energy use, air pollution emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. A Weighted Water Quality Index and Index of Biological Integrity were used to assess water-related impacts based on recent monitoring data supplied by the Philadelphia Water Department. It was no surprise that ECON-UNI and ECON-MUNI generated higher profit than ENV-MUNI and ENV-UNI. ENV-UNI had lower energy use and environmental impacts than all others. That ECON-MUNI had the second lowest energy use and environmental impacts, and the highest water quality, was unexpected. Some policy proposals and conclusions end the paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) bases risk assessments on air or water contaminant concentrations and exposure durations, but neglects to consider total body burden (TBB). The amount of a contaminant in the body at any given instant is especially important when assessing risk due to inhalation. The purpose of this paper is to compare (I)benzene TBB inhalation cancer risk to ingestion cancer risk and (2) the benzene TBB inhalation cancer risk to the inhalation cancer risk derived using USEPA methodologies. Results from this study indicate the ratio of the TBB inhalation to ingestion lifetime cancer risk is 8 to 1, and the TBB inhalation to USEPA-derived inhalation cancer risk is 58 to 1. Considering that the shower (inhalation) and drinking (ingestion) benzene water concentrations were the same, USEPA default exposure values alone do not provide a complete basis for risk assessment. TBB is a much more valuable indicator of risk. Total body burden calculated from pharmacokinetic modeling can be linearly adjusted to consider any inlet water concentration of benzene or shower duration. This same methodology can be applied to other chemicals of concern. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventional ecology lacks a non-contingent theory on the relationship between abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors under natural or quasi-natural conditions. As a result, since ecology is the science that studies the interaction between ecological factors in nested complex systems, we should recognize that ecology needs significant enhancements to understand the functioning of ecosystems. This article combines the ecological state equation (ESE, one of the earliest models derived from the Organic Biophysics of Ecosystem -OBEC), with abundant field data of abiotic factors, biotic factors and human factors from inland water rotifers and crustaceans (1022 samples taken over 21 years), litter invertebrates in laurel forest and pine forest (308 samples), and marine interstitial meiofauna of sandy beaches (90 samples). This has been done in order to obtain additional empirical evidence on the intrinsic trend to stationarity in the long run, even in perturbed ecosystems (manmade eutrophic water reservoirs, forest vegetation affected by traffic, and coastal ecosystems close to disposal points of sewage that are fully or partially treated, respectively to the above-mentioned taxocenes), and the relationship between the above-mentioned ecological factors. Our results indicate that there is a complex natural arrangement that intertwines the trend to stationarity and the resilience capability of ecosystems with a clear pattern of hierarchical setup between ecological factors. This is reflected by the role of ESE as a trophodynamic interface in hierarchical statistical models (cluster analysis) because they involve, in the following order of increasing rank: lower level abiotic factors (a.f.), biotic factors (b.f.), the holistic combination of state variables included in the ESE and, finally, higher level human factors (h.f.). In such a way, there is a clear trend to a hierarchical assemblage in agreement with the evolutionary origin of ecological factors in the deep time, as well as in regard to the net direction (<-) of ecological homeostasis: a.f. <- b.f. <- h.f. In this setup, the ESE accomplishes a key liaison role, because it reflects a long run trend to stationarity which allows an essential degree of ecological stability, as well as our capability to classify ecosystems, in spite of the random influence of ecological perturbations in the short run. The above-mentioned set of additional evidence can be regarded as a step to develop a non-contingent theory about the relationship between abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors. Furthermore, since the OBEC, in its origin, deals with only the dynamics of biotic variables, this is the first time that the interaction between one of its main models and other kind of ecological factors is studied yielding reliable results in the process.

AB  - As the scenic spot of Dongsha sea area in Nanhai Sea, it is faced with the situation of coexistence of opportunity and challenge as the scenic spot strategic water source. Firstly, the paper constructs the three objective functions of economic, social and environmental benefits of Dongsha Scenic Area in Nanhai Sea, taking the available water supply, water demand, comprehensive evaluation index of water environment, total water quality and water balance as the constraint conditions, taking the ecological environment benefit, economic and social benefit as the optimization goal to construct the multi-objective coupling model of water resources protection in Dongsha Scenic Area in Nanhai Sea, and solves the multi-objective coupling model of water resources protection by particle swarm optimization algorithm. The results show that the total value of scenic resources in Dongsha Sea area of Nanhai Sea is 80 points. After 2014, the comprehensive development level of the water resources eco-environment system in the Dongsha Sea Area of the Nanhai Sea was above 0, and maintained an upward trend. The comprehensive development level is rising rapidly, and the reduction of main pollutants in the water resource ecological environment in the Dongsha Sea Area of the Nanhai Sea is controlled.

AB  - Environmental health indicators are helpful for tracking and communicating complex health trends, informing science and policy decisions, and evaluating public health actions. When provided on a national scale, they can help inform the general public, policymakers, and public health professionals about important trends in exposures and how well public health systems are preventing those exposures from causing adverse health outcomes. There is a growing need to understand national trends in exposures and health outcomes associated with climate change and the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies for health. To date, most indicators for health implications of climate change have been designed as independent, individual metrics. This approach fails to take into account how exposure-outcome pathways for climate-attributable health outcomes involve multiple, interconnected components. We propose reframing climate change and health indicators as a linked system of indicators, which can be described as follows: upstream climate drivers affect environmental states, which then determine human exposures, which ultimately lead to health outcomes; these climate-related risks are modified by population vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies. We apply this new conceptual framework to three illustrative climate-sensitive health outcomes and associated exposure-outcome pathways: pollen allergies and asthma, West Nile virus infection, and vibriosis.

AB  - In this paper, we analyze the impact of externalities on firms' capacity to develop and implement innovations. We evaluate a Probit model containing both firm level factors and regional factors, such as the institutional environment, state support, and human capital. The dependent variable is a dummy variable reflecting the involvement of a firm in innovation activity. We employ data provided by BEEPS 2012-2014 for firm-level indicators and data provided by the Russian Federal State Statistics Service for region level indicators. The results confirm that at present the most important external factors affecting the innovation activity of Russian firms are state support, both at the firm level and at the regional level, economic situation in the region, institutions, and quality of human capital. At the same time, we found several factors such as political stability, tax policy, and investment risks to be insignificant. These results require further analysis. We also found that the impact of the factors mentioned above depends on whether a region receives state support. The results imply that a differentiated policy that considers regional characteristics will probably be more effective than a uniform policy on innovation.

AB  - The array of biomolecules generated by a functioning ecosystem represents both a potential resource for sustainable harvest and a potential indicator of ecosystem health and function. The cupped leaves of the carnivorous pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, harbor a dynamic food web of aquatic invertebrates in a fully functional miniature ecosystem. The energetic base of this food web consists of insect prey, which is shredded by aquatic invertebrates and decomposed by microbes. Biomolecules and metabolites produced by this food web are actively exchanged with the photosynthesizing plant. In this report, we provide the first proteomic characterization of the sacrophagid fly (Fletcherimyia fletcheri), the pitcher plant mosquito (Wyeomyia smithii), and the pitcher-plant midge (Metriocnemus knabi). These three arthropods act as predators, filter feeders, and shredders at distinct trophic levels within the S. purpurea food web. More than 50 proteins from each species were identified, ten of which were predominantly or uniquely found in one species. Furthermore, 19 peptides unique to one of the three species were identified using an assembled database of 100 metazoan myosin heavy chain orthologs. These molecular signatures may be useful in species monitoring within heterogeneous ecosystem biomass and may also serve as indicators of ecosystem state.

AB  - The power of total coliforms (TC), faecal coliforms (FC) and Enterococci to predict the presence of Salmonella in seawater was investigated. Indicator cut-off values with the most satisfactory combination of sensitivity and specificity in predicting Salmonella presence were 1000 CFU 100 ml(-1) TC, 200 CFU 100 ml(-1) FC, 500 CFU 100 ml(-1) Enterococci. When TC or FC were used for Salmonella prediction in logistic regression, then the addition of another indicator did not have a statistically significant effect. When Enterococci were used for prediction, then the addition of either of the two other indicators led to a statistically significant improvement (P = 0.001 for TC, P = 0.003 for FC). These results suggest that using either TC or FC alone provided an adequate indicator of Salmonella presence, but a statistically significant improvement is possible over using Enterococci alone. Concerning Enterococci, European Union limits for excellent coastal water quality (100 CFU 100 ml(-1)) and United States Environmental Protection Agency criteria for marine bathing waters (35 CFU 100 ml(-1)) have the same value in predicting Salmonella absence (92.5%).

AB  - Heavy metal pollution that results from electronic waste (e-waste) recycling activities has severe ecological environmental toxicity impacts on recycling areas. The distribution of heavy metals and the impact on the bacteria in these areas have received much attention. However, the diversity and composition of the microbial communities and the characteristics of heavy metal resistance genes (HMRGs) in the river sediments after long-term e-waste contamination still remain unclear. In this study, eight river sediment samples along a river in a recycling area were studied for the heavy metal concentration and the microbial community composition. The microbial community consisted of 13 phyla including Firmicutes (ranging from 10.45 to 36.63%), Proteobacteria (11.76 to 32.59%), Actinobacteria (14.81 to 27.45%), and unclassified bacteria. The abundance of Firmicutes increased along with the level of contaminants, while Actinobacteria decreased. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the concentration of mercury was significantly correlated with the microbial community and species distribution, which agreed with an analysis of the potential ecological risk index. Moreover, manually curated HMRGs were established, and the HMRG analysis results according to Illumina high-throughput sequencing showed that the abundance of HMRGs was positively related to the level of contamination, demonstrating a variety of resistance mechanisms to adapt, accommodate, and live under heavy metal-contaminated conditions. These findings increase the understanding of the changes in microbial communities in e-waste recycling areas and extend our knowledge of the HMRGs involved in the recovery of the ecological environment.

AB  - Greater Mumbai is one of the major sufferers of urban flood in India. In the present study, flood susceptibility zonation (FSZ) mapping of Greater Mumbai were performed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based models, evidential belief function (EBF), frequency ratio (FR), fuzzy gamma operator (FGO). For FSZ mapping, 12 conditioning factors were considered which included elevation, slope, plan curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, built-up index, geology, soil type, land use land cover, modified Fournier index, proximity to natural drainage and proximity to sewers and storm water drainage. The flood inventory database was divided into training and test data. The factor maps were integrated using GIS. The FSZ map was validated using area under curve (AUC) method. The AUC values of prediction rate using test data for FR, FGO, and EBF models were 0.7400, 0.7231 and 0.7268 respectively. The accuracy assessment of all three models shows fair prediction accuracy.

AB  - Recent studies have found that Appalachian coal mining causes increased surface water salinity, and that benthic macroinvertebrate communities in salinized mining-influenced streams differ from communities in streams draining unmined areas. Understanding the role of salinity in shaping these communities is challenging because such streams are often influenced by a variety of stressors in addition to salinity. We characterized associations of salinity with biotic condition while isolating salinity from other stressors through rigorous site selection. We used a multimetric index of biotic condition to characterize benthic macroinvertebrate communities in headwater streams in the Central Appalachian Ecoregion of Virginia across a gradient of sulfate-dominated salinity. We found strong negative seasonal correlations between biotic condition and three salinity measures (specific conductance, total dissolved solids, and SO42- concentration). We found no evidence to suggest stressors other than salinity as significant influences on biotic condition in these streams. Our results confirm negative associations of salinity with benthic macroinvertebrate community condition, as observed in other studies. Thus, our findings demonstrate that elevated salinity is an important limiting factor for biological condition in Central Appalachian headwater streams.

AB  - In order to study the effect of plant density on yield and yield components of three sunflower cultivars, an experiment was conducted in 2006-07 at Cultural Experiment and Research Centre in Isfahan. A factorial layout within randomized complete block design with three replications was used. The experimental treatments were three cultivars of sunflower Sup. Armky-19 (Sup. A), S1 Re85 (SIR) and Sup. Prrog.sh-85 (Sup. P) and four plant densities (8, 10, 12, 14 plants per m(2)) in 60 cm interval rows. The results showed that the effect of plant density was significant on number of seeds per head, 1000-seed weight, grain yield, biological yield and harvest index. The effect of cultivar was significant on 1000-Seed weight, grain yield, biological yield, harvest index and oil percentage. Sup. A cultivar had obtained the highest seed yield (3383 kg/ha), biological yield and harvest index (25.64%). The 12 plants per m(2) had obtained the highest number of seeds per head, seed yield, biological yield and harvest index. Also, Sup. A cultivar with 12 plants per m2 had high oil percentage. It seems that under Isfahan condition, 12 plants per m2 with Sup. A cultivar were suitable.

AB  - We developed a benthic macroinvertebrate index of biological integrity (B-IBI) for the semiarid and populous southern California coastal region. Potential reference sites were screened from a pool of 275 sites, first with quantitative GIS landscape analysis at several spatial scales and then with local condition assessments (in-stream and riparian) that quantified stressors acting on study reaches. We screened 61 candidate metrics for inclusion in the B-IBI based on three criteria: sufficient range for scoring, responsiveness to watershed and reach-scale disturbance gradients, and minimal correlation with other responsive metrics. Final metrics included: percent collector-gatherer + collector-filterer individuals, percent noninsect taxa, percent tolerant taxa, Coleoptera richness, predator richness, percent intolerant individuals, and EPT richness. Three metrics had lower scores in chaparral reference sites than in mountain reference sites and were scored on separate scales in the B-IBI. Metrics were scored and assembled into a composite B-IBI, which was then divided into five roughly equal condition categories. PCA analysis was used to demonstrate that the B-IBI was sensitive to composite stressor gradients; we also confirmed that the B-IBI scores were not correlated with elevation, season, or watershed area. Application of the B-IBI to an independent validation dataset (69 sites) produced results congruent with the development dataset and a separate repeatability study at four sites in the region confirmed that the B-IBI scoring is precise. The SoCal B-IBI is an effective tool with strong performance characteristics and provides a practical means of evaluating biotic condition of streams in southern coastal California.

AB  - The selection of optimal hibernation temperature (T,) was possible by bats changing both the distance at which they roosted from the mine entrance (D) (T-H versus D; r(s) = 0.73, n = 615, P < 0.001), and the height of hibernation place (H) (T-H vs. H; r(s) = 0.16, n = 412, P < 0.01). Bats were able to select areas of high relative humidity (RH) by roosting in low temperature (RH vs. TH; r(s) = -0.26, n = 366, P < 0.001) and/or by selecting hibernation places situated lower on the mine walls (RH vs. H; r(s) = -0.61, n = 280, P < 0.001). Sub-adult bats (identified by presence of the black chin spot) were found to hibernate at significantly lower temperatures (Z = -3.1, n(1) = 164, n(2) = 41, P < 0.01) and in places situated lower on the mine walls (Z = -2.2, n(1) = 164, n(2) = 41, P < 0.05) than adult individuals. In March sub-adults hibernated closer to the entrance than adult individuals (chi(2) = 8.18, d.f. = 1, P < 0.01). The difference in average body condition index between subadult and adult bats recorded in March (one-way ANOVA, F = 6.56, error d.f. = 5 1, P < 0.05) made individuals in their first year of life more prone to starvation at the end of hibernation period. In this month the significantly smaller distance of hibernation place of sub-adult individuals from the mine entrance (Z = -2.7, n(1) = 58, n(2) = 19, P < 0.01), resulted in significantly lower hibernation temperature, making them more endangered by predation of mammalian and avian species than adult bats hibernating deeper in the mine. The linear (r = 0.87, d.f. = 30, P < 0.001) relationship between body mass at the beginning and end of hibernation (November and March) of uniquely marked individuals indicates these bats did not forage in winter and their energy use was exclusively dependent on fat reserves accumulated prior to hibernation. The significant relationship between body mass in November and total mass loss (r = 0.59, d.f. = 30, P < 0.001) could indicate the possibility of existence of another factor, or group of factors, that could increase the energy use in hibernating M. daubentonii. These may include mating and/or energy costly defence against predators.

AB  - Recurring agricultural droughts are of concern to smallholder livestock farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study determined the impact of agricultural drought resilience on smallholder livestock farming households' welfare in the Frances Baard District Municipality (FBDM), in Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Interviews, more specifically survey interviews, were conducted with 207 smallholder livestock farmers. We used compensation variation, resilience index and linear regression models to analyse the data. The findings indicate that smallholder farmers who received drought relief support saw an improvement in their welfare. However, the welfare improvements varied across respondents and different gender categories, with males having higher welfare improvements relative to females. The study also found that economic capital, social capital, human capital and natural capital substantially affected the welfare of smallholder farmers. Furthermore, the study revealed that the smallholder farmers had a moderate agricultural drought resilience index, but low natural resilience capital. The study recommends that governments and non-governmental policymakers aiming to improve the welfare of smallholder farmers should focus on building their economic, social, human and capital resource bases. In this way, the smallholder farmers will be resilient in a time of climatic shock.

AB  - Parapolsky Dol is one of the largest wetlands of world importance. However, there is only fragmentary information about the species composition and structure of animal communities in this area, due to its inaccessibility. This fact determines the relevance of studying small mammals as an indicator group in Parapolsky Dol. The article deals with the results of a research on the fauna and small mammal communities of Parapolsky Dol (Koryak State Nature Reserve), carried out from 25 August to 15 September 2017. The study area included the shore of Lake Talovskoye, the floodplains of the River Tylakrylvayam and the River Ichiginnyvayams. During the period of 2735 trap-nights and 144 cylinder-nights we captured 5 small mammal species: Myodes rutilus, M. rufocanus, Sorex isodon, S. caecutiens and Ochotona hyperborea. The surveyed habitats ranged from the maximum to the minimum abundance of small mammals: the floodplain of the River Ichiginnyvayam - 10.9 individuals/100 trap-nights, 8.0 individuals /100 cylinder-nights; the shore of Lake Talovskoye - 3.48 individuals/100 trap-nights; the floodplain of the River Tylakrylvayam - 1.43 individuals/100 trap-nights. 2.53 individuals/100 cylinder-nights. The largest number of species (4) was captured in the habitats with woody vegetation and berry beds. The results of the capture by snap traps revealed the tendency of M. rutilus and S. rufocanus to dominate in most habitats. The results of the capture by cylinders show that S. caecutiens is dominant in the surveyed open habitats. All studied communities are characterised by low diversity indices, average values of dominance index, sufficiently high evenness and low sustainability. One can explain such structure of small mammal communities by the zonal and climatic conditions of the territory. The diversity/evenness structure in all the communities corresponds to that of the natural habitats in central, southern Kamchatka and Siberia. The small mammal communities on the shore of Lake Talovskoye and the floodplain of the River Ichiginnyvayam are characterised by high diversity indices, while the communities of the floodplain of the River Tylakrylvayam are distinguished by a high evenness index. We observed animal reproduction in the small mammal communities (pregnant and lactating females of different age groups were captured). The largest number of pregnant females and embryos, the highest values of reproductive success, indices of conservation and the generalised indices of well-being were identified in the small mammal communities in cedar and birch ribbon forests on the shore of Lake Talovskoye and in floodplain of the River Tylakrylvayam. In the plant associations Ledum decumbens + Vaccinium uliginosum - Cladonia sp. + Cladina sp., and Ledum decumbens + Vaccinium uliginosum - Sphagnum sp. we did not observe any reproduction. The material of this research work supplement the data on the fauna and population structure of small mammals in Parapolsky Dol.

AB  - An index of Chihuahuan floristic affinity was constructed to characterize the floristic variation over a 5degrees latitudinal gradient in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, with an emphasis on evaluating northern boundary conditions. The index was based on evaluating the ranges of 494 species from 590 vegetation plots from Bouteloua eriopoda and B. gracilis grasslands and Larrea tridentata scrub, distributed among four sites along the gradient. The most northern site, the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (34degreesN latitude), while maintaining a complement of primarily southern distributed species, had the lowest index values and the fewest Chihuahuan endemics (3%) and Southwestern desert species (19%) in general. At the intermediate sites (Jornada/Tularosa basins and Otero Mesa), one and two degrees further south, index values increased conspicuously along with number of Chihuahuan endemics (7%) and the Southwestern desert species (37%). At 29degreesN latitude, the Sierra del Carmen Protected Area in northern Mexico was the furthest southern site. It represented typical hot and dry Chihuahuan Desert conditions where Chihuahuan endemics comprised 29% of species complement and Southwestern desert species made up 55%. With respect to floristic boundaries, the Sevilleta was clearly transitional to the southern Shortgrass Prairie and Intermountain (Great Basin-Colorado Plateau) provinces. While it supported several grassland and shrubland associations that maintained their overall Chihuahuan character, there were also several associations with primarily northern affinities, and also a set unique to the Sevilleta, reflecting its ecotonal nature. The results show that sound biosystematics, biogeographical analyses and indices like those presented here can provide an important context for questions in synecology, plant ecology, and conservation biology.

AB  - The status of woody plants in dry-land systems is a fundamental determinant of key ecosystem processes. Monitoring of this status plays an important role in understanding the dynamics of woody plants in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. The present study determined the dynamism of the Zagros forests in Iran using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques and statistical science. The results show that the density of trees varied from 10 to 53 % according to the physiographic and climatic conditions of semi-arid regions. The best and lowest correlation between vegetation indices and forest density were obtained for the global environmental monitoring index (GEMI; R (2) = 0.94) and soil adjust vegetation index (R (2) = 0.81), respectively. GEMI is used to monitor land use changes over a 10-year period. Results show that 2720 ha(2) of forest have been destroyed by human interference and tillage on steep slopes during this period which also resulted in the loss of the fertile soil layer. GEMI determined the areas with a biomass of trees and could normally separate border regions with low biomass density of trees from regions without canopy cover. The results revealed that assessment of forest and vegetation cover in arid and semi-arid arduous forest regions using satellite digital numbers and ordinary sampling is subject to uncertainty. A stratified grouping procedure should be established to increase the accuracy of assessment.

AB  - Similarity between assemblages can be explained by environmental and geographic distances, which are directly linked to environmental filtering and dispersal capacity of the species, respectively. Floodplains are typically heterogeneous, creating a situation where environmentally similar habitat patches are more distant geographically than environmentally different ones, what aids the understanding of the importance of each distance to assemblage similarity. Furthermore, flow type and macrophyte presence are important habitat features that influence both environmental conditions and dispersion of species. Thus, we aimed to investigate the influence of these distances on fish assemblage similarity in a Neotropical floodplain, controlling for macrophyte presence and habitat flow. We tested our predictions using three rivers in Upper Parana River floodplain (Baia, Ivinhema and Parana rivers). First, we tested the difference in fish assemblage similarity considering the three factors (flow, macrophyte presence and river) with a PERMANOVA on presence-absence data. We then correlated assemblage similarity (indexed by Jaccard similarity) to environmental distance (indexed by Gower dissimilarity) and geographic distances between sites (in km). Regarding the importance of the environmental heterogeneity, the presence of the macrophytes in lentic environments changed significantly the fish fauna while in semilotic environments, assemblages in sites with and without macrophytes were similar. Both geographic and environmental distances were correlated with similarity in lentic sites and in the absence of macrophytes. With macrophytes and in semilotic environments, the effects of these distances were not significant, because these factors act like environmental filters to pre-adapted species, independently of the dispersal distance.

AB  - Knowledge about the response of root biomass and root system architecture (RSA) to soil conditions would increase efficiency in selecting high performance crop varieties and predicting the impact of rotations on long-term soil organic matter (SOM) stock. We evaluated the effect of variety and site on maize (Zea mays L.) root growth. Two-dimensional (2D) and 3D techniques were used to quantify changes of RSA. Commercial maize varieties were grown in three sites with typical soil types for maize cultivation in Belgium. We observed that at Merelbeke, above- and belowground biomass and root-to-shoot ratios (R/S) were larger compared to those at Ravels. Both factors interactively influenced an index of biological stability (ISB) based on biochemical quality of the roots. There were also more fine roots at Merelbeke than at Bassevelde and Ravels. Together with a lower ISB value, this suggests that site had an inherent effect on root biochemical quality. We conclude that a strong impact of site exists on both above- and belowground biomass; however, they are not necessarily correlated. With a fixed R/S, predictions of root biomass were misestimated in one half of the cases. This complex response of root phenotyping to varying soil conditions should not be overlooked.

AB  - This study aims at identifying multi-source heavy metal pollution from natural and anthropogenic sources using a regression model, principal component analysis, and five different indices (geo-accumulation index (Igeo), the modified degree of contamination, pollution load index (PLI), enrichment factor, and ecological risk factor. Results revealed that: (1) although the average concentrations of soil heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, Hg, As, Zn) were generally low, Hg, As, and Cr concentrations exceeded national standard values by approximately 0.91, 1.84, and 0.91 times with maximum concentrations up to 0.41, 78.6, and 175.2 mu g/g, respectively; (2) PLI results showed that the industrial park and Wucaiwan open coal mining area were the most polluted (PLI of 1.98, 1.71). The potential ecological hazards index indicated that the E-i(r) of three heavy metals (Cu, Hg, As) in the soil were relatively high, presenting potential ecological risk factors of 74.89, 16.71, 4.15%, respectively; (3) stepwise regression model and principal component analysis suggest that Cu and Zn were primarily effected by the natural geological condition and atmospheric dust fall. Cr, Hg, Pb are mainly derived from anthropogenic sources, particularly coal mining activities and industrial sources. Results of this research have some significant implications for heavy metal pollution prevention and the sustainable development of the economy and ecology of arid regions in China.

AB  - Benthic macroalgal communities constitute one of the ecological quality elements needed to implement the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), the legislation targetted at sustainable management of the European aquatic environment. As the Directive foresees the establishment of Ecological Status Class boundaries and Reference Conditions in coastal waters, a study was conducted on the Attica coast of Greece to identify the best method to use macroalgal community data for evaluating ecological quality and at the same time keep the program within a low budget. Six seasonal quantitative and qualitative samples were taken from the upper infralittoral macroalgal communities on the Attica coast of Greece on six occasions between summer 1998 and spring 2002; these sites, which reflect a gradient of anthropogenic perturbation, were used on each occasion. A list of 60 macroalgal taxa was prepared, the cover value of each taxon was measured and the structure of the vegetation was described. The use of four different indices (Shannon-Weaver index, Pielou evenness, Multi-Dimensional Scaling plot of Bray-Curtis similarity, Ecological Evaluation index-EEI) were compared. The multidimensional scaling of Bray-Curtis similarity and the EEI were better at indicating the perturbation pattern of the study area. However, only the EEI succeeded in distinguishing four quality classes ('low' to 'high'). By using EEI, a spatial scale-weighted evaluation of ecological quality was also performed.

AB  - In Germany, 70% of the drinking water demand is met by groundwater, for which the quality is the product of multiple physical-chemical and biological processes. As healthy groundwater ecosystems help to provide clean drinking water, it is necessary to assess their ecological conditions. This is particularly true for densely populated urban areas, where faunistic groundwater investigations are still scarce. The aim of this study is, therefore, to provide a first assessment of the groundwater fauna in an urban area. Thus, we examine the ecological status of an anthropogenically influenced aquifer by analysing fauna in 39 groundwater monitoring wells in the city of Karlsruhe (Germany). For classification, we apply the groundwater ecosystem status index (GESI), in which a threshold of more than 70% of crustaceans and less than 20% of oligochaetes serves as an indication for very good and good ecological conditions. Our study reveals that only 35% of the wells in the residential, commercial and industrial areas and 50% of wells in the forested area fulfil these criteria. However, the study did not find clear spatial patterns with respect to land use and other anthropogenic impacts, in particular with respect to groundwater temperature. Nevertheless, there are noticeable differences in the spatial distribution of species in combination with abiotic groundwater characteristics in groundwater of the different areas of the city, which indicate that a more comprehensive assessment is required to evaluate the groundwater ecological status in more detail. In particular, more indicators, such as groundwater temperature, indicator species, delineation of site-specific characteristics and natural reference conditions should be considered.

AB  - Application of a sentinel species-based population evaluation using creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), a common minnow in eastern North America, could provide a framework for environmental assessments and focus future research in small streams. Analysis of creek chub endpoints (growth, condition, fecundity) was based on an assessment framework for white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) populations (Gibbons & Munkittrick, 1994). We evaluated creek chub and fish community endpoints simultaneously in two streams with differing degrees of urbanization, agriculture, and thermal regimes during spring, summer, and fall. Fish from the more altered stream appear to be suffering from a feeding-based niche shift, and demonstrate reproductive anomalies suggestive of exposure to some unknown sublethal stressor(s). Fish community assessments identified modified habitat and water quality but did not detect the presence of any additional stressor(s). Similarity in fish community and population responses, widespread distribution of creek chub, limited within-stream movements, and the ability of this species to populate even the smallest streams where the resident fish community may be depauperate and fish community-type assessments limited, makes the potential use of creek chub as a monitor for small streams promising over a wide geographic zone.

AB  - Grain quality parameters of winter common wheat under the influence of ha/Ha (hard vs. Soft) genes, determining grain hardness vs. grain softness, as well as genotypes for the Wx-A1, Wx-B1, and Wx-D1 genes, responsible for either amylose or amylopectin type of endosperm starch, were examined. The influence of environmental conditions on the formation of these parameters in different wheat genotypes during grain ripening was demonstrated. It was demonstrated that the grain softness in comparison with the grain hardness and amylopectin form led to a considerable decrease in water absorption capacity (Absorption) of the grain. The environment affects variation of this trait in amylose genotypes, but does not affect absorption in amylopectin forms. Differences in grain hardness affected the gluten parameter, but showed no response to the environmental influence. Genotypes differing in Wx genes had no hereditary effect on this parameter. The influence of environment factors on the formation of this parameter was revealed. In the years favorable for the wheat grain ripening, the values of viscosity and retrogradation indices were considerably lower in amylopectin forms compared to amylose ones. In the conditions of increased humidity during this period, the differences between these groups of genotypes are smoothed out, and very low viscosity and retrogradation index values are observed. Unlike environmental factors, the differences in grain hardness had no effect on these grain quality parameters. The amylase index in amylopectin forms was stable over the years and did not vary in this group of genotypes and also did not differ from that in amylose genotypes. The response of this index to environmental conditions in the groups of amylose-type cultivars was observed. In the years with the weather conditions favorable for wheat ripening, the viscosity index can be used for identification of amylopectin genotypes.

AB  - Genypterus blacodes is a bento-demersal species endemic of the southern hemisphere distributed in Chile, Argentina, New Zealand and southern Australia. In the Chilean Patagonia (41 degrees 00'S and 57 degrees 00'S), information in relation to life history traits was assessed on the basis of individuals collected from open sea, whereas knowledge of basic biological attributes on this species in inner channels and fjords is very scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the maturity aspects in female pink tusk-eel based on samples collected inside fjords and inner channels during research surveys conducted in spring. Histological and gonometric (a staging method based on gonadosomatic index) analysis of the gonads collected was performed to estimate the maturity ogive. In addition, batch fecundity was estimated using the gravimetric method and gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index and condition factor were computed. Results show that maturity ogives were different (P<0.05) between administrative areas of the Patagonia, in which individuals from the northern zone (41 degrees 00'S and 47 degrees 00'S) mature at smaller sizes in comparison with the southern zone (47 degrees 00'S and 57 degrees 00'S). These results confirmed previous latitudinal gradients in life history traits reported on this species. Likewise, estimated batch fecundity was comparable to previous estimates reported using individuals collected from open sea. The presence of skipped spawning and females with low fecundity confirms this species has low resilience to fishing exploitation. We discuss how habitat temperature and food availability are key factors in shaping the latitudinal variations of maturation rate for this species.

AB  - Today, commercial microwave radiometer profilers (MWRPs) are robust and unattended instruments providing real-time, accurate atmospheric observations at similar to 1 min temporal resolution under nearly all weather conditions. Common commercial units operate in the 20-60 GHz frequency range and are able to retrieve profiles of temperature, vapour density, and relative humidity. Temperature and humidity profiles retrieved from MWRP data are used here to feed tools developed for processing radiosonde observations to obtain values of forecast indices (FIs) commonly used in operational meteorology. The FIs considered here include K index, total totals, KO index, Showalter index, T1 gust, fog threat, lifted index, S index (STT), Jefferson index, microburst day potential index (MDPI), Thompson index, TQ index, and CAPE (convective available potential energy). Values of FIs computed from radiosonde and MWRP-retrieved temperature and humidity profiles are compared in order to quantitatively demonstrate the level of agreement and the value of continuous FI updates. This analysis is repeated for two sites at midlatitude, the first one located at low altitude in central Europe (Lindenberg, Germany) and the second one located at high altitude in North America (Whistler, Canada). It is demonstrated that FIs computed from MWRPs well correlate with those computed from radiosondes, with the additional advantage of nearly continuous updates. The accuracy of MWRP-derived FIs is tested against radiosondes, taken as a reference, showing different performances depending upon index and environmental situation. Overall, FIs computed from MWRP retrievals agree well with radiosonde values, with correlation coefficients usually above 0.8 (with few exceptions). We conclude that MWRP retrievals can be used to produce meaningful FIs, with the advantage (with respect to radiosondes) of nearly continuous updates.

AB  - Physical modifications leading to a homogenization of previously diverse littoral habitats increasingly affect the ecological integrity of lake shores in urban landscapes. The European Water Framework Directive (EU WFD) requires integrative assessment of the ecological status of lake ecosystems including lake shore assessment aimed at reaching good ecological status (GES). The ecological consequences of lake shore modifications can be assessed site-specifically by ecological assessment tools based on benthic invertebrates in compliance with the EU WFD. However, it still remains unclear which percentage of the lake shore may be morphologically altered until whole-lake ecological status is affected. We studied a peri-urban lake with similar to 50% of the shoreline altered by urban developments and recreational facilities and the other 50% still remaining in a near-natural, undeveloped state. We assessed the ecological status of each shore type using the Littoral Invertebrate Multimetric Index based on Composite Sampling (LIMCO). Additionally, we used data of a physical habitat survey conducted for each 100-m section within the 12-km long shoreline. We extrapolated site-specific biological assessments to the whole shore length based on pressure-response regressions using physical survey data. Our results showed an overall 'moderate' whole-lake ecological status and consequently the present share of near -natural shoreline is not sufficient to reach GES as required by the EU WFD. GES may be obtained by either further improving existing near -natural shorelines, or by revitalizing developed shorelines. Thus, our approach allows for the quantification of the amount of restoration necessary to derive EU WFD-compliant management objectives for lake shores subjected to human use.

AB  - Thapsigargin is a major terpenoid constituent of Thapsia garganica root. Owing to its potent antagonistic effect on the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, thapsigargin has been widely used to study Ca2+ signalling and is also a potential drug for prostate cancer. Despite its importance, thapsigargin biosynthesis in T. garganica remains unknown. In order to decipher thapsigargin biosynthesis, deep transcript sequencing (454 and Illumina) of the T. garganica root was performed, and two terpene synthases (TgTPS1/2) were identified. Functional characterization of their encoded enzymes in a metabolically engineered yeast revealed that TgTPS1 synthesized delta-cadinene, whereas TgTPS2 produced ten distinct terpenoids. However, cultivation of the TgTPS2-expressing yeast in pH-maintained conditions (pH 6-7) yielded one major oxygenated sesquiterpenoid, suggesting that formation of multiple terpenoids was caused by acidity. The major terpene product from TgTPS2 was identified as 6 beta-hydroxygermacra-1(10),4-diene (kunzeaol) by mass-fragmentation pattern, retention index, the nature of its acid-induced degradation and NMR. Also, recombinant TgTPS2 efficiently catalysed the synthesis of kunzeaol in vitro from farnesyl diphosphate with a K-m of 2.6 mu M and a k(cat) of 0.03 s(-1). The present paper is the first report of a kunzeaol synthase, and a mechanism for the transformation of kunzeaol into the thapsigargin backbone is proposed.

AB  - Rapid urbanization threatens the biota of streams and rivers around the globe. Efforts to manage urban streams traditionally take an engineering approach focused on stormwater runoff, physical channel condition, and chemical water quality. Our objective was to use the biology of streams - measured with the multimetric benthic index of biological integrity (B-IBI) based on benthic macroinvertebrates - to assess stream health. From 1997 to 1999, we sampled invertebrates at 45 sites in second- and third-order streams in the Puget Sound lowlands of Washington State. Land cover upstream of each site was characterized by analysis of a 1998 satellite image. We evaluated associations between five land cover categories and biological condition across three spatial scales. The relationships between B-IBI ( and its component metrics) and stream substrate and hydrologic features were also analyzed at a subset of sites. Across all study sites, B-IBI declined as the percentage of urban land cover increased (r < -0.71, p < 0.001, n > 31). Most metrics were better predicted by sub-basin rather than local-scale urbanization. Within individual basins, however, local land-cover urbanization and B-IBI were strongly correlated (r = -0.91, p < 0.001, n = 9). The biological condition of a site was also related to measures of hydrologic alteration and stream substrate. The aquatic biota is sensitive to a variety of urban effects, expressed at both large and small spatial scales. Biological assessment tools such as B-IBI can identify areas of excellent biological condition for conservation and guide the design and evaluation of efforts to restore the biota of degraded streams.

AB  - North Creek of Jiulong River is characterized by large falls and a high degree of cascade-driven hydropower development. In this paper, ecological health assessments for North Creek of Jiulong River were carried out by a field survey of seasonal phytoplankton community structure dynamics and constructing an index system, the planktonic index of biotic integrity, P-IBI, to compare ecosystem health across different seasons. North Creek were relatively healthy in the summer and fall, but exhibited the worst conditions in the winter. With the exception of fall samples, the assessments for more than 50% of the sites in the dam reservoir area were lower than "moderate." Further, the ecological health of the mainstream was lower than that of the tributaries. The PIBI index across different seasons was correlated with some basic water physicochemical parameters (chlorophyll a, COD and DO concentrations). Importantly, these assessment results were consistent with actual water quality monitoring results, indicating that it is feasible to use P-IBI to evaluate river health status. The assessment of seasonal changes in algal community health is helpful for developing management strategies for rivers with multiple dams.

AB  - In polygynous mammals, sex-specific patterns of body growth are linked to divergent selection pressures on male and female body size, resulting in sexual dimorphism (SD). For males, reproductive success is generally linked to body size, hence, males should prioritise early growth. For females, reproductive success is linked to resource availability, so they may adopt a more conservative growth tactic. Using longitudinal monitoring of known-age animals in two contrasting populations and an allometric approach to disentangle the relative contribution of structural size and physiological condition to SD, we addressed these issues in the weakly polygynous roe deer. Despite very different environmental conditions, we found remarkably similar patterns in the two populations in the mass-size allometric relationship at each life history stage, suggesting that relative allocation to structural size and physiological condition is highly constrained. SD in structural size (indexed by hind foot length) involved sex-specific growth trajectories governed by a single mass-size allometric relationship during the juvenile stage, such that males were both bigger and heavier than females. In contrast, SD in physiological condition (indexed by the allometric relationship between body mass and hind foot length, expressed as body mass for a given body size) developed markedly during the sub-adult stage in relation to sex differences in the timing of first reproduction. Among adults, males were heavier for a given size than females, suggesting that, relative to females, males express a capital breeder tactic, accumulating fat reserves to off set reproductive costs. By the senescent stage, SD in physiological condition had disappeared, with both sexes governed by a single allometric relationship, suggesting more rapid senescence in males than females. Individuals born into poor cohorts were generally lighter for a given size, indicating growth priority for skeletal size over physiological condition in both sexes. However, sex differences in cohort effects among sub-adults resulted in lower size-specific SD in poor cohorts, indicating that body condition of sub-adult females is buffered against environmental harshness. We conclude that sex-differences in reproductive tactics impose constraints on the ontogeny of SD in roe deer, leading to sex-specific trajectories in structural size and physiological condition.

LA  - English
AB  - John O'Neill, Alan Holland, and Andrew Light usefully distinguish two ways of thinking about environmental values, namely, end-state and historical views. To value nature in an end-state way is to value it because it instantiates certain properties, such as complexity or diversity. In contrast, a historical view says that nature's value is (partly) determined by its particular history. Three contemporary defenses of a historical view need to be clarified: (1) the normatively relevant history; (2) how historical considerations are supposed to instruct environmental decision making; and (3) the relative importance of historical and end-state considerations. There are multiple reasons for including historical considerations in an account of environmental values. For example, knowledge of a natural object's history can add depth and texture to our appreciation of that object. Further, if we were blind to the relevant history, we could not adequately understand and defend environmental policy goals such as preserving the potentials of natural systems or maintaining ecological health, for these goals appear to have irreducibly historical aspects. While historical considerations are important, such considerations are insufficient to guide our normative thinking about nature and how it should be dealt with practically. But they succeed in broadening and deepening our understanding of the nature and sources of environmental value.

AB  - Dipnet (DN) sampling is routinely employed for macroinvertebrate bioassessments in wetlands, but it has been demonstrated that some taxa are more effectively collected with activity traps (AT). The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) used both DN and AT methods to evaluate the biological condition of depressional wetlands in the Mixed Wood Plains (MWP) and Temperate Prairies (TP) ecoregions. Two indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) were developed for each ecoregion using: 1) DN data alone and 2) composite samples consisting of both DN and AT data. ATs collected more active taxa such as diving beetles and swimming Hemiptera. DNs collected more taxa and collected more skating taxa and those associated with sediment or vegetation. A comparison of the effectiveness of the IBIs to evaluate biological condition indicated that the composite data had a slightly better relationship with anthropogenic disturbance and was marginally more precise. A comparison of sampling and processing costs revealed that sampling using composite samples was 130 % greater and processing was 50 % greater compared to DN-only samples. Based on the cost and limited benefit of adding AT samples, a DN-only sampling protocol is recommended to assess biological condition in depressional wetlands.

AB  - There has been a significant increase in efforts to improve environmental data sharing practices in the past decade. One such initiative is the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS), initiated by the European Commission in 2008, as part of a process to facilitate regular environmental assessments and State-of-the-Environment Reporting (SOER). Using SEIS as a case study example, this paper takes its departure from the 8th Environment for Europe (EFE) Ministerial conference to identify ongoing processes and challenges surrounding environmental data and information sharing. The paper relies on data obtained for the 2016 report on progress in establishing SEIS in support of regular reporting in the pan-European region. The article demonstrates a number of gaps with regards to the availability and accessibility of certain environmental datasets and indicators and highlights the suboptimal use of information, where comprehensive data flows and high-quality information is not being used adequately in support of policymaking or where there is selective use of environmental indicators. Against this background, questions arise as to whether applied models for data sharing can be implemented with equal success across different regions and countries that are characterized by heterogeneous and complex data practices and data flows. Most importantly, results from the SEIS progress report demonstrate the pressing need for a better understanding of environmental data types, data packaging and data flows across multiples contexts, epistemic cultures and policy making.

AB  - This paper employs an analytical method to analyze vibration of piezoelectric coupled thick annular functionally graded plates (FGPs) subjected to different combinations of soft simply supported, hard simply supported and clamped boundary conditions at the inner and outer edges of the annular plate on the basis of the Reddy's third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT). The properties of host plate are graded in the thickness direction according to a volume fraction power-law distribution. The distribution of electric potential along the thickness direction in the piezoelectric layer is assumed as a sinusoidal function so that the Maxwell static electricity equation is approximately satisfied. The differential equations of motion are solved analytically for various boundary conditions of the plate. in this study closed-form expressions for characteristic equations, displacement components of the plate and electric potential are derived for the first time in the literature. The present analysis is validated by comparing results with those in the literature and then natural frequencies of the piezoelectric coupled annular FG plate are presented in tabular and graphical forms for different thickness-radius ratios, inner-outer radius ratios, thickness of piezoelectric, material of piezoelectric, power index and boundary conditions.

AB  - Widespread alteration of flow regimes requires guidelines for the protection of river ecosystems based on sound science. Preservation of the biodiversity within river ecosystems and sustaining natural ecological functions are key aspects of their management. However, the relationship between the biota and flow-related phenomena is poorly understood and, as a consequence, over-simplistic hydrology-based guidelines for river management have been adopted without establishing clear indicators of success. In the present paper, we aim to support the improvement of guidelines for flow (current velocity) management by developing a flow sensitivity index based on macroinvertebrates for Canadian rivers. Using benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) samples collected by the Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network (CABIN), current velocity preferences for the 55 most common invertebrate taxa across a range of reference and potential reference sites were derived. A Canadian Ecological Flow Index (CEFI) was developed based on these preferences. By testing the index against independent data, CEFI was found to respond mainly to changes in hydraulic conditions, and was minimally influenced by confounding factors (e. g. stream type, organic enrichment). The index was further validated using two independent data sets from the west and east of Canada, suggesting countrywide applicability of the method. In conclusion, we have developed a practical approach to evaluate relationships between hydrological regime and an important component of the river biota, permitting the development of an index which has good potential as an indicator for the effects of flow alteration. Moreover, we outline how the CEFI could be used as a tool for the development of holistic guidelines for the estimation of riverine flow needs.

AB  - Methods to quantify biodiversity impacts through life cycle assessment (LCA) are evolving for both land- and marine-based production systems, although typically independently from each other. An indicator for terrestrial food production systems that may be suitable to assess marine biodiversity, and is applicable across all food production systems, is a measure of hemeroby or distance from the natural state. We explore the possibility of adapting this approach to marine systems to assess the impact of fishing on seawater column and seafloor systems.
   The terrestrial hemeroby concept is adapted here for marine ecosystems. Two commercial fishery case studies are used to trial the effectiveness of hemeroby in measuring the influence exerted by fishing practices on marine biodiversity. Available inventory data are used to score areas to a hemeroby class, following a semi-quantitative scoring matrix and a seven-point scale, to determine how far the seafloor and seawater column are from their natural state. Assessment can progress to the impact assessment stage involving characterisation of the hemeroby score, to determine the Naturalness Degradation Potential (NDP) for use in calculating the Naturalness Degradation Indicator (NDI). The method builds on well-established processes for assessing fisheries within the ecosystem-based fisheries management framework and is designed to enhance assessment of fishing impacts within LCA.
   Australian fisheries case studies were used to demonstrate the application of this method. The naturalness of these fisheries was scored to a hemeroby level using the scoring matrix. The seafloor of the Northern Prawn Fishery and the seawater column of the South Australian Sardine Fishery were both classified as partially close to nature. Impact assessment was carried out following the process outlined for the NDI. The naturalness degradation results were highly sensitive to area calculation method and data. There was also variation in results when using annual or averaged data for catch. Results should therefore be interpreted in the context of these sensitivities.
   Adaptation of the hemeroby concept to marine habitats may present an opportunity for more informed comparison of impacts between terrestrial and marine systems. Incorporating a measure of naturalness into assessments of food production can be useful to better understand the cost, in terms of transforming ecosystems from natural to more artificial, of meeting growing food demand. Biodiversity is a broad concept not easily captured through one indicator, and this method can complement emerging biotic LCA indicators, to provide a suite of indicators capable of capturing the full impact of fishing on marine biodiversity.

AB  - A better understanding of the relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment is necessary to guide sustainable urban development and formulate environmental policies. In this study, the city of Qingdao was taken as an example. We evaluated the quantitative evolution of the relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment development from 2000 to 2018 by establishing the comprehensive index system and applying it to the coupling coordination model. Results showed the following: (1) The economic urbanization and eco-environment states offer the greatest contribution to the urbanization and eco-environment systems, respectively. (2) The coupling coordination relationship between urbanization and eco-environment conforms to an S-shaped curve, and the two systems have gradually moved from a "seriously uncoordinated and urbanization lag" stage at the beginning into a "good coordination and eco-environment lag" stage by the end of the research period. (3) Finally, the economic urbanization and response subsystems are essential determinants in the coupling relationship between urbanization and eco-environment. The research results can help the government better understand the complex coupling relationship and then formulate sustainable urbanization development strategies to better balance urbanization and eco-environmental protection.

AB  - Continuous increase in the sale and indiscriminate consumption of packaged drinking waters in Nigeria is of public health significance. One hundred and eight samples comprising 16 bottled and 20 sachet water brands purchased randomly all over Ibadan and Ile-Ife cities in South Western Nigeria were analysed for presence of bacterial indicators of water quality. Total heterotrophic bacteria plate counts (HPC) ranged from 2 to 150 for bottled water and 5 to 200 for sachet water brands. One brand of bottled water and eight brands of sachet water had mean HPC greater than 100 per ml millilitre water and thus fell below the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and World Health Organisation (WHO) dinking water standard of 100 HPC per millilitre water. Total coliforms and Escherichia coli were detected in only one brand of bottled water. All brands of sachet water (100%) had total coliforms, four brands (20%) had presence of E. coli while Enterococcus faecalis was recovered from two (10%) of the brands. Most of the sachet water brands fell below WHO drinking water standards and are therefore of doubtful quality. Efforts need to be intensified in the monitoring of activities in this rapidly expanding industry with a view to raising standards.

AB  - Self-excited combustion instabilities in a high pressure, single-element, lean, premixed, natural gas (NG) dump-combustor are investigated. The combustor is designed for optical access and instrumented with high frequency pressure transducers at multiple axial locations. A parametric survey of operating conditions including inlet air temperature and equivalence ratio has been performed, resulting in a wide range of pressure fluctuation amplitudes (p') of the mean chamber pressure (pCH). Two representative cases, flames A and B with p'/pCH = 23% and p'/pCH = 12%, respectively, both presenting self-excited instabilities at the fundamental longitudinal (1L) mode of the combustion chamber, are discussed to study the coupling mechanism between flame-vortex interactions and the acoustic field in the chamber. 10 kHz OH*-chemiluminescence imaging was performed to obtain a map of the global heat release distribution. Phase conditioned and Rayleigh index analysis as well as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is performed to highlight the contrasting mechanisms that lead to the two distinct instability regimes. Flame interactions with shear layer vortex structures downstream of the backward-facing step of the combustion chamber are found to augment the instability magnitude. Flame A engages strongly in this coupling, whereas flame B is less affected and establishes a lower amplitude limit cycle.

AB  - Nowadays, most of the analysis on thermal comfort in the agricultural environment, with particular reference to animal production environments, use indexes that allow the evaluation of the thermal stress level of a given location by means of climatological variables. For the resolution of these indexes there is currently no specific computational system that provides, in loco, the thermal condition of an environment. Thus, the present study aimed to develop a computational system capable of evaluating the thermal comfort of animal production facilities and human work environments. The system was based on the development of an application for smartphones and Android tablets, and the creation of a low cost portable device to measure climatological variables such as air temperature, black globe temperature and relative humidity. The portable device was developed based on the Arduino ATmega1280 microcontroller, along with temperature and relative humidity sensors. The android app was used together with the portable device in two environments, an office and a pig facility. The system showed to be functional in obtaining an in loco diagnosis of thermal comfort of the environments, in which measurements of air temperature, relative humidity and black globe temperature were collected and sent to the application that calculated THI and BGHI. The development of the Android application and portable device can be considered as a low-cost alternative solution for evaluations and monitoring of thermal comfort of animals and people.

The hydrography data used in the present analysis were collected over a wide area of the western part of CIB (71 degrees -79 degrees E; 9 degrees -14 degreesS) during austral summer (January 1997) from the Indian research vessel ORV Sagar Kanya, while during the austral winter season (June-July 1997), hydrographical stations were occupied by Russian research vessel RV Yuzhmorgeologia in the central part of CIB (75 degrees -77 degreesE; 9 degrees -11 degreesS) where a benthic disturbance on experimental scale was carried out. The spatial variations in the physical parameters decreased below 3500 m, inferring a restricted basin-scale deep circulation. The dynamic topography field at 5000 m relative to 2000 db surface in the central part of CIB, representing the abyssal circulation, was generally characterized by a southwestward weak flow around 10 degreesS flanked by cyclonic and anti-cyclonic eddies on its right and left sides, respectively. This flow regime agreed with the earlier one inferred by Warren (J. Mar. Res. 40 (1982) 823) linking the source of deep water in CIB to a saddle overflow across Ninetyeast Ridge from West Australian Basin around 10 degreesS. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - We developed a watershed index of biotic integrity that used whole watershed variables for metrics rather than site-specific variables. We used the index to evaluate the biological health of 100 watersheds in the Sierra Nevada of California. The inner scores, which were based on various measures of distribution and abundance of native fish and frogs, indicated that 7 of the watersheds were in excellent condition (high biotic health), 36 were in good to very good condition 48 were in fair condition, and 9 were in poor condition. The biggest factors contributing to low index scores were large dams and introduced fishes, although measures of road density and indicators of intensity of use of terrestrial habitats were also important. Large areas of the Sierra Nevada that were once fishless now contain trout in most waters, anadromous fishes are excluded from many streams from which they were once abundant assemblages of native fishes have been disrupted, and ranid frogs have been extirpated from many areas All watersheds in the Sierra Nevada have thus experienced loss of biotic integrity, but some have suffered much less than others Evaluations of the biotic integrity of watersheds over wide regions can help managers set priorities for watershed-oriented systems of aquatic conservation and provide starting places for more-intensive studies.

AB  - This article introduces multi-agent strategy enabling multiple agents to explore an unknown environment with many obstacles, while generating a topological map in a cooperative way. Once a topological map is built, it can be used for various purposes, such as path planning or intruder capture. Multiple agents generate a Voronoi graph as a topological map of the environment, while dropping indexed markers at Voronoi vertices. Each agent has range sensors to detect nearby obstacles, thus can move along a Voronoi edge. Also, each agent stores the boundary for the explored region thus far, and unite its boundary with the boundary of another agent if some conditions are met. In this way, multiple agents can explore the entire workspace in a time efficient manner. The proposed exploration strategy doesn't require localization of an agent or a marker in global coordinate systems. To the best of our knowledge, this article is unique in addressing a multi-agent exploration and map building strategy, such that each agent drops indexed markers for generating a topological map of the environment. The effectiveness of the proposed exploration and mapping strategy is demonstrated utilizing MATLAB simulations.

AB  - Healthy river ecosystems are conducive to the sustainable use of water resources. As the climate change and human activities become more intense, the integrity of such ecosystems is seriously threatened. The maintenance of enough environmental flow (e-flow) for river ecosystems is the most effective way of protecting river health. Accurately and reasonably estimating e-flow is essential for river health maintenance. So far, few methods can quantitatively verify the e-flow results calculated by various e-flow methods, which reduces the success rate of ecological restoration projects on a global scale. Therefore, the Tennant method, wetted perimeter (WP) method, and adapted ecological hydraulic radius (AEHRA) method have been recognized by many scholars. The article used the combination of these three methods to calculate the e-flow and its meeting rate (actual flow/e-flow) and formed a new framework to verify e-flow results. First, the Shannon diversity index, index of biological integrity (IBI), and river health index are used to evaluate river health status. Then, we studied the relationship between e-flow meeting rates and three indices using field monitoring data on hydrology, water quality, and biological communities. Finally, we investigated the effects of different e-flow calculation methods on river health. Results show that the e-flow in the centre of the study area calculated by the Tennant and WP methods are relatively high (48.33-317 m(3)/s), whereas lower e-flow (0.03-21 m(3)/s) are observed in its southern and northern parts. The e-flow in the southern mountain area calculated by the AEHRA method (1.42 m(3)/s) is higher than those in the other regions determined by the same method. Furthermore, the highest values of river health-the Shannon diversity index (3.19), IBI (67.47), and river health index (0.65)-appear in mountainous areas that are less affected by human activities. The lowest values appear in the urban areas with river health values (0.97, 14.54, and 0.45, respectively) with high population density. For the river health scores, the values of the Shannon diversity index and IBI first increase and then decrease with the increase in the e-flow meeting rates. The values of river health index continuously increase with the increase in the WP- and AEHRA-calculated e-flow meeting rate and fluctuate with the increase of Tennant-calculated e-flow meeting rate. We concluded that the adoption of WP- and AEHRA-calculated e-flow values can maintain the health of river ecosystems with a certain degree of pollution, whereas the Tennant-calculated e-flow can only ensure the health of river ecosystems with little pollution, the reason for which is the pollution-affected relationships between river biota communities and stream flows, and the Tennant method uses historical stream flow records to calculate e-flow. WP and AEHRA methods, on the other hand, do not rely on flow records. The methodologies and results can provide a scientific basis for the selection of suitable e-flow methods and therefore facilitate the projects for ecological river restoration.

AB  - In this work, we examine the factors predicting the perception of three distinct risks, namely "Algae growth", "Chemical pollution" and "Changes to ecosystems", to the water environment of each European Union Member State. We utilize a novel dataset that combines a Europe-wide Eurobarometer poll on water-related issues and a database of water quality indicators, water stressors and impacts compiled for the European Environment Agency (EEA) under the Water Information System for Europe (WISE). We utilize a three-level logistic regression model with the 2nd and 3rd levels being the region and the country in which the respondent lives. We find that perceived risks generally reflect the actual state of the environment at both the regional and national level, with the national level being stronger. Perceived risks are also related to socio-demographics, information and knowledge, pro-environmental activity and consumer practices. The influence of unobserved factors, captured in the model by random effects, was large at the national level, reflecting differences in cultural and institutional structures". Results support higher levels of water policy devolution and more focused and targeted policy communication. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reliable ecosystem quality assessment of marine environments is increasingly important due to mounting pressures attributable to human activities. Biotic indices are widely used in studies to describe communities and indicate the ecological state of systems. This study focuses on benthic macroinvertebrate-based biotic indices for the assessment of ecosystem health. Indices used in ecosystem health assessment in the marine environment have mainly focussed on measuring structural components of the system while more recently the measurement of functional components has been highlighted. In this study the performance of traditional diversity indices based on structural components of benthic macroinvertebrate communities, indices developed for the EU Water Framework Directive, and indices which are based on functional biological traits of species were compared. The results indicated that while functional indices may provide a more detailed assessment of the benthic communities than structural indices, the overall outcome is broadly similar for both types of indices. This suggests measurement of functional indices may be unnecessary for routine monitoring purposes, although they may have value in revealing more specific aspects of change in a system.

AB  - Industrial activity, dam construction, and agriculture-while important for socioeconomic progress-can severely damage the natural environment. To evaluate the effects of these human activities on the bio-integrity of riverine ecosystems, we examined the Wanan reach of the Ganjiang River (Wanan River basin), which contains the river's largest reservoir. On the basis of 20 attributes of zooplankton, we constructed a zooplankton index of bio-integrity (Z-IBI) evaluation system using range analysis, discriminant analysis, and correlation analysis. Our research found that these anthropogenic activities can greatly change the composition and number of zooplankton community. The overall health status of this catchment was classified as "good", and the eco-health situation of the reference, industrial, dam-controlled and agricultural sites were deemed "healthy", "fair", "good", and "fair", respectively. Our results suggested that the three activities adversely affected the integrity of local aquatic ecosystems. Agriculture was the activity most detrimental to the zooplankton community, followed by industrial production and dam construction. Therefore, we demonstrated that the Z-IBI evaluation system can be applied to reservoir-riverine ecosystems. We also provide guidance on the ecological protection, assessment, monitoring and of reservoir-riverine ecosystems and suggest that additional Z-IBI evaluation approaches be further developed in the future.

AB  - Fungal contamination (foxing) was detected on a painting stored in an art museum. The internal environments were assessed using a fungal index. The index is a biological climate-parameter, which represents the environmental capacity to allow fungal growth. To determine the index, fungal detectors encapsulating the spores of sensor fungi were placed at the site being examined. The growth response, germination of the spores and hyphal extension, of xerophilic sensor fungi was observed in the storehouse. The values of fungal index predicted propagation of fungi, although dehumidifiers were already in use. Next year, the number of dehumidifiers installed in the storehouse was increased from 3 to 8. After the number of dehumidifiers was increased, the indices were below the detectable limit in the storehouse indicating no fungal contamination will occur. The sensor fungi used in those assessments were five xerophilic and two non-xerophilic strains. In the assessment before countermeasures were taken, Aspergillus penicilhoides showed the highest growth response among the sensor fungi in the fungal detector exposed in the room where the contaminated painting was stored. Eurodum herbariorum showed the highest growth response in other rooms. These two strains were selected as the sensor fungi for assessments of museum environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During the fall of 2001 and 2002, Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus were collected from several creeks in the Pamlico River, North Carolina, to investigate recent fish kills and ulcerative skin lesions. High skin lesion prevalence (> 50%) was associated with the Atlantic menhaden kills in fall 2001, whereas there were no fish kills in fall 2002 and skin lesion prevalence was lower (<= 50%). Indicators of tissue damage (histopathological analyses of gills, hem liver, intestine, and anterior kidney), body condition (liver somatic index), and immune status (transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-beta] messenger RNA [mRNA] production, hematology, plasma chemistry, and splenosomatic index) were compared between Atlantic menhaden with and without ulcerative skin lesions in fall. Atlantic menhaden with ulcerative skin lesions had significantly higher liver somatic indices, neutrophil and monocyte percentages, and splenic mononuclear cell TGF-beta mRNA levels than did fish without lesions. Hematocrit values, plasma protein, and Ca concentrations were significantly lower in fish with ulcerative skin lesions than in those without. The indicators used in this study at multiple levels of biological organization have provided valuable baseline data for understanding the health status of lesioned and nonlesioned Atlantic menhaden in the Pamlico River.

AB  - We provided valuable information about the palaeoenvironmental evolution of Southwestern Europe during the last 800 ka through the palynological study of the longest continuous continental Quaternary record in the Iberian Peninsula and in the Southwestern Mediterranean region. The SPD core studied here constituted the longest sequence recovered at the Padul Basin and we improved the chronological precision with respect to previous research. Furthermore, the high sampling resolution provided interesting insights into the main vegetation changes occurred at long-term timescales in the region and allowed correlating these variations with other long continental records of Europe. Dating using palaeomagnetism, amino acid racemisation, U/Th and C-14 allowed us to construct a robust Bayesian age-depth function, thereby making it possible to determine the chronological framework for the Padul record. From the palynological content of the samples, which were grouped in 11 clusters, we obtained a large variable number of minor pollen variations totalling 21 palynozones identified along the record. From the statistical analysis of the pollen data, some pollen environmental indexes were defined, allowing the reconstruction of palaeotemperature and palaeohumidity conditions. Five climatic scenarios were established: cold/arid, cold/semi-arid, cold/wet, temperate/wet (Mediterranean-climate), and warm/wet (Mediterranean-climate with higher moisture). Of note, the vegetation in the Padul Basin differed from that of other European basins with long pollen records due to regional characteristics, but main palaeoenvironmental trends were in agreement. Pinus, Steppic, Xerophilous, and Mediterranean taxa in the Padul Basin showed a continuous and dominant presence along the whole record, while only in certain periods did humidity increase, reflected by the expansion of Spores, Deciduous and Mediterranean taxa (especially in Pz 2, 7 and 13), but without any large expansion of deciduous forest. Comparison with other European records revealed the singular bioclimatic position of the Padul Basin in the Southwestern Mediterranean realm, and this part of Iberia can be considered a Quaternary vegetation refuge, mainly for mesophillous taxa and sclerophyllous oak. Although the biomes of the Padul basin and other European basins could not be compared directly, the main palaeoenvironmental trends were coincident (interstadials were marked by warmer periods and greater humidity, whereas stadials were cooler and more arid). These observations suggest that environmental changes in the Padul Basin were in tune with variations in global palaeoclimatic conditions.

AB  - Arsenic (As), a toxicant, present in flue dust, tailings, and mine drainages generated from mineral processing and smelting processes represents high environmental risk due to its high mobility. Around 42-50% As is found in flue dust in the form of As2O3. The vitrification of As results in the formation of stable inert glass material and supposed to reduce the risk of As release to the environment. In this study, a glass material produced by vitrification of As bearing flue dust via DST GlassLock (TM) Process was received from Dundee Sustainable Technologies, Canada and was subjected for As stability assessment using United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) leaching methods-1311,1312,1313,1314,1315 and 1316. The released arsenic concentration was found to be less than the recommended TCLP hazardous waste limit for arsenic i.e., 5 mg/L in most of the test conditions. The experimental data were analyzed using LeachXS Lite (TM), a data management software that showed the goodness of the DST GlassLock (TM) Process for As stabilization and safe landfill deposition of the resulting product.

AB  - A new three-dimensional Laser-Induced Fluorescence (3DLIF) system was applied to study the mixing of a produced water outfall discharge typical of that used in offshore production operations. The outfall consists of a pipeline terminating in a multiport diffuser discharging into water about 12 m deep. Scaled laboratory experiments were done using conditions based on measured oceanographic conditions near the site. The current was perpendicular to the diffuser, and the receiving water was linearly stratified. The model was undistorted and the jet densimetric Froude number was the same as in the prototype. This scaling results in correct modeling of the source volume, momentum, and buoyancy fluxes, and equality of other line source dimensionless parameters. The experiments were conducted in a constant refractive-index environment which enabled detailed three-dimensional concentration measurements in the near field mixing zone to be obtained despite the density variations in the flow field. The mixing processes were found to be complex. The jets discharging upstream were quickly swept downstream, where they began merging with the downstream jets. Lateral mixing caused the concentration profiles to quickly become laterally homogeneous. Initially, dilution increased rapidly with distance from the diffuser, but farther away the rate of increase of dilution slowed as the turbulence became affected by the ambient density stratification. The dilution eventually becomes approximately constant; the location where this occurs defines the end of the near field, where mixing is primarily due to turbulence and other processes induced by the discharge itself. The end of the near field is marked by collapse of the self-induced turbulence under the influence of the ambient stratification.
   The results were compared to predictions of commonly used mathematical models of marine mixing zones: RSB, UM3, and CORMIX. The best predictions of the near field dilution and the length of the near field were by RSB. UM3 gave good predictions of the near field dilution, but CORMIX overestimated the dilution and rise height substantially. It is believed that this overestimation by CORMIX is due to its approximation of the diffuser as a row of vertically discharging jets of equivalent total momentum flux; this is clearly a poor approximation to the diffuser conditions modeled here.
   3DLIF is an exciting new technique that can give unprecedented insight into the complex hydrodynamics and processes occurring in buoyancy-modified mixing zones and to improvement of near field mathematical models. Experiments on other discharge configurations are continuing. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Exposure to elevated concentrations of heavy metal micro-pollutants is a serious environmental issue. Often times, metals are suspended in air as vapor. It also biomagnifies across the food chain, causing adverse health conditions in human. This study evaluated the risks of heavy metals in atmospheric particulate matter (PM10) around gas flaring vicinity in Bayelsa State, Nigeria. Materials and methods Using Particulate matter sampler APM131 monitor, suspended particulate was sampled across eight locations. Sample measurements were obtained within 3000 m distance of the gas flaring facility, while a control point was established at over 7000 m distance from the flare stark. Afterward, filter was analyzed for trace/heavy metals using the atomic absorption spectrometer. Results The mean concentration of heavy metals ranged from 0.017 to 0.060, 0.050 to 0.197, 0.027 to 1.280, 0.050 to 0.170, 0.037 to 0.310 and 6.717 to 8.233 mu g/m(3) for arsenic, cobalt, chromium, cadmium, copper and iron, respectively. Pollution indices reflected low-to-moderate pollution, while ecological risk index showed low risk. Index of geoaccumulation and enrichment factor depicts anthropogenic activities as the prevalent source of heavy metals in atmospheric PM10 of the area. The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks revealed values that were within the threshold limits. Conclusion Heavy metals in air around the study area has no adverse health effect on inhabitants within the considered age bracket. However, due to the presence of these metals in atmospheric PM10 within the study area, there is a need for the studied parameters to be included in the routine emission inventories.

AB  - At present, the promotion policy for the reuse of recycled water adopted in China gives priority to mandatory administrative orders but ignores the policy guidance for residents' behavior to use recycled water. Based on the above practical problems, this research combines the characteristics of recycled water reuse, then reduces the behavior guiding policy for the potential use of recycled water to environmental motivation stimulating policy, demonstration guiding policy, and combined with the mechanisms of different policies, the extreme shortage of water resources, the promotion degree of regional recycled water reuse, and the reuse of recycled water in a natural environment are selected as the abstract indicators of environmental motivation stimulating policy, demonstration guiding policy, and knowledge popularization policy. The above indicators are taken as control variables, and control groups are set to simulate the mechanisms of different policies. The residents' willingness to accept the reuse of recycled water is taken as a dependent variable, and a structural equation model is used for a variance analysis of data between different control groups. Finally, it is verified under the natural state that the three types of policies have a significant guiding effect on the reuse of recycled water.

AB  - 1. Resilient and functional landscapes are essential for climate change adaptation. Thermodynamic theory has been applied increasingly to ecological studies to understand ecosystem resilience and integrity. Resilient ecosystems have complex structure and greater levels of biomass and functional diversity, which act to enhance the degradation of solar energy. Forests that exhibit these characteristics express thermodynamic efficiency through a greater capacitance effect that promotes cooler surface temperatures under extreme weather conditions. 2. With forest disturbance, complex structures and functional linkages are simplified, reducing the capacity of the system to degrade energy. Such changes can lead to dysfunctional ecosystem states, impaired provision of ecosystem services and a weakened resilience. 3. This study has applied indicators based on thermodynamic theory to a chronosequence of forest ecosystems in the UK, Germany and Ukraine. Surface temperatures were measured to test thermodynamic theories relating to energy degradation and temperature moderation. Grimes CSR model was applied to plant data to compare functional complexity in vegetation between stands. 4. Old-growth woodlands are shown to attenuate surface temperature more effectively than native species plantations. Consistently lower temperatures were observed in European old-growth forests with high proportions of biomass when compared to managed stands of similar species composition, suggesting a greater efficiency of energy degradation in complex forest ecosystems, particularly at higher temperatures. 5. Analysis of plant species data using Grimes CSR model indicated that old-growth forests ordinate towards competitive and stress-tolerant communities in contrast to intensively managed forests, which had a greater proportion of generalist and ruderal species. High CSR functional scores were associated with moderated temperature extremes. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest an important thermodynamic basis for conservation in the context of climate change. Conservation practice and management policy, which is based on preserving ecosystem complexity and function, can aid in mitigating the effects of extreme temperatures, enhancing vital services such as climate regulation, primary production and water retention. Old-growth forests have a significant climate mitigation role alongside other recognised ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration.

AB  - This study was carried to compare amino acids content, muscle cellularity, and flesh quality between farmed and imitative ecological farming loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus. Loach from farmed (average body weight 15.03 +/- 0.36 g, average body length 13.41 +/- 0.17 cm) and imitative ecological farming population (average body weight 12.44 +/- 0.62 g, average body length 13.80 +/- 0.26 cm) were used to analyze growth, body parameters, muscle composition, texture characteristics, amino acids content, relationship between muscle cellularity and textural parameters, and myogenic regulatory factors expression. The results showed the final weight, condition factor, hepatosomatic index and viscera index of farmed loach were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than of imitative ecological farming loach. Hardness, cohesiveness, adhesiveness, and resilience and Phe, Glu, and Tyr contents of imitative ecological farming loach were significantly higher than of farmed loach (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, muscle density of loach showed a positive and significant correlation with hardness (p < 0.05). Expression of growthrelated genes including MyoD in farmed loach was significantly higher than in imitative ecological farming loach (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the flesh quality of imitative ecological farming loach is better than that of farmed loach.

AB  - Life history of immature maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky, was studied at 10-40 degrees C and 43-76% RH. The optimal quantity of corn for minimizing density effects and the optimal observation frequency for minimizing disturbance effects were determined at 30 degrees C and 75% RH. The quantity of corn (32-256 g) provided to five females ovipositing for 24 h did not affect duration of development, but the number of progeny produced increased asymptotically as the quantity of corn provided increased. Frequency of observation (from 1- to 14-d intervals) did not affect duration of development or number of progeny produced. Using moisture contents measured in the life history study, an equation was developed for predicting equilibrium moisture content of corn from temperature and relative humidity. Duration of immature development did not vary with sex, but did vary with test. This suggests that insect strain or chemical composition of the corn must be included as factors in a model predicting effects of environment on duration of immature development. Survival from egg to adult emergence was greatest at 25 degrees C. Sex ratio of emerging adults did not differ from 1:1. The number of multiply-infested kernels was low at all environmental conditions, and survival from egg to adult emergence in these kernels averaged 18%. Maximum daily rate of fecundity, duration of development, and number of progeny produced were optimal at 30 degrees C and 75% RH. An index of environmental suitability indicated that 30 degrees C and 75% RH was the optimal environment for growth of maize weevil populations on corn. Implications of the results for managing maize weevil populations are discussed.

AB  - The object of the present research was the Czarna Staszowska River, which is located in south-eastern Poland and which is a left tributary of the upper Vistula River. The length of the river is 61 km and its sources are situated in the Swietokrzyskie Mountains. The river flows across an area covered by Mesozoic rocks, mostly carbonate and sulfate ones. The upper and middle course of the river is of natural character, while increased pollution occurs downstream of the Chancza Reservoir. In the present study, the water quality of the Czarna Staszowska is investigated in the pure and polluted sections using diatom indices, such as IO - Diatom Index, IPS - Specific Pollution Sensitivity Index, GDI - Generic Diatom Index and TDI - Trophic Diatom Index. In the four river sections distinguished on the basis of the hydrology and the degree of water pollution, the occurrence of different indicator species was determined in the respective diatom assemblages. Indicator species were determined, i.e. characteristic of oligosaprobic and mesosaprobic, limestone and silicon-rich waters. Also taxa indicating an increased trophic status of the river (occurring in its polluted sections) were identified.

KW  - INDEX
AB  - Urban development alters the natural hydrological conditions of many streams and rivers often resulting in the degradation of water quality, physical habitat, and biotic integrity of lotic systems. Restoration projects attempt to improve and maintain the ecological integrity of urban streams; however, few projects have quantified improvements to stream ecology following implementation of restoration measures. This paper summarizes pre-restoration data collected as part of an urban stream restoration project on Gypsum Creek in Wichita, Kansas. Water quality monitoring revealed eutrophic conditions in the stream and the presence of pesticides. Channelization has led to changes in physical habitat including bank erosion, sedimentation, loss of substrate and channel diversity, elimination of in-stream aquatic habitat, removal of riparian vegetation, and, decreased base flows. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities appear degraded with more than 90% of individuals collected described as tolerant to anthropogenic stressors. Fish communities were assessed with an Index of Biotic Integrity and were rated as poor to fair, with trophic structure dominated by generalists, no sensitive species present, and one-third of the species collected considered nonnative. Overall, the data collected strongly suggest that site-specific restoration measures need to be implemented in order to improve and maintain the ecological condition of Gypsum Creek. Recommendations for improvements have been made to city managers, with implementation beginning in spring 2003 (dependent upon funding availability).

AB  - Conserving fish in lakes requires the systematic analysis and assessment of fish species. The issues, conservation needs and fish assemblage changes are described for Lake Qionghai (China). The annual fishery production (AFP) was analysed from 1949 to 2003, which indicated a high disturbance of the aquatic ecosystem in Lake Qionghai caused especially by fisheries. The continuous increase in AFP and the introduction of economically important fish species have changed the fish species structure and diversity of the lake. Only five of 20 native fish species remained extant in 2003. The alien species accounted for 83.58% of the total fish production in 2003. Scoring criteria for 10 indexes of biotic integrity (IBI metrics) were selected for Lake Qionghai. The overall IBI score decreased from 40 in the 1940s to 26 in the 1980s to 20 in 2003. Changes in biotic condition were mainly caused by the destruction of fish physical habitat, pollution, bycatch and the invasion of alien species. Based on the IBI analysis, an ecosystem approach was developed for fish conservation in Lake Qionghai, including conservation at the watershed scale, habitat improvement and restoration, rebuilding of aquatic ecosystems and adaptive ecosystem-based fishery management.

AB  - Nanoparticles released into the environment are attracting increasing concern because of their potential toxic effects. Conventional methods for assessing the toxicity of nanoparticles are usually confined to cultivable cells, but not applicable to viable but non-culturable (VBNC) cells. However, it remains unknown whether silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), a typical antimicrobial agent, could induce bacteria into a VBNC state in natural environments. In this work, the viability of E. coli, an indicator bacterium widely used for assessing the antibacterial activity of AgNPs, was examined through coupling plate counting, fluorescence staining and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. AgNPs were found to have a considerable antibacterial ability, which resulted in less than 0.0004% of culturable cells on plates. However, more than 80% of the cells still maintained their cell membrane integrity under the stress of 80 mg/L AgNPs. Meanwhile, the residue of ATP production (0.6%) was 1500 times higher than that of the culturable cells (< 0.0004%). These results clearly demonstrate that when exposed to AgNPs, most of cells fell into a VBNC state, instead of dying. Environmental factors, e.g., Cl-and illumination, which could change the dissolution, hydrophilicity and zeta potential of AgNPs, eventually influenced the culturability of E. coli. Inhibition of dissolved Ag+ and reactive oxygen species was found to facilitate the mitigation of the strain into a VBNC state. Our findings suggest the necessity of re-evaluating the environmental effects and antibacterial activities of AgNPs. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A set of factors cause the Surface Ecological Status (SES) of urban areas to become largely different from the surrounding rural areas. Hence, the degree of poorness of SES in urban areas versus surrounding rural areas forms a zone, which is named Urban Surface Ecological Poorness Zone (USEPZ). The main objective of this study was to propose a new method to quantify USEPZ Intensity (USEPZI). To this end, Landsat-8 satellite images. water vapor products, and High Resolution Imperviousness Layer (HRIL) datasets of Budapest, Bucharest, Ciechanow, Hamburg, Lyon, Madrid, Porto, and Rome cities were used. Firstly, Single Channel (SC) algorithm, Tasseled cap transformation, and spectral indices were used to model the surface biophysical characteristics including Land Surface Temperature (1ST). Wetness, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI). Then, SES was modeled based on the combination of surface biophysical characteristics using Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index (RSEI). Finally, the USEPZI was modeled bawd on the linear regression function obtained from RSEI-Impervious Surface Percentage (ISP) feature space. The spatial variability of the ISP, LST, NDVI, NDSI and Wetness of the selected cities was found to be heterogeneous. The coefficient of determination (R-2) between RSEI and ISP values for Budapest, Bucharest, Ciechanow, Hamburg, Lyon, Madrid, Porto, and Rome cities were obtained to be 0.99, 0.97, 0.98.0.99, 0.98,0.99.0.99, and 0.94, respectively. Also, the USEPZI values of these dties were 0.14.0.31, 0.41,0.26. 0.40,0.81, 0.44 and 0.46, respectively. Our findings show that the significant differences in their SES and USEPZI are due to the surface biophysical characteristics. The USEPZI in the selected cities with humid climate conditions was higher than the selected cities in dry climate conditions. Also, the use of the RSEI-ISP feature space is quite useful in modeling USEPZI of cities in different conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a compilation of published mineralogic and trace element data from nine gas shales in the United States. Formations analyzed include the Antrim, Bakken, Barnett, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Marcellus, New Albany, Utica and Woodford. These mineralogic and trace element data can be used to assess the potential for environmental impacts during hydraulic fracturing. Impacts addressed in this study include: 1) the potential for acid rock drainage generation during gas shale weathering, 2) the distribution of trace elements in gas shales and comparison with regulatory guidelines, and 3) the implications for environmental management of well cuttings. The use of the mineralogic data to assess the fracability of the gas shales is also considered. Compilations of the mineralogy and geochemistry of gas shales can be a valuable resource for managing real and perceived environmental problems associated with their exploitation. Comprehensive environmental assessment to fully address these issues, in addition to other potential environmental impacts, will require collection and collation of additional data on the mineralogy and trace element geochemistry of gas and other hydrocarbon producing shales.

AB  - Based on analyses of key issues concerning watershed ecological security assessment including the subject, content, and methodology of assessment, this paper points out that ecological security should be assessed dynamically at different levels (e.g. watershed and ecosystem levels) with human being as the main assessment subject. Both the functional security and the structural security must be considered in watershed ecological security assessment. In order to reflect the overall and timely security status of the watershed, the PSR (pressure-state-response) method should be employed. Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR) was researched as an example. An index system of watershed ecological security assessment has been proposed, which includes structural index, functional index, pressure and response index, and the state of ecological security is analyzed for LRGR in Yunnan Province.

AB  - A Human Well-Being Index (HWBI) has been developed for the U.S. to help inform and empower decision makers to equitably weigh and integrate human health, socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors to foster sustainability. The integrity of the index structure is designed to be transferable to different U.S. population groups across space, time and demography. This paper presents the applicability and integrity of the HWBI framework using metrics scaled to assess well-being for American Indian Alaska Native (AIAN) and large tribal populations. Potential modifications needed to produce reasonably defensible well-being assessments were identified and HWBIs were calculated for the AIAN population and large tribal groups for the time period covering 2000-2010. Greater than 80 % of the data available for a national AIAN assessment were specific to the target population, while the remaining data were derived from the general U.S. population. Despite the utilization of non-target data, the AIAN well-being signature could still be differentiated from the U.S. HWBI, indicating that the HWBI approach is transferable. As designed, the framework is intended to be used for a variety of spatial scales and demographic groups; however, the degree to which the structure can be utilized is dependent upon the availability and quantity of quality data.

AB  - Drought is among the least understood natural hazards and requires particular notice in the context of climate change. While the Mediterranean climate is by itself prone to droughts, a rise of temperatures and alteration of rainfall patterns already render the southern parts of continental Portugal and Spain highly susceptible to desertification. Precipitation in the Iberian Peninsula is mainly controlled by the large-scale mode of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and is distributed with elevated variability over the cold months. Most drought studies of this region rely on meteorological data or apply information on vegetation dynamics, such as the Normalised Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI), to indirectly investigate droughts. This paper evaluates the influence of the NAO winter index on the spatiotemporal occurrence of droughts in the Iberian Peninsula during the spring and summer seasons (March to August) for the years 2001-2005, 2007 and 2010. We applied the Vegetation Temperature Condition Index (VTCI) to identify local droughts. VTCI is a remote sensing drought index developed for reflecting soil moisture conditions in agricultural areas and combines information on land surface temperature (LST) and NDVI. As such, VTCI overcomes the shortcomings of NDVI in terms of drought monitoring. We derived biweekly information on LST and NDVI from MODIS/Terra and produced VTCI-NAO correlation maps at a confidence level of at least 90 % based on the VTCI time series. The results reflect a typical Mediterranean pattern in most parts of Iberia that is highly influenced by relief. Spring seasons are marked by great variability of precipitation, while summers persistently become dry, particularly in the south. NAO exerts its greatest influence in April and June, clearly delineating high correlation areas in the northwest and southeast with reverse patterns between the spring and early summer months. Due to the impact on water availability, the spring months are important for plant growth. At the same time, agricultural lands were found with types of land cover less resilient to droughts. The knowledge acquired in studies like the one reported here is therefore likely to be used in drought warning models for agriculture in spring.

AB  - 1. Some ecosystems show nonlinear responses to gradual changes in environmental conditions, once a threshold in conditions-or critical point-is passed. This can lead to wide shifts in ecosystem states, possibly with dramatic ecological and economic consequences. Such behaviours have been reported in drylands, savannas, coral reefs or shallow lakes for example. Important research effort of the last decade has been devoted to identifying indicators that would help anticipate such ecosystem shifts and avoid their negative consequences.
   2. Theoretical and empirical research has shown that, as an ecosystem approaches a critical point, specific signatures arise in its temporal and spatial dynamics; these changes can be quantified using relatively simple statistical metrics that have been referred to as "early warning signals" (EWS) in the literature. Although tests of those EWS on experiments are promising, empirical evidence from out-of-laboratory datasets is still scarce, in particular for spatial EWS. The recent proliferation of remote-sensing data provides an opportunity to improve this situation and evaluate the reliability of spatial EWS in many ecological systems.
   3. Here, we present a step-by-step workflow along with code to compute spatial EWS from raster data such as aerial images, test their significance compared to permutation-based null models, and display their trends, either at different time steps or along environmental gradients. We created the R-package spatial-warnings (MIT license) to help achieve all these steps in a reliable and reproducible way, and thereby promote the application of spatial EWS to empirical data.
   4. This software package and associated documentation provides an easy entry point for researchers and managers into spatial EWS-based analyses. By facilitating a broader application, it will leverage the evaluation of spatial EWS on real data, and eventually contribute to providing tools to map ecosystems' fragility to perturbations and inform management decisions.

AB  - Agricultural policy plays a major role in effective management of natural resources of a country. It is important that the acreage and condition of the various crop production sites, amounts and yields should be determined and forecast on time for a complete set up of agricultural planning. Otherwise, the development of agricultural policies in compliance with the realities of the country, and coinciding with development objectives beco me difficult. Most cereal production in the Anatolian Plateau is rainfed and therefore, exposed to the interannual variability of rainfall which directly affects the variability of the main cereals and food security as well. Yield forecasts were made by using AgroMetShell in the scope of FAO Technical Cooperation Project (TCP). Meteorological data, crop coefficients, phenological observations, soil characteristics and NDVI data are prepared in order to run the model. Model was run at 265 stations for unirrigated conditions. Water Satisfaction Index (WSI) values and graphics were obtained. By using NDVI data, average values of WSI calculated city by city. Statistical analysis were made between WSI values and statistics. As a result yield forecasts of cities were obtained for wheat in 2005 and 2006. Maps were prepared by using statistics and yield forecasts for 2005 and 2006. A relation of r(2) = 0.9067 calculated between yield forecasts and statistics.

AB  - Considering that the soil aggregation reflects the interaction of chemical, physical and biological soil factors, the aim of this study was evaluate alterations in aggregation, in an Oxisol under no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT), since over 20 years, using as reference a native forest soil in natural state. After analysis of the soil profile (cultural profile) in areas under forest management, samples were collected from the layers 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 and 20-40 cm, with six repetitions. These samples were analyzed for the aggregate stability index (ASI), mean weighted diameter (MWD), mean geometric diameter (MGD) in the classes > 8, 8-4, 4-2, 2-1, 1-0.5, 0.5-0.25, and < 0.25 mm, and for physical properties (soil texture, water dispersible clay (WDC), flocculation index (FI) and bulk density (Bd)) and chemical properties (total organic carbon - COT, total nitrogen - N, exchangeable calcium - Ca2+, and pH). The results indicated that more intense soil preparation (M < NT < PC) resulted in a decrease in soil stability, confirmed by all stability indicators analyzed: MWD, MGD, ASI, aggregate class distribution, WDC and FI, indicating the validity of these indicators in aggregation analyses of the studied soil.

AB  - Forest surveys were conducted in 2015-2018 on 12 sample plots (SPs), located in different districts of the city of Bratsk, a large industrial center of Eastern Siberia. The ecological state of natural forests preserved within the city's territory was estimated by a set parameters of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees, understory vegetation, moss-and-lichen cover, and soil. Significant changes in the parameters caused by technogenic pollution and a high recreational load on the soil cover have been revealed. The high level of technogenic pollution of urban forests is evidenced by the accumulation of pollutants (sulfur, heavy metals, PAH) in the needles of pine trees and soil horizons, changes in the ratios of elements-pollutants and elements-nutrients in plants and soils, shift in the acid-base balance of the soil solution to alkalinity. A high recreational load on urban forest soils is indicated by many negative changes: a decrease in the thickness of the forest litter or its complete destruction; violation of the natural structure of the upper horizons due to increase in physical clay content, stony content, and anthropogenic inclusions; significant increase in soil density, and decrease in humidity, porosity, and aeration. The impact of a complex of negative factors also leads to a decrease in the species diversity of the understory vegetation, mosses, lichens, and an increase in the number of ruderal species in the herbaceous vegetation. The biggest negative changes in the parameters of forest ecosystems have been found in Tsentralny district of the city, located in close proximity (from 2 to 8 km) to a large aluminum smelter and timber industry complex. Less-pronounced negative changes in parameters were found in samples taken in the Padunsky district, located 25 km from the emission source, and the smallest changes in the parameters were found in Pravoberezhny district, 45 km away from the emission sources. The main recommendations for improving the condition of forests in all areas of the city are as follows: planning a road-path network, restoring the fertile soil layer, sodding open areas of soil with herbaceous vegetation, and selecting an assortment of trees and shrub plants that are resistant to industrial pollution and recreational stress.

AB  - A legacy of pre-regulation coal mining in many areas has been acid mine drainage (metal-rich, low pH water). Today, numerous remediation strategies may be implemented, but there is little data on efficacy in restoring biological condition. Two alkaline doser projects in Ohio were assessed using diatom assemblages, and biofilm extracellular enzyme activities (EEA). In one stream, water quality steadily increased downstream of the doser; pH increased from 3.8 to 7.2 and Fe decreased from 107 to 0.42 mg l(-1). Likewise, the periphyton biomass (chl a 7.15-12.77 mg m(-2)) increased and periphyton index scores (4-27) improved. As well, EEA data showed greater activity for phosphorus, nitrogen, and one carbon acquisition enzyme. For the other stream, the conductivity remained high (> 720 mu S cm(-1)) and pH and alkalinity decreased downstream. Biological data, including EEA, varied along the stream length with higher numbers in the middle reach, such as chlorophyll a (0.56 to 87.75 to 2.77 mg m(-2)), and index scores (7 to 29 to 11). The first remediation site showed positive results in chemistry, biological community and measures of ecosystem function. The second stream was highly variable in these parameters suggesting further AMD inputs are hampering recovery.

AB  - Biological sampling has been implemented to assess water quality in many states. The purpose of this study was to examine whether genetic diversity and structure of Pimephales notatus could serve as effective biomarkers of exposure to anthropogenic stressors by comparing genetic measures with other biological indicators of water quality. Fish were collected from 15 sites on eight streams by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency as part of their stream water quality evaluation program. Values for the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) were determined for these 15 sites. Starch gel electrophoresis was used to collect genetic data for seven variable enzyme loci. Genetic diversity measures were not associated with site IBI or ICI values. However, the range of site IBI and ICI values was limited. The proportion of individuals not expressing esterase locus 3 could be used to predict IBI; IBI decreased as the proportion of nonexpression increased. Allele and genotype frequency differences were observed between sites on the Little Scioto River, the one stream with a large difference in IBI and ICI values between sites. This study suggested that allele and genotype frequencies may have been impacted without affecting overall species diversity. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Odourgenes covariance (i.e. that individual odour similarities covary with genetic similarity) allows animals to assess their genetic relatedness to one another by comparing the similarities between their individual odours. The reliability of the odourgene covariance phenomenon under environmental changes has not yet been explored. Using an innovative habituation-generalization procedure, we tested whether the modifications of body odours induced by a change in diet interfered with the perceived similarity of individual odours of more genetically similar individuals. The effects of a change in diet, by adding aniseed flavour to the drinking water, was assessed in male mound-building mice, a species in which odourgenes covariance has already been demonstrated. The results obtained indicate that mice perceive more similarities in the odours of sibling males than in those of nonrelatives, despite the effects of diet on body odours. We suggest that the reliability of signals arising from odourgenes covariance is likely a result of the independence between traits indicating genetic relatedness and indicator signals of biological states (e.g. diet) in body odours.

AB  - Most flammability tests for a material to be used for manned spacecraft are conducted on the ground, although several studies have reported that the flammability limit in microgravity is different from that in normal gravity. Hence, an important task is to predict the margin between the limiting oxygen concentrations (LOCs) in normal gravity and microgravity. We set up a simplified scale model to describe the opposed-flow flame spread over a thin material and derived expressions for the Damkohler number (Da) and the nondimensional radiative loss factor (R-rad) for the flame spread over a thermally thin poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheet. The empirical constants for these nondimensional numbers were evaluated by fitting with the experimental results in a N-2 balance. The obtained model was validated under varying gas-phase properties. First, we obtained the experimental blow-off limits via downward spread tests in normal gravity with different balance gases (N-2, Ar, and CO2). We compared the predicted blow-off limits, which corresponded to the limiting oxygen index (LOI) condition, with the experimental results for each balance condition and found that the predicted limits agreed well quantitatively with the experimental results. Then, using Da and R-rad, we drew a flammability map for opposed-flow flame spread over a thin PMMA sheet, which predicted the flammable conditions under the LOI. The developed simplified model predicted the minimum LOCs (MLOCs) and the critical opposed-flow velocity for the N-2, Ar, and CO2 balance conditions. The model underestimated the MLOCs because it considered the effect of either the radiation or the kinetics, whereas both these effects are actually coupled near the MLOC. Nevertheless, the predicted margin between the MLOC and the LOI illustrated the behavior of the flame spread near extinction. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The article studies the problem of assessing the quality of atmospheric air in the green areas of the metropolis. The aim of the work is to compare the data obtained by the biomonitoring method with information from unified state environmental monitoring system (USEMS). The sample object of the study is a Udelny park located in the Primorsky district of the city of St. Petersburg. The objectives of the study include the analysis of atmospheric pollution of the Udelny Park by the method of bioindication, comparison of the data obtained with the general telephone indicators, as well as with information from the nearest USEMS posts. When studying the object, the method of V.M. Zakharov was used to study the fluctuating asymmetry of the leaf plates of the hanging birch (Betula pendula Roth.). The site between Udelny Ave., the Vyborg railway line, Testers Ave. and Kolomyazhsky Ave. with an approximate area of 18 hectares was chosen as a model site. The assessment was carried out on 12 pickets, at each 100 samples of leaf plates were taken in total. For comparison, data were obtained from a stationary observation post for the state of atmospheric air pollution, information on the content of pollutants in the air of the Primorsky district. The study found that the quality of atmospheric air in the territory is low. In part of the pickets, the value of the fluctuating asymmetry index was more than 0.054, which corresponds to the V score (critical pollution). These data are generally correlated with information about air pollution in St. Petersburg. Nevertheless, the state of the environment is assessed by the chosen method more critically. This is due to the fact that the biomonitoring method studies pollution from the point of view of direct impact on the ecosystem, taking into account. among other things, the cumulative effect. The result makes us to conclude that it is more correct to use an integrated approach, combining both methods, to assess the stability of urban ecosystems and the quality of the environment in them. It is important to separate information about the quality of the atmosphere in green areas from general data on residential areas.

AB  - The population ecology of rangeland insects has been little studied in Chile. There are different species inhabiting the inter-valley areas of the transitional desert that, under certain environmental conditions, display population outbreaks. One of them is Elasmoderus wagenknechti (Orthoptera: Tristiridae). It is an endemic species to Chile. Its geographic range of distribution is from Taltal in the Second Region (25degrees22'S, 70degrees31' W) to Salamanca in the Fourth Region (31degrees46' S, 70degrees58' W). The results of morphometric analyses carried out on individuals captured from two population outbreaks are reported and discussed in this work. The outbreaks took place in 1996 and 1999 in the Fourth Region (Coquimbo, Chile). Elasmoderus wagenknechti has been described as a brachypterous species. In this work, the relation length of the tegmen/length of the abdomen was 0.66 for the male and 0.51 for the female. To the metathoracic wing, this relation was 0.34 and 0.24 respectively. The morphometric variability of 23 characters examined in this work was low both in the male (CV: 3.04-31.46 %) and in the female (CV: 3.68-32.00 %). Despite the thicker aspect of the female, the relation body width/total length was similar in both sexes (0.27). Likewise, the level of hydration was close to 71% of fresh biomass in both the male and the female. In the same way, the relation dry biomass/fresh biomass was also similar in both sexes (male: 0.28; female: 0.29). The morphometric comparisons from different outbreaks showed 10 significant differences in males and eight significant differences in females. Besides body size (e.g., total length), the sexual dimorphism showed up in 12 morphometric comparisons. In all of them, the difference was favorable to the female. The highest indices of morphometric variablefemales/males were dry weight (2.83), total length (1.56), mesonotal width (1.55), and pronotal length (1.52); all of them related to body size. The condition index was higher in the female (beta(1): 1.42) as compared to that of the male (beta(1): 1.25). Although this difference was not statistically significant, a higher value would suggest a better fitness of the female. This fact might explain the ability of this species to demographically outburst in the Chilean semidesert, once the right environmental conditions have been triggered.

AB  - The Dniester is one of the largest transboundary rivers of the Black Sea basin, and its lower reaches integrate the influence of climate change and hydropower plant (HPP) impact on the waterway. The decrease in precipitation and average annual air temperature increase and intensive hydroelectric construction have led to a decline in the total water content of the river, during the last 10 years, being below the long-term historical "norm ". The shifts in the river flow result in multidirectional seasonal dynamics of nutrient concentrations. During the modern period, a stabilization of nutrient concentrations takes place, being lower than at the peak of eutrophication in the 1970s-1980s, but higher than in the natural flow period. The construction of reservoirs leads to a long-term decline in silica concentrations, continuing in the modern period. The concentration of heavy metals and metalloids in water and bottom sediments of the river generally corresponds to the ecological status of "Moderate ". Biological communities show a high beta-diversity of microalgae, but low diversity of plankton and benthic invertebrates. Biological communities respond to the impact of HPP in both the short- and long-term. Hydroelectric dams change the bioavailability of nutrients downstream which, in the long-term, causes shifts in phytoplankton composition, especially the reduction of Bacillariophyta due to the lack of silicates that are deposited in reservoirs. However, in the short-term, after the discharge from the HPP dam, the concentration of silicates and the proportion of diatoms increase. Long-term changes also include a decline in the proportion of Rotifera and an increase in Copepoda in the total abundance of zooplankton and the unification of the benthic community with an increase in the biomass of gastropods in the area, which can be considered as indicators of the impact of hydroelectric power plants. The saprobity index, calculated both for zooplankton and macrozoobenthos, characterised the water as moderately polluted; benthic biotic indexes (Biological monitoring working party (BMWP), Belgian Biotic Index (BBI), Danish Stream Fauna Index (DSFI)) calculated on macrozoobenthos described the condition as "low " quality.

AB  - A geographical information system (GIS)-based method of lake eutrophication assessment was undertaken to study the spatial distribution of eutrophication conditions in lake environments. A trophic state index (TSI) consisting of six physical, chemical and biological indicators including total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN),. chemical oxygen demand (COD), Secchi disk depth (SD), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and phytoplankton biomass (CA) was constructed to describe the eutrophication state of the lake environment. A 0-100 eutrophication. scale was also developed to indicate seven different trophic levels within the lake environment: oligotrophic, lower-mesotrophic, mesotrophic, upper-mesotrophic, eutrophic, hypereutrophic and extremely hypereutrophic. A representation of the spatial distribution of TSITP, TSITN, TSICOD, TSISD, TSIChl-a and TSICA was developed using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method. By categorizing the interpolated values, a clear illustration of the different trophic levels was developed on six thematic maps. A GIS overlay technique was applied to synthesize the information from the six thematic maps into a final map illustrating the spatial distribution of eutrophication conditions within the study area. The different periods or levels associated with lake eutrophication assessment using GIS were then discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A wide range of aquaculture industries are exposed to environmental conditions and variability which can impact on production. Information about future climate conditions on a range of time scales can improve risk management, buffer production against unfavourable environmental conditions, and allow maximised production during opportune times. Seasonal forecasting, providing information beyond weather forecasting up to several months into the future, can aid such decision making. In north-east Australian coastal pond-based prawn farms environmental stresses influence timing of farming periods, animal growth and survival. Here we describe the development, packaging and provision of regional and local forecast products, derived from the Predictive Ocean Atmosphere Model for Australia (POAMA; version 2), to the Queensland prawn industry. Product development followed a three-stage process; (i) assessment of management needs and critical timescales, (ii) development and evaluation of the forecast products, and (iii) forecast implementation and refinement of the forecast products. Prawn farm managers identified the critical forecast variables as minimum and maximum air temperatures and rainfall at lead times of up to 2-3 months. The POAMA forecast skill for all three variables was evaluated, with three spatially averaged regional environmental indexes derived from POAMA showing a strong relationship with large-scale observed conditions. Forecast accuracy was assessed using model hindcast data together with historical observations, and was similar in all three regions, higher for temperature than rainfall, and declined with lead time in all cases. Forecast indices were then scaled using local weather station information for a subset of prawn farms in the study. Discussion with prawn farm managers helped refine the format and visualisation of the forecasts. Tailored forecast packages were then delivered through a web-based system and directly by email. These forecasts could aid a range of management decisions, and user feedback led to further refinement. This approach has great potential to be extended to other coastal aquaculture industries using these and other environmental variables. Information about future conditions, such as provided by seasonal forecasting, can assist aquaculture managers in development of production plans that will be more robust to short-term environmental variability and represents the first adaptation step on a pathway to coping with longer term climate change.

AB  - On the upper reaches of the Ishite River, Japan the stream water is diverted completely at about 3 km above the Ishitegawa Reservoir, except under flood conditions. The chemical composition of the regenerated streamflow 2.4 km downstream from the diversion was determined 70 times during two years (1986-7) to investigate the effects of the diversion on water chemistry. Factor analysis suggested that two main factors controlled the water chemistry. Factor 1 explained 45.7% of the total variance and was correlated positively with the concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, HCO3-, SO42- and Cl-, which seemed to reflect the leaching of dominant ions from the catchment soil. The factor 1 score was correlated negatively with the ecological 'Ca-Mg index' (r2 = 0.912), a low value of which is necessary to avoid phosphorus enrichment by phytoplankton in the downstream reservoir. The diversion seemed to contribute to this purpose because the log flow-rate value was correlated positively with the index (r2 = 0.730). On the other hand, factor 2 explained 10.2% of the total variance and was correlated positively with NO3- concentration and negatively with pH. Factor 2 was considered in relation to the partial pressure of dissolved CO2 gas in the stream water and appeared to be a complex biological factor that reflected CO2 production in the catchment soil and consumption in the stream.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of an industrial wastewater treatment plant (IWTP) and a municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWTP) effluents on a variety of bioindicators ranging from biochemical, organism, and population-level responses in pate chub (Zacco platypus) and fish community structure. The Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) indicated that the site upstream of these wastewater treatment plant discharges is in fair-good condition and downstream of the plant is in poor condition. The EROD (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) activity, condition factor, and liver somatic index were significantly increased at the downstream site compared to those of the upstream site. The most significant change observed in pale chub population in the downstream site of the Miho Stream, relative to the upstream population, was the total absence of an younger age group. Stressors impacting the downstream site were identified as mostly organic or nutrient enrichment and habitat degradation associated with wastewater treatment plants. The results of causal analysis suggest that the primary causes affecting fish population in the downstream site are through both size-selective mortality caused by ammonia toxicity and recruitment failure caused by habitat degradation and reproduction problem due to an IWTP and MWTP effluents.

AB  - Despite the high conservation value of intermittent soda pans, these habitats were mostly targeted by small-scale studies and little is known about their microscopic fauna. We sampled all the remaining 110 representatives of this habitat type (including recently restored ones) in Europe in an area covering approximately 125 000km(2). We analyzed spring and summer zooplankton species composition including rotifers, copepods, and cladocerans. We found 105 Rotifera, 26 Cladocera, and 26 Copepoda taxa, with local species richness ranging between 1 and 38 taxa. Alpha diversity was comparable in the two main groups (Rotifera, Crustacea), while beta and gamma diversity was higher in rotifers. The most frequently occurring zooplankters were crustaceans, while rotifer taxa were rarer as the most frequent species inhabited less than half of the pans. Dominance of the natronophilic Arctodiaptomus spinosus proved to be a reliable indicator for high quality soda pans. We concluded that the most typical soda pan zooplankton communities developed by early summer, in the concentrated pans, thus we would suggest considering this period as a reference for ecological state monitoring, and especially for evaluating the success of soda pan rehabilitations or reconstructions with the help of zooplankton. Based on these criteria, restorations could be considered only moderately successful.

AB  - An integrated modelling framework (IMF) has been developed and applied to analyse climate change impacts and the effectiveness of adaptation measures in Austrian agriculture. The IMF couples the crop rotation model CropRota, the bio-physical process model EPIC and the bottom-up economic land use model PASMA at regional level (NUTS-3) considering agri-environmental indicators. Four contrasting regional climate model (RCM) simulations represent climate change until 2050. The RCM simulations are applied to a baseline and three adaptation and policy scenarios. Climate change increases crop productivity on national average in the IMF. Changes in average gross margins at national level range from 0% to + 5% between the baseline and the three adaptation and policy scenarios. The impacts at NUTS-3 level range from -5% to + 7% between the baseline and the three adaptation and policy scenarios. Adaptation measures such as planting of winter cover crops, reduced tillage and irrigation are effective in reducing yield losses, increasing revenues, or in improving environmental states under climate change. Future research should account for extreme weather events in order to analyse whether average productivity gains at the aggregated level suffice to cover costs from expected higher climate variability.

AB  - Bivalve farming is a major European aquaculture activity, representing 48.5% of total biomass produced. Italy is one of the largest consumers of oysters but local production does not meet the market demand. Italy has approximately 384,000 ha of shallow lagoons in its coastal area, already devoted to extensive aquaculture activities, which could also represent potential locations for Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas, Thunberg, 1793) farming.
   The aim of this study is to enhance Pacific oyster farming in shallow coastal lagoons by testing novel farming technologies and validating an existing bioenergetic growth model (ShellSIM).
   Commercial performance of Pacific oysters and associated environmental parameters were monitored in two Sardinian coastal lagoons (San Teodoro and Santa Gilla, Italy). Oyster growth and survival were compared during a production cycle for two rearing systems: traditional systems (floating bags or lanterns) and Ortac units. The latter has not been previously tested in coastal lagoons. Measured performances were compared with ShellSIM predictions to evaluate the model's ability to predict growth and the potential production in other coastal lagoons.
   Results showed that at the end of a six months cycle the oysters mean weight and Condition Index were significantly higher (p value < 0.05) in floating bags than in Ortac, (55.8 +/- 0.9 g and 50.1 +/- 1.3 g; 4.6 +/- 0.1 and 3.9 +/- 0.1 respectively). Also, the minimum commercial size (40 g) was reached by 98% and 68% of the oyster farmed in floating bags and Ortac units respectively. On the other hand, oysters reared in the Ortac showed a higher survival than in the floating bags (95.8 +/- 0.9% and 82.1 +/- 3.4%, respectively).
   ShellSIM growth predictions were highly correlated with the observed data in both lagoons. However, high values for root mean square deviation (RMSD) indicated that ShellSIM predictions were significantly validated for San Teodoro lagoon but not for Santa Gilla suggesting further tailoring to some environmental conditions to produce more realistic growth predictions.
   Results of this study indicate that both floating bags and Ortac system should be employed during the production cycle to maximise oysters' survival and growth performances. Furthermore, this study provides a new validated tool to farmers and stakeholders to monitor oysters' performances and estimate productivity in local waters.

AB  - This paper compares approaches to quantifying land cover/land use (LCLU) in riparian corridors of 23 watersheds in Oregon's Willamette Valley using color infrared aerial photography (AP) and Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. For each imagery source, LCLU adjacent to stream networks were quantified across a range of lateral and longitudinal scales. Single-date AP data had higher LCLU class accuracies than the multi-date TM data, except for row crops. Correlations among LCLU classes for the two imagery sources increased with increased spatial extent. In general, LCLU proportions for AP and TM differed, but lateral/longitudinal patterns were similar. An aggregated vegetation class comprised of forest, shrub/scrub, and grass/forb was strongly associated with a fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) for both AP and TM data, although AP correlations were higher. Highest fish IBI correlations for both data sources were with the aggregated vegetation class close to the stream and for the longest longitudinal scales. The row crop class was strongly associated with stream nitrate for both data sources, although correlations for the TM data were higher. Stream nitrate correlations were strongest for the widest lateral and longest longitudinal scales. Overall, both single-date AP and multi-date TM imagery appear to have potential for use in estimating indicators of stream ecological condition.

AB  - Overdependence and cumulative anthropogenic stresses have caused world forests to decrease at an unprecedented rate, especially in Southeast Asia. The Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Peninsula of Bangladesh is not an exception and follows the global deforestation trend. Despite being one of the country's richest forest ecosystems with multiple wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests, and influential wildlife habitats, the peninsula is now providing shelter for nearly one million Rohingya refugees. With the global deforestation trend coupled with excessive anthropogenic stresses from the Rohingya population, the forests in the peninsula are continuously deteriorating in terms of quality and integrity. In response to deforestation, the government invested in conservation efforts through afforestation and restoration programs, although the peninsula faced a refugee crisis in August 2017. The impact of this sudden increase in population on the forest ecosystem is large and has raised questions and contradictions between the government's conservation efforts and the humanitarian response. Relocation of the refugees seems to be a lengthy process and the forest ecosystem integrity needs to be preserved; therefore, the degree of stresses, level of impacts, and pattern of deforestation are crucial information for forest conservation and protection strategies. However, there are a lack of quantitative analyses on how the forest ecosystem is deteriorating and what future results would be in both space and time. In this study, the impact of the sudden humanitarian crisis (i.e., Rohingya refugees) as anthropogenic stress in Cox's Bazar-Teknaf peninsula has been spatiotemporally modeled and assessed using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and other collateral data. Using the density and accessibility of the Rohingya population along with the land cover and other physiographic data, a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique was applied through the Markov cellular automata technique to model the forest vegetation status. The impact of deforestation differs in cost due to variability of the forest vegetation covers. The study, therefore, developed and adopted three indices for assessment of the forest ecosystem based on the variability and weight of the forest cover loss. The spatial severity of impact (SSI) index revealed that out of 5415 ha of total degraded forest lands, 650 ha area would have the highest cost from 2017 to 2027. In the case of the ecosystem integrity (EI) index, a rapid decline in ecosystem integrity in the peninsula was observed as the integrity value fell to 1190 ha (2019) from 1340 ha (2017). The integrity is expected to further decline to 740 ha by 2027, if the stress persists in a similar fashion. Finally, the findings of ecosystem integrity depletion (EID) elucidated areas of 540 and 544 hectares that had a severe EID score of (-5) between 2017 and 2019 and 2017 and 2027, respectively. The displacement and refugee crisis is a recurrent world event that, in many cases, compromises the integrity and quality of natural space. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to have significant global and regional implications to help managers and policymakers of forest ecosystems make decisions that have minimal or no impact to facilitate humanitarian response.

AB  - Two end-to-end ecosystem models, NORWECOM.E2E and NoBa Atlantis, have been used to explore a selection of indicators from the Barents Sea Management plans (BSMP). The indicators included in the BSMP are a combination of simple (e.g. temperature, biomass, and abundance) and complex (e.g. trophic level and biomass of functional groups). The abiotic indicators are found to serve more as a tool to report on climate trends rather than being ecological indicators. It is shown that the selected indicators give a good overview of the ecosystem state, but that overarching management targets and lack of connection between indicators and management actions makes it questionable if the indicator system is suitable for direct use in management as such. The lack of socio-economic and economic indicators prevents a holistic view of the system, and an inclusion of these in future management plans is recommended. The evaluated indicators perform well as an assessment of the ecosystem, but consistency and representativeness are extremely dependent on the time and in what area they are sampled. This conclusion strongly supports the inclusion of an observing system simulation experiment in management plans, to make sure that the observations represent the properties that the indicators need.

AB  - The Wufeng-Longmaxi Formations (WF-LM Fms) in the Sichuan Basin are sets of graptolite-bearing shale strata containing high-frequency bentonite layers. In order to investigate the influence of volcanism on the organic matter (OM) accumulation in shales, detailed observations of several typical profiles and wells were performed. Also, analyses including total organic carbon (TOC) contents and mineral compositions were conducted on 126 shale and 5 bentonite core samples. Major and trace element analyses were conducted on the selected 25 shale and 5 bentonite samples in the WF-LM Fms of well Lu-A. Results show that WF and LM1-4 members are the bentonites concentrated sections, while LM5-6 are the bentonites relatively concentrated sections and no bentonite is found in LM7-9 members. The high potassium (K) content of bentonites have the typical characteristics of intermediate-acid calcium-alkaline volcanic rocks such as andesite and dacite, which probably originated from intraplate collision or volcanic arc structural backgrounds related to the collision belt of the Cathaysia Block to the Yangtze Block. Productivity indicators (P content, excess Si, P/Al, Cu/Al, and Ni/Al) in the WF and LM1-3 members are all significantly higher than those in the Lingxiang (LX) and LM4-5+ members. The higher biological productivity during the Ordovician-Silurian (0-S) transition was attributed to the massive and intensive volcanism. The fertilization by volcanic ash brought abundant biologically relevant nutrient elements (N, P, Si, Fe, and Al) into the ocean, thus triggering the phytoplankton bloom and enhancing primary biological productivity. All the redox condition indexes (Mo-EF, U-EF, NiEF, V-EF, Mo/TOC, C-org/P, and U/Th) positively correlate with TOC content. During the O-S transition, the intensive and massive volcanic eruptions triggered global cooling, sea-level changes, late Ordovician mass extinction, and primary productivity increases, thus promoting anoxic, and possibly intermittently euxinic bottom conditions. In addition, the deposited bentonite layers had a strong capacity for oxygen isolation. Volcanism should be considered when modeling the OM accumulation of the WF-LM shales.

AB  - The state of an ecosystem is governed by dynamic biotic and abiotic processes, which can only be partially observed. Costs associated with measuring each component limit the feasibility of comprehensive assessments of target ecosystems. Instead, indicator species are recommended as a surrogate index. While this is an attractive concept, indicator species have rarely proven to be an effective tool for monitoring ecosystems and informing management decisions. One deficiency in the existing theoretical development of indicator species may be overcome with the incorporation of latent (i.e. unobservable) states. Advancements in quantitative ecological models allow for latent-state models to be tested empirically, facilitating the robust evaluation and practical use of indicator species for ecosystem science and management. Here, we extend the existing conceptual models of indicator species to include a direct relationship between an indicator species, ecosystem change drivers and latent processes and variables. Our approach includes explicit consideration of important estimation uncertainty and narrows the range of values a latent variable may take by relating it to measurable attribute(s) of an indicator species. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by relating a commonly cited indicator species, the red-backed salamanderPlethodon cinereus, to a typical latent process of interest - ecosystem health.

AB  - Shrimps are economically and ecologically very important, yet a lack of ageing techniques and hence unknown growth rates often impairs analytical assessments and management. A new method for the determination of in situ growth rates of shrimps is presented, based on dry weight condition. Since this index oscillates from low values directly after moult to highest values prior to moult in constantly feeding shrimp, the lowest observed pre-moult condition followed by a moult was introduced as a reference value to separate growing and starving individuals in field data. Experiments with Crangon crangon confirmed that (1) post-moult condition varies in a narrow physiologically optimal range, regardless of recent growth increments, and (2) dry weight condition prior to moult is closely related to the subsequent length increment. The method was applied to estimate growth increments from in situ dry weight condition data of C. crangon. The new method can easily be applied to other related species, since the required data can be obtained from very simple short-term experiments.

AB  - Fish assemblages are considered indicators of aquatic ecosystem quality. Based on how fish communities respond to anthropogenic pressures, we developed a multimetric fish index for evaluating the health of both coastal and transitional waters. Fish data were collected along the Polish coast in the years 2011, 2013 and 2014 using different types of gear. Redundancy analysis showed that the most important environmental factor affecting fish community was salinity. Responses to anthropogenic disturbances of 20 candidate metrics were tested by generalized linear models, taking into account salinity, sampling protocol and the proxy of human pressures described by the Baltic Sea Impact Index (BSII). Five selected metrics were combined in a Multimetric Index, which showed negative significant correlation with BSII. The index presented herein appeared to be a good tool for assessing the ecological state of highly impacted Polish transitional and coastal areas and complies with the Water Framework Directive requirements.

AB  - Cross-cultural environmental monitoring systems inform on a broad suite of indicators relevant to both scientific and local communities. In this study, we used forest-plot-based survey measures developed by western scientists and a set of community-based survey indicators developed by maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand (NZ), to compare the current state of two ecologically congruent forests (Whirinaki and Ruathuna), as they related to a historic Ruathuna forest state (Baseline; 1955-1975) in NZ. Both the plot-based and community-based field surveys indicated that the Whirinaki forest was in a better state than the Ruathuna forest. This was supported by a stronger mauri (concept of life essence) rating assigned by maori elders to the Whirinaki forest compared with the Ruathuna forests. However, both the Ruathuna and Whirinaki forests were deemed to be in a significantly poorer state than the Baseline forest. A cross-cultural monitoring system provides understanding of forest state that both managers and communities can use for decision-making. Historical baselines of forest state can provide ecological targets for restoration initiatives and also identify where on the restoration continuum current forest indicators lie. The alignment of plot-based measures with community-based indicators offers possibilities for future-proofing a cross-cultural monitoring system and buffering it from intergenerational shifts in ecological baselines. The opportunity for indigenous peoples and local communities to apply their traditional ways of knowing, and interpret and act on information they understand are crucial components of cross-cultural environmental management regimes.

AB  - The effect of altitude of residence on the growth status of 11,454 indigenous school children 6-14 years of age in Oaxaca, southern Mexico, was examined. Indicators of living conditions (human development index [HDI], index of community nutritional risk [INR], index of marginalization [IM], index of relative isolation [II]) were regressed on z-scores for height, weight and BMI, and the residuals were regressed on altitude of residence (km). Independent of other environmental conditions, altitude negatively affected height by approximately -0.07 z-scores per kilometer altitude above sea level. The estimated average decrease in stature was 0.92 cm per kilometer elevation. BMI was significantly increased, 1.2 units per kilometer elevation, consistent with earlier studies of growth status and altitude. In contrast, weight was not affected by altitude of residence. Approximately 36% of the reduction in height and 54% of the increase in BMI were due to altitude effects; the remaining changes in height and BMI were associated with environmental factors reflected in the indices of community well-being considered.

AB  - On the left bank of the Cuiba River, one of the main tributaries of the Pantanal in Mato Grosso, are located the Chacorore and Sinha Mariana Lakes and the Mutum River, the littoral regions of which are covered with aquatic macrophytes, dominated by the species Eichhornia crassipes and Eichhornia azurea. To examine the ichthyofauna associated with this vegetation, in the year 2003, 3510 fish were collected, distributed among 83 species, and the limnological variables verified near the macrophyte stands where they were sampled. The most abundant and richest order was the Characiformes, followed by the Gymnotiformes and Siluriformes. Analysis of similarity showed a very low, or null, index that. the limnological conditions and morphology of the aquatic macrophyte species provide habitat sufficiently homogeneous to give. The limnological conditions and morphology of the aquatic macrophyte species provide a sufficient habitat heterogeneity to give very low, or null, index values. Thus, environmental conservation measures should be more effective in promoting the conservation of the species, given the high levels of biological diversity found in the habitats studied.

AB  - Three developmental stages in the Tivela mactroides clam: juvenile (10-20 mm), juvenile with reproductive capacity (20-30 mm) and adults (30-45 mm) were evaluated to determine the physiological condition of clams related to environmental pollution levels using the RNA/DNA index. The populations evaluated were obtained from Playa Guiria (Sucre state, northeastern coast of Venezuela), which has no sign of pollution, and from Rio Chico and Boca de Paparo (Miranda state, central coast of Venezuela), which showed high pollution levels due to urban and industrial waste disposal through the Tuy river. The RNA and DNA concentrations were determined in the adductor muscle by fluormetric techniques. The three populations showed significant differences in the RNA/DNA index. The clams of Playa Guiria showed the highest RNA/DNA index, followed by Rio Chico and Boca de Paparo specimens. This pattern was related to pollution levels in each locality. The RNA/DNA index was inversely proportional to bivalve sizes. The results showed that the RNA/DNA index can be used as a physiological index to estimate conditions of environmental pollution stress on Tivela mactroides.

AB  - We developed a multimetric index for assessing ecological conditions in rocky reefs areas to evaluate thermal and urban influences on fish community. Eight metrics were selected to assess thermal influence: (1) total number of species; (2) number of water column species; (3) number of transient species; (4) density of individuals with low resilience; (5) density of omnivores; (6) density of carnivores; (7) number of cryptic species; (8) density of herbivores. For urban influence, six metrics were selected: (1) total density; (2) ratio between the number of rare species and the total number of species; (3) density of individuals with heavy fishing pressure; (4) number of resident species; (5) number of cryptic species; (6) density of herbivores. This preliminary index succeed in discriminating control/impacted sites and proved to be an important tool to assess impacts that alter fish community and have potential to be used in tropical rock reef coastal areas.

AB  - Morphological and ecophysiological traits of wild, farmed and wild farm-associated gilthead seabream Sparus aurata were used to assess the degree of phenotypic adaptation of the species to their respective environments. Geometric morphometrics revealed clear body shape differentiation amongst the 3 types of populations, whereby significant differences were noted in head profile and the anterior-body region of the fish. Morphological resemblance was recorded among 2 gilthead seabream populations associated with tuna farms, indicating that they share the same phenotypic responsiveness pattern. Adaptation in reproductive investment strategy was observed in individuals from farm-associated origin, displaying the highest gonadosomatic index but lowest condition in comparison to their farmed and wild counterparts. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that sex change from male to female with increasing length was more pronounced in farm-associated fish than in farmed and and wild fish. These findings demonstrate a significant influence of the environmental factors inherent to tuna farms on the phenotypic characteristics of gilthead seabream, providing a basis for further research on the ecological effects of tuna farms on local marine populations.

AB  - Mortality is a key process of forest ecosystem dynamics and functioning strongly altering biomass stocks and carbon residence times. Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) used to predict forest dynamics are typically based on simple, largely data-free ('theoretical') mortality algorithms (MAs). To improve DVM projections, the use of empirically based MAs has been suggested, but little is known about their impact on DVM behavior. A systematic comparison of eight MAs (seven inventory-based, one 'theoretical') for the pan-European tree species Pinus sylvestris L. was carried out within the DVM ForClim for present and future climate scenarios at three contrasting sites across Europe. Model accuracy was furthermore evaluated with empirical data from young- and old-growth forests. We found strongly diverging mortality patterns among the MAs for present climate. Based on their behavior, we identified two distinct empirical MA groups that were related to their structure (i.e., variables considered), but not to their geographic origin (i.e., the environmental conditions they were calibrated to). Under climate change, MAs based on a competition index produced ecologically inconsistent results, while MAs based on growth showed more plausible and less extreme behaviors. Furthermore, MAs based on growth reached a higher accuracy for projecting young- and old-growth forest dynamics. Our results demonstrate that using empirical MAs in DVMs has a high potential to better predict forest dynamics, but also a risk of yielding implausible results if their structure is inadequate. For DVM applications across large spatiotemporal scales, we thus suggest using MAs based on growth, particularly under future no-analogue climates.

AB  - Biological quality elements have been developed worldwide to assess whether a water body is in a good status or not. However, current studies mainly focus on a single taxonomic group or a small set of species, often limited by methods of morphological identification, and lack further aspects of biodiversity (e.g., across taxa and multiple attributes) and ecosystem functions. Here, we advance a framework for assessing the river's ecological status based on complete biodiversity data measured by environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding and measurements of ecosystem functions in addition to physicochemical elements across a large riverine system in China. We identified 40 indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, covering five taxonomic groups from bacteria to invertebrates, and associated with multiple attributes of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Our data show that human impact on ecosystems could be accurately predicted by these eDNA-based indicators and ecosystem functions, using cross-validation with a known stressor gradient. Moreover, indices based on these indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem functions not only distinguish the physicochemical characteristics of the sites but also improve the assessment accuracy of 20-30% for the river's ecological status. Overall, by incorporating eDNA-based biodiversity with physicochemical and ecosystem functional elements, the multidimensional perspectives of ecosystem states provide additional information to protect and maintain a good ecological status of rivers.

AB  - This paper deals with thermomechanical bending of functionally graded material (FGM) plates under various boundary conditions and resting on two-layer elastic foundations. One of these layers is Winkler springs with a variable modulus while the other is considered as a shear layer with a constant modulus. The plates are considered of the type having two opposite sides simply-supported, and the two other sides having combinations of simply-supported, clamped, and free boundary conditions. The temperature is obtained by solving the one-dimensional equation of heat conduction. The material properties of the plate are assumed to be graded continuously across the panel thickness. A simple power-law distribution in terms of the volume fractions of the constituents is used for estimating the effective material properties such as temperature-dependent thermoelastic properties. The governing equations are derived based on the sinusoidal shear deformation plate theory including the external load and thermal effects. The results of this theory are compared with those of other shear deformation theories. Various numerical results including the effect of boundary conditions, power-law index, plate aspect ratio, temperature difference, elastic foundation parameters, and side-to-thickness ratio on the bending of FGM plates are presented.

AB  - Implementation of the Controlled Reduced Tide (CRT) technique could increase the total surface of tidal freshwater marshes in Europe and ease implementation of restoration projects in coastal defense and riverine ecosystems. The goal was to determine whether a regularly flooded area connected to a freshwater tidal river could act as an important foraging area for European eel, and if so, to what extent the diet of eels in this flooding area differed from that of eels foraging in the river itself. The stomach contents of eels from the River Schelde were compared with eels from the Lippenbroek, an adjacent CRT area. Prey diversity (H') of individual eels was about four times higher in the Lippenbroek than in the River Schelde. Moreover, 12 prey categories in eel stomachs from the Lippenbroek were found whereas only three categories were retrieved from eels in the River Schelde. In the Lippenbroek, eels fed on terrestrial organisms (lumbricids, caterpillars and other insects), but also on fish and fish eggs and to a lesser extent on other aquatic prey (Lumbricullidae, chironomids and Hirudinea). In contrast, eels from the main river fed mainly on tubificids, fish, and some gammarids. Consequently, eels in the Schelde estuary are opportunistic feeders, but with a preference for large benthic prey. The number and weight of aquatic organisms ingested by eels in the Lippenbroek is not significantly different from the River Schelde. However, eels foraging in the Lippenbroek area had consumed significantly more terrestrial prey. Furthermore the total caloric value estimated for the ingested prey of eels from the Lippenbroek (derived from the literature) was about twice as high as that for eels from the River Schelde. While the condition index remained inconclusive, an Ancova revealed that eels captured in the Lippenbroek were significantly heavier for a given length than eels captured in the Schelde. The study showed that with a controlled reduced tide to restore lateral connectivity of large tidal rivers with their adjacent floodplains, high quality habitats for the European eel are created. These measures could significantly contribute to the production of eels in better condition, which have better chances to reproduce successfully. Hence, wetland restoration could enhance the recovery of the European eel stocks.

AB  - This study was designed to evaluate whether the outcome of artificial insemination (AI) was affected by the metabolic and oxidative status of dairy cows. Seventy-nine inseminations in 40 cows, were classified, on the basis of blood progesterone (P4) and pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) concentrations and clinical confirmation of pregnancy into, three categories: (1) positive (AI+, resulted in pregnancy, n = 26; 33%), (2) negative (AI-, did not result in pregnancy, n = 49; 62%), and (3) embryonic mortality (EM, n = 4; 5%). Reactive oxygen metabolites, biological antioxidant potential, oxidative stress index, body condition score, glucose, total proteins, albumin, urea, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), cholesterol, triglycerides, haptoglobin and advanced oxidative protein products (AOPPs) were measured on the day of AI (day 0), and 30 and 42 days later.
   Cows with EM had lower BCS scores (2.5) than AI+ (2.8) and AI- (2.9) cows (P < 0.05). During the postpartum period, body condition score (BCS) increased and NEFAs decreased (P < 0.05) suggesting a recovery from the negative energy balance (NEB). The only significant differences found were that the mean concentration of AOPPs was higher and that of albumin lower in EM cows than in AI+ and AI- (P < 0.05) animals.

AB  - A three-dimensional (3D) free vibration analysis of simply supported, doubly curved functionally graded (FG) magneto-electro-elastic shells with closed-circuit surface conditions is presented using the method of perturbation. By means of the direct elimination, we firstly reduce the twenty-nine basic equations of 3D magneto-electro-elasticity to ten differential equations in terms of ten primary variables of magnetic, electric and elastic fields. The method of multiple scales is introduced to eliminate the secular terms in various order problems of the present formulation so that the present asymptotic expansion to the primary field variables leads to be uniform and feasible. Through the mathematical manipulation of nondimensionalization, asymptotic expansion and successive integration, we finally obtain recurrent sets of governing equations for various order problems. The coupled classical shell theory (CST) is derived as a first-order approximation to the 3D magneto-electro-elasticity. Higher-order modifications can be further determined by considering the solvability and orthonormality conditions in a systematic and consistent way. Some benchmark solutions for the free vibration analysis of FG elastic and piezoelectric plates are used to validate the performance of the present asymptotic formulation. The influence of the material-property gradient index on the natural frequencies and corresponding modal field variables of the FG shells is mainly concerned. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - The Issyk-Kul Lake region is well known for its magnificent scenery and unique scientific significance. With multivariable statistical methods, the contents of several geochemical elements (Fe, Mn, V, Zn, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Mo, Cd, Sb, Tl, Pb, and Hg) and total organic matter of 61 topsoil samples were analyzed, and then, the results were used to assess the environmental factors controlling the concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTE) in the region. The results showed that most of the elements including Fe, Mn, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, As, and Sb reflected the natural state, but several PTE (Zn, Mo, Hg, Cd, Pb, and Tl) had been influenced by anthropogenic factors. Among these, Zn, Mo, Hg, and Cd were significantly correlated with the organic matter content, which suggests that agricultural soils will accumulate more PTE. From the calculations for the human risk assessment of anthropogenically derived PTE (Zn, Mo, Hg, Cd, Pb, and Tl), the risks for ingestion in this region were found to be higher than those for inhalation and dermal absorption; however, the results also suggested there are no non-carcinogenic risks for all anthropogenically influenced PTE in the current state.

AB  - Indicators are needed to support the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), by providing information on the state of the ecosystem, the extent and intensity of effort or mortality and the progress of management in relation to objectives. Here, I review recent work on the development, selection and application of indicators and consider how indicators might support an EAF. Indicators should guide the management of fishing activities that have led to, or are most likely to lead to, unsustainable impacts on ecosystem components or attributes. The numbers and types of indicators used to support an EAF will vary among management regions, depending on resources available for monitoring and enforcement, and actual and potential fishing impacts. State indicators provide feedback on the state of ecosystem components or attributes and the extent to which management objectives, which usually relate to state, are met. State can only be managed if the relationships with fishing (pressure) and management (response) are known. Predicting such relationships is fundamental to developing a management system that supports the achievement of objectives. In a management framework supported by pressure, state and response indicators, the relationship between the value of an indicator and a target or limit reference point, reference trajectory or direction provides guidance on the management action to take. Values of pressure, state and response indicators may be affected by measurement, process, model and estimation error and thus different indicators, and the same indicators measured at different scales and in different ways, will detect true trends on different timescales. Managers can use several methods to estimate the effects of error on the probability of detecting true trends and/or to account for error when setting reference points, trajectories and directions. Given the high noise to signal ratio in many state indicators, pressure and response indicators would often guide short-term management decision making more effectively, with state indicators providing longer-term policy-focused feedback on the effects of management action.

AB  - Comparing fat content with physiological status can throw light on the reproduction and feeding behavior of the fish. The biological data of 586 bigeye tuna were collected from the longline fishery in the waters of Western Central Indian Ocean from November, 2012 to March, 2013. The spatial or temporal distribution of the fat content, and the relationships of fat content with gender, round weight, gonadal maturity and fork length were analyzed. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the relationships between fat content and fork length (FL), gonadosomatic index (GSI), condition factor (K), and somatic index (SI). Results showed that: 1) the fat content of bigeye tuna was in the range of 3.1%-27.1% with the average 12.8%; 2) there were no significant geographical differences of average fat content (P > 0.05) among 1 degrees squares in general; 3) there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) of the fat content for different genders, months, or gonad maturity stages; 4) there was an extremely significant correlation (P = 0.000) between fat content and FL and GSI. There was no significant correlation (P = 0.051) between fat content and K. There was a significant correlation (P = 0.003) between fat content and SI. The results of this study suggest that the fat content of the matured fish was relatively stable. The survey area was in a spawning region, and the survey period was the spawning season for bigeye tuna.

AB  - In total, 626 individuals of Alburnus mossulensis and 586 individuals of Acanthobrama marmid were collected monthly from Karakaya Dam Lake on the upper Euphrates River. The gonadosomatic index, somatic condition, oocyte size, and fecundity were calculated on a monthly basis. Reading of scales indicated that the maximum age was 4+ years for A. mossulensis and A. marmid. The estimated length-weight relationships were W = 0.206 x FL2.065 for females and W = 0.119 x FL2.138 for males in A. mossulensis, and W = 0.029 x FL2.678 for females and W = 0.030 x FL2.631 for males in A. marmid. Growth in length equations were L-t = 19.6[1 - e(-0.14(t + 1.39))] for females and L-t = 20.1[1 - e(-1.40(t + 1.04))] for males in A. mossulensis and L-t = 17.3[1 - e(-1.37(t + 1.04))] for females and L-t = 16.6[1 - e(-1.29(t + 1.04))] for males in A. marmid. This study investigated oocyte size and fecundity for A. mossulensis and A. marmid in Turkey for the first time. The spawning period was between May and August for A. mossulensis and between May and June for A. marmid. These 2 species usually play a key role in the food web of temperate freshwater systems. In addition to water quality, biological data of these 2 species are very important in terms of future water management of the basin of Karakaya Dam Lake.

AB  - In Brazil, the papaya crop (Carica papaya L.) is well diffused, specially in the Southern Region of the State of Bahia and the Northern Region of the State of Espirito Santo, where most of the commercial plantations are concentrated. Papaya is a crop that needs renovation of the orchards every four years, at the most, demanding the development of new technologies and improvement in the quality of the plantlets, also demanding the development of research in this area. Growth analysis has been used by researchers in order to explain growth differences of genetic or environmental causes. This is a very efficient tool for the identification of promising materials and characteristics that possibly increase the yield of abolt plant during the initial growth, favoring the works of breeding. This is valmble infermatian for plant breeding army productive. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the initial growth of papaya plants growing under greenhouse conditions using physiological indexes as yield indicative parameters. Therefore, a complete randomized block experiment was carried out using the Golden cultivar and the Tainung N degrees 1 hybrid. It was concluded that the physiological indexes: absolute growth ratio. relative growth ratio, accurate assimilation ratio and leaf area ratio are efficient tools to identity and compare different genetic materials during the initial growth of papaya plants growing under greenhouse conditions.

AB  - Interspecific interactions, such as competition, are among the key factors that determine the distribution, abundance and diversity of organisms in natural communities of aquatic ecosystems. However, a marked reduction in the environmental integrity of streams may lead to modifications of the natural dynamics of these communities, including co-occurrence patterns and body size. In the Amazon, the replacement of forests by production systems is one of the leading causes of alterations to riverine ecosystem. The insects of the order Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) are predators known to compete for environmental resources but are also sensitive to environmental changes such as those caused by shifts in land use. In this scenario, the present study evaluated species co-occurrence and body size patterns in adult odonates found at preserved and altered Amazonian streams, to determine whether there are morphological differences among the species that enable their coexistence. During the study, 98 streams in the eastern Amazon region were sampled, and a habitat integrity index (HII) was used to evaluate the integrity of each stream (based on variables such as the condition of the riparian vegetation and channel, and land use). Ten male individuals were selected from each species, and nine morphometric measurements were taken from each individual. A total of 3588 specimens were collected and distributed in nine families, 49 genera and 134 species. We found a non-random pattern of co-occurrence in the species of the odonate suborder Zygoptera and a random pattern in the suborder Anisoptera, in both preserved and altered streams. We found morphological divergence between pairs of zygopteran species, in the whole sample and both categories of stream integrity separately. No such morphological divergence was found in the pairs of anisopteran species. The distribution patterns of odonate species are limited by specific environmental processes, especially in preserved environments and in specialists, such as most zygopterans. Zygopteran species have more specific microhabitat requirements, which could explain this pattern, whereas anisopterans prefer open environments, which usually have a greater supply of resources, although there tends to be less microhabitat heterogeneity, which leads to reduced competition. Given this, future studies should use limiting similarity (e.g. morphological attributes) in addition to environmental and spatial factors to better understand the factors structuring these communities. Among these mechanisms, the effects of common ancestry (phylogenetic inertia) and biogeography are important factors that should also be considered in future studies.

However, little has been done to assess the pristine soil conditions despite the fact that these provide the basis to put changes into context. Various methodologies have been developed to assess the global distribution of current soil conditions. We used the S-World methodology that was developed to generate global soil property maps for environmental modelling studies. Up till now, the S-World methodology assessed current soil conditions by disaggregating the Harmonized World Soil Database using detailed information on climate, topography, land cover, and land use. This study used the S-World methodology to derive global soil conditions under natural vegetation. A large number of natural areas around the globe were identified for which land cover, expressed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, could be successfully correlated to environmental conditions such as temperature, rainfall, and topography. Using this relation in regression kriging, the vegetation index under natural conditions was derived for the entire globe. Subsequently, the S-World methodology was used to calculate the soil properties under natural land cover and absence of human land use. Soil property maps for natural and current conditions were compared and showed large local differences. The results indicate that there are major changes due to land cover and land use change and that these changes are concentrated on the globe. The results are the basis for future assessments on, for example, land degradation, food security, or the sustainable development goals. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Rapid changes in climate and land use and the resulting shifts in species distributions and ecosystem functions have motivated the development of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Integrating across spatial scales from ground sampling to remote sensing, NEON will provide data for users to address ecological responses to changes in climate, land use, and species invasion across the United States for at least 30 years. Although NEON remote sensing and tower sensor elements are relatively well known, the biological measurements are not. This manuscript describes NEON terrestrial sampling, which targets organisms across a range of generation and turnover times, and a hierarchy of measurable biological states. Measurements encompass species diversity, abundance, phenology, demography, infectious disease, ecohydrology, and biogeochemistry. The continental-scale sampling requires collection of comparable and calibrated data using transparent methods. Data will be publicly available in a variety of formats and suitable for integration with other long-term efforts. NEON will provide users with the data necessary to address large-scale questions, challenge current ecological paradigms, and forecast ecological change.

AB  - Sludge bulking, a notorious microbial issue in activated sludge plants, is always accompanied by dramatic changes in the bacterial community. Despite large numbers of phages in sludge systems, their responses to sludge bulking and phage-host associations during bulking are unknown. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of viral metagenomes and bacterial 16S rRNA genes were employed to characterize viral and bacterial communities in a sludge plant under different sludge conditions (sludge volume index (SVI) of 180, 132, and 73 ml/g). Bulking sludges (SVI > 125 ml/g) taken about 10 months apart exhibited similar bacterial and viral composition. This reflects ecological resilience of the sludge microbial community and indicates that changes in viral and bacterial populations correlate closely with each other. Overgrowth of "Candidatus Microthrix parvicella" led to filamentous bulking, but few corresponding viral genotypes were identified. In contrast, sludge viromes were characterized by numerous contigs associated with "Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis," suggesting an abundance of corresponding phages in the sludge viral community. Notably, while nitrifiers (mainly Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrospiraceae) declined significantly along with sludge bulking, their corresponding viral contigs were identified more frequently and with greater abundance in the bulking viromes, implying that phage-mediated lysis might contribute to the loss of autotrophic nitrifiers under bulking conditions.

AB  - Air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) have been widely used in domestic buildings. However, the regulation performance of ASHPs for indoor thermal comfort control is influenced by the factors such as cold draft and slow response to the variation in room temperature. In this paper, a range of experiments was carried out for 14 ASHPs in an indoor environmental chamber under both cooling and heating conditions. A multi-index comprehensive evaluation model including the questionnaire survey method, the weighted scoring method and the quartile algorithm method was then adopted to analyze the tested data in order to give some intuitive indices to evaluate the regulation performance of ASHPs for indoor thermal comfort control. The results showed that unsatisfied factor of the overall thermal comfort under the cooling conditions was reached to 71 %. Besides, the precision of the temperature control was poor in both cooling and heating conditions, which manifesting ASHPs need a novel matched adjust mode and more intelligent control system to meet thermal comfort requirement. This study provided a reference basis for evaluating ASHP's regulation performance on indoor thermal comfort.

AB  - Ghar El Melh is a shallow lagoon (average depth of 0.8 m) that has undergone a eutrophication process due to growing human pressures. To obtain a global frame of the ecosystem functioning, an optical and an ecological classification were used in parallel. Downwelling and upwelling spectral irradiances were measured in situ in 22 sampling stations across the water body; then Apparent Optical Properties (AOPs), namely reflectance R(lambda) and vertical attenuation coefficient K-d(lambda()) were calculated for each wavelength of visible spectrum, furnishing typical spectra from turbid waters, rich in dissolved and suspended matter. From water samples of the same stations the concentrations of OASs (Optically Active Substances), i.e. Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Non-Algal Particulate (NAP) and Phytoplankton, were assessed. The use of an optical classification for water bodies rich in TSM and CDOM, integrating AOPs and OASs, highlighted a great spatial heterogeneity, well overlapping with hydrology and human impacts patterns. A modified version of the Ecological Evaluation Index (EEI), considering the macrophyte distribution (based on a visual assessment of macrophyte coverage, without quantitative sampling) was then used, highlighting an intermediate ecological condition, despite high water turbidities. The integrated use of both systems thus furnished a complete characterization, rapidly detecting the most impacted sectors and the possible primary causes. The method might be applied as a monitoring procedure in other Mediterranean coastal lagoons, with the aim to adopt a common conservation strategy for these important transitional water bodies.

AB  - Numerous environmental factors can influence body size. Comparing populations in different ecological contexts is one potential approach to elucidating the most critical of such factors. In the current study, we found that the body size of the land hermit crab Coenobita rugosus was significantly larger on Dongsha Island in the South China Sea than on other eco-islands around Southern Taiwan. We hypothesized that this could be due to differences in (1) shell resources, (2) parasite impact, (3) competition, (4) predation, and (5) food. We found no supporting evidence for the first three hypotheses; the shells used by the hermit crabs on Dongsha were in poorer condition than were those used elsewhere, extremely few individuals in the region had ectoparasites, and the density of hermit crabs varied considerably among localities within each island. However, significantly higher percentages of C. rugosus reached age 3 years on Dongsha than at Siziwan bay in Taiwan. Two growth rate indices inferred from size structures suggested faster growth on Dongsha than at Siziwan. The condition index (i. e., the body mass/shield length ratio of C. rugosus) was also greater on Dongsha than at Siziwan. Therefore, Dongsha hermit crabs seem to have superior diet and growth performance. Seagrass debris accumulation at the shore of Dongsha was considerable, whereas none was observed at Siziwan or on the other islands, where dicot leaves were the dominant food item for the vegetarian hermit crabs. We then experimentally evaluated the possible role of seagrass as food for C. rugosus. The crabs on Dongsha preferred seagrass to dicot leaves, and their growth increment was faster when they fed on seagrass than when they fed on dicot leaves; no such differences were found in the Siziwan hermit crabs. The aforementioned results are compatible with the food hypothesis explaining the size differences among the islands. The predator hypothesis could explain the greater life span but not the other findings. Populations of C. rugosus on islands with seagrass debris piles probably contribute more to the gene pool of the species because higher proportions of these populations could achieve high fecundity. The fate of these terrestrial hermit crabs may rely on the health of underwater seagrass ecosystems that are under threat from global change.

AB  - GIS-based data sets were used to analyze the structure of the forest line at the landscape level in the lowlands of the Usa River Basin, in northeast European Russia. Vegetation zones in the area range from taiga in the south to forest-tundra and tundra in the north. We constructed logistic regression models to predict forest location at spatial scales varying from 1 x 1 km to 25 x 25 km grid cells. Forest location was explained by July mean temperature, ground temperature (permafrost), yearly minimum temperature, and a Topographic Wetness Index (soil moisture conditions). According to the models, the forest line follows the +13.9degreesC mean July temperature isoline, whereas in other parts of the Arctic it usually is located between +10 to +12degreesC. It is hypothesized that the anomalously high temperature isoline for the forest line in Northeast European Russia is due to the inability of local ecotypes of spruce to grow on permafrost terrain. Observed patterns depend on spatial scale, as the relative significance of the explanatory variables varies between models implemented at different scales. Developed models indicate that with climate wan-ning of 3degreesC by the end of the 21st century temperature would not limit forest advance anywhere in our study area.

AB  - Scientific water resource carrying capacity (WRCC) evaluations are necessary for providing guidance for the sustainable utilization of water resources. Based on the driving-pressure-state-impact-response feedback loop, this paper selects 21 indicators under five dimensions to construct a regional WRCC comprehensive evaluation framework. The projection pursuit clustering (PPC) method is implemented with the matter-element extension (MEE) model to overcome the limitations of subjective deviation and indicator attribute incompatibility in traditional comprehensive assessment methods affecting the accuracy of evaluations. The application of the integrated evaluation model is demonstrated in Baoding city in the Jing-Jin-Ji area from 2010 to 2017. The results indicate that the economic water consumption intensity is the most influential factor that impacts the WRCC change in Baoding, and the pressure subsystem and response subsystem are dominant in the entire system. The WRCC in Baoding significantly improved between 2010 and 2017 from a grade V extremely unsafe state to a grade III critical state. Natural water shortages and large population scales are the main negative factors during this period; however, the existing measures are still insufficient to achieve an optimal WRCC status. Considering the future population and industry inflow, additional actions must be proposed to maintain and promote harmonious conditions.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) has recently proposed changes to strengthen the transparency of its pivotal regulatory science policy and procedures. In this context, the US EPA aims to enhance the transparency of dose-response data and models, proposing to consider for the first time non-linear biphasic dose-response models. While the proposed changes have the potential to lead to markedly improved ecological risk assessment compared to past and current approaches, we believe there remain open issues for improving the quality of ecological risk assessment, such as the consideration of adaptive, dynamic and interactive effects. Improved risk assessment including adaptive and dynamic non-linear models (beyond classic threshold models) can enhance the quality of regulatory decisions and the protection of ecological health. We suggest that other countries consider adopting a similar scientific-regulatory posture with respect to dose-response modeling via the inclusion of nonlinear biphasic models, that incorporate the dynamic potential of biological systems to adapt (i.e., enhancing positive biological endpoints) or maladapt to low levels of stressor agents.

AB  - Water quality in streams typically changes fast, and sensitive biological indicators are crucial for monitoring these changes in water quality. Diatoms are widely used in biological stream quality assessment. However, interannual and intra-annual variation of diatom population densities is large, often hampering a reliable quality assessment. We studied the importance of different species traits on temporal occurrence of diatom species. We also examined whether temporal occurrence of diatoms is related to species' local abundance or regional distribution using a data set collected in Finnish streams. According to the general linear model (GLM), temporal occurrence of diatoms increased with increasing local abundance and regional distribution. Species that occurred more frequently also had larger niche breadths and nonmarginal niche positions. In addition, cell size and attachment ability were positively related to species temporal occurrence. Our results imply that abundant and widely distributed species with large niches and ability to attach sustain persistent populations in varying environmental conditions typical for streams. We suggest that future studies could concentrate on monitoring these common (abundant) species when detecting the possible changes in the biological state of streams. We advise, however, to consider a relatively large number of species as many of the most common species may have low indicator values.

AB  - Accurately estimating evapotranspiration (ET) for meadow wetland ecosystems is of great significance for water management in semiarid regions. Taking a meadow wetland ecosystem in the Horqin Sandy Land as an example, this study coupled the Ball-Berry canopy stomatal conductance model to Penman-Monteith (P-M) model and Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) model, and the improved P-M model and SWH model were calibrated and validated by long-term (2013-2018 growing seasons) eddy covariance (EC) measurements. The results indicated that the improved P-M model and SWH model performed well either at half-hourly or daily timescales, with high coefficient of determination (R-2) and index of agreement (IA) and low root mean square error (RMSE). Generally, the SWH model performed better than the improved P-M model, especially under the low leaf area index (LAI) conditions. In addition, in the growing seasons from 2013 to 2018, the mean ET measured by the EC system was 2.78 mm/d, which was approximately equal to the mean modeled ET from the SWH model (2.75 mm/d) and slightly higher than the mean modeled ET from the improved P-M model (2.34 mm/d). The improved P-M model and SWH model were highly sensitive to the parameter in estimating canopy surface resistance and to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in meteorological variables.

TI  - Nature indicators for agriculture
T2  - BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
LA  - German
AB  - The aim of the project "nature indicators for agriculture" was to develop a practicable and efficient tool for monitoring, assessing and evaluating the biotic and landscape benefits of agriculture on the farm level. The focus was laid on the feasibility of the method: farmers should be able to assess the biotic and landscape benefits on the farm by themselves. The method has been tested on 42 farms of 13-1900 ha size with different farming systems and structures throughout Germany - from the southwest (Baden-Wurttemberg) to the northeast (Brandenburg) of Germany. The testing was performed by the farmers as well as by scientists.
   Thirty-eight indicators have been worked out, which allow to assess the "ecological state" in the field of biotic resources on the farm level. Twenty-two of them are suitable for evaluating the "ecological achievements" in the field of biotic resources on the farm level. A final set of ten indicators in five categories was chosen as a set of core-indicators:
   Spatial diversity Number of crops (crop variety) and grassland types (grassland variety)
   Length of field edges and landscape elements [m/ha] (edge-density)
   Species diversity Share of farmland that is rich in plant species (presence of a certain amount of indicator plant species)
   Share of farmland which is very rich in plant
   Crop and livestock diversity Share of rare or endangered crop species
   Share of rare or endangered breeds
   Landscape element diversity Share of landscape elements (e. g. hedges, ditches, field margins)
   Share of landscape elements of acceptable quality (quality assessment of landscape elements)
   Extensively used farmland Share of extensively used farmland
   Share of extensively used farmland which is rich in indicator species (quality assessment of extensively used area)
   The application of the indicators is possible on different levels: on farm level, on regional and national level against the background of agri-environmental policy schemes and environmental monitoring schemes.
   The surveys on the farms in 2001 and 2002 have shown that the developed set of indicators reflects very well the ecological state on farm level. Furthermore the use of the tool seems easy enough to be put into a wider range of practice. In order to be used as an efficient evaluation tool on the farm level and finally be implemented as an official agri-environmental assessment tool, further steps have to be taken, e. g. regional goals concerning the shares or/and the "target-species" (in the category species diversity) have to be defined. In addition to assessing and evaluating the tool might very well contribute to the environmental awareness as well as promote the integration of environmental issues into farming practice.

AB  - Hepatic antioxidant enzymes as oxidative stress biotnarkers were investigated and correlated with the identified dominant gut microbial phyla. The results showed that while the antioxidant enzymes, Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), and Catalase (CAT) levels were reduced in the polluted PO site, significant elevation (*P >= 0.05) was observed at the clean reference CR site indicating negative correlation to pollution stress. On the other hand, among five significant bacterial genera, Lactobacillus and Vagococcus showed a positive relationship to the oxidative pollution stress between PO and CR sites. Diversity and bacterial richness had been observed in the PO site compared to the CR site. As a result. 429,346 sequences were obtained from the pooling of 20 samples identified into 10 phyla and 79 genera in which Finnicutes was dominant in both PO and CR sites. The number of conunon OTUs was 221 for both CR and PO samples. The results revealed that under the stressed environmental state, the homo-lactic Vagococcus genus is dominant over the hetero-lactic Lactobacillus, which uses less energy in the derived process.

AB  - National and regional ecological assessments are essential for making rational decisions concerning water body conservation and management at those spatial extents. We analyzed data from 4597 samples collected from 3420 different sites across the conterminous USA during the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2008-2009 and 2013-2014 National Rivers and Streams Assessment. We evaluated the relationship between both fish and macroinvertebrate multimetric index (MMI) condition scores and 38 environmental factors to assess the relative importance of natural versus anthropogenic predictors, contrast site-scale versus watershed-scale predictors, and examine ecoregional and assemblage differences. We found that most of the environmental factors we examined were related to either fish and/or macroinvertebrate MMI scores in some fashion and that the factors involved, and strength of the relationship, varied by ecoregion and between assemblages. Factors more associated with natural conditions were usually less important in explaining MMI scores than factors more directly associated with anthropogenic disturbances. Local site-scale factors explained more variation than watershed-scale factors. Random forest and multiple regression models performed similarly, and the fish MMI-environment relationships were stronger than macroinvertebrate MMI-environment relationships. Among ecoregions, the strongest environmental relationships were observed in the Northern Appalachians and the weakest in the Southern Plains. The fish and macroinvertebrate MMIs were only weakly correlated with each other, and they generally responded more strongly to different groups of variables. These results support the use of multiple assemblages and the sampling of multiple environmental indicators in ecological assessments across large spatial extents.

AB  - Growth rate of individually tagged dogwhelks Nucella lapillus (L.) was measured in free-living individuals at 3 sites of differing heavy metal contamination in the Firth of Clyde, west Scotland. Condition index (CI), concentrations of metals (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn), metallothionein (NIT), RNA (the RNA/protein ratio) and glycogen were also measured. In general, the marine environments of Gourock and Largs were contaminated with significantly higher tributyltin, Pb and Zn than Loch Fyne, as indicated by the results of imposex indices, and metal concentrations in transplanted polymer-ligands (Chelex (R) 100) and Mytilus edulis. Further, metal concentrations of native M. edulis (Pb and Zn) and Semibalanus balanoides (Cu) from Gourock were significantly higher than those from Loch Fyne. However, metal accumulation in the dogwhelks displayed a very different pattern. At a standard size (0.5 g wet soft-body weight), N. lapillus from Largs showed higher Cd, Cu and MT in their tissues than individuals from the other 2 populations. Levels of Pb and Zn were similar among the populations despite different concentrations in Chelex and mussels. Gourock dogwhelks showed similar levels of Cu and NIT but lower Cd compared to those of Loch Fyne. These differences can be attributed primarily to differences in dogwhelk growth rate between sites. Gourock individuals had a higher Cl and RNA/protein ratio in the foot muscle and grew faster (especially at small sizes), resulting in a tissue-dilution effect on metal and NIT concentrations, In contrast, higher levels of Cd, Cu and NIT in dogwhelks from Largs can be attributed to their growth rate being relatively slow compared to the rate of metal accumulation, Slow-growing individuals in Loch Fyne had relatively high Cd, Pb Zn and NIT, although Loch Fyne has been regarded as a clean reference site, Among populations, differences in growth rate may be due to differences in prey availability, predation pressure, and/or genotype. The present results demonstrate that inter-site differences in growth rate can confound the use of the dogwhelks as a biomonitor of metals.

AB  - Fisheries provide critical provisioning services, especially given increasing human population. Understanding where marine communities are declining provides an indication of ecosystems of concern and highlights potential conflicts between seafood provisioning from wild fisheries and other ecosystem services. Here we use the nonparametric statistic, Kendall's tau, to assess trends in biomass of exploited marine species across a range of ecosystems. The proportion of 'Non-Declining Exploited Species' (NDES) is compared among ecosystems and to three community-level indicators that provide a gauge of the ability of a marine ecosystem to function both in provisioning and as a regulating service: survey-based mean trophic level, proportion of predatory fish, and mean life span. In some ecosystems, NDES corresponds to states and temporal trajectories of the community indicators, indicating deteriorating conditions in both the exploited community and in the overall community. However differences illustrate the necessity of using multiple ecological indicators to reflect the state of the ecosystem. For each ecosystem, we discuss patterns in NDES with respect to the community-level indicators and present results in the context of ecosystem-specific drivers. We conclude that using NDES requires context-specific supporting information in order to provide guidance within a management framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biotic indicators are useful for assessing ecosystem health because the structure of resident communities generally reflects abiotic conditions integrated over time. We used fish data collected over 5years for 470 Great Lakes coastal wetlands to develop multi-metric indices of biotic integrity (IBI). Sampling and IBI development were stratified by vegetation type within each wetland to account for differences in physical habitat. Metrics were evaluated against numerous indices of anthropogenic disturbance derived from water quality and surrounding land-cover variables. Separate datasets were used for IBI development and testing. IBIs were composed of 10-11 metrics for each of four vegetation types (bulrush, cattail, water lily, and submersed aquatic vegetation). Scores of all IBIs correlated well with disturbance indices using the development data, and the accuracy of our IBIs was validated using the testing data. Our fish IBIs can be used to prioritize wetland protection and restoration efforts across the Great Lakes basin. The IBIs will also be useful in monitoring programs mandated by the Agreement between Canada and the United States of America on Great Lakes Water Quality, such as for assessing Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) in Great Lakes Areas of Concern, and in other ecosystem management programs in Canada and the USA.

AB  - The Western Scheldt river and estuary is known to be highly polluted as it receives industrial, agricultural and domestic effluents from one of the most populated and industrialised zones in Europe. Aquatic organisms are exposed to pollutants, specifically metals that are present in different environmental phases, e.g. dissolved, suspended material or sediment phases. The objective of this study was to study the relationship that exists between environmental metal levels, the degree of metal uptake by aquatic organisms with the concomitant biological responses. For this purpose the bivalve mollusk, Mytilus edulis, was selected as bioaccumulation indicator organism. Environmental (water and sediment) and mussel samples were collected during the late winter (March 2000) from sampling sites in the Scheldt estuary. Sites were selected to represent a salinity gradient from the mouth of the estuary to the furthest distribution area of mussels upstream in the system. Together with standard water quality parameters (e.g. salinity, dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, etc.) concentrations of twelve metals were analysed in the water (dissolved and suspended matter) and sediments. Levels of these metals were also measured in the soft tissue of M. edulis, together with concomitant biomarker responses in resident mussel populations at each site. The biomarkers that were included in this study were condition index, scope for growth, survival in air, cell membrane stability, DNA damage, and metallothioneins. Data were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis. The physico-chemical parameters and metals in the environmental samples clustered the sites to reflect the distribution based on the salinity gradient. Bioaccumulation results revealed increased metal uptake along a pollution gradient with the highest metal bioaccumulation occurring at the upstream most sites and therefore closest to the in the industrial activities. However, the biomarker responses clustered the sites in a manner that reflected the influence of combination of internal exposure (bioaccumulation) and external exposure (physico-chemical conditions). These differences in biomarker responses clearly demonstrated were attributed to abiotic factors other than metal pollution alone e.g. localized short-term increases in increased suspended sediment concentrations and decreased dissolved oxygen concentrations.

AB  - Coal-mine development is occurring at a rapid rate in the central Appalachians, but few tools exist to assess the consequences of cumulative effects of mining to downstream aquatic resources. We constructed and applied an index of mining intensity (MI) to the Lower Cheat River basin, northern West Virginia. Our objectives were to: 1) determine if the MI could be used to predict stream-water quality and biological conditions, 2) quantify the extent to which geology and the geographic position of mines modulate the effects of mining on in-stream conditions, and 3) identify thresholds of MI that produce quantifiable changes to benthic macroinvertebrate communities. We quantified water chemistry, habitat quality, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities from May 2002 to May 2003 in 39 stream segments randomly distributed across a range of MI, coal geology, elevation, and watershed area. We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates at an additional 41 validation sites in May 2002. The MI was positively correlated with dissolved metals (r = 0.65-0.85) and negatively correlated with ecological condition metrics (r = 0.49-0.78), including total richness, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera richness, and the West Virginia Stream Condition Index. Coal geology and distance from mining had a significant interactive effect on benthic macroinvertebrate responses. Streams draining watersheds with Freeport coal geology had significantly poorer water quality and ecological condition than streams draining watersheds with similar MI but with Kittanning coal geology. Mining effects on stream conditions diminished as distance from the nearest mining activities upstream increased to a distance of similar to 10 km. Changepoint analysis provided evidence of threshold effects of mining on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in Freeport coal watersheds but not in Kittanning coal watersheds. Abrupt reductions in ecological condition occurred at MI values as low as 1 to 5% of maximum intensity, and ecological impairment to streams became almost certain at MI >18 to 20%. Our results provide evidence of an interactive effect of landuse intensity, underlying geology, and the spatial arrangement of disturbance on the degree of impairment to receiving water bodies. The thresholds we identified could be used by water-resource managers to protect and restore stream conditions in actively mined watersheds of the central Appalachian region.

AB  - One of the most critical phases in the life of petrels (Procellariiformes) is at fledging when young birds pass from parental dependence on land to an independent life at sea. To mitigate mortality at this time, rescue programs are implemented near breeding sites around the world, especially for birds grounded by artificial lights. We evaluated the plumage and body condition of short-tailed shearwater (Ardenna tenuirostris) fledglings captured at colonies just before departure in comparison to fledglings washed up on beaches and to fledglings attracted by artificial light along roads. We measured abundance of down, body mass, and body condition index as the standardized residuals of a regression of body mass on size, and employed linear models to test differences on body mass and body condition between locations. Beach-washed birds were underweight and in poor condition, suggesting their future survival probabilities at sea were low. Birds rescued on roads as a consequence of light attraction had lower body weights and condition indices than fledglings captured at the colony. However, more than 50% of light-attracted birds had attained similar weights to those of adults, suggesting they have higher probabilities of survival than beach-washed birds. Water-logged birds being washed onto beaches is a natural process, but birds grounded by lighting along roads is an increasing anthropogenic threat that requires management. Thus, management and conservation efforts should be directed to protect birds in the colonies and reduce light-induced mortality, ideally through the strategic reduction of light sources and lateral light spillage. When resources for conservation are limited, rescue programs should focus on rescuing birds from roads rather than beach-washed birds, which have a lower probability of survival. (c) 2017 The Wildlife Society.
   Short-tailed shearwater fledglings rescued on roads as a consequence of light attraction had higher body weights than beach-washed fledglings on Phillip Island, Australia, and consequently higher probabilities of survival. Management and conservation efforts should be directed to protect birds in the colonies, improve rescue patrols, and reduce light-induced mortality, ideally through the strategic reduction of light sources and lateral light spillage.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to assess the hydromorphological status of watercourses above and below the hydropower plants. To this end, four methods were selected which represent various groups of methods used in various member states of the EU. Particular focus was on the RHS method (assessment of the physical habitats the method used in Poland). The following methods were also used: LAWA (assessment of physical habitats, Germany), QBR (assessment of bank habitats, Spain), and HEM (comprehensive morphological assessment, the Czech Republic). For each of these methods, appropriate hydromorphological status indicators were calculated (assessment on a five grade scale). The analysis revealed that despite the different assumptions, the methods lead to similar results and can be used in various countries, especially in Europe. Because of the broad spectrum of space and time data used in the analysis, the results of HEM are the most reliable; however, this method is also the most difficult to use. All the methods meet the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, which calls for rational water management. Based on the hydromorphological assessment, the results obtained helped us to evaluate the environmental changes on the river sections above and below the hydropower plants.

AB  - Claviceps purpurea, the causal agent of ergot of perennial ryegrass seed crops, overwinters as sclerotia in the soil and releases airborne ascospores in the spring that infect flower ovaries and replace seed with sclerotia. Burkard spore traps were used to quantify the dispersal phenology and concentration of ascospores in perennial ryegrass seed fields in the Columbia Basin of Oregon. Weather factors were measured concurrently with spore trapping. Nonparametric regression, box-and-whisker plots, and univariate analysis were used to visualize and identify trends between ascospore concentrations and weather variables. Most ascospores (75.4%) were trapped when minimum soil temperatures were between 16.2 and 20.4 degrees C. Over 67% of the total ascospores trapped were observed when minimum air temperatures were between 6.8 and 12.4 degrees C and 64% of ascospores were trapped when daily mean dew point was between 3.7 and 8.2 degrees C. Environmental favorability index (EFI) models were developed and validated based on their ability to predict ascospore occurrence. The EFI models were able to predict ascospore occurrence with an accuracy of 71.7 to 87.5% depending on the year. The models were up to 79.8% accurate when validated using three years of historical spore trap data not used in the EFI model development. Ninety-four percent of ascospores were trapped when cumulative air degree days, using lower and upper thresholds of 10 and 25 degrees C, respectively, were between 230 and 403. These results suggest that weather parameters can be used to model C. purpurea ascospore occurrence and potentially improve the timing and efficacy of fungicide applications by identifying when plant protection is most needed.

AB  - Mediterranean mountain regions have undergone several landscape changes since the end of the 19th century due to progressive depopulation and the abandonment of cattle rearing, forestry, charcoal production and agricultural activity. Such activity favored landscape dynamics by creating grassy habitats, which in turn resulted in greater landscape diversity. This is now being lost as the forest reclaims abandoned pastures. Thus, the purpose of this work was to identify those open habitats most in need of management action to maximize biodiversity and cultural heritage conservation and minimize fire risk and management costs. These analyses show a sharp decrease of open agriculture areas, which are the habitat of many endemic species (from 46.4% to 12.3%), currently overgrown with secondary forests. Multivariate analysis and the PGP (Patch Growing Process) heuristic model indicate the areas in which the restoration of open areas (by about 8%; about 500 ha) will be the most advisable and the most beneficial, taking into account environmental, social and economic factors. The use of PGP provides for a 21% improvement in total agriculture areas. Still, the natural state of the protected Mediterranean mountain area "Alta Garrotxa" (Catalonia, Spain) is almost continuous forest. However, the management models proposed in this study offer flexible precepts to achieve the desired landscape patterns and maintain biodiversity, while conserving cultural heritage and decreasing the risk of fire.

AB  - Microorganisms population, as major soil component, is very significant indicator of soil fertility, i.e. the process of soil degradation. Microbial population density and enzyme activity of microorganisms may be highly reliable practical indicators which can suggest the answer to the question concerning conditions that favour plant production. The influence of different NPK fertiliser rates on microbiological activity of the alluvial soil planted with plum culture has been studied over a 3-year period. The effect of the mineral fertiliser used was determined 3 times over the growing season and was monitored through determinations of the number of different groups of microorganisms and proteinase activity in the soil. The 3-year results suggest that the effect of the applied fertilisers was induced by numerous factors, which primarily refers to climate effects and its specific elements, the activity of the plant itself and its root metabolism, as well as the effect of soil specificities, i.e. its structural, chemical and agro-chemical properties. Taking into account biological properties of soil, plum production, economic and environmental indicators of the results of the stated treatments, the rate of 600 kg ha(-1) can be recommended for growing plum under the stated environmental conditions.

AB  - The aim of present study were to reveal species-indicators of the Alakol Lake communities and assess the water quality with bioindication and statistical methods. Algal communities in the Alakol Lake Natural State Reserve were studied in 21 samples collected during August 2015-2017 summer field trips. Altogether 208 algal species from five taxonomic Divisions were indicators of ten water properties: temperature, oxygenation, organic pollution, salinity, trophic state of the water, and nutrition type of algal species. It was the first experience of the bioindicational approach implementation for ecological assessment of water quality in the Alakol Lake. Diatom species, which are most indicative, strongly prevailed in the three studied areas of the lake. We revealed that algal species can characterize the water of the lake as low alkaline, low saline, temperate, middle oxygenated water with low-to middle organic pollution that comes from Koktuma and Kamyskala areas and decrease from north to south. The lake tropic state and intensity of self-purification are also increase from north to south. Algal communities aremostly represented by periphytonic and benthic autotrophic species. Statistical analysis of species-environment relationships revealed that most of species preferred to survive in communities with complicated structure which formed in low organically polluted waters. Bioindication assess the Alakol Lake as oligotrophic and meso-eutrophic, of Class 2 and 3 of Water Quality with high level of self-purification capacity.

AB  - Introduction: The dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has a key role in drug addiction susceptibility. In addition to the well-known relationship between cortisol and the HPA axis, other molecules are involved with stress response and could modify the HPA activation, such as the neuropeptide Y (NPY), which has anxiolytic proprieties. There are few studies evaluating the effect of NPY levels on addiction, especially in crack cocaine dependence.
   Objective: To evaluate NPY in crack users during early withdrawal to determine its relationship with drug use and cortisol levels.
   Methods: We analyzed 25 male inpatient crack users. Serum NPY levels were measured at admission and discharge (mean of 24 days). Morning salivary cortisol was measured at admission.
   Results: Serum NPY levels at admission and discharge were very similar. Lower NPY levels at discharge were associated with higher lifetime crack use. Also, a negative correlation was found between morning cortisol and delta NPY (NPY discharge - NPY admission).
   Conclusion: These preliminary findings indicate that crack use influences the modulation of NPY levels and modifies stress response. The NPY pathway may play an important role in the pathophysiology of crack addiction, and the anxiolytic effect of NPY may be impaired in crack users. Future studies should consider NPY as a measurable indicator of the biological state in addiction.

AB  - Soil moisture and vegetation growth are the most direct and important indicators of drought events and, therefore, an understanding of vegetation and soil spectral behavior is critical to the drought estimation. Recently, Ghulam et al. [Ghulam, A., Qin, Q., Zhan, Z., 2006. Designing of the perpendicular drought index. Environmental Geology, doi: 10. 1 007/sOO254-006-0544-2 (accessed March 8, 2007).] established the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) that is based on an extensive analysis of spatial distribution features of soil moisture in NIR-Red spectral space. In this paper, an improved drought monitoring method, the Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), is developed introducing vegetation fraction, which takes into account both soil moisture and vegetation growth. To validate the drought indices proposed by this paper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images from different times registered over different eco-systems with various drought conditions are used to calculate the PDI and MPDI over ground measuring points. The PDI and MPDI are then compared to an in-situ drought index obtained from field measurements made synchronously with the satellite overpass, including the bulk soil moisture content at different soil depths, field moisture capacity, wilting coefficient, etc. It is evident from the results that the PDI and the MPDI is highly accordant with in-situ drought values with the highest correlation (R-2 =0.8134) found between the MPDI and an in-situ drought index derived from 0-20 cm mean soil moisture. This study concludes that the PDI and the MPDI provide quite similar results for bare soil surfaces, especially in the early stages of vegetation growth. However, the MPDI demonstrates a much better performance in measuring vegetated surfaces since it takes into account both soil moisture and vegetation growth in the modeling process. The MPDI has the potential to provide a simple and real-time drought monitoring method in the remote estimation of drought phenomena.

AB  - Preserving biodiversity implies the development of indicators to evaluate management practices and to identify critical thresholds and dynamics that modify ecosystems. This study was conducted in the Camargue Delta (South of France). Mediterranean wetlands represent great potential for biodiversity, and their natural dynamics are strongly influenced by water control. We hypothesized that human influence can be estimated by taking into account spatial patterns of human artifacts. We defined two types of landscape indicators of human pressure: the spatial density and the connectivity of the hydrologic network. Co-inertia analysis was used to explore the correlation between these indicators and aquatic macrophyte communities sampled in marshes. Results suggested that human action may strongly influence marsh aquatic macrophyte communities and affect ecological dynamics. Particularly, alteration of wetland integrity by water control may promote the replacement of specialized species by generalist and exotic species. The canal network seems to facilitate dispersion of Ludwigia peploides between marshes. This result confirmed the negative role of corridors in facilitating dispersion of exotic species from one patch to another. We found positive correlations between landscape indicators and macrophyte composition, which is consistent with the tested hypothesis. The density of hydraulic structure was revealed to be a relevant landscape predictor of marsh biological state.

AB  - Bioindicators assess the mangroves ecological state according to the types of pressures but they differ with the ecosystem's specificities. We investigated benthic meiofauna diversity and structure within the low human-impacted mangroves in French Guiana (South America) in response to sediment variables with various distances to the main city. Contaminant's concentrations differed among the stations, but they remained below toxicity guidelines. Meiofauna structure (Foraminifera, Kinorhyncha, Nematoda) however varied accordingly. Nematode's identification brought details on the sediment's quality. The opportunistic genus Paraethmolaimus (Jensen, 1994) strongly correlated to the higher concentrations of Hg, Pb. Anoxic sediments were marked by organic enrichment in pesticides, PCB, and mangrove litter products and dominance of two tolerant genus, Terschellingia (de Man, 1888) and Spirinia (Gerlach, 1963). In each of these two stations, we found many Desmodora individuals (de Man, 1889) with the presence of epibionts highlighting the nematodes decreased fitness and defenses. Oxic sediments without contaminants were distinguished by the sensitive genera Pseudocella (Filipjev, 1927) and a higher diversity of trophic groups. Our results suggested a nematodes sensitivity to low contaminants concentrations. Further investigations at different spatio-temporal scales and levels of deterioration, would be necessary to use of this group as bioindicator of the mangroves' ecological status.

AB  - Indicators are effective tools for summarizing and communicating key aspects of ecosystem state and have a long record of use in marine pollution and fisheries management. The application of biodiversity indicators to assess the status of species, habitats, and functional diversity in marine conservation and policy, however, is still developing and multiple indicator roles and features are emerging. For example, some operational biodiversity indicators trigger management action when a threshold is reached, while others play an interpretive, or surveillance, role in informing management. Links between biodiversity indicators and the pressures affecting them are frequently unclear as links can be obscured by environmental change, data limitations, food web dynamics, or the cumulative effects of multiple pressures. In practice, the application of biodiversity indicators to meet marine conservation policy and management demands is developing rapidly in the management realm, with a lag before academic publication detailing indicator development. Making best use of biodiversity indicators depends on sharing and synthesizing cutting-edge knowledge and experience. Using lessons learned from the application of biodiversity indicators in policy and management from around the globe, we define the concept of 'biodiversity indicators,' explore barriers to their use and potential solutions, and outline strategies for their effective communication to decision-makers.

AB  - Considering relationships between environmental factors and aquatic ecosystems, obtaining a clear understanding of river habitat integrity plays a key role in addressing habitats' disturbances. Since benthic macroinvertebrate assembly can reflect the benthic stream conditions, we assessed the river habitat integrity based on benthic macroinvertebrate multi-metric model. The development and application of Benthic macroinvertebrate multi-metric index (B-MMI) was based on samples collected from October to November 2014 at representative sites from upper to lower reaches in Luanhe River, Haihe River Basin, China. Hydromorphology, water quality and land use patterns were considered to define reference sites and metrics related to macroinvertebrate community composition, structure, function and tolerance to pollution were selected as candidate metrics. Then, Range, sensitivity and redundancy tests were used to select candidate metrics based on their ability to distinguish the reference and impaired sites. As the result, four core indicators were selected to build the B-MMI: EPT%, Tubificidae%, BI (Biotic Index), Collect-Gatherers%. The values of B-MMI ranged from 0.21 to 3.75 in 17 sites. Based on B-MMI values, the habitat integrity of 29% sites were in very poor status and 6% were in excellent status. The upper reaches were influenced by animal husbandry and tourism, while the lower reaches were influenced by urbanization and dams. More good habitats were located in middle reaches under less human disturbances. Overall, this B-MMI shows promise for developing biomonitoring tools to assess the habitat integrity of streams, to provide appropriate restoration strategies and policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Consistent and repeatable estimation of habitat condition for biodiversity assessment across large areas (i.e. regional to global) with limited field observations presents a major challenge for remote sensing (RS). RS can describe what a site looks like and how it behaves (using time series), but is unable to distinguish anthropogenic impacts from natural dynamics. Consequently, it is possible to mistake a heavily degraded habitat for a natural habitat, for example a logged forest may appear identical to an intact open woodland. This problem is compounded by the existence of multiple natural states in any given environment, and spatial variation in the natural composition and structure of vegetation as a function of variation in environment. Uncertainty in assessing habitat condition from RS is often further exacerbated by sparseness in the spatial coverage of training data. We describe a novel generic, RS-based algorithm called Habitat Condition Assessment System, designed to address the above sources of uncertainty and to be highly flexible in its application. It allows for variability in the definition of condition and in the type and quantity of input data employed. Here, we demonstrate the mechanics of the new algorithm in a simple worked example and its practical application in a case study using inferred natural-only' reference data, reflective remotely sensed data, and associated environmental data, to map condition for Australia at a 001 degrees resolution. We assess the behaviour and shortcomings of the method, and compare the national case study with estimates from two existing national data sets, and field measured condition data observed at 16967 sites across the State of Victoria. The modelled predictions outperform both of the existing national data sets, explaining 52% of the variability in field observations for well-sampled cells (relative to 8% and 12% for the existing products). The methodology can potentially address some of the key pitfalls of condition modelling and could be applied in other regions with sufficient coverage of reference data. The approach also has good potential to be extended to work with reference data for which condition is measured on a continuous scale, for example from field-based condition assessment initiatives.

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental changes in climate, land use and disturbance regimes, as well as mass propagule transport are having dramatic effects on many ecosystems. Both conservationists and ecologists need ecologically relevant metrics to quantify the condition of plant and animal communities. However, current metrics fail to address the invasion of species native to different community types in the same region, even though these native aliens' can serve as valuable indicators of recent changes in habitat condition. We propose a novel approach to reconceptualize community biodiversity based on the composition of historically developed habitat-specific species pools. Total observed community diversity can be divided to characteristic diversity, consisting of species belonging to habitat-specific species pool, and derived diversity, consisting of either native or non-native species not typical to a given community and whose presence is driven by adverse human impact. Characteristic and derived diversity in communities have different historical backgrounds; thus, the ecological patterns of these components, effects on ecosystem functioning as well as actions necessary for their conservation are likewise different. We propose the Index of Favourable Conservation Status - the log ratio of characteristic to derived diversity - as an easily quantified, ecologically relevant and universal indicator of biodiversity integrity and community condition. The Index of Favourable Conservation Status provides valuable information on habitat conservation needs and recent adverse human impact in relative terms and can be compared between regions and across a wide range of ecosystems. It can also be used to monitor restoration success or characterize biodiversity degradation. We present standardized procedure of determining habitat-specific species pools and bring several examples of how the concept of characteristic and derived diversity can be applied in conservation and research and how expert knowledge on habitat-specific species pool composition can expand our understanding of community biodiversity.

AB  - Investigations to determine stable or source-sink animal population dynamics are challenging and often infeasible for most species due to the time and expense of mark-recapture studies and the challenge of life histories attributes that result in low detectability and low recapture probabilities. Often, managers rely solely on occupancy or relative abundance patterns to assess a species' sensitivity to environmental changes. Greater insight into population-level responses to environmental change can be gained by consideration of a combination of readily obtainable metrics, including occupancy, relative abundance, demographic structure and body condition. We examined how these metrics can improve our understanding of population-level responses to forest disturbance, using datasets for two exemplar species of terrestrial salamanders resident to the Pacific Northwestern USA. We compared population metrics for the Del Norte salamander (Plethodon elongatus) and the Siskiyou Mountains salamander (Plethodon stormi) across the seral continuum represented by four forest age classes: pre-canopy, young, mature, and old-growth. We compared these data with those collected from reference stands in mature (P. stormi) or old-growth (P. elongatus) forest containing robust populations. P. elongatus was twice as common as P. stormi. Both occupancy and salamander counts were lowest at pre-canopy sites for both species. Although there were numerous P. elongatus detections in young forests, higher proportions of these individuals were juveniles and sub-adults when compared to populations in late-seral forests. We found a negative relationship between the proportion of immature animals and total counts at a site, indicating that the high proportion of young animals in young forest stands is likely due to dispersal of young salamanders from nearby source populations and/or low survival of adult animals in young forests. We also found reduced body condition of P. stormi populations in young forests. Our results suggest that there are costs to populations occupying early seral forests, such as skewed age class structure and reduced body condition that are indicative of sink populations. Consideration of population-level metrics beyond occupancy and relative abundance can provide important insights when assessing a species' sustainability in managed forest landscapes.

AB  - Organic agriculture, based on natural production technologies, has a great potential for the reversion of mankind to a healthy diet and living in harmony with nature by improving the state of the ecosystem. The share of organic products in the food market of the developed countries is already quite sizable; in the top countries various institutional systems of the industry have been introduced and improved. Russian agribusiness is lagging behind in these issues but the situation should be significantly changed by the adopted law and the state standard regulating the requirements for the organic sector. Our work is an application of applying a two-sided quantitative-and-qualitative approach to the survey of existing markets from the standpoint of extant results and dynamics, on the one hand, and their organizational-and-economic structure, on the other hand. The presented conclusions are confirmed by systematized absolute and relative indicators of the number of market entities, areas of land certified for organic production, retail sales in domestic markets and consumption of organic products per capita. The qualitative characteristic of organic production systems is reflected in the description of the national characteristics of regulatory and control and supervisory support, research support, state regulation of production and turnover, and ways of doing the business under study. Our research is addressed to the world business community operating in the organic food market and industry research institutions.

AB  - Horticulture nitrogen (N) runoffs are major environmental and health concerns, but current farming practices cannot detect ineffective N applications. Hence, we set to recognize high N conditions and characterize their effects on the physiology of almond trees grown in drainage lysimeters. Water and nutrients mass balances exhibited that N benefitted almond trees in a limited range (below 60 mg N L-1 in irrigation), while higher N conditions (over a 100 mg N L-1) reduced evapotranspiration (ET) by 50% and inherently constrained N uptake. Respectively, whole-tree hydraulic conductance reduced by 37%, and photosynthesis by 17%, which implied that high N concentrations could damage trees. Through gas-chromatography, we realized that high N conditions also affected components of the citric acid cycle (TCA) and carbohydrates availability. Such changes in the metabolic composition of roots and leaves probably interfered with N assimilation and respiration. It also determined the proportions between N and starch in almond leaves, which formed a new index (N:ST) that starts at 0.4 in N deficiency and reaches 0.6-0.8 in optimal N conditions. Importantly, this index continues to increase in higher N conditions (as starch reduces) and essentially indicates to excessive N applications when it exceeds 1.1.

AB  - ,Humankind is prone to exceeding biogeochemical limits to freshwater resources in the face of rapidly increasing demands of global population and economic growth Without measurable indicator of sustainability. Such indicators with a differing Methodological complexity were developed for rivers in order to estimate water quantity required to secure their long-term productive state. Generally, environmental flow requirement method was applied to economically significant rivers Where intensive fisheries take place and was defined as the sum of flow requirements that fish stocks demand. Recently, more robust methods for environmental flow requirement have been developed that consider multiple environmental factors such as demands of other organisms (e.g. invertebrates and water birds), ecosystem Structure, (e.g., biogeoclimate, geomorphology, flora, fauna, biodiversity and flood plain) and ecosystem function (e.g. nutrient cycles, primary production and ecosystem respiration). This study assesses the concept of environmental flow requirement in the context of Big Melen water transfer project as a case study.

AB  - Previous research examining hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity in generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) has suggested a general hypercortisolism. These studies have mostly relied on salivary, plasma or urinary assessments, reflecting cortisol secretion over short time periods. The current study utilised the novel method of cortisol assessment in hair to obtain a retrospective index of cortisol secretion over a prolonged period of time. Hair cortisol levels were determined in 15 GAD patients and in 15 age- and gender-matched controls. In addition, participants collected six saliva samples (on awakening, +30 min, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00 h and at bedtime) on two consecutive weekdays for the assessment of the diurnal cortisol profile. Results revealed significantly lower (50-60%) cortisol levels in the first and second 3-cm hair segments of GAD patients compared to those of controls. No significant between-group differences were seen in diurnal cortisol profiles. The hair cortisol findings tentatively suggest that under naturalistic conditions GAD is associated with hypocortisolism. If corroborated by future research, this demonstrates the important qualities of cortisol measurement in hair as an ecologically valid, retrospective index of long-term cortisol secretion and as a marker for psychiatric disorders associated with hypo- or hypercortisolism.

AB  - Little is known about the functions of N:P ratios in determining trophic structures and ecological health in lotic ecosystems, even though N:P ratios have been frequently used as a stoichiometric determinant in ambient water for trophic allocation of low-level organisms such as phytoplankton or zooplankton. In this study, nutrients (N, P) and sestonic chlorophyll (CHL) from 40 different streams in the Geum-River watershed were measured from 2008 to 2011. Fish compositions and stream health were also assessed, based on the multi-metric modeling of an index of biological integrity. Land use patterns in these watersheds were a key factor regulating nutrient contents and N:P ratios in ambient water, and also influenced empirical relationships between N:P ratios (or nutrients) and sestonic CHL. Land use patterns in forested, urban and wastewater treatment plant regions were associated with significant differences in stream N:P ratios, and the ratios were mainly determined by phosphorus. Sestonic CHL was significantly correlated with nutrient level (N, P); the ratios had a positive linear relationship with the proportion of omnivores, and a negative relationship with the proportion of insectivores. A similar trend in the N:P ratios was observed in indicator fishes such as N. koreanus and Z. platypus. Overall, the N:P ratio may be a good surrogate variable of ambient concentrations of N or P in assessing trophic linkage and diagnosing the ecological stream health in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Body weight and snout-vent length (SVL) data of 3006 individual Leptodactylus latrans frogs collected over ten years in the Pampa Region of Argentina were analyzed to evaluate the best approach for expressing body condition and to characterize the natural variability of this parameter. Two different methods for expressing body condition were compared: the scaled mass index (SMI) and the residuals methods. Body weight of L. latrans was related to SVL through an allometric relationship described by the power function: Y = 0.00006 X-3.11. The shape of the weight-length relationship was not affected by neither the sex of the animal nor its date or site of capture. A truly size-independent SMI value was more easily obtained when defining the scaling exponent through a non-linear regression of mass on length rather than when performing a standardized major axis regression of lnweight on lnlength. Overall, it was proved optimal to use a single scaling factor equal to 3.11 to compute SMI of all L. Latrans from the Pampa Region, irrespective of their gender and month or site of capture. Altogether, obtained results showed that SMI is a more performant indicator of body condition than residuals because it is less variable and it allows a better detection of effects. SMI and residuals condition factors deviated from each other in the extremities of L. latrans size range because scaling is not considered when calculating residuals. Body condition of females, males and juveniles was significantly lower in December/January compared to October/November and February/March. Moreover, juveniles consistently exhibited a lower body condition compared to both males and females. Based on the natural inter- and infra-annual variability observed for L. latrans SMI values, it should be possible to detect a 10% difference in SMI in an infra-annual study by sampling 14 to 17 frogs per group, whereas a 15% difference in SMI could be detected in an inter-annual study by sampling 23-29 animals per site. These numbers show that alterations of body condition should be straightforwardly identifiable in field studies with L. latrans when using SMI. The determination of SMI body condition factor during amphibian monitoring programs could be of great value, as it would provide information on amphibian health together with population abundance numbers.

AB  - The Darwin's Naturalization Hypothesis (DNH) states that the successful naturalization of alien species is favored when the phylogenetic relationship between the colonizer and the recipient community is distant. Conversely, related species would compete strongly, hence reducing the probability of naturalization. From a populational perspective, the concept of naturalization involves both the progressive increase in size and spatial distribution of the invasive population. In this study, we focused our attention on the spatial component of naturalization, assessing the role of phylogenetic relatedness as a determinant of its extension. Following the DNH, it is expected that those alien species closely related to the native flora would show narrower distribution ranges than alien taxa less related to native species. Using the APG III taxonomic system as an indicator of phylogenetic relationships in the vascular flora of continental Chile, our analysis showed that alien species with congeneric native counterparts have larger ranges than alien species with a distant relationship (i.e. species belonging to families or orders not represented in the native flora). These results do not support the DNH because the more distant taxa (less related species) show distributional ranges smaller. Results suggest that close relatedness could have facilitated the naturalization of alien plants in continental Chile, at least for species belonging to genus and families represented on the native flora.

AB  - The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is cultured at 8 commercial farms in South Africa. Worldwide, environmental-specific intensive selection on the species optimizes commercially beneficial traits, but its performance has not been studied in South Africa. From May 2010 to March 2011, we compared 2-mo measurements of growth rate, condition, and survival of 3 cohorts of different origin in longline culture at 3 different South African environments: 2 sea-based farms located in Saldanha Bay (Western Cape) and Algoa Bay (Eastern Cape) and a land-based farm at Kleinzee (Northern Cape). Overall, Saldanha Bay was cooler (mean sea surface temperature of 16.0 degrees C; CV, 16.2%) than the other 2 localities, which did not differ significantly from one another (Kleinzee: 18.6 degrees C; CV, 20.4%; Algoa Bay: 17.8 degrees C; CV, 8.9%). The high variability at Kleinzee reflected stronger summer warming than at the other 2 farms. Saldanha Bay had higher phytoplankton biomass (mean, 14.3 mg chlorophyll a/m(3); CV, 54.2%; May 2010 to March 2011) than did Algoa Bay (mean, 5.3 mg chlorophyll a/m(3); CV, 81.0%; September 2010 to March 2011). The 3 cohorts showed similar trends in growth and condition. Growth rates, expressed as live or dry mass gains, were 2-10 times those reported elsewhere in the world, and dry weight condition indices were also high. High live mass growth rates in Algoa Bay, despite its relatively low phytoplankton biomass, seem to reflect a similar phenomenon to that reported in other relatively phytoplankton-poor grow-out environments, such as the Mediterranean Thau Lagoon in France. Dry meat mass gain and condition were highest for oysters in Saldanha Bay, with high food availability offsetting the thermal advantages of the warmer Algoa Bay site. Oysters in the bottom layers of the cages grew significantly faster than those in the top layers, particularly in Saldanha Bay, possibly reflecting fine-scale vertical differences in phytoplankton biomass. Saldanha Bay is the best of the 3 locations to produce market-ready oysters. Algoa Bay yields faster growth but leaner oysters and is a good nursery location, as is Kleinzee, which yields overall slow growth but good shell quality in winter and early spring.

AB  - A straightforward, fast and specific stability indicating UPLC method is developed for the direct determination of bambuterol hydrochloride in tablets as well as in spiked human plasma and urine samples. Chromatographic separations for bambuterol hydrochloride as well as their degradation products (stress induced) were obtained in 2.5 min on Acquity BEH-C18 (carbon 17.7 %) and BEH-Shield RP18 (carbon 16.6 %) columns (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mu m particle size) as stationary phase at 265 nm (diode array detector). Gradient elution was performed using aqueous and organic acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.45 mL/min. Validation studies were performing according to regulatory guidelines. There was a linear function of concentrations over the range for 7-13 mu g/mL and LOD, LOQ for bambuterol hydrochloride were determined as 0.11 and 0.36 mu g/mL, respectively. Good separation of analytes as well as their degradation products was observed with acceptable values of resolution and tailing. After the application of all stress conditions peak purity index was >= 0.9999 for analyte indicating its complete separation from degradation products peaks.

AB  - Torrefaction is a crucial biomass upgrading technology to produce biochar for fuel, soil amendment, and bioabsorbent. A number of indicators such as weight loss (WL), torrefaction severity index (TSI), and severity factor (SF) have been conducted to describe the torrefaction degree. However, operating conditions such as torrefaction temperature and duration are not considered in weight loss and torrefaction severity index, while biomass nature is not taken into account in the severity factor. To overcome these drawbacks, an indicator termed torrefaction severity factor (TSF) is proposed by introducing a time exponent in the severity factor. Four different biomass materials of Chinese medicine residue, Arthrospira platensis residue, C. sp. JSC4, and spent coffee grounds are examined. After the optimization of the time exponent, TSF can accurately correlate weight loss and thereby torrefaction severity, and improve the prediction up to 13% when compared to severity factor. In addition, the results suggest that TSF is able to appropriately predict the enhancement factor of HHV and energy yield where the coefficient of determination (R-2) is beyond 0.83. Overall, TSF has successfully combined the operating conditions (temperature and duration) and biomass species, can be utilized for predicting torrefaction performance. This gives a simple and fast way for torrefaction operation and reactor design, thereby achieving time-saving and efficient predictions.

AB  - Crosses of wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum and Hordeum vulgare ssp. agriocrithon) with Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare were used to select high yielding grain types under dryland Mediterranean conditions. No special difficulties were faced in making the crosses, in eliminating the brittle rachis genes from the grain types or in selecting 6-rowed types in crosses between 2-rowed wild barley and 6-rowed ssp. vulgare varieties. Brittle rachis genotypes, present in the segregating populations were used in developing self-reseeding permanent pastures for dry areas. The best selections were tested in seven trials during 1989-92 and some of them outyielded their parents and also the best improved check variety by 13-22%. Indications for transgressive segregation were obtained for grain yield, straw yield, total biological yield, harvest index and volume weight. The crude protein content of some of the selections was significantly higher than that of the checks. For breeding programs aiming at large seeds, special ssp. spontaneum lines should be used as parents. High grain yield was positively correlated with high straw yield, total biological yield, earliness in heading date, high harvest index and negatively with volume weight. It was concluded that unexploited useful genes, even when not directly observed in wild barley, could be transfered easily into high yielding genotypes by breeding.

AB  - We assessed fish community status for 16 nearshore areas in Lake Ontario and the upper St. Lawrence River, from 2006 to 2016, using complementary fish sampling gear types and protocols, boat electrofishing and trap nets, and the published aquatic ecosystem health indicators associated with them. Factors influencing Indices of Biotic Integrity scores included degree of exposure to the open-waters of Lake Ontario, effective fetch, and land cover and use in surrounding watersheds. Focusing on Toronto Harbour, we determined that Indices of Biotic Integrity scores were lower (45.1 and 45.6 for electrofishing and trap net gear types, respectively) than predicted (55.5 and 59.6) based on other Lake Ontario nearshore areas with similar physical/environmental conditions but seemed reasonable given the significant influence of Canada's largest urban area, the City of Toronto. The proportion of fish community biomass comprised of piscivores (0.21 and 0.18 for electrofishing and trap nets, respectively) approached target levels (0.20) set for the Toronto Harbour fish community, and indicated a balanced trophic structure. On-going aquatic habitat remediation and creation projects on the Leslie Street Spit (including Tommy Thompson Park) and the Toronto Islands, should ensure maintenance or improvement in Indices of Biotic Integrity scores and aquatic ecosystem health generally.

AB  - Preoccupations with regulatory and legal liability issues in marine environmental monitoring have led to programmes based on reductionist models that use non-biological parameters which are indirect measures of biotic condition. The ability to assess the effectiveness of current monitoring programmes to protect the marine environment at regional and national scales does not currently exist. Current monitoring programmes rarely serve the function for which they were intended: an accurate and sensitive source of information from which conditions and trends can be defined and recognized, and management decisions made. In addition, the natural variability of systems is problematic and must be documented in order to distinguish natural from anthropogenic changes in environmental conditions. Owing to their ecological importance, numerical abundance, and sensitivity to a variety of toxicants and pollutants, amphipod crustaceans have long been known as sensitive environmental indicators. However, application and use of amphipods in such programmes is limited to the few regions where ongoing comprehensive taxonomic and natural history investigations have been undertaken. Potential for amphipods as bioindicators exists in a wide variety of environments, especially in the tropics, but their incorporation into such programmes is dependent upon completion of taxonomic surveys and inventories.

AB  - This paper examines how strategic environmental assessment has been practiced at the national level in China through 2005 and why it has been practiced in the manner observed. Based on literature reviews and interviews carried out in 2005 and 2006, we find that bureaucratic politics between environmental and nonenvironmental ministries has limited the legislation and implementation of strategic environmental assessment to environmental assessment (EA) for a set of government plans defined in the 2003 Environmental Impact Assessment Law. Interviewees from environmental and nonenvironmental ministries and key research institutes have reported that few planning EAs have been performed at the sectoral level. Nonenvironmental ministries have either evaded the 2003 Environmental Impact Assessment Law and have not undertaken required planning EA or have organized planning EA on their own Without participation by the State Environmental Protection Administration. The rising tension between the environmental and nonenvironmental ministries has limited the role of planning EA as a participatory decision-making tool. In addition to bureaucratic politics, we find that weak public participation and underemphasis on social analysis in planning EA may have further compromised the utility of planning EA.

AB  - Poyang Lake wetland in China has extraordinary importance to millions of people in middle and lower Yangtze River Basin, and is also recognized globally for its remarkable biodiversity. However, it has been experiencing degradation for the past decades that is caused by human disturbances. Developing practical indicators for assessing ecological condition of this wetland is urgently needed. The index of biotic integrity (IBI) is a widely used approach for assessing ecological health of aquatic ecosystems. However, the methods for IBI metric selection are highly variable, hindering a consistent implementation of IBIs in assessment research and practice. In this article, we aim to develop a vegetation-based IBI (V-IBI) for the assessment of ecological status of Poyang Lake wetland, and to test whether adopting different methods for metric selection would present impacts on the assessment of wetland health condition. We conducted field surveys for obtaining the data of plant assemblages, water quality and human-induced disturbances at 30 sites in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We tested six different methods for V-IBI metric selection.
   The study found that the selection of V-IBI core metrics varied considerably by using different methods. Wetland health status of sample sites assessed by the tested methods only showed moderate correlations (mean r = 0.67), suggesting that using different methods for metric selection would affect the assessment output. The method that took account of three important aspects of wetland environment (i.e. water quality, land use and field-observed disturbances) for metric selection yielded the most plausible assessment results. We selected seven metrics to construct the V-IBI for Poyang Lake wetland, i.e. cover of Phalaris arundinacea L. and numbers of submerged species, invasive species and tolerant species in a sample site, percentages of perennial species, obligate wetland species and species with both sexual and vegetative propagation (calculated as the ratio of the number of species concerned to the total number of plant species in a sample site). The assessment indicated that the overall health condition of Poyang Lake wetland was in a "good" category, while the estuarine wetland was in either "poor" or "very poor" categories, suggesting that controlling pollutant input from rivers should be an important measure for wetland restoration and conservation. This study highlighted the importance of standardizing the methods for metric selection in IBI development so that assessments from different studies, such as in other large lakes and wetlands along the Yangtze River Basin, could be comparable. The V-IBI developed in this study can serve as a protocol for monitoring ecological security of Poyang Lake wetland.

AB  - In the field of aquatic ecotoxicology, indexes obtained from a battery of biomarkers have proved to be a useful tool for assessing quantifiable and integrated health responses of organisms exposed to pollutants. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of exposure to the Reconquista River water (RR) on adults of Cnesterodon decemmaculatus using different integrated indexes. We conducted a 12-d laboratory assay involving the exposure of fish to RR, a negative control (moderately hard water - MHW medium), and a positive control (for genotoxicity with MHW + Cyclophosphamide, CP). There were measured metabolic (food intake and specific assimilation, specific metabolic rate, oxygen extraction efficiency, ammonia excretion, and ammonia quotient), genotoxic (comet assay, micronucleus test, and nuclear abnormalities), morphological variables (total length, body and liver weight) and biochemical variables (Electron Transport System - ETS, Acetylcholinesterase activity - AChE, Catalase - CAT, Glutathione-S-transferase - GST, Glutathione content - GSH and tissue proteins). These variables were grouped into different indexes: morphological (Condition Factor - K and Liver Somatic Index-LSI), metabolic (Scope for Growth-SFG), genetic damage (GDI) and integrated biomarker response - IBR (AChE brain, CAT, GST and GSH liver, GSH gills, ETS muscle) indexes. Results indicated that RR water induced metabolic, biochemical and genetic damages. The SFG, GDI and IBR were suitable to assess the effects of exposure to an environmental sample in an integrated approach, reducing uncertainty due to inherent biomarker variability. These indexes have emerged as promising tools for environmental monitoring studies. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lyme disease is emerging in Canada due to geographic range expansion of the tick vector Ixodes scapularis Say. Recent areas of emergence include parts of the southeastern Canadian Prairie region. We developed a map of potential risk areas for future I. scapularis establishment in the Canadian Prairie Provinces. Six I. scapularis risk algorithms were developed using different formulations of three indices for environmental suitability: temperature using annual cumulative degree-days > 0 degrees C (DD > 0 degrees C; obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data as an index of conditions that allow I. scapularis to complete its life cycle), habitat as a combined geo-layer of forest cover and agricultural land use, and rainfall. The relative performance of these risk algorithms was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) analysis with data on presence-absence of I. scapularis obtained from recent field surveillance in the Prairie Provinces accumulated from a number of sources. The ROC AUC values for the risk algorithms were significantly different (P<0.01). The algorithm with six categories of DD > 0 degrees C, habitat as a simple dichotomous variable of presence or absence of forest, and normalized rainfall had the highest AUC of 0.74, representing "fair to good" performance of the risk algorithm. This algorithm had good (>80%) sensitivity in predicting positive I. scapularis surveillance sites, but low (50%) specificity as expected in this region where not all environmentally suitable habitats are expected to be occupied. Further prospective studies are needed to validate and perhaps improve the risk algorithm.

AB  - A method to simulate thousands of tropical cyclones using output from a global climate model is applied to simulations that span very high surface temperatures forced with high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). The climatology of the storms downscaled from a simulation with modern-day conditions is compared to that of events downscaled from two other simulations featuring 8 and 32 times preindustrial-era levels of CO2. Storms shift poleward with warming: genesis locations and track densities increase in subtropical and higher latitudes, and power dissipation increases poleward of 20 degrees S and 30 degrees N. The average latitude at which storms reach their maximum intensity shifts poleward by more than 1.5 degrees latitude in the 8 x CO2 experiment and by more than 7 degrees latitude in the 32 c CO2 case. Storms live longer and are more numerous in both of the warmer climates. These increases come largely from an expansion of the area featuring favorable conditions into subtropics and midlatitudes, with some regions of the Arctic having the thermodynamic conditions necessary to sustain systems in the hottest case. Storms of category 5 intensity are 52% more frequent in the 8 x CO2 experiment but 40% less so in the 32 x CO2 case, largely owing to a substantial decline in low-latitude activity associated with increases in a normalized measure of wind shear called the ventilation index. Changes in genesis and track densities align well with differences in the ventilation index, and environmental conditions become substantially more favorable poleward of about 20 degrees latitude in the warmer climates.

AB  - A rating assessment of the quality of life of the Russian regions, one of the most important social priorities, has been carried out. Experience of determining the quality of life indices in Russia and abroad is taken into account. The ratings of individual indicators for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation are calculated in three groups: socio-economic development, environmental status, and public health. Positions in the rating in each group were determined by combining the rating points of the three most significant indicators; after that, the integral rating was calculated in the same way. To identify trends, indicators for 2005 and 2015 were selected. A stable position both in 2005 and in 2015 in the top ten is occupied by Moscow and St. Petersburg, and by Tyumen (without AO), Kursk, Belgorod and Tambov oblasts, and the outsiders include Irkutsk, Amur and Arkhangelsk (without AO) oblasts, and by the Republic of Khakassia and Karelia. While in the leading regions, the main problems are associated with the ecological state of the environment, in the outsider regions they are caused by a combination of socio-economic, environmental, medical and demographic problems. The ratings of the constituent entities of the Baikal region are examined in detail. It was found that the common features of Zabaikalskii krai and the Republic of Buryatia are a low level of economic development, and a high level of poverty and mortality of the population. Irkutsk oblast, being a more economically developed region, is distinguished by an increase in poverty, a low standard of health, and by higher mortality rates as compared with the average Russian values, as well as with Zabaikalskii krai and the Republic of Buryatia. Irkutsk oblast occupies the last positions in the ecological ranking. Rating monitoring should be continued as it is required in order to reduce the spatial asymmetry of the country and the imbalances in its socio-economic development.

AB  - Biological indicators (BIs) are used to monitor ethylene oxide (EO) gas sterilization processes for medical devices.  Several European and United States BIs for EO sterilization were evaluated for resistance according to both United States Pharmacopeia (USP) XXI and United Kingdom's (UK) tests for D-values.  US BIs are B. subtilis var. niger spores on paper strips or disc carriers, while European BIs use aluminum strips, quartz sand, or cotton yarn.  Numerous BIs per run and runs per lot, as well as 2-3 different lots of BIs from each manufacturer, were examined.  Both British a US BIs met their respective label claims for rates of inactivation when tested against British and USP EO test parameters, respectively.  However, Danish BIs, on cotton yarn or quartz sand, were not inactivated following USP specifications during the exposure dwell times tested (600 mg L-1 EO, 54-degrees-C, 60% RH, 0-110 min).  The Danish BIs will require further testing in order for us to determine if their B. subtilis spores are unusually resistant to EO or if the spore carrier substrates protect the spores from the sterilizing gas.  In conclusion, the British and American BIs for EO sterilization are equivalent in resistance despite differences in carrier substrate, recovery conditions, calculation methods for D-values, and the labeled sterilization conditions for use.

AB  - The objective of this study was to diagnose integrative ecological health of an urban stream, which is located in the Asian temperate region. The research approach was primarily based on the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) using fish assemblage and a Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI). And these indexes were compared with long-term conventional chemical dataset during 1996-2005. For the experiment, four sampling sites were chosen from the stream and wading method was used for fish collection during 2004-2005. We developed a stream health assessment model (SHA model) for the regional application. Stream health conditions, based on the SHA model, averaged 23 indicating a fair-poor condition, and varied from 18 to 40 depending on the sampling stations. Values of QHEI varied from 55 (fair-poor condition) to 112 (good-fair condition) and the values were significantly lower in the down stream than the headwater. Water quality, based on COD, BOD, TN and TP declined from the upstream to downstream reach. The proportion of sensitive species showed a negative linear function with BOD and the tolerant was vise versa. Values of SHA model reflected the chemical and physical habitat conditions and this result was clearly evident in the downstream reach. These outcomes were supported by principal component analysis (PCA) of IBI vs. other factors. Overall these results suggest that the impacts to the health of this stream are due to the combined effects of both chemical and habitat degradation.

AB  - In an ongoing effort to propose biologically protective nutrient criteria, we examined how total nitrogen (TN) and its forms were associated with macroinvertebrate communities in wadeable streams of Maryland. Taxonomic and functional metrics of an index of biological integrity (IBI) were significantly associated with multiple nutrient measures; however, the highest correlations with nutrients were for ammonia-N and nitrite-N and among macroinvertebrate measures were for Beck's Biotic Index and its metrics. Since IBI metrics showed comparatively less association, we evaluated how macroinvertebrate taxa related to proposed nutrient criteria previously derived for those same streams instead of developing nutrient-biology thresholds. We identified one tolerant and three intolerant taxa whose occurrence appeared related to a TN benchmark. Individually, these taxa poorly indicated whether streams exceeded the benchmark, but combining taxa notably improved classification rates. We then extracted major physiochemical gradients using principal components analysis to develop models that assessed their influence on nutrient indicator taxa. The response of intolerant taxa was predominantly influenced by a nutrient-forest cover gradient. In contrast, habitat quality had a greater effect on tolerant taxa. When taxa were aggregated into a nutrient sensitive index, the response was primarily influenced by the nutrient-forest gradient. Multiple lines of evidence highlight the effects of excessive nutrients in streams on macroinvertebrate communities and taxa in Maryland, whose loss may not be reflected in metrics that form the basis of biological criteria. Refinement of indicator taxa and a nutrient-sensitive index is warranted before thresholds in aquatic life to water quality are quantified.

AB  - Relationships between indices of condition and measures of proximate body composition were examined among and within nine populations of mature walleyes Sander vitreus that varied widely in growth rate and lipid status. Body condition, measured as the residuals from mass versus length regressions, was negatively related to mean water content and positively related to mean lipid content among populations. When the roles of water and lipid content were examined simultaneously within populations, most of the variance in condition was accounted for by lipid content. The strength of the relationships between various condition indices and body proximate composition varied considerably among populations but less between sexes within populations. Furthermore, the strength and nature of these relationships was not strongly influenced by the choice of mass-at-length index (residuals, relative condition, relative weight, or Fulton's K). The visceral-somatic index and muscle lipid content both exhibited slightly stronger relationships with body proximate composition than did mass-at-length condition indices for both sexes. The hepatosomatic index was more consistently related to somatic lipid content for females than for males in most populations. Relatively simple condition indices can provide reliable surrogates of body proximate composition in many adult walleye populations, but caution should be exercised in extrapolating from condition-composition relationships among populations.

AB  - Infant mortality rate (IMR) serves as a summary measure of the health of a nation's population. The U.S. IMR has declined over the past several decades (to 6.85 per 1000 in 2003), but remains high compared with other developed countries. We hypothesized a relationship between IMR and poor water quality at a local scale. We used degraded stream condition, represented by a multimetric index of biotic condition, as a metric for poor water quality. Using conditional probability analysis on county-aggregated data for the state of Maryland, we show that there is a significant association between the extent of a county's stream miles in poor ecological condition and the probability of a county's IMR exceeding the national norm. The overall relationship appears to be robust, as similar associations were also found for the states of West Virginia and Pennsylvania. We are not implying that IMR and degraded stream condition are directly causally related, but rather that there may be common factors that affect both of them. We hypothesize that attributes and activities at the county scale (e.g., socioeconomic conditions, land use, human activities) may contribute to both stream degradation and increased IMR.

AB  - In ecological assessment many abiotic and biotic indicators, reflecting the many facets of ecosystems, are used. Reporting on the state of the environment requires that information on separate indicators be integrated into comprehensive yardsticks or indices. In this paper we describe a method for assessing the quality of natural resources in agroecosystems and present a case study on the Dutch Lowland Peat area. Using a coherent set of physical, chemical, and biotic indicators, we compare the present situation with the long-term policy objective of strategic policy plans. Results are depicted in a radial plot. The present ecological quality of the Lowland Peat area has been found to deviate strongly from that of the desired state.

AB  - This paper assesses the applicability of the Frame of Reference (FoR) approach for the environmental monitoring of large-scale offshore Marine Renewable Energy (MRE) projects. The focus is on projects harvesting energy from winds, waves and currents. Environmental concerns induced by MRE projects are reported based on a classification scheme identifying stressors, receptors, effects and impacts. Although the potential effects of stressors on most receptors are identified, there are large knowledge gaps regarding the corresponding (positive and negative) impacts. In that context, the development of offshore MRE requires the implementation of fit-for-purpose monitoring activities aimed at environmental protection and knowledge development. Taking European legislation as an example, it is suggested to adopt standardized monitoring protocols for the enhanced usage and utility of environmental indicators. Towards this objective, the use of the FoR approach is advocated since it provides guidance for the definition and use of coherent set of environmental state indicators. After a description of this framework, various examples of applications are provided considering a virtual MRE project located in European waters. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are provided for the successful implementation of the FoR approach and for future studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reproduction management of natural popsulations can have long-term consequences that have to be examined to avoid unwanted side effects. Management policies of urban Pigeons (Columba livia Gmelin, 1789) include the set up of public Pigeon houses that aim at limiting hatching rate by egg removal. However, long-term consequences of this management method on the ecology of this species are still unknown. In this study we examined how egg removal affected egg-laying cycles of Pigeons by using a powerful method of time-series analysis, the wavelet method. We compared egg-laying cycles in Pigeon houses exposed to different management treatments and found that egg-laying cycles were shorter (4 weeks) in Pigeon houses with egg removal compared with control Pigeon houses without egg removal (11 weeks), suggesting that Pigeons respond to egg-removal pressure by multiplying reproduction attempts. Furthermore, we found that egg quality, an important index of female condition, was negatively affected by egg removal. This result suggests that the observed increase of egg production can lead to an increase of reproductive physiological costs and to a decrease of female condition. This study raises issues about potential consequences of such a management procedure on parasite resistance and health status of urban bird populations.

AB  - The complex and interconnected nature of ecological systems often makes it difficult to understand and prevent multiresource, multistressor problems. This article describes a process to assess ecological condition at regional scales. The article also describes how the approach was applied to the Mid-Atlantic estuaries, where it focused on characterizing the current state of the environment rather than on predicting future effects from humans. The necessity for iteration during the exercise showed how important it was to identify the purpose of the assessment and its users, that appropriate, consistent data are lacking for large-scale assessments, and that it remains a challenge to communicate succinctly the results of such an assessment.

AB  - The relationship of multiple factors, such as instream habitat, drainage area, gradient, cumulative effluent, conventional pollutants, and chemical mixtures, to fish communities was explored at the subbasin, basin, and state level within the state of Ohio, USA. Two approaches were used: bottom-up, which focused on subbasin- and basin-level relationships within the Great Miami River, Ohio, and top-down, focusing on relationships across the entire state. Data were provided by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. These data were integrated via a geographical information system. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the strength of stressor-response relationships. The greatest amount of variation of the index of biotic integrity (IBI) and selected metrics was addressed at the subbasin level, followed by the basin and state level, respectively. Overall, habitat factors were the best predictors and positively related to the IBI and number of fish species. Chemical factors, such as cumulative effluent, metals, ammonia, and biochemical oxygen demand, were consistently observed as negative, moderating factors for IBI and fish taxa richness and were the best predictors of the percent of fish observed with deformities, fin erosions, lesions, and tumors.

AB  - Deer antler metrics have been used to index the physical condition of deer populations, but those sampled at deer-check stations may not be representative of the population at large if deer hunters select for larger antlered individuals. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate whether white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus hunters exhibit selective behavior through an age-specific comparison of harvested antler metrics to naturally cast antlers; and 2) evaluate the potential value of cast antlers to monitor herd condition via antler seal depth to identify individual health. Antler metrics representing antler mass (main beam basal circumference), length (main beam length), and the number of antler points were taken on yearling (aged 1.5 y) hunter-harvested deer during the 2009, 2010, and 2011 November firearm seasons and compared with freshly cast yearling antlers collected during the corresponding 2010, 2011, and 2012 antler-casting seasons. The antler metric indicative of antler mass was greater in harvested deer than the deer herd at large, providing empirical evidence of size-selective hunter behavior. We suggest that cast antlers be used as a less-biased alternative to measurements taken of antlers of harvested deer to assess herd characteristics.

AB  - The results of three Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression models were used to gain a holistic view on the consequences of natural processes and anthropogenic pressures for water quality degradation and biodiversity decline in a multi-use watershed. The processes were soil erosion and wildfire risk; the pressures comprised land use conflicts, leachates from domestic and industrial waste, arable farming intensity and livestock density. Water quality was characterized for concentrations of nutrients (nitrate, phosphate), oxygen demands (Biochemical Oxygen Demand - BOD5, Chemical Oxygen Demand - COD) and various metals (e.g., As, Cr). Ecological integrity was assessed by the recently developed MELT (Multiple Ecological Level Index). In total, 18 variables were processed in the regression models. Two models were called "nested models" because they dealt with initial (pressures), intermediate (water quality) and final (MELI) environmental descriptors, used as dependent (MELI, quality) or independent (quality, pressures) variables. The third was called "bypass model" because it dealt solely with initial and final descriptors. Overall, the results of PLS regression linked the ineffective treatment of domestic sewage to water quality and ecological integrity declines in the studied watershed. Put another way, all models recurrently affirmed the major role of local factors, meaning of point source pollution, in determining the quality of stream water and the integrity of freshwater ecosystems. Sources of diffuse pollution were accounted for as contributing factors in the PLS regressions, but their influence was scarcely perceptible in the results. The poor treatment of domestic effluents is a public concern. In their strategic plans for mitigating this problem in the forthcoming years, administrative authorities are concentrated on management initiatives to improve the quality of provided services, instead of considering the construction of new wastewater treatment plants.

AB  - This New Zealand research focuses on providing evidence that a specified residential land use layout plus, at source. stormwater management results in higher aquatic ecosystem health. The evidence provides justification for changes in statutory plans, policies and practice rules that direct urban development. The surveyed sites are within river basins clustered by similar residential land use density. Each cluster includes one river basin with conventional urban form and drainage. Other comparative basins in the cluster typify a, water sensitive. urban form and infrastructure. An index of biotic integrity (indicating river health) is determined for each waterway at annual intervals over years. Current plan requirements, policies and practice guidelines for urban development are critiqued in relation to survey results. The cumulative influence of defined residential river basin characteristics (drivers) are related to the holistic biotic indices. Combined drivers determine the cumulative aquatic health outcome. Research methods typically don. t target the effects of a single driver. Policy, plan and practice requirements need to guide urban design and construction to incorporate the elements of urban form that are together necessary for aquatic health. This will ensure an order of magnitude improvement in the functionality and recreational appeal of streams, wetlands, lakes and recipient harbours.

AB  - This paper presents, for the first time, evidence to show that Calluna species are one causative factor of piping in blanket peat catchments. Ground-penetrating radar survey on 960 plots illustrated that piping was prevalent throughout blanket peats. However, soil pipe occurrence was significantly higher where bare peat (149 pipes/ km) or Calluna (87 pipes/ km) were present compared to other species (67 pipes/ km). A case study catchment where there was an altitudinal limit to Calluna provided some control over potential factors that may lead to an association between piping and Calluna. Under the controlled conditions of topographic index, peat depth, and water table, piping was greater under the Calluna-covered peat than under other vegetation covers. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that 10 years worth of rainfall was enough to almost double the proportion of macropore flow occurring in recently colonized Calluna peatlands. This suggests that given enough water and time, the woody Calluna plants result in water being preferentially channeled through the upper peat. Improvements are therefore required in our understanding of the relationships between peatland plant nutrient and water supply and the feedbacks between ecosystem functioning and landform development. These results are also important given the propensity to encourage Calluna growth for game bird enhancement in many northern peatlands.

AB  - The key goal of this study was to analyse application of the Green Investment Scheme in the Czech Republic through the Green Savings Programme finalising in 2015. The programme was evaluated in terms of aspects of both reduction effectiveness and economic aspects of the basic subsidy categories: (a) Insulation; (b) Low-Energy Houses; (c) Biomass Boilers; (d) Solar Thermal Systems and (e) Heat Pumps. The essential results of the programme were also covered, including the number of projects supported, the total volume of emission reduction and the volume of financial funding.
   The basic evaluation was based on selected indicators, including abatement costs, greening ratio, payback period and subsidy share of investment costs. The primary data for calculating originated from the database of the Information System of the Green Savings Programme by the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic. The calculated value of abatement cost was between 12 (heat pumps and biomass boilers) and 272 (sic) t CO2-1(low-energy houses). The shortest payback time-periods were calculated for insulation at 11.2 and 3.8 years respectively, without and including the provided subsidy. On the contrary, there was no economic payback in the case of biomass boilers, due to transition to an economically costlier fuel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ferula assa-foetida L. (Apiaceae) is one of the most important endangered medicinal plants, which is rare in nature due to poor seed germination. In an effort to improve and promote the cultivation of this plant, the effects of two temperatures (23 degrees C and 4 degrees C), exogenous GA(3) and cytokinins (kinetin and BAP) were investigated on dormancy breaking and germination of F. assa-foetida L. seeds. Among the treatments, cold stratification (4 degrees C) significantly stimulated seed breaking dormancy. The highest mean germination index (2.6 germinated seed per week) was obtained by treatment of seeds with 5 mg/L kinetin at 4 degrees C. But, under no hormone treatment, the highest final percentage germination (73%) was obtained when the seeds were soaked in distilled water and then incubated at 4 degrees C. Also, under this condition the germination index was achieved to 2.5 germinated seeds per week. Treatment of the seeds by GA(3) not only could not significantly enhance the germination index and percentage at 23 degrees C, but also the existence of GA(3) caused a marked decrease in those values at 4 degrees C. This result demonstrated that GA(3) was not effective to overcome dormancy for this species.

AB  - We consider a network of parallel service stations each modeled as a single-server queue. Each station serves its own dedicated customers as well as generic customers who are routed from a central controller. We suppose that the cost incurred by a customer is an increasing function of her time spent in the system. In a significant advance on most previous work, we do not require waiting costs to be convex, still less linear. With the objective of minimizing the long-run average waiting cost, we develop two heuristic routing policies, one of which is based on dynamic programming policy improvement and the other on Lagrangian relaxation. In developing the latter policy, we show that each station is "indexable" under mild conditions for customers' waiting costs and also prove some structural results on the admission control problem that naturally arises as a result of the Lagrangian relaxation. We then test the performance of our heuristics in an extensive numerical study and show that the Lagrangian heuristic demonstrates a strong level of performance in a range of traffic conditions. In particular, it clearly outperforms both a greedy heuristic, which is a standard proposal in complex routing problems, and a recent proposal from the heavy traffic literature.

AB  - The utilization and protection of tidal flat play a crucial role in the sustainable development of coastal areas. This study aims to propose an evaluation index system model for the carrying capacity of the tidal flat resources in bays around the Bohai Sea. Indexes are selected under the framework of DSI (Drivers-State-Impact), considering the socio-economic driving factors, resource conditions, the influence of shoreline change on hydrodynamic environment and the utilization type associating with possible ecological impact. Basic indexes are quantified using publicly available statistical information, hydrodynamic numerical simulation and satellite image interpretation, while the weight of each index is determined using the entropy weight method. The historical changes and future trends of shoreline and the utilization type of the coastal tidal flat in last decades are analyzed, and the carrying capacity of the tidal flat resources around the Bohai Sea has been evaluated. The coast around the Bohai Sea is divided into three areas, the Liaodong Bay, the Bohai Bay and the Laizhou Bay. The results show that the carrying capacity of the Laizhou Bay is better than the other areas. Moreover, the carrying capacity of the three areas showed a large decline from 2003 to 2013, while the decline slowed from 2013 to 2018 and is expected to increase slightly from 2018 to 2028.

AB  - Government-operated water quality monitoring programmes and their long-term datasets are crucial to documenting improvements in water resource condition in response to changes in pollutant regulation. We present trends in the biological assessment of water quality (benthic macroinvertebrates) and water chemistry, to determine how these indicators of water quality have responded to shifts in pollutants and regulation in streams and rivers of NY between 1972 and 2012. Change in the results of NYS's multimetric index of biological integrity, the Biological Assessment Profile (BAP) score, was compared between four, 10-year periods at 30 large river and 138 wadeable stream sites. Water Chemistry trends were analysed through calculation of Weighted Regression on Time, Discharge, and Season from 11 long-term, large river locations from across NYS. Overall, results suggest small, incremental improvements in biological indicators and a shift from point source dominated pollution to nonpoint sources. From 1972 to 2012, 33% of large river sites sampled improved and 13% declined in biological assessment of water quality, 58% of wadeable stream sites sampled showed no change. Macroinvertebrate community models suggest that impact sources are now dominated by nonpoint nutrient sources. Trends in water chemistry concentrations suggest that ammonia, chloride, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus had the strongest correlations with time. Total phosphorus and total Kjeldahl nitrogen decreased at base flow and increased during high flows, whereas ammonia decreased across a range of discharges, indicating the shift to nonpoint sources of nutrients and supporting the trends observed in biological indicators.

AB  - Considering the significant influence of mercury (Hg) contamination on the land reclamation inopencast coalmine, the spatial distribution patterns and ecological risks of Hg were investigated and the regulating factors of Hg mobility were determined in the South Dump of the Pingshuo opencast coalmine. The results show that the total Hg (HgT) contents of most soil samples (83.7%) vary from 6 to 50 mu g kg(-1), while the potential ecological risk index (EIHg) values of most samples (79.8%) are lower than 80, indicating that most reclaimed soils are in relatively good conditions and the soil samples at high to very high ecological risk are mainly collected near the backfilled coal gangue. Moreover, the kriging maps of the geo-accumulation index (I-geo) indicate that the uncontaminated areas (I-geo < 0) and Hg-contaminated areas (I-geo > 0) in topsoil (0-10 cm) are roughly divided by an "east-west arc" while the Hg-contaminated areas in other soil horizons are characterized by a "point distribution pattern". The slight Hg contamination in topsoil is mainly triggered by the atmospheric Hg deposition from the nearby coal-fired power plant, while the Hg contamination in other soil horizons should be attributed to the weathering and spontaneous combustion of coal gangue. On the other hand, Pearson's correlation analyses show that HgT contents were positively correlated with clay (r = 0.31, P < 0.01) and SOC (r = 0.53, P < 0.01) contents. This study can provide some insight for the land reclamation measures in the opencast coalmine.

LA  - English
AB  - A rule-based deterministic model is used to forecast recruitment of anchovy Engraulis capensis in the southern Benguela from field measurements of biological and environmental variables collected during two consecutive years. Field data were obtained on a monthly basis during the anchovy spawning season as part of the South African Sardine and Anchovy Recruitment Programme (SARP). A total of six indicator variables was considered for the analysis: distance offshore of the 16 degreesC isotherm: southerly wind stress; anchovy egg abundance; incidence of oocyte atresia in adult females; an index of fish starvation; and oil : meal ratios obtained from commercial data (which were used as an index of fish condition). In the model, data for each variable were assessed against a threshold value. "Active" variables were assumed to contribute towards below-average recruitment by being either above or below their threshold values, as defined by the rules. The model was not based on the SARP field data, which were used to test the model. Predicted results from the expert system compared favourably with final estimates of recruitment strength for both 1994 and 1995 (years of below average recruitment), indicating that field measurements of biological and environmental variables may be used in a structured manner to obtain forecasts of anchovy recruitment to the fishery.

Contaminant levels, histopathology and several biological effects (BEs) including Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), acetylcholinesterase (AChe), metallothionein proteins (MT) and alkali labile phosphate (ALP), in Mytilus edulis are presented, improving the current knowledge base for these data. Potential links between histopathology, BEs and contaminants and ranking of sites are investigated with an integrated response (IR) indexing technique. Histopathological condition indices (Ih) in mussel digestive gland are used to calculate health indices. A spatial and temporal assessment is conducted at Irish coastal locations. Linear mixed effects modelling revealed effects of confounding factors such as reproductive condition on NRRT (gonad stage (p < 0.001)). Higher prevalence of inflammation, brown cells and epithelial thinning of the digestive gland was evident at Dublin and Wexford and this linked well with the Ih. Levels of contaminants were generally found to be low with few exceptions as were BE responses. Using the IR approach, Dublin was ranked as being most impacted while Shannon ranked the least impacted, this being consistent with the BE ranking. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined naturalized rainbow trout spawning stocks from across the Great Lakes to determine: i) how reproductive characteristics among adults within populations vary with sex, ontogeny and energetic status, and ii) if variations in growth and reproductive characteristics among populations reflect differences in the environments they inhabit. Females in spawning runs tended to be larger and older than males, but growth rates were similar between sexes. As predicted, females had larger and more lipid-rich gonads and livers, and lower somatic condition and muscle lipid concentrations than males. Within populations, gonad size, fecundity, and egg size were related primarily to body size, and secondarily to indices of adult condition. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) increased with body size in females and declined with body size in males. Egg size increased with female size and declined with liver size and/or lipid content, whereas relative fecundity showed opposite trends. In contrast, egg lipid content appeared to be more strongly related to liver size and lipid content (positive effects) than to female size. Among populations, growth rate and muscle lipid concentration declined from south to north, but contrary to predictions, none of the reproductive traits examined showed strong covariation with environmental gradients. Growth, energetic status, and reproductive investment of Great Lakes naturalized rainbow trout vary both within and among populations, but localized adaptation to environmental conditions appears to be subtle.

AB  - Riparian vegetation is known to affect aquatic macroinvertebrate communities through contributions of organic matter and shading. Despite the widespread degradation of riparian vegetation in Australia, there are relatively few studies examining the effect of changes in riparian vegetation on in-stream macroinvertebrate assemblages on individual catchments. In particular, information is lacking on the responses of macroinvertebrate communities in catchments dominated by agriculture, where farms that are managed at the paddock scale result in riparian vegetation condition varying over relatively short distances. In this study, macroinvertebrate assemblages were assessed from 12 reaches along a 25-km section of a small agricultural stream in south-eastern Australia. Riparian condition was assessed using in-stream coarse woody debris (CWD) levels and the rapid appraisal of riparian condition (RARC) index, a numerical system for categorising the health of riparian areas that incorporates sub-indices reflecting habitat continuity, vegetation cover, plant debris levels, native vegetation dominance, and other indicative features. There was a significant positive correlation between RARC scores and macroinvertebrate taxon richness (p < 0.01), and also between CWD scores and macroinvertebrate taxon richness (p < 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant correlation observed between riparian condition and the other macroinvertebrate indices (abundance, Shannon diversity, SIGNAL and SIGNAL2). Macroinvertebrate communities were significantly different in stream reaches from different riparian condition categories (ANOSIM; p < 0.05). Our results indicate that efforts to rehabilitate riparian vegetation may have a positive effect on in-stream biota even when implemented at a relatively small scale by individual landholders.

AB  - Field observations of near-surface soil moisture, collected over several seasons in a watershed in suburban Maryland, are compared with values of the topographic soil moisture index generated using digital elevation models (DEMs) at a range of grid cell sizes from photogrammetric and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data sources. A companion set of near-surface soil moisture observations, DEMs and topographic index values are also presented for a nearby forested catchment. The degree to which topographic index values are an effective indicator of near-surface soil moisture conditions varies in the two environments. The urbanizing environment requires topographic index values from a DEM with a much finer grid cell resolution than the LIDAR data can provide, and the relationship is stronger in wetter conditions. In the forested environment, the DEM resolution required is considerably lower and adequately supported by the photogrammetric data, and the relationship is strong under all moisture conditions. These results provide some insights into the length scales of near-surface hydrological processes in the urbanizing environment, and the resolution of terrain data required to model those processes.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination in the Bohai Sea (China) has been the focus of many studies, but most of them only focused on local pollution levels and thus lacked high spatial resolution for the whole sea. In this study, heavy metals (i.e., As, Cr, Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, and Fe) in surface sediments were analyzed to assess the spatio-temporal pollution conditions of the Bohai Sea, an important coastal environment consisting of Bohai Bay, Laizhou Bay, and Liaodong Bay. The results indicated that the heavy metal concentration in the sediments was in the range of 6.43-32.18 mg/kg for As, 14.90-58.07 mg/kg for Cr, 3.90-27.19 mg/kg for Cu, 0.04-0.27 mg/kg for Cd, 11.09-30.95 mg/kg for Pb, 18.76-65.58 mg/kg for Zn, and 0.78%-2.55% for Fe. The distribution of heavy metals revealed that the concentrations were relatively low in Laizhou Bay, very high in the northwest coastal region of the Bohai Sea, and decreased from near-shore to offshore areas. Moreover, both the enrichment factor and geo-accumulation index demonstrated that there was no contamination to be found for Cr, Cu, Zn in the region and a slight to moderate pollution of As, Cd, and Pb. Cd and As presented considerable potential ecological risk as a result of their high toxicity. The potential ecological risk index (RI) suggested that a third of the areas (northwest coastal area of the Bohai Sea) has moderate ecological risk. The risk area was generally decreased as offshore distance increased, which suggested that the contamination and risk of heavy metals are influenced by anthropogenic activities.

AB  - The present study assesses disparities in the spatial distribution of three indicators evaluating respectively economic growth (per capita value added), sustainable development (a sustainable development index composing 99 individual variables) and the quality of the natural capital (Environmental Sensitive Area Index composing 14 individual variables) in Italy. The analysis was carried out on three different geographical domains (3 divisions (north, central and south Italy), 20 administrative regions and 103 provinces) with municipalities as the elementary spatial unit. While the distribution of the three indicators was coherent across space, the coefficient of variation of the three indicators, taken as a proxy of regional disparities, showed a contrasting spatial pattern. Domains with higher average values of the sustainable development index showed a lower variability among municipalities, indicating a less divided territorial context. By contrast, income and natural capital disparities are decoupled from the average level of the respective indexes. Multivariate analysis identifies a north-south gradient reflecting the divide between competitive and economically-disadvantaged regions in Italy. Results provide an informative base to implement sustainability policies in countries characterized by persistent socioeconomic disparities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A biomonitoring study was conducted using some biotic (Pomadasys hasta and Lutjanus russellii fish) and abiotic (water and sediment) components of the Red Sea coast of Hodeida, Yemen Republic along two polluted sites (Al-Dawar beach and Urj village) in comparison to a reference site (Al-Nukhailah beach). The studied fish biomarkers included hepatosomatic index (HSI), condition factor (K), scaled mass index (SMI), catalase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), malondialdehyde (MDA), total protein and albumin. In addition, metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd) concentrations in water and sediment were measured and sediment pollution assessment was carried out using contamination factor (CF), geoaccumulation index (Igeo), pollution load index (PLI) and enrichment factor (EF). The studied metals concentration in water and sediment samples showed significant increase among the polluted sites in comparison to the reference site. Sediment pollution assessment generally confirmed that Urj village was the most contaminated site followed by Al-Dawar beach. Catalase, GST and MDA proved to be the most responsive biomarkers with increased values of GST and MDA at sites influenced by agricultural, urban and industrial activities while catalase, HSI, K, SMI, total protein and albumin showed the opposite trend. This study recommends monitoring of sediment Igeo and EF values as well as SMI, catalase, GST and MDA as sensitive indicators of different anthropogenic activities and their effects on aquatic ecosystems under complex and different gradients of metal pollution. In addition, P. hasta proved to be more sensitive towards the detected pollution condition.

AB  - The aims of this study were to i) identify the influence of the GxE interaction in the selection of inbred lines of melon, and ii) test the efficiency of different indexes in the selection of inbred lines with a higher yield potential and better quality fruit. For these purposes, 98 inbred lines of yellow melon and two commercial controls, Vereda and AF-646, were evaluated in a randomized block design with two replications, at the conditions present in Mossoro and Barauna. Analyses of the following traits were performed: fruit yield, mean fruit weight, pulp thickness, pulp firmness and soluble solids content. A complex portion of the GxE interaction was predominantly detected for all traits. The recommendation in this case is to promote selection in each environment. Alternatively, selection based on the average behavior of the inbred lines is the strategy that generates the greatest gains, approaching those obtained through direct selection in each specific environment. The selection indexes aimed at reducing the expression of all traits proved to be best for both locations. The index constructed for Barauna allowed the selection of a greater number of inbred lines with a higher yield potential and better quality fruit and, thus, greater efficiency.

AB  - The Wetland Classification and Risk Assessment Index (WCRAI) is based on manifestations of ecological processes in natural wetland ecosystems. The index is hierarchical in structure and is designed to allow identification and rapid assessment at the broadest levels by non wetland experts in different disciplines to manage natural wetlands. From previous studies, landscape ecology has demonstrated the importance of considering landscape context in addition to local site attributes when explaining wetland ecological processes and ecological integrity. The pressures that land uses and activities exert on wetlands generate impacts that affect both the biotic and abiotic characteristics of the surface water column and the surrounding riparian zone. Therefore, human-altered land in a catchment and spatial patterns of surrounding wetlands provide a direct way to measure human impacts and can be correlated with indicators such as water chemistry and biotic variables. The objective of this study was to develop and test the WCRAI so that the index can be used to classify different types of wetlands and to assess their ecological condition (also known as "Eco-status") under different ecological conditions. The results obtained from the WCRAI were indicative of the integrity of these wetlands when compared to the status of the abiotic and biotic variables measured at each sampling site. From an economical perspective, the WCRAI can play a crucial role in preventing unnecessary degradation of wetlands, hence reducing financial loss through management, restoration, or rehabilitation efforts. The methodology can be applied very easily (due to its simplistic nature) by industry stakeholders to continually monitor these wetlands.

AB  - We propose a general Markovian model for the optimal control of admissions and subsequent routing of customers for service provided by a collection of heterogeneous stations. Queue-length information is available to inform all decisions. Admitted customers will abandon the system if required to wait too long for service. The optimisation goal is the maximisation of reward rate earned from service completions, net of the penalties paid whenever admission is denied, and the costs incurred upon every customer loss through impatience. We show that the system is indexable under mild conditions on model parameters and give an explicit construction of an index policy for admission control and routing founded on a proposal of Whittle for restless bandits. We are able to gain insights regarding the strength of performance of the index policy from the nature of solutions to the Lagrangian relaxation used to develop the indices. These insights are strengthened by the development of performance bounds. Although we are able to assert the optimality of the index heuristic in a range of asymptotic regimes, the performance bounds are also able to identify instances where its performance is relatively weak. Numerical studies are used to illustrate and support the theoretical analyses.

AB  - The habitat suitability index and environmental flow requirements were assessed for ten species of macroinvertebrates in a 2 km length section of the urban Boti creek (average flow 0.4 m(3) s(-1)) in Prague. Boti creek has been affected by two combined sewer overflows (CSO). Spring, summer and fall seasonal environmental flow requirements were identified using the Physical HABitat SIMulation System (PHABSIM) approach for the whole macroinvertebrate community: Spring - optimal flow 0.32-0.38 m(3) s(-1), minimal flow 0.20-0.21 m(3) s(-1) and maximal acceptable flow 0.91-0.93 m(3) s(-1); Summer - optimal flow 0.42-0.45 m(3) s(-1), minimal flow 0.19-0.21 m(3) s(-1) and maximal acceptable flow 0.95-1.00 m(3) s(-1); Fall - optimal flow 0.38-0.48 m(3) s(-1), minimal flow 0.22-0.23 m(3) s(-1) and maximal acceptable flow 0.95-0.98 m(3) s(-1). The seasonal variability of environmental flow for all three categories is approximately 10%. Environmental flow requirements of the studied species and their life stages vary with depth, velocity and bottom substratum. Due to inflow from the CSOs, the optimal and maximal acceptable flow are not maintained and the maximal flow is exceeded by more than twice its value. Although the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) was primarily designed for large impounded rivers, the study proved its applicability in small streams affected by urbanization and urban drainage.

AB  - The Timber, Fish, and Wildlife program (TFW) in Washington is a consensus approach to implementing reforms in forest practice regulations involving industrial timberland owners, state agencies; environmental groups, Indian tribes, and non-industrial forest landowners. A cooperative monitoring and research effort (CMER) has been included as a part of this program. Technical projects undertaken by CMER are overseen by a series of steering committees, one of which is the Water Quality Steering Committee. Projects currently being addressed by the Water Quality Steering Committee include: forestry impacts on water temperature, water quality impacts from forestry derived sediment, use of bio-indicators to assess the water quality impacts of forest practices, and the effect of forest chemical applications on water quality. A close link between the research efforts in TFW and the procedure for implementing regulatory change has greatly improved the responsiveness of the rule making process to new information. Results from the water temperature and forest chemical work is currently being incorporated into the forest practice regulations.

AB  - Puyehue is a largely basaltic stratovolcano located in the southern volcanic zone of the Andes, with an irregular inter-occurrence intervals of eruption that affects the ecology of the native communities. The latest Puyehue eruption occurred in June 2011 and dispersed about 100 M tons of pyroclastic materials to the Patagonia steppe of Argentina, due to the West-East predominant winds, affecting an area of over 7.5 M ha. Herein we report the changes in the reproductive cycle of females and body condition of adult males, females, juveniles, and newborns of Phymaturus spectabilis, a lizard with a vulnerable conservation status, following volcanic ash accumulation in Argentinian Patagonian steppe. This microendemic species inhabits specific volcanic rocky outcrops, in cold and arid environments of Ingeniero Jacobacci, Rio Negro, Argentina. We used the body condition index, an useful method for quantifying the energy reserves of animals, and we studied this index and the female reproductive cycle during the first (years 2011-2012) and the second (years 2012-2013) activity season post-eruption, and discussed the results in relation to the body condition and the reproductive cycle studied before eruption (years 2006-2011). We found that only 12% of adult females were reproductive during the first activity season, which indicates that most P. spectabilis, skipped reproduction the year of eruption. In contrast, during the second activity season 83% of adult females were reproductive. However clutch size was changed to one to three offspring, instead of the typical two offspring reported for P. spectabilis before the Puyehue eruption, which is also characteristic of the Phymaturus genus. In addition, body condition of offspring born during the second activity season was significantly lower than offspring born before the eruption. We found that body condition of juveniles and adult males was significantly lower during the first activity season than before eruption and significantly higher during the second year. The lack of improvement in the body condition of non-reproductive females during the first years might explain the skip in the reproduction given that a good body condition is crucial for reproduction. These results suggest that the ash fall caused changes in the reproduction and the body condition of a population of a lizard, P. spectabilis, during the first activity season. However, the population showed rapid recovery during the second activity season post-eruption, indicating heretofore unobserved plasticity in litter size.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the development of reliable tools to assess the water quality and state of aquatic ecosystems in dynamic conditions a crucial need to address. One of such tools could be devised by monitoring the taxonomic structure of reservoirs' microbiomes. Microbial taxa's ecological and metabolic characteristics suggest their essential roles in maintaining the water ecosystem's environmental equilibrium. The study aimed to explain the role of diversity and seasonal variability of the microbial communities in the ecosystem stability on the example of Goczalkowice Reservoir (Poland). The structure of the reservoir microbiome was studied using bioinformatics and modeling techniques. Water was sampled periodically in July & November 2010, and April 2011 at four representative sites. The abundance and relative fraction of the limnetic taxonomic units were determined in respect to the physicochemical indices. Significant seasonal variations in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) were observed within the reservoir basin's main body but not at the main tributary's mouth. The highest values of the correlation coefficients between OTU and physicochemical variables were obtained for Burkholderiales, Pseudoanabenales, Rickettsiales, Roseiflexales, Methylophilales, Actinomycetales, and Cryptophyta. These microorganisms are proposed as indicators of environmental conditions and water quality. Metataxonomic analyses of the freshwater microbiome in the reservoir, showed that microorganisms constitute conservative communities that undergo seasonal and local changes regarding the relative participation of the identified taxa. Therefore, we propose that monitoring those variations could provide a reliable measure of the state of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - P>1. Previous attempts to identify nationally important wetlands for biodiversity in New Zealand were based on expert panel opinions because quantitative approaches were hampered by a lack of data. We apply principles of systematic conservation planning to remote sensing data within a geographical information system (GIS) to identify nationally important palustrine and inland saline wetlands.
   2. A catchment-based classification was used to divide New Zealand into 29 biogeographic units. To meet representation goals, all wetland classes need to be protected within each unit.
   3. We mapped current and historic wetlands down to a minimum size of 0.5 ha. Over 7000 current wetlands were mapped using standardised satellite imagery and a collection of point or polygon data. Historical extent was estimated from soil information refined using a digital elevation model. The current extent of wetlands is 10% of the historic extent, which is consistent with previous estimates.
   4. A classification was produced using fuzzy expert rules within a GIS to identify seven wetland classes: bog, fen, swamp, marsh, pakihi/gumland, seepage and inland saline. Swamps and pakihi/gumland are the most common, but the former has sustained the greatest reduction in area with only 6% of its historical extent remaining. A preliminary field assessment of classification accuracy in the Otago region found only 60% agreement, mainly because of the misclassification of marshes into swamps.
   5. Wetland condition was estimated using six measures of human disturbance (natural cover, human-made impervious cover, introduced fish, woody weeds, artificial drainage and nitrate leaching risk) applied at three spatial scales: the wetland's catchment, a 30-m buffer around the wetland and the wetland itself. Measures were transformed and combined into a single condition index. More than 60% of remaining wetlands had condition indices < 0.5, probably indicating moderate to severe degradation and loss of native biodiversity.
   6. Sites were ranked within each biogeographic unit using the wetland classification to ensure a representative set of wetland diversity. Rankings were determined by combining condition and complementarity to calculate conservation effectiveness that was then weighted by irreplaceability. Highest ranked sites in each biogeographic unit were usually the largest remaining wetlands that contained multiple wetland classes. This reflects their potential to protect a diverse range of wetland classes and a high proportion of the remaining habitat.

AB  - During the 1960s and early 1970s, the open system of the Rhine-Meuse estuary with a continuous salinity gradient was converted into a series of stagnant fresh water lakes separated by sluices from the North Sea coastal region 'Voordelta'. For the last 50 yr, the macrozoobenthic communities have been monitored intensively, and a large dataset is available on the responses of macrozoobenthic communities to strong disturbances (e. g. transitions in salinity, currents and dynamics) and gradual changes (e. g. changes in pollution and nutrient levels). The current study analyzes patterns and developments in macrozoobenthic compositions in terms of community descriptors (e. g. density, richness, evenness and diversity) and proportional distributions over feeding guilds (suspension feeders, deposit feeders, surface deposit feeders, herbivores, omnivores and predators). We compare historic and present situations and show that communities respond in similar ways (viz. peaking densities co-occurring with decreasing richness and diversity) to large disturbances and that the distribution over the feeding guilds indicates the state of the environment. Although the historic communities showed signs of system deterioration (mainly due to pollutants and nutrients), and at present, exotic species are abundant in the region, historic data were found to be valuable as a reference for what can be expected on the macrozoobenthic level following estuary restoration. This study showed the value of an undisturbed estuary in terms of total macrozoobenthic diversity compared to the series of fresh water lakes now separated from the Voordelta system and raises questions about future plans for a regulated salt water inlet that will be restricted to only 11.5 km inland.

AB  - We describe a tolerance classification based on the physicochemical parameters of water and habitat quality indices for native and introduced fish species in northeastern Spain. Although fish are widely used as biological indicators, the tolerance categories currently available for Spanish Mediterranean fish species are uncertain or subjective. We sampled 430 sites covering a wide range of river conditions, allowing us to develop tolerance scores based on a quantitative assessment. We used indirect ordination methods to establish stress gradients between the environmental variables compiled during the monitoring surveys carried out from 2002 to 2008. We then drew up a tolerance classification for the most common species in our dataset using weighted average inference models based on the following gradients: water quality and the state of physical habitat. The results were corroborated by multivariate gradient analysis. The fish scores obtained were applied to an independent dataset and a positive correlation was found between assessment protocols. Our results corroborate the use of fish, including exotic fish species, as biological indicators. Our findings may be used in a regional Index of Biotic Integrity and for the use of fish in bioassessment studies based on scores. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mullet (Mugil liza) were sampled in five different areas along the Guanabara Bay, southeastern Brazil, classified as non-contaminated, moderately contaminated and contaminated. Morphometric (Fulton condition factor, relative condition factor and weight to length scaling coefficient) and organosomatic (hepatosomatic index) indices of environmental stress were analysed. Fish from the differentially contaminated areas show statistically different Fulton and relative condition factors and hepatosomatic indices, but not the weight to length scaling coefficient. The Kn and the FCF followed the same trend, with fish from So Gon double dagger alo (1.07 +/- A 0.04 and 0.89 +/- A 0.03), Itaipu (0.84 +/- A 0.01 and 0.86 +/- A 0.01) and the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon (1.03 +/- A 0.01 and 0.87 +/- A 0.20) showing higher FCFs than fish from Mag, (0.96 +/- A 0.01 and 0.81 +/- A 0.01). Fish from Itaipu showed significantly higher HSI values than the other sampling sites (1.68 +/- A 0.07), with fish from Olaria and Ipiranga showing the lowest (1.56 +/- A 0.12 and 1.60 +/- A 0.07, respectively).

AB  - The importance of marinas as infrastructures for recreational boating is increasing substantially. However, information on their soft-bottom benthic communities, a key tool for managing programmes, is still scarce. We combined environment features with macro-and meiofaunal soft-bottom community information for assessing the ecological status of marinas with an integrative approach. To address this issue, we focused on eight marinas of the Southern Iberian Peninsula. Macro-and meiofauna data revealed high benthic heterogeneity at a spatial scale. The environmental variables which correlated best with macrofauna were mainly phosphorus, granulometry, and total organic carbon, and secondarily important variables were faecal coliforms, the biocide Irgarol, and heavy metals; total hydrocarbon concentration was also significant for meiofauna. Annelida was the dominant phylum in terms of number of species (37%) and abundance (66%) and were better descriptors of the environmental conditions than Arthropoda and Mollusca. Although identification to the species level is desirable and mandatory for assessing biological pollution, significant differences among marinas and correlations between fauna and abiotic variables were already detected at the level of family and order. This implies that biota assessment at higher levels may still be useful in monitoring programmes limited by time and budget constraints. The major novelty of this study lies in the development of an integrative assessment method based on the following selected ecological indicators: Marinas Environmental Pollution Index (MEPI), Biocontamination Index (BCI), macrofaunal biotic indices (AMBI, M-AMBI, BENTIX, MEDOCC and BENFES), macrofaunal taxa richness and Shannon-Wiener?s diversity, and nematode:copepod index. This approach was able to discriminate marinas of the Southern Iberian Peninsula based on their ecological status, which ranged from poor to good. The method can be useful to design standards for assigning ?sustainable quality seals? to those marinas with better values of ecological indicators.

AB  - Energy efficiency. is a very important indicator in the stability assessment of industrial processes. The optimal utilization of energy is a vital task today, as it determines the state of environment, technology and product price. The present work describes a method for the reduction of energy consumption by heat integration, in a system of bioreactors for the production of antibiotics. A scheme for heat integration of two heat reservoirs is suggested, ensuring performance at different time intervals. A mathematical model of the processes taking place in the two reactors is developed. On the base of the model, a strategy for optimal control of energy resources using heat integration of two heat reservoirs is proposed. The optimization task is formulated in terms of the Mixed Integral Non-Linear Programming (MINLP). The proposed method is applied to a real industrial process for antibiotics production.

AB  - A systematic study of the influence of solvent on the crystal packing behaviour of Reichardt's dye demonstrates that the structure of the assembly formed in the solid state depends on the nature of the solvent-solute interactions present in the solution phase. Apolar aprotic solvents lead to solvates with a hexagonal channel topology, but this supramolecular assembly is perturbed by the presence of aromatic or polar protic solvents.

AB  - Background. Since its discovery in 1935, numerous derivatives of testosterone have been synthesized, with the goals of prolonging its biological activity in vivo, producing orally active androgens, and developing products, commonly referred to as anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), that are more anabolic and less androgenic than the parent molecule.
   Objective: This article reviews the structure, biotransformation, and mechanism of action of testosterone and some of the most commonly used AAS. Clinical applications of the AAS are discussed, and guidelines and therapeutic maneuvers for minimizing their side effects are outlined.
   Methods: Literature for inclusion in this review was identified using the libraries of the University of Wisconsin Medical School and School of Pharmacy, the author's files, and searches of MEDLINE, Science Citation Index, Biological Abstracts, and Chemical Abstracts.
   Results: The myotrophic action of testosterone, and its derivatives and their stimulatory effects on the brain have led to widespread use of AAS by athletes and "recreational" drug users. Consequently, all AAS were classified as class III controlled substances in 1991. Nonetheless, AAS have shown benefit in a variety of human disorders, including HIV-related muscle wasting and other catabolic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe burn injuries, and alcoholic hepatitis. Because of their diverse biological actions, AAS have been used to treat a variety of other conditions, including bone marrow failure syndromes, constitutional growth retardation in children, and hereditary angioedema. AAS therapy is associated with various side effects that are generally dose related; therefore, illicit use of megadoses of AAS for the purpose of bodybuilding and enhancement of athletic performance can lead to serious and irreversible organ damage. The most common side effects of AAS are some degree of masculinization in women and children, behavioral changes (eg, aggression), hepatotoxicity, and alteration of blood lipid levels and coagulation factors.
   Conclusions: To minimize or avoid serious toxicities with AAS therapy, close medical supervision and periodic monitoring are important, with dose adjustment as appropriate to achieve the minimum effective dose. Given the biological effects and potential adverse effects of AAS, administration of these agents should be avoided in pregnant women, women with breast cancer or hypercalcemia, men with carcinoma of the prostate or breast, and patients with nephrotic syndromes or significant liver dysfunction.

AB  - This paper presents the application of a methodology in which the degree of anthropization is evaluated and related to the local environmental, morphological and demographic variables. The main goal is to achieve an integrated diagnosis of the current conditions of the coastal zone. The degree of anthropization was estimated using five variables: land use, anthropization on river banks, presence industry, presence and type of ports and presence of artificial structures. It was proposed to perform an anthropization assessment on coastal compartments, identified from satellite imagery. As a result, for each unit of analysis the degree of anthropization was found and classified as High, Moderate, Low or None. Then, the ecological variable was evaluated as the presence or absence of coastal ecosystems. The morphological variable was analysed according to the historical coastline displacement rates, and the demographic variable was determined from the population growth rates of the coastal communities within the compartments. The combination of these data allows an evaluation of the loss of the natural state of the coast. A case study on the Mexican coast was also carried out. The methodology can be applied at local and global scales, being accurate, repeatable and easily updated.

AB  - We study the application of plasmonic lattice modes of arrays of closely packed large metallic nanodisks for chemical and biological sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity and refractive index dynamic range. Our results show that by changing the refractive index of the environment the narrow spectral features associated with these collective modes can be shifted by about 250 nm, going from visible (similar to 650 nm) to infrared (similar to 900 nm) range without any mode degradation. We attribute this shift to the refractive-index enhancement of the superstrate collective modes of these arrays. This index enhancement allows the arrays to preserve their mode integrity within this range. We show that, because of this feature and the ultra-long range fields of these modes, such structures can offer a unique platform for biosensors based on dielectric-coated metallic nanoparticle arrays. In such structures, the dielectric layers are used to tune the collective modes of the arrays, protect them against environmental degradation, and to prepare bio-functionalized surfaces for certain biological targets. We demonstrate that such a platform allows us to set the operation wavelength of these sensors within the visible-infrared spectral range with sensitivity more than 520 nm/refractive index unit and a figure of merit of about 17.

AB  - Ecotoxicity of nanoparticles (50-100 nm) of Cu, Ni, and Zn has been assessed by changes in biological indicators of an ordinary chernozem (Haplic Chernozem (Loamic)) of Rostov-on-Don in the laboratory model experiment with incubation of soil samples with nanopowders of these elements added to soil in concentrations 100, 1000, and 10 000 mg/kg. The effects of biological indicators have been determined 10, 30, and 90 days after soil contamination. The addition of Cu, Ni, and Zn nanoparticles led to a decrease of the total number of bacteria, abundance of Azotobacter bacteria, catalase and dehydrogenase activities, and germination and length of roots of radish sown. Reliable cases of hormesis were not detected. Nanoparticles of Cu and Zn showed higher toxicity than Ni nanoparticles, and this was inconsistent with the hypothesis, according to which the toxicity of nanoparticles depended only on their size and did not depend on chemical nature of the element. According to the integral indicator of biological state of soil, maximal toxicity of Cu, Ni, and Zn nanoparticles was observed on the 30th day after contamination.

AB  - Following the advances in the field of the thermodynamics of far-from-equilibrium systems, several ecological orientors (indicators able to describe the stage and orientation of ecosystem development) incorporating entropy terms have been proposed. Although most of the proposed functions have a good theoretical basis and have proved to perform adequately as ecological indicators, their suitability as ecological orientors has yet to receive a full confirmation in real case studies. The aim of the present contribution is to examine how several entropy-based indicators (exergy, structural information, entropy production, specific entropy production and the Eco-exergy index) perform as orientors when applied to a special case of ecological succession, i.e. eutrophication, in a homogeneous set of shallow lakes lying along a trophic gradient, from oligotrophy to hyper-eutrophy. The results show that a coherent pattern of response emerge, which is also consistent with the classical ecological theory. In particular, the maximisation of storage and the minimisation of specific entropy production are confirmed as the most reliable principles of ecosystem development, whereas the maximisation of dissipation (as entropy production) appears as a debatable criterion of development.

AB  - Proposed United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations require that processed sludge, prior to disposal, must meet certain pathogen-reduction requirements.  The present study was conducted to evaluate reductions in pathogen-indicator bacteria in the sludges of six wastewater plants.  Five of the plants use extended aeration and oxidation ditches; the other is a trickling filter plant.  Fecal coliform, fecal streptococcus, and Salmonella were measured on all sludge samples.  Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, volatile suspended solids (VSS), and total suspended solids were also measured.  The fecal coliform log reductions/g VSS for all the extended aeration and oxidation ditch plants were greater than 1.76.  They varied from a log reduction of 1.76 to 4.21.  The fecal streptococci reductions for the same sludge were generally lower than the fecal coliform reductions.  The variations in the fecal streptococci log reductions in different plant sludges were from 0.87 to 2.73.  The Salmonella log reductions varied from 1.39 to 4.7 and paralleled the fecal coliform reductions.  The bacterial reductions were related to the plant design parameters.  A longer storage of sludge usually produced a larger log reduction of the indicator bacteria.  Generally, the extended aeration and oxidation ditch plants were meeting the proposed EPA class B Pathogen reduction criteria, a two-order reduction.

AB  - An index of coat condition can be a non-invasive tool for tracking health and stress at population level. Coat condition in ringtailed lemurs, Lemur catta, was recorded during September-November birth seasons of 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2001-2006 at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar. Condition was scored on a scale from 0: full, fluffy coat with guard hairs present, to 5: half or more of body hairless. Adult males did not differ overall from adult females. Coats were worse in adults than in 2-year-old subadults; 1-year-old juveniles were intermediate. Mothers and adult males lost coat condition as the season progressed: non-mother females maintained condition. Years 1999-2002 scored better coats than either 1996-1997 or 2003-2006. Lemurs in high population density areas had worse coats than in natural forest, but tourist presence had less effect than density. Monitoring coat condition in an apparently healthy population reveals differences between population segments, and in a forest fragment with limited immigration or emigration it can track progressive changes, correcting impressions of progressive improvement or degradation over time. Above all it gives a baseline for response to climate changes or eventual pathology. Am. J. Primatol. 71:191-198, 2009. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Effective plant protection practices and use of chemical pesticides are a prerequisite for maintaining yields of sufficient quality and quantity in conventional agriculture today. Despite regulatory efforts to ensure safe use, reports have indicated that residual amounts of pesticides and their metabolites occur in surface and ground water and may have non-target effects on aquatic organisms. The objective of the present study was to identify environmental challenges of pesticide use in the northern climate by evaluating long-term pesticide monitoring data compiled by the Norwegian Agricultural Environmental Monitoring Programme. Pesticide use data and pesticide concentrations measured in stream water from six small agricultural catchments in Norway were analysed. Observed trends in pesticide detection frequencies, measured concentrations and cumulative risk from the six monitoring sites were compared. The results demonstrated the need for continued focus on the herbicides metribuzin and aclonifen, and potential concerns regarding use of the fungicide prothioconazole and the insecticide imidacloprid. The six monitoring sites represented the diversity of intensively cropped areas in Norway and differed with respect to estimated cumulative risk. Vegetable and potato cropping areas showed not only the highest level of total environmental risk, but also a statistically significant decreasing trend over the monitoring period. Cereal cropping areas exhibited no statistically significant time-dependent trends in the studied parameters but did show an increase in fungicide use that requires continued attention. The need for risk assessment of mixture toxicity effects and improved monitoring strategy is also discussed. In conclusion, the present results imply that the current global focus on multiple stressors and mixture toxicity of pesticides in stream water is equally relevant in cold climatic conditions.

AB  - The Bundelkhand region situated in the central part of India has a long history of droughts. Although recurrent drought events in this region are controlled by the climatic variables, its unique soil, and physiography, the adversities associated with this devastating hazard largely depend upon the coping capacity of the local communities. Hence, estimating the socio-economic vulnerability of drought is necessary for adopting specific mitigation strategies to reduce the adverse impacts of drought. In this study, we explored the potentiality of geographical information system (GIS)-based analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for assessing drought risk in the Bundelkhand region from socio-economic perspective. The 10-day composite Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre Vegetation (SPOT-VGT) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (1998-2013) dataset was used for computing the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), a satellite-derived agricultural drought index for monitoring spatio-temporal dynamics of drought. NDVI maps of each year were assessed for mapping drought frequency. On the other hand, the socio-economic vulnerability of drought was estimated using five relevant parameters, viz. population density, marginalized population, cultivators, agricultural labours, and literacy rate, with employing AHP in a GIS platform. The pairwise comparison method was used for estimating the weights of each criterion. Most of the districts under hot semi-arid agro-climatic zone located in the Uttar Pradesh (UP) part of Bundelkhand are highly vulnerable to socio-economic drought, mainly due to high density of population and extensive agricultural activities. Out of the total area under highly vulnerable zone (27.8%), about 20% fall under semi-arid agro-ecological zone covering a large part of UP. The Madhya Pradesh (MP) part of Bundelkhand, located under the hot sub-humid agro-ecological zone, is comparatively less vulnerable to socio-economic drought. A substantial portion of this area is covered by forest, and the percentage of the total population involved in agricultural activities is relatively less. The study reveals that near about half of the total area is under threat to high (20.1%) and very high (29.1%) risk of socio-economic drought. Most of this drought risk zone falls under UP part of Bundelkhand. It is a matter of deep concern as this extensive fertile plain produces various cash crops, as well as cereals; therefore, high drought risk over this region needs a suitable strategy to mitigate the adversities of the hazard.

AB  - Jatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceae) is an evergreen tree traditionally used in popular medicine, and also as a promising source for bio-fuel production. The in vitro propagation of this species has been studied as an alternative to conventional methods such as cutting and seedling. In vitro culture environment consists on closed flasks, with high relative humidity, reduced gas exchanges and artificial temperature and luminosity conditions. These conditions may induce physiological and anatomical alterations in cultivated plants. The occurrence of anatomical alterations on the leaves of J. curcas was examined in plants cultivated both in vitro and ex vitro, under greenhouse conditions. The stomatal index was higher on the leaves from greenhouse plants. Mesophyll thickness did not differ, but the greenhouse leaves presented an additional palisade layer, which reflects the environmental influence on cell division. The cells of the chlorophyllous parenchyma of young plants grown in greenhouse conditions have larger chloroplasts than those of the plants grown in vitro. The chloroplasts of mature leaves are similar in height, but the mitochondria are smaller. Current results indicate that the leaves of J. curcas respond distinctly to both environments. It is necessary to adjust the abiotic conditions in vitro to avoid precocious senescence, diagnosed by chloroplasts and mesophyll degradation.

AB  - Quantitative analysis of the histopathological and immune parameters of bivalve Modiolus kurilensis collected from water areas with different level of ecotoxicological stress was performed. Significant differences between samples from polluted and non-polluted sites were revealed for total haemocyte count; percentage of agranulocytes; size and internal complexity of agranulocytes and granulocytes; phagocytic activity; percentage of NBT-positive cells; hemolytic activity and plasma protein concentration; percentage of the optical density of haemolymph major polypeptide bands at 55 kDa, 78 kDa, and 124 kDa; concretion coverage area in the kidney tubules; thickness of the tubular basement membrane; nephrocyte shape; and karyopyknosis of the kidneys; and hypervacuolisation; necrosis; karyopyknosis; haemocyte infiltration; fibrosis; and invasion of the digestive gland. Analysis of the global histopathological condition index based on the weighted indices also revealed that both the digestive gland and kidneys showed significantly greater histopathological changes in the bivalves collected from polluted water. Bivalve histopathology is an established tool in aquatic toxicology. However, it reflects a morphological picture of change, which, as a rule, can be clearly recorded only at the later stages of pathology, and in some cases, indicates an adaptation to stressors within the physiological norm. In this respect, a promising and highly sensitive biomarker of the functional state of bivalves, in terms of norm and pathology as well as their habitat, is the evaluation of immune status in combination with morphological changes. However, the use of different methods and scales of assessment and the diagnosis of biomarkers, characterised by different profiles of the stress response, makes it difficult to compare the results of different studies. We propose a reliable and powerful system for assessing the physiological state of bivalve molluscs, expressed in the integral health index (IHI) and based on the standardisation of the numerical values for all parameters that have significant differences between animals collected from impacted and non-impacted water areas. In our study, IHI calculated in three variants (for histopathological parameters, for immunological parameters, and in combination) showed the most significant differences in each of the cases, but the strongest difference (-4.07) was in calculating the total IHI, which included both the immune and histopathological parameters (p = 0.00005).

AB  - To date, European abalone aquaculture relies mostly on locally harvested fresh seaweeds which nutritional quality and abundance vary greatly, hence affecting abalone growth. Abalone artificial diets generally include fishmeal, limiting their utilization in ecologically sustainable aquaculture and affecting abalone quality and acceptance by the consumers. A six month feeding trial was conducted to assess the nutritional value of four different dried seaweed meals: Ulva lactuca (Chlorophyta), Gracilaria cornea (Rhodophyta), Laminaria digitata (Phaeophyta) and Palmaria palmata (Rhodophyta), as ingredients to all-vegetable-based formulated feeds for abalone Haliotis tuberculata coccinea (33.1 +/- 0.8 mm and 4.7 +/- 0.6 g). A mixed fresh algae diet of G. cornea and U. Ulva rigida, reared in an Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) system, served as control. Survival rates were very high (95-98%), regardless of the diet fed. Enriched fresh algae produced a significantly higher growth for H. tuberculata coccinea (169% weight gain) than all the artificial diets (49-84% WG). Comparison among abalone fed the different formulated diets showed that the inclusion of P. palmata improved growth, condition index and dietary protein utilization. On the contrary, the use of L. digitata markedly reduced the efficiency of dietary protein since the protein-related nutritional index (PER), the percentage of protein deposited in the foot muscle as well as the meat to shell ratio recorded for animals fed this diet were the lowest, despite a higher feed intake. Large differences were found in the FA profile of fresh algae as compared with the three formulated diets. The n-3/n-6 ratio was much higher in the fresh algae and, consequently, in the foot tissues of abalone fed this diet in comparison to the one of those fed the formulated ones. The elevated contents of 20:4n-6 in the abalone fed the experimental diets and 20:5n-3 in abalone fed the fresh algae, as well as their respective metabolites, suggest that abalone have the ability to desaturate and elongate LA to ARA and ALA to EPA. Further studies are required to improve the growth obtained with these vegetable based diets, especially concerning the use of different seaweed combinations and inclusion levels, as well as the diet processing methods to improve diet water stability.

AB  - The European soil policy is being focussed towards a more conscious and sustainable use of the soil, taking into account ecological, economical and societal dimensions. Living soil organisms are reliable bioindicators, as they provide the best reflection of the soil system, ecological services and ecosystem functioning therein. These most complex (bio)physical systems indicate, among others, the energy flow. Such processes can be described by rather simple power law relationships. In fact, the average body mass (dry weight) can be seen as an inherent species property, while population density is a much more flexible parameter reflecting ecosystem state. In this study, I review the interactions between these items in relation to feedbacks and conjectured relationships which can be seen as ecological networks. From this novel perspective, allometry can be used as an integrated measure for the anthropogenic influence on landscapes and related food webs. Allometry is, therefore, a perfect surrogate for land use intensity in modelling of field effects for restoration ecology and conservation biology. Robust correlations will be addressed between the density dependence of invertebrates and the ability of soil systems themselves to recover after disturbance. Quantitative indicators of soil community composition and related ecological services are proposed and their application for ecological risk assessment is illustrated.

AB  - During the study period, the general pattern of distribution, species composition, and abundance of phytoplankton differed from those recorded previously. The greatest changes are observed in the central part of the northern coast of Neva Bay. As previously, the phytoplankton biomass is about 1 mg L-1 in the Neva Bay near eastern station 7 on the northern coast, while it is 2-3 times higher than the previously observed biomass near station 12. On the whole, the phytoplankton biomass in this area is 6.1 +/- 2.9 mg L-1 in 2011-2015, which corresponds to the eutrophic level of productivity. The phytoplankton biomass of 15.8 mg L-1, which was recorded in late July 2015 and was dominated by algae Chlorophyta, characterizes this area of the Neva Bay as highly eutrophic. Against the background of currently observed processes of eutrophication in the Neva Bay and the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland, the summer phytoplankton (late July-early August) is dominated by different groups of algae. The mean biomass is 6-7 mg L-1 in the most productive area of the internal estuary (station 19). Periods of cyanobacterial water blooming at a biomass of over 22 mg L-1 are also most often recorded here.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommends the use of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and enterococci as indicators of enteric pathogens in fresh waters; however, fecal coliform analyses will remain important by virtue of the large amount of historic data collected in prior years. In this study, we attempted, in a real-world situation (i.e., a rural inland watershed in the Piedmont of South Carolina) to compare different bacterial indicators and methods to one another. We compared fecal coliforms, enumerated by membrane filtration with E. coli, enumerated by a commercialized enzyme substrate method and observed E. coli/fecal coliform ratios of 1.63 and 1.2 for two separate tests. In the same watershed, we observed an E. coli/fecal coliform ratio of 0.84 when we used the commercialized enzyme substrate method for both enumerations. Given these results, users of such data should exercise care when they make comparisons between historic membrane filtration data and data acquired through the use of the more modern enzymatic methods. Some sampling and side-by-side testing between methods in a specific watershed may be prudent before any conversion factors between old and new datasets are applied.

AB  - A total of 57 stonefly species have been recorded in the Hron River. The natural gradient (slope and stream width) and pollution gradient of the river were defined using CCA based on physical, chemical and stonefly data. Stonefly metrics (abundance, richness/diversity, sensitivy/tolerance and functional metrics) were used to estimate the quality of the Hron River and the degree of proximity to its natural state. Similar results were obtained using two different methods. The first method was based on the homogeneity of variance and the interquartile range of different groups of stretches of the Hron River and the second was based on deviations from the expected values of biological metrics in a given stretch of the river. These values continuously decreased with increasing distance from the spring area, with the exception of the saprobic index, which increased in a downstream direction, and the stonefly average score, which did not change significantly along the whole river flow. The Stonefly Average Score (SAS) metric is universal for a variety of habitats such as the Hron River upstream and downstream, and is a reliable indicator of water quality and the natural course of a stream.

AB  - This paper aims at demonstrating the significance of biochar risk evaluation and reviewing risk evaluation from the aspects of pyrolysis process, feedstock, and sources of hazards in biochar and their potential effects and the methods used in risk evaluation. Feedstock properties and the resultant biochar produced at different pyrolysis process influence their chemical, physical, and structural properties, which are vital in understanding the functionality of biochar. Biochar use has been linked to some risks in soil application such as biochar being toxic, facilitating GHGs emission, suppression of the effectiveness of pesticides, and effects on soil microbes. These potential risks originate from feedstock, contaminated feedstock, and pyrolysis conditions that favor the creation of characteristics and functional groups of this nature. These toxic compounds formed pose a threat to human health through the food chain. Determination of toxicity levels is a first step in the risk management of toxic biochar. Various sorption methods of biochar utilized low-cost adsorbents, engineered surface functional groups, and nZVI modified biochars. The mechanisms of organic compound removal was through sorption, enhanced sorption, modified biochar, postpyrolysis thermal air oxidation and that of PFRs degradation was through activation, photoactive functional groups, magnetization, and hydrothermal synthesis. Emissions of GHGs in soils amended with biochar emanated through physical and biotic mediated mechanisms. BCNs have a significance in reducing the health quotient indices for PTEs risk contamination by suppressing cancer risk arising from consumption of contaminated food. The degree of environmental risk assessment of HM pollution in biomass and biochars has been determined by using potential ecological risk index and RAC while organic contaminant degradation by EPFRs was considered when assessing the environmental roles of biochar in regulating the fate of contaminants removal. The magnitude of technologies' net benefit must be considered in relation to the associated risks.

AB  - Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) were among the top priority Constituents of Potential Concern (CoPC) in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) effort to set ecological soil-screening (Eco-SSL) values. Search strategies, acceptance criteria, and evaluation procedures were developed to ad-dress effects on plants, invertebrates, and wildlife. Systematic literature searches were conducted to obtain all relevant information on toxic response of terrestrial plants, invertebrates, and wildlife exposed to PAHs. More than 325 papers on PAHs were reviewed. Only 14 papers (one plant, three invertebrate, and ten wildlife) met the minimum criteria for use. Only eight PAH analytes had data that qualified for use in deriving Plant-, Invertebrate-, or Wildlife-SSLs. Only one SSL, (invertebrate, fluorene) could be derived based on the available data using the USEPA draft criteria. Rapid volatilization of lower molecular weight PAHs, generally low toxicity of persistent PAHs, limited potential for uptake by plants, binding to soil organic matter that lowers bioavailability, and low bioaccumulation by invertebrates may explain the general absence of documented adverse effects among terrestrial receptors exposed to PAHs.

AB  - Protected areas (PA) provide conservation benefits and ecosystem services that spill over the boundaries of jurisdictions to other regions. In this paper we analyse the foundations of and design options for ecological fiscal transfers (EFT) that may internalize such positive external effects. We propose a model for integrating ecological indicators into the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system between federal and state-level governments in Germany. Our approach is performance oriented and would thus compensate those states that designate an above-average share of their area for nature conservation purposes. The suggested EFT design builds upon the existing fiscal equalization system and complies with the legal requirements for indicators determining fiscal needs. We employ an econometric analysis to demonstrate that, on average, sparsely populated states in Germany provide more PA per capita and would thus be eligible for increased fiscal transfers. A quantitative model of the fiscal transfer scheme is then used to estimate the marginal financial effects of integrating ecological indicators into federal state fiscal relations in Germany. Moving beyond the specific case presented, we discuss the implications in terms of the specific role of EFT as a policy instrument within the broader conservation policy mix.

AB  - Aquatic species' tolerances to overall human disturbance are key components of biological assessments of aquatic ecosystems. These tolerance classifications enable development of metrics for use in multimetric indexes, such as the index of biotic integrity (IBI). Usually, species are classified as being tolerant, moderately tolerant, or intolerant (sensitive) to human disturbance. Traditionally, for fish-based IBIs, these assignments are based on a combination of professional judgment and information from state fish books. We used fish and amphibian species data in conjunction with chemical, physical, and landscape indicators of human disturbance collected at 1,001 stream and river sites in 12 western states (USA) sampled by the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program in 2000-2004. Using principal components analyses, we created synthetic disturbance variables for water nutrients, site-scale physical habitat, catchment-scale land use, and overall human disturbance. We calculated species' tolerance values for the four synthetic disturbance variables as weighted (by relative abundances) averages plus SDs. For each site, we used the tolerance values (based on the overall synthetic disturbance variables) and relative abundances of species to calculate an assemblage tolerance index (ATI) score. We discuss (1) bow the tolerance values could be used in establishing species tolerance classifications appropriate for regional species pools and (2) potential application of the ATI to the IBI and to bioassessments in general.

AB  - Seagrasses help mitigate climate change by capturing and storing carbon for a very long time. Despite their significance, multiple threats are putting pressure on this valuable habitat. Seagrass conservation and restoration is essential to maintain the carbon sequestration service, along with the other ecosystem services (e.g., fisheries production). Information on the status of seagrass habitat is required to enable proactive management strategies. In this study, we assessed the ecological status of seagrass meadows in Indonesia, a globally significant hotspot of blue carbon habitat, using five resilience parameters: seagrass species richness, seagrass cover, macroalgal cover, epiphyte cover, and water transparency. We collected data on these parameters from 18 locations across Indonesia and developed the Seagrass Ecological Quality Index (SEQI, range 0-1) that summarises the parameters into a standard seagrass assessment. We recorded that Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides were the most common species in the sampling locations. Seagrass cover was on average 39 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- SE) which was lower than measured 3 years before (46%). Macroalgal cover and epiphyte cover were relatively low with mean values 10 +/- 1.8% and 22 +/- 4.4% respectively. Most locations had clear water. Our analysis showed that Indonesia's seagrass meadows are generally in moderate condition, indicated by the mean value of SEQI 0.68 +/- 0.02. These findings provide a baseline for seagrass conservation and management. It enables setting up of specific goals for management action plans, at both the local, national and international level, and where appropriate, track the progress of management actions based on threat mitigation or restoration over time. The SEQI is a useful tool to summarise the condition of tropical seagrass meadows in Indonesia and could be applied across Southeast Asia or the Tropical Indo-Pacific bioregion.

AB  - Due to climate change and urbanization, runoff events will become more frequent, resulting in increased potential for flooding and soil erosion. To understand the hydrologic impacts of various climate change and urbanization scenarios in the state of Maryland, this study assesses the frequency, intensity, and associated runoff conditions of index storm events as hydrologic indicators for stormwater management. The analyzed events are defined as capture depth, that is, the depth of event precipitation that accounts for a specified fraction (85%, 90%, 95%, and 99%) of total rainfall when all event depths are ranked and cumulated. Four representative watersheds (area of approximately 3 km2) are analyzed across four populous counties in Maryland. A statistically significant increasing trend in the frequency of these events is observed during the historical period 1981-2015. For the future period 2016-2035, an ensemble of bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models shows an increase of 1%-5% in mean precipitation. Two different downscaling methods are applied to generate time series of future event precipitation for the study watersheds from the CMIP models: change factor (CF) and multivariate adaptive constructed analogs (MACA). Modest increases in the frequency of events in the 85%-99% range of capture depth are observed across all counties. Runoff associated with events greater than the 85% capture depth is computed using the Natural Resources Conservation Service curve number method. Both the CF and MACA projected future precipitation time series are used to calculate the response to 24-h precipitation under two scenarios: (1) climate change, and (2) climate change plus urbanization. Runoff frequency distribution modeled under both scenarios indicate that climate change is more influential than urbanization in this region. In addition, storage volumes for enhanced bioretention using CF-based future climate projections show that both climate change and urbanization have similar potential to affect stormwater management costs.

AB  - Variations in the microbial biomass and the in situ metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) due to climatic conditions were determined in a typical soil from the Argentine Rolling Pampa. Microbial C was evaluated by fumigation - incubation and qCO(2) was calculated using soil respiration in the field. An inverse relationship between microbial C and soil temperature was fitted to a model (r(2) = 0.90, P = 0.01). No significant association with the soil water content was detected because the soil was generally near field capacity and thus water availability did not limited microbial growth and activity. Values of qCO(2) increased (r(2) = 0.89, P = 0.01) as the result of metabolic activation, likely induced by a higher maintenance energy requirement at high temperatures. The highest values of qCO(2) were obtained when microbial C was the lowest, which was attributed to self consumption of microbial C in the presence of high temperatures. Consequently, microbial C was generally higher (P = 0.05) in winter than in summer. Therefore, when microbial C is used as an index of soil biological activity, the influence of temperature should be taken into account.

AB  - Regime shifts are abrupt transitions between alternate ecosystem states including desertification in arid regions due to drought or overgrazing. Regime shifts may be preceded by statistical anomalies such as increased autocorrelation, indicating declining resilience and warning of an impending shift. Tests for conditional heteroskedasticity, a type of clustered variance, have proven powerful leading indicators for regime shifts in time series data, but an analogous indicator for spatial data has not been evaluated. A spatial analog for conditional heteroskedasticity might be especially useful in arid environments where spatial interactions are critical in structuring ecosystem pattern and process. We tested the efficacy of a test for spatial heteroskedasticity as a leading indicator of regime shifts with simulated data from spatially extended vegetation models with regular and scale-free patterning. These models simulate shifts from extensive vegetative cover to bare, desert-like conditions. The magnitude of spatial heteroskedasticity increased consistently as the modeled systems approached a regime shift from vegetated to desert state. Relative spatial autocorrelation, spatial heteroskedasticity increased earlier and more consistently. We conclude that tests for spatial heteroskedasticity can contribute to the growing toolbox of early warning indicators for regime shifts analyzed with spatially explicit data.

TI  - Operationalization of the Pressure-State-Response Model in the Study of Ecological Value of Rural Communes Illustrated on the Example of Lublin Voivodeship

AB  - Local governments are obliged by law tasks assigned to them to take a lot of pro-ecology actions. Authorities' activities should be included in the long-term development strategy of a municipality together with measures for the protection of environment taken by other local actors. The effectiveness of these measures depends on proper recognition of the need to protect environment. The reaction of local government should correspond to the identified pressures on environment and serve keeping it in at least unchanged state. Effective environmental policy pursued by local authorities depends largely on systematic monitoring of its condition and the degree of human pressure. Therefore, appropriate monitoring instruments in the form of indicators measuring the pressure, state and response to changes in environment are essential.
   The following paper presents a proposal of indicators assessing pressure, state and response to environmental changes in a rural municipality. The indicators can and should be used to:
   evaluate the effectiveness of environmental policies of individual municipalities,
   evaluate environmental values of rural municipalities,
   determine strategic areas due to environmental values,
   conduct effective interregional policy of environmental protection and distribution of measures allowing more optimal protection of environment,
   indicate problem municipalities as far as environment is concerned, facing particular difficulties in the implementation of sustainable development policies,
   inform local community about environmental issues in the municipality.
   During the operationalization of the P-S-R model two major problems of its full implementation were recognised: limited availability of mass statistics data for the level of municipalities hinders detailed analysis of the PSR model for individual elements of environment: for example, pressure on soil-soil condition-soil protection, limited scope of the monitoring of environment for rural/urban-rural municipalities (short-term study, financial constraints of monitoring and lack of current representative research of the state of soils for example).
   Conducted analysis and undertaken project activities in the designation of the indicators of P-S-R for municipalities allow to formulate the following recommendations:
   the need to adapt CSO LDB to the needs of monitoring local sustainable development policy,
   propose financial preferences for supporting wastewater management in rural municipalities in Lublin Voivodeship (apart from the matters of information noise in the case of the indicator of the length of the sewerage system, e.g. in the form of commonly occurring solutions like home wastewater treatment plants because of which the indicator itself does not fully illustrate the state of access to wastewater treatment), there is still a very low level of rural municipal sewerage as compared to the urban municipalities of the voivodeship and rural municipalities of the country,
   the need to draw the central government's attention to the need to increase rather than reduce the possibility of monitoring the state of environment by institutions set up to assess the needs of local environment,
   universal application of the framework of PSR method to assess ecological values of municipalities.

AB  - Around the world, woodlands have been cleared for agricultural production and their bird communities are in decline. To reverse these declines and foster bird community resilience, government agencies, non-government organizations, and private landholders have implemented restoration actions, commonly including grazing exclusion and replanting. These actions are rarely implemented in an experimental framework, making it difficult to measure their effectiveness. However, ecological monitoring datasets, and citizen science datasets in particular, can provide useful opportunities for measuring effects of restoration actions and act as a baseline upon which adaptive management can be built. We examined the effect of revegetation actions on the terrestrial bird community in Australia's south-eastern temperate woodlands using long-term, community-collected monitoring datasets. We explored the response of bird abundance, species richness, and a newly developed index of ecological community condition, to grazing exclusion and replanting over a 20-year period using an uneven control-impact study design. Grazing exclusion plus replanting had strong positive effects on all three bird community metrics, which increased with time, compared to control sites where neither action occurred. Bird abundance, but not species richness or community condition, increased over time with grazing exclusion alone, while control sites with continued grazing and no replanting showed no change in all three measures. We demonstrate that citizen science datasets with imperfect study designs can be used to gain insights on conservation action effectiveness and highlight the value of metrics that capture information about community condition more precisely than just abundance or species richness.

AB  - Radiometric analysis of SPOT-VEGETATION (VGT) images acquired over Australia was carried out as a basis for the development of an algorithm to map burnt areas in woodland savannas. We analysed the variability of daily ground reflectance and its relationship with illumination and viewing geometry. Finding that the geometrical effects can be parameterised by the phase angle (angle between the illumination and the viewing directions) and the viewing zenith angle (VZA), we fit a simple linear model to the observations. The results show that about 60-70% of the variability in the daily reflectance is caused by geometrical effects. The residual 30-40% of the variability is probably due to changes in vegetation condition, such as senescence, and residual atmospheric contamination. We tested temporal compositing as a practical method of reducing the variability in the reflectance whilst retaining the burnt area signal. We inspected the radiometric and geometrical effects of four different compositing criteria and showed that minimum near infrared (NIR) is the most appropriate for burnt area mapping over the study area. In order to analyse the sensitivity of the VGT spectral bands and derived indices to changes induced by fire, we extracted burnt area spectral signatures for different vegetation types. The persistence of the burnt signal, as observed with each band and index, was analysed. Among the bands, NIR is shown to be the most sensitive to fire occurrence. There is a clear drop in the reflectance immediately after the fire and it remains very low during subsequent weeks, On the other hand, the burnt signal in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) band is showed to be strongly dependent on the vegetation cover type and on the age of the burnt area, Among the indices, the Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI) is identified as the most suitable for detecting changes induced by fire on the vegetation cover.

AB  - Smallholder farming in southern African needs climate-smart agricultural approaches to adapt to current climate stress and climate variability, and increasing risk of these under future global climate change. There are a range of climate-smart systems that have been proposed and conservation agriculture (CA) based on minimum soil disturbance, crop residue retention and crop rotation is one of them. A CA trial established in 2007 in Malawi was used during cropping-seasons 2015-2016 (El Nino) and 2016-2017 (La Nina) to assess the performance and resistance of different CA maize systems under climate-related stress at anthesis, a climate sensitive growth stage. Large in-situ rainout shelters were used to simulate increased daytime temperatures and in-season droughts of 18-19 days and 27 days. CA systems better resisted climate stress around anthesis than conventional tillage practices as CA systems showed greater resistance to drought than conventional practice. This was expressed by higher CA maize grain yields, biomass yields or harvest index under conditions of natural (El Nino) or 19 day simulated drought. However, under 27 day drought simulation the resistance benefit of CA was no-longer significant. Crop diversification improved the resistance of CA systems to climate stress, more so when diversification was over time (rotation) than in space (intercropping). In all years CA systems substantially out yielded conventional practice, this highlights the benefits of medium-term (eight years) CA management before the rainout shelter experiment started. Our results from natural and simulated drought conditions confirm that CA systems can increase adaptive capacity to an increased risk of climate stress associated with projected global climate change. We show that large-scale rainout shelters are a useful means of accelerating our understanding of how long-term agricultural management practices can enhance resistance to climate stresses.

AB  - With data from Taiwanese jiggers that targeted the Argentine shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) in the southwest Atlantic between 1986 and 2010, we used log-transformed catch per unit of effort (logU) as an index of the abundance of this squid to explore squid recruitment strength in response to environmental conditions. The logU was negatively correlated with sub-surface seawater temperature (at a depth of 5 m) observed during February and April on the southern Patagonian shelf during the fishing season. The logU was also correlated with the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), positively correlated in December of the fishing season and in March and May of the previous 2 years, and negatively correlated in November and December of the previous 2 years. A generalized linear model selected 4 environmental variables as predictors of annual catches that accounted for 83% catch variation: AAOs in November and March of the previous 2 years and subsurface seawater temperatures in March of the current and previous year in the southern location. The AAO would not directly affect the squid abundance more than 1 year later and biotic and abiotic linkages between atmospheric circulation patterns and stock fluctuations are not understood.

AB  - We fitted hierarchical Bayesian models to coded wire tag data and studied the variation in the probability that male coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch released at 72 locations in 41 basins and 8 regions mature early. We used data from at least 10 cohorts at each location; therefore, our analysis was both spatially and temporally more extensive than those conducted previously. We accounted for variation in the log-odds of early maturation with (1) mean smolt weight, (2) covariates (developed specifically for this paper) that indexed marine environmental conditions during the first few months after out-migration, and (3) hierarchical means that identified each cohort's release location, basin, and region. There was posterior support for location-specific effects of smolt size on the probability of early maturation across the geographic range of this species, but not for location-specific marine environmental effects. Nevertheless, substantial residual variation remained from our final analysis; we argue that this variation can be attributed to environmental effects that were not detected here. The spatial variation in the probability of early maturation was dominated by region-level differences in freshwater rearing conditions, as evidenced by positive relationships between mean smolt weight and the expected log-odds of early maturation at all levels in the geographic hierarchy. We identified more than one such relationship, and the differences between the center and the edges of the geographic range are considered here. Ultimately, since we defined regions on the basis of existing evolutionarily significant units for coho salmon, our results further support the use of these units for management and conservation purposes.

AB  - Life-history studies provide a global framework for comparison of fish species responses and trade-offs facing ecological and environmental constrains. A broad comparison among fishes' early growth and condition traits is performed in order to determine ecological patterns of early development regarding latitudinal distribution, habitat use and life-history strategies. Based on Winemiller and Rose (1992) classification of life-history strategies, data on early growth and condition indices of 46 fish species worldwide was analysed. Available information on fishes' early features, namely first year length percentage (relative to species maximum theoretical length), age at maturation and Fulton's condition index (K), provided a good segregation of species by latitudinal distribution and habitat use, and evidenced the categories of the three-endpoint model. Higher larvae and juvenile growth rates and condition indices (K, mean RNA-DNA ratios and protein contents) were associated with tropical and temperate fish species that occur in complex or variable habitats (respectively coral reefs and estuaries). These species selected for the opportunistic and periodic strategies, investing highly in rapid growth in order to increase survival probability to counter high mortality rates during early stages or unstable habitat conditions. Later age at maturation, slower larvae and juvenile growth as well as lower mean condition indices were consistent with fish species from more stable or predictable environments, as polar regions and freshwater habitats, which selected for the equilibrium strategy. Nonetheless, differences in energy allocation strategies during early stages were not observed, evidencing the scarcity of available data regarding condition indices and/or the importance of integrating life-history intermediate strategies. Future research into condition indices and other physiological processes, for a broader set of species and for a wider latitudinal and habitat range including seasonal variability (particularly for species from tropical and polar regions), is essential to better understand or test current theories of species ecological patterns. The use of direct quantitative measures of young fishes' metabolic investment and fitness constitutes a new approach for life-history studies, and should be fundamental for predicting species' responses to acute environmental or human constrains, especially in a global climate change scenario that is expected to affect distribution and abundance of fish species worldwide.

AB  - The federal program on the formation of comfortable urban environment was initiated in Russia in 2017. Its aim is to improve local and public territories. The program implies the active involvement of citizens, which is taken into account in the Urban Environment Quality Index. On the basis of an empirical study, conducted using mass survey and expert interview methods in the towns of the Arkhangelsk Oblast, the authors analyze a degree of civic participation of residents in the implementation of projects to create a comfortable urban environment and assess the efficiency of existing mechanisms of interaction between society and government. We assume the theoretical provision that a social activity is the citizens' work to transform the environment, carried out under the influence of external and internal factors. External factors include activities of municipal authorities to inform town residents about the program for creating a comfortable urban environment and to involve them in the implementation of projects. Internal factors are citizens' personal interest and their meaningful participation in the program. The results of the sociological survey indicate a high potential for citizens' social activity, which is a necessary condition for effective interaction between government and society and a successful implementation of the program. However, practical participation of urban residents remains weak. The main reasons are the lack of citizens' awareness about the implemented program, the lack of clear ways of interaction between government and society, as well as an understanding of the program's fundamental principles, which, in turn, leads to passivity and distrust toward the authorities. The authors conclude that, in order to increase civic engagement, we need a system of measures, which would allow adjusting the existing communication means between government and society and increasing the effectiveness of the program on the formation of a comfortable urban environment.

AB  - The objective was to use scrotal infrared digital thermography to evaluate effects of thermal stress on semen quality of Murrah buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) breeding bulls. Ejaculates from 109 Murrah bulls maintained at three semen stations were evaluated for: ejaculate volume, sperm concentration (SCON), initial motility (IM), percent live sperm (LIVE), acrosome integrity of fresh semen (AIFS), plasma membrane integrity of fresh semen (PMIFS), head abnormalities of fresh semen (HAFS), midpiece abnormalities of fresh semen (MPAFS), tail abnormalities of fresh semen (TAFS), post-thaw motility (PTM), acrosome integrity of post-thawed semen (AIPT) and plasma membrane integrity of post-thawed semen (PMIPT). Scrotal and ocular surface temperatures were acquired during rainy, winter and summer seasons, using an FLIR i5 infrared camera. Thermographic images were analyzed with Quick Report 1.2 SP2 software and temperature data acquired. Daily mean temperature and mean relative humidity were used to determine the temperature-humidity index (THI). Environmental factors were analyzed using CORR to determine collinearity among independent variables. There was a high correlation among THI, proximal, mid and distal scrotal temperatures (r >= 0.73). Therefore, distal pole temperature (DPT), THI, temperature gradient (TG) and ocular temperature (OcT) were used in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and in regression analysis of dependent variables. The THI, DPT, TG and OcT had significant influences on sperm abnormalities, acrosome and plasma membrane integrity of fresh as well as post-thawed semen. The TG had significant effects on LIVE and SCON. All semen quality parameters were predicted (regression analysis) as a function of the three independent factors. We concluded that scrotal infrared thermography was useful for assessing influences of thermal stress and environmental factors on characteristics of buffalo semen.

AB  - The results of the study of the ecological-hydrogeochemical state of the underground waters of the Chop-Mukachevo basin and the identification of its spatio-temporal changes in the chemical composition using GIS facilities are presented. The methodology for processing the initial hydrogeological data on the basis of geographic information technologies has been improved and tested on the example of spatio-temporal changes in the indicators of chemical composition. A specialized geoinformation database of the chemical composition of groundwater has been created. The evaluation of spatio-temporal patterns of changes in the chemical composition using statistical analysis, cartographic modeling, and spatial analysis in GIS, identified areas with increased salinity and hardness of groundwater. Based on an integrated approach, zoning was performed and the current hydrogeochemical state of the groundwater resources of the study area was evaluated.

AB  - Ecological indicators are commonly used to provide synoptic information about the state of ecosystems. Their main attribute is that they combine a range of environmental factors in a single value, which is thought useful for management and for making ecological-quality concepts easily understandable by the general public. In some European countries, the trophic state of marine and coastal waters is characterized using the trophic index TRIX. We used TRIX in the studies of the Mar Menor coastal lagoon ( southeast Spain) and the Mondego estuary ( northwest Portugal). These areas are under environmental stress, and eutrophication processes have been monitored in recent years. The results demonstrate the inefficacy of TRIX as a trustworthy tool to classify eutrophication status in estuarine waters. The causes of the malfunction of the index are discussed, and we suggest that, if the index is to be applied over wide areas, the classification criteria will have to be adapted to specific environments.

AB  - We surveyed aquatic macrophyte diversity and abundance at 20 sites along the main channel of the Cuyahoga River and its tributaries. These sites included 12 sites in the watershed at which an Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) for fish communities deviated significantly from a value predicted by a statistical model of landscape urbanization and stream habitat quality. These sites were classified as Best of the Best, Worst of the Best, Best of the Worst and Worst of the Worst among 164 sites within the Cuyahoga basin. In order to characterize a site, we collected data on the physical features of the stream and quantified the species abundance of aquatic macrophytes; in a 100 m transect. Within each transect, measurements of stream width, bankfull width, stream depth, bankfull depth, and canopy cover were recorded every 10 m. Nitrate, phosphate, and ammonia content of water samples were also assayed. The quality of stream habitat for each site was quantified using the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI). Strong significant correlations between the measure of stream depth and stream width as well as canopy coverage and bankfull width were observed. A weak significant correlation was found between IBI and QHEI scores. Additional analysis showed that water chemistry did not influence QHEI or IBI scores. An analysis of variance indicated that the IBI scores significantly differed among site types. Macrophytes were discovered at seven of the 20 sites with an overall richness of 11 species among all sites. The most common aquatic macrophytes were: Elodea canadensis L, Sparganium americanum Nutt, and Sagittaria latifolia Wild. Results demonstrate that physical stream characteristics are strong indicators of fish population integrity, but are not necessarily indicative of aquatic macrophyte assemblages. Storms severely impacted many streams during the survey, possibly altering macrophyte assemblages. Further surveys should be undertaken at additional sites within the Cuyahoga River watershed for a comprehensive assessment of aquatic macrophytes.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency held an international two-day workshop in June 2018 to deliberate possible performance targets for non-regulatory fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) air sensors. The need for a workshop arose from the lack of any market-wide manufacturer requirement for documented sensor performance evaluations, the lack of any independent third party or government-based sensor performance certification program, and uncertainty among all users as to the general usability of air sensor data. A multi-sector subject matter expert panel was assembled to facilitate an open discussion on these issues with multiple stakeholders. This summary provides an overview of the workshop purpose, key findings from the deliberations, and considerations for future actions specific to sensors. Important findings concerning PM2.5 and O-3 sensors included the lack of consistent performance indicators and statistical metrics as well as highly variable data quality requirements depending on the intended use. While the workshop did not attempt to yield consensus on any topic, a key message was that a number of possible future actions would be beneficial to all stakeholders regarding sensor technologies. These included documentation of best practices, sharing quality assurance results along with sensor data, and the development of a common performance target lexicon, performance targets, and test protocols.

AB  - Shipping is an important source of pollution affecting both atmospheric and aquatic environments. To allow for efficient mitigation of environmental degradation, it is essential to know the extent of the impacts of shipping in relation to other sources of pollution. Here, we give a perspective on a holistic approach to studies of the environmental impacts of operational shipping through presentation of an assessment framework developed and applied on a case of shipping in the Baltic Sea. Through transfer of knowledge and concepts, previously used in assessments of air pollution, now applied to assessments of marine pollution and underwater noise, the horizon of understanding of shipping-related impacts is significantly improved. It identifies the main areas of environmental degradation caused by shipping and potential improvements through legislation and technological development. However, as the vast majority of contaminants discharged into the sea are not routinely monitored and assessed, the links between pressure of contaminants from shipping and environmental state and impacts will not be caught in the current environmental regulatory frameworks.

AB  - Chemical ecology has been suggested as a less time-consuming and more cost-efficient monitoring tool of seagrass ecosystems than traditional methods. Phenolic chemistry in Zostera marina samples was analyzed against latitude, sea depth, sample position within a seagrass meadow (periphery or center) and wave exposure. Multivariate data analysis showed that rosmarinic acid correlated moderately positively with depth, while the flavonoids had an overall strong negative correlation with increasing depth-possibly reflecting lack of stress-induced conditions with increasing depth, rather than a different response to light conditions. At a molecular level, the flavonoids were separated into two groups; one group is well described by the variables of depth and wave exposure, and the other group that was not well described by these variables-the latter may reflect biosynthetic dependencies or other unrevealed factors. A higher flavonoid/rosmarinic acid ratio was seen in the periphery of a seagrass meadow, while the contrary ratio was seen in the center. This may reflect higher plant stress in the periphery of a meadow, and the flavonoid/rosmarinic acid ratio may provide a possible molecular index of seagrass ecosystem health. Further studies are needed before the full potential of using variation in phenolic chemistry as a seagrass ecosystem monitoring tool is established.

AB  - The objective of this study was to quantify chemical and biological responses to an experimentally increased nutrient input to an open coastal planktonic ecosystem and to contribute to a scientific concept and credible indicators for managing nutrient supply to coastal waters. Data were derived in a 5 year fertilisation experiment of a tidal driven coastal lagoon at the outer coast off Central Norway (63 degrees 36'N, 9 degrees 33'E), with a surface area of 275.000 m(2), volume of 5.5 mill m(3), mean depth of 22 m and a water exchange rate of 0.19 day(-1). The lagoon was fertilised in the summer season 1998 and 1999, while summer seasons 1996-97 and 2000 and inflowing water were used as unfertilised references. Most measured chemical and biological variables showed linear responses with an increasing loading rate of inorganic N and P (L-N and L-P, respectively). PUN, POP and POC (<200 mu m) responded significantly (P < 0.05) as did chlorophyll a and phytoplankton C. DIN and DIP remained, however, constant and independent of L-N and L-P respectively (P> 0.05) as did heterotrophic biomass (P> 0.05). We evaluate the response variables assuming a stepwise incorporation process of nutrients in the planktonic ecosystem and how that will interact with biological response times and water dilution rates. We suggest that PUN is a credible indicator of both chemical and ecological states of the planktonic ecosystem and that natural background and upper critical concentrations are 46 and 88 mg PON m(-3), respectively. The study was supported by data from mesocosms. We discuss the scientific relevance of our suggestions, how results can be extrapolated to a broader geographical scale, and we propose a science-based concept for the management of nutrient emission to open coastal waters.

FX  - The experimental work was undertaken by Norwegian partners in COM WEB, a project of the EU-MAST programme, and a member of the ELOISE and the MARICULT umbrella programmes, which was funded by the EC MAST Programme (MAST3-0T96-0052) and Norsk Hydro ASA, and later by the Research Council of Norway allowing a second year of fertilisation. The field work is a result of 5 years of hard work of all of the enthusiastic hard working project participants at Trondhjem Biological Station and other colleagues who were involved in the experiments carried out in Hopavaagen, Central Norway (63 degrees 36' N, 9 degrees 33' E) through 1996-2000. The comprehensive basis of results gathered, together with results from a main mesocosm experiment have unconditionally enhanced our understanding of coastal eutrophication, even though it took time to pursue.

AB  - We evaluated the ecosystem regime shift in the main basin of Lake Huron that was indicated by the 2003 collapse of alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) and dramatic declines in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) abundance thereafter. We found that the period of 1995-2002 should be considered as the early phase of the final regime shift. We developed two Bayesian hierarchical models to describe time-varying growth based on the von Bertalanffy growth function and the length-mass relationship. We used asymptotic length as an index of growth potential and predicted body mass at a given length as an index of body condition. Modeling fits to length and body mass at age of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), Chinook salmon, and walleye (Sander vitreus) were excellent. Based on posterior distributions, we evaluated the shifts in among-year geometric means of the growth potential and body condition. For a given top piscivore, one of the two indices responded to the regime shift much earlier than the 2003 collapse of alewives, the other corresponded to the 2003 changes, and which index provided the early signal differed among the three top piscivores.

AB  - Determination of potential mobility of toxic trace metals in sediments under changing redox condition is important in ecological risk assessment. Current methods are limited in risk prediction in such dynamic environment. In this study, we have discussed the general disagreement from widely used methods (sediment quality guideline (SQGs), potential ecological risk index (PERI), risk assessment code (RAC) using BCR fraction information). In addition, the stable isotopic dilution method (IDM) was also modified to quantify metal lability in a microcosm experiment mimicking river bank sediment turning into anaerobic. The isotopically exchangeable Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn quantified by IDM (%Eincub) was used in the RAC to reveal the trend of risk during this process. Strong risks from Cd are suggested by the PERI and RAC as a result of high toxicity and mobility of the element, while SQGs suggests medium risk for Cu, Pb, and Zn in certain samples. The disagreement between the results of RAC assessed by metal lability (%Edry) and by BCR metal fractionation reflects the effect of sediment properties and source of metal contamination. The RAC based on the non-residual fractions is likely to overestimate the potential risk for most metals even there is a significant change in sediment Eh. The RAC assessed by %Eincub reveals that the variability in risk in response to the reducing Eh is not consistent. Large fluctuation in %Eincub for Cd (28.5%, 49.5%), Pb (27.6%, 18.2%), and Cu (14.4%, 24.7%) can shift the risks to a higher level in certain range of Eh in two sediments. In sediment with lower contents of metal binding phases (e.g. mineral oxides, organic matters), the release of metals can be more significant, thus higher ecological risk in changing redox condition.

AB  - This study aims to determine the extent of metal pollution in Lake Yenicaa (Bolu, Turkey) by investigating the accumulation trends of five metals (Al, Cu, Fe, Ni and Zn) and a metalloid (As) in gills, exoskeleton, hepatopancreas and abdominal muscles of the freshwater crayfish Astacus leptodactylus. Principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA), correlation analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were utilised to determine the accumulation profiles of each element over four seasons. The greatest element accumulation was found to occur in the gills. All elements in exoskeletal tissue displayed positive correlations with each other, a similar trend was also observed in the hepatopancreas samples. Strong (r=0.868) and very strong (r=0.960) positive correlations were found between the accumulations of Al and Fe in gills and the exoskeleton, respectively. Correlations in tissue accumulation rates are discussed in the context of metabolic roles and impacts associated with the elements tested. Elemental compositions of Yenicaa water and sediment samples were also investigated to determine whether the composition of the surrounding environment matches the metal accumulation trends of tissue samples. We demonstrate that, by the criteria set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Lake Yenicaa is heavily polluted in terms of As and Ni.

AB  - Results of detailed microfacies analysis of units studied in a Barremian-Aptian stratigraphic sequence from Durango State of northeast Mexico, indicate primarily carbonate series representative of the transgressive episode that drowned the Cupido Platform during the late early to late Aptian. Formally established lithostratigraphic units of the studied section include from bottom to top: (a) the Cupido Formation (Barremian-lower Aptian): a unit of resistant thick- to massive-bedded limestones, representative of a shallow carbonate-platform facies; and (b) the La Pena Formation (middle-upper Aptian): a unit of intercalated marls, marry limestones, and shales, indicative of a deepening environment. Typical Aptian index ammonites dominate the macrofauna of the deepening unit, allowing a biostratigraphic analysis and consequently a correlation of this transgressive episode on the basis of the biochronology of these macrofossils. Vertical variations in the carbon/carbonate contents and in the relative abundance of benthic and planktonic foraminifera and radiolaria throughout the section, allow characterization of the sedimentological regimes during Barremian-Aptian times in this area of Mexico. The data suggest that intervals of C-rich levels may be related to periods of bottom dysoxic-anoxic conditions as a result of combined effects by eustatic, paleoceanographic, and paleoecological changes.

AB  - The Estuarine Health Index was applied to determine macrophyte health of the permanently open uMkhomazi Estuary and Mvoti River Mouth, KwaZulu-Natal. Macrophyte health was assessed in terms of the degree of similarity of species richness, abundance and community composition to reference condition (natural state prior to human influence). Changes over time in the area covered by different estuary habitats were assessed using available historical data and mapping of the earliest available aerial photographs together with field surveys and mapping in 2013. The floodplains of both estuaries have been transformed by sugarcane cultivation and colonisation by invasive alien plants, resulting in intact macrophyte habitats only occupying 60% of uMkhomazi and 40% of Mvoti Estuary. Reduced freshwater inflow and input of wastewater at Mvoti Estuary have led to reed encroachment (50% greater cover than natural) and spread of hygrophilous grasses into the open water. Macrophyte species richness in both estuaries was lower than previous botanical studies. Overall macrophyte health was poor with the uMkhomazi Estuary in a moderately modified state and Mvoti Estuary in a largely modified state. (C) 2016 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study compared the sediment characteristics, heavy metal content, enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (I-geo) and other heavy metal pollution indicators between the sediments inside and outside the Kaohsiung Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site (KODMDS). The aim was to examine the impact of dumping harbor dredged sediments into the ocean on the heavy metal distribution in the sediments of KODMDS. The relatively significant variations were found in particle size distribution of the disposal site, whereas those of the outside disposal site were relatively stable. Results indicate that the organic and heavy metal content in the disposal site were significantly higher than those outside the disposal site. Compared with the sediments outside the disposal site, the heavy metal enrichment and accumulation level in the disposal site increased in the dredged sediments, especially the content of Cr, Cu, and Zn. According to the analysis results of the heavy metal pollution indicators, including: the pollution load index (PLI), mean effect range median quotient (m-ERM-q) and potential ecological risk index (RI), the level of heavy metal pollution, the potential eco-toxicity and the potential ecological risk of the sediments inside the disposal site all showed a slight increase albeit without significant impact on the benthos inhabiting the disposal site. The result also indicates that the content of heavy metal in the dredged sediments constitutes one of the major factors that account for the increased heavy metal content in the sediments of the disposal site. In addition, the method of dumping the dredged sediments and the environmental condition of KODMDS may be some of the reasons for the same level of heavy metal content in sediments from KODMDS, where dredged sediments have been dumped for 10 years, and from other sea areas without disposal of dredged sediments.

AB  - The paper proposes a closed-form dynamic stiffness (DS) formulation for exact transverse free vibration analysis of tapered and/or functionally graded beams based on Euler-Bernoulli theory. The novelties lie in both the DS formulation and the solution technique. For the formulation, the developed DS is applicable to a wide range of non-uniform beams whose bending stiffness and linear density are assumed to be polynomial functions of position. This fills a gap of existing closed-form DS element library which is generally limited to linearly tapered/functionally graded beams. For the solution technique, an elegant and efficient J0 count of tapered element is proposed to apply the Wittrick-Williams (WW) algorithm most effectively. The investigation sheds lights on the so-called J0 count challenge of the algorithm for other DS elements. The above two novelties make exact and highly efficient modal analysis possible for a wide range of tapered and/or functionally graded beams, without resorting to series solution, numerical integrations or refined mesh discretization. Results for a particular case show excellent agreement with published results. Moreover, we investigate the effects of the taper/functional gradient rate/index and boundary conditions on the free vibration behaviour. Benchmark solutions are provided for individual beams as well as beam assemblies.

AB  - Flash flood has been increasing in the Khartoum area, Sudan due to geographical conditions and climatic change as heavy rainfall and high temperature, therefore the present work tried to estimate the sensitivity of flash flood. The present work proposes an advanced technique of flood sensitivity mapping using the method of analytical hierarchy process. Ten factors as elevation, slope, distance from the network, land use, density of the drainage, flow accumulation, surface roughness, stream power index, topographic wetness index and curvature of the topography were digitized and then contributed in the mapping of Flash flood. Remote sensing data were integrated with analytical hierarchy process to determine the flood sensitive area in Sudan. The model was applied and completed as the consistency ratio was mostly reasonable (<0.1). Based on the proposed model, about 75.56 Km(2) (12.26 %), 156.14 Km(2) (25.33%), 169.89 Km(2) (27.56 %), 141.40 Km(2) (22.94 %) and 73.50 Km(2) (11.92 %); were classified as no susceptible, low susceptible, high susceptible, moderate susceptible and very highly susceptible to flooding. The present study showed a high variation in flood sensitivity due to climatic change and geographic condition. This index can be modified and applied in areas of the same characteristics of climatic conditions as one of the main recommendation in the study area. The study showed that poor infrastructure and lack of preparedness were the main causes of the disaster of flood in Sudan. This study merely demonstrated the critical analysis of geospatial mapping in proper mitigating, sustainable development and great monitoring the negative effects of flooding along the Khartoum region to reduce hazards of flood.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been the epicenter of national environmental justice (EJ) work since President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order (EO) 12898 in 1994. Despite this continued focus, black, Indigenous, and people of color and low-income communities still bear the brunt of environmental harms. Although the EO began to institutionalize EJ work within EPA and across the federal government, implementing EPA's EJ program through an EO leaves it particularly vulnerable to the whims of political appointees. In this article we draw on > 100 interviews by > 75 former and current EPA employees to examine how despite the lack of top- down systems of accountability, EPA employees relied on middle-out systems of accountability to maintain EPA's EJ work in an administration seen as hostile to it. We begin by briefly situating this research within critical EJ studies and literature on accountability. We then draw on qualitative analysis of interviews to examine how the Trump administration tried to exploit the lack of top-down systems of accountability to dismantle EPA's EJ program. However, our interviews show how pressure from within the EPA, as well as external to the agency countered the lack of top- down systems. We conclude that the development of formalized top-down systems of accountability are critical to establish for EPA's EJ activities.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to propose a new approach to evaluate the effect of tannins on rumen microbial fermentation in terms of biological effect (proportion of the response if tannins are inactivated, BE) and reactivity (capability of tannins to bind chemically with different amounts of a reagent), by recording gas production in 24 h in vitro incubation of substrates with increasing levels (0.025-1 g/g substrate) of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Three tropical browse legumes with different tannin contents (Acacia cornigera, Albizia lebbekoides and Leucaena leucocephala) were chosen as model substrates. The reactivity index (RI, mg PEG) and absolute reactivity index (aRI, mg PEG/ml gas) were estimated from the rate coefficient of fitting gas production per unit of added PEG to an exponential equation for each incubation time. The RI characterises each specific tannin source, and depends on the potential fermentation of the plant. The average RI values of A. cornigera, L. leucocephala and A. lebbekoides were 70.4, 36.3 and 55.7 mg PEG, respectively. The aRI is a tool for species comparison, because it is referred to the total volume of gas produced. It was higher in A. lebbekoides, intermediate in A. cornigera and lowest in L. leucocephala (1.57, 0.76 and 1.14 mg PEG/ml gas, respectively; P=0.012). This index was higher at 6 h than at 12 and 24 h (1.62, 0.96 and 0.89 mg PEG/ml gas, P<0.001). The estimation of these indexes is a simple and inexpensive tool that gives a more complete view of the biological activity pattern of tannins in practical conditions, complementing that of other biological effect indexes and avoiding the biases that arise from their chemical analysis.

AB  - Municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) fly ashes are characterized by high calcium oxide (CaO) content. Carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption by MSWI fly ash was discussed based on thermogravimetry (TG)/differential thermal analysis (DTA), minerology analysis, and adapting the Stenoir equation. TG/DTA analysis showed that the weight gain of the fly ash below 440 degrees C was as high as 5.70 %. An adapted Stenoir equation for MSWI fly ash was discussed. The chloride in MSWI fly ash has a major impact on CO2 adsorption by MSWI fly ash or air pollution control (APC) residues. Geochemical modeling of the critical trace elements copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), and antimony (Sb) before and after carbonation was performed using a thermodynamic equilibrium model for solubility and a surface complexation model for metal sorption. Leaching of critical trace elements was generally found to be strongly dependent on the degree of carbonation attained, and their solubility appeared to be controlled by several minerals. Adsorption on ferrum (Fe) and aluminum (Al) colloids was also responsible for removal of the trace elements Cd, Pb, and Sb. We used Hakanson's potential ecological risk index (HPERI) to evaluate the risk of trace element leaching in general. The results demonstrate that the ecological risk showed a V-shaped dependency on pH; the optimum pH of the carbonated fly ash was found to be 10.3-11, resulting from the optimum carbonation (liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio = 0.25, carbonation duration = similar to 30-48 h). The dataset and modeling results presented here provide a contribution to assessing the leaching behavior of MSWI fly ash under a wide range of conditions.

AB  - Armoring of streambanks is a common management response to perceived threats to adjacent infrastructure from flooding or erosion. Despite their pervasiveness, effects of reach-scale bank armoring have received less attention than those of channelization or watershed-scale hydromodification. In this study, we explored mechanistic ecosystem responses to armoring by comparing conditions upstream, within, and downstream of six stream reaches with bank armoring in Southern California. Assessments were based on four common stream-channel assessment methods: (1) traditional geomorphic measures, (2) the California Rapid Assessment Method for wetlands, (3) bioassessment with benthic macroinvertebrates, and (4) bioassessment with stream algae. Although physical responses varied among stream types (mountain, transitional, and lowland), armored segments generally had lower slopes, more and deeper pools and fewer riffles, and increased sediment deposition. Several armored segments exhibited channel incision and bank toe failure. All classes of biological indicators showed subtle, mechanistic responses to physical changes. However, extreme heterogeneity among sites, the presence of catchment-scale disturbances, and low sample size made it difficult to ascribe observed patterns solely to channel armoring. The data suggest that species-level or functional group-level metrics may be more sensitive tools than integrative indices of biotic integrity to local-scale effects.

AB  - Terminal heat stress is one of the major production constraints in wheat-producing areas of south-cast Asia. The selection of genotypes based on grain yield per se is not effective under stress condition. In the present study 30 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes were evaluated under normal and heat stress conditions during 2016-17 and 2017-18 to determine the suitable trait index for selection of genotypes under non-stress and heat stress environments and identification of heat tolerant genotypes. The observation was recorded for 13 morphological, biochemical and physiological traits. The index based on seven characters like grain yield, days to heading, biological yield, green fodder yield, dry matter content, catalase and peroxidase was most suitable with the genetic gain of 4856.09% and the genetic advancement of 33.09 in normal condition and the index based on five characters comprising days to heading, biological yield, number of tillers, catalase and peroxidase was most suitable with an expected genetic gain of 20101.32% and genetic advance of 35.09. The genotypes RAJ 3765, BRW 3794, HD 2643, SW 129, DBW 14, SW 160, BRW 3759, BRW 3762 and BRW 3800 were identified as moderately tolerant considering selection index score and heat susceptibility index. These genotypes may he promoted for cultivation under late sown conditions and used as parents for the development of genotypes tolerant to terminal heat stress.

AB  - Over two hundred samples were collected in tropical headwater forested catchments in the lowland Amazon basin near Juruena, Mato Grosso Brazil. These were analyzed for fluorescence characteristics and DOC concentrations, and represented a range of terrestrial hydrologic flowpaths and first-order streams during baseflow and stormflow conditions. The fluorescence index (FI) of McKnight et al. (2001) was found to have a significant relationship with DOC concentrations for stream water at baseflow conditions, but FI values within individual terrestrial flowpaths and stormflow varied little for the range of DOC concentrations observed. FI values were seen to increase for increasing residence time of water within the terrestrial ecosystem, while DOC concentration decreased for increasing hydrologic residence time. The FI of terrestrial flow paths indicated that DOC became increasingly characterized by microbially derived carbon for flow paths with longer residence times, on the order through fall and overland flow < percolating soil water < groundwater. Base flow samples of stream water had a mean FI value of 1.78, compared with 1.51 and 1.44 for through fall and overland flow, respectively, and 1.65 for percolating soil water. The FI values for stream water at base flow were also seen to vary seasonally, and were inversely proportional to DOC concentrations over time.

AB  - As water utilities operate as natural monopolists and they provide essential services for human life, their activities are regulated by public authorities. The sustainable use of water resources and a specific attention on social needs should be essential goals for this kind of firms, so that the evaluation of their business should go beyond their profitability and their financial solvency. Keeping pace with the new Circular Economy paradigm and the evolution of the water regulatory framework, in this paper we suggest a global composite indicator apt to evaluate in a novel way the water utilities performance, encompassing financial and economic indexes together with environmental sustainability and service quality measures. To show its empirical implementation we evaluate the performance of Italian water utilities. The operating context is also under scrutiny focusing on specific water utility features such as size, geographical location, degree of diversification and ownership. In this light, operating in the Centre and being large are considered favourable background conditions, while the South and the medium size display a significant unfavourable influence on the water utility performance. Multi-utilities are more advantaged with respect to the mono-utilities and no significant distinction can be made among the different ownership models.

AB  - Vegetation is a key biological element used to assess the ecological status of rivers, for example, under the EU Water Framework Directive. Current macrophyte-based river vegetation metrics may not accurately reflect overall ecological state, particularly when plant community components are weakly related to broader hydromorphological context. A more holistic River Vegetation Quality Metric (RVQM) is proposed. The RVQM applies an eco-hydromorphic approach to assessment of vegetation integrity, with a focus on lowland (low-moderate energy) rivers. The concepts underlying the RVQM and the methods for applying this new metric are presented and discussed. A pilot study then explores relationships between the RVQM and recorded physical variables in 119 sites (river reaches) within 27 rivers across Ireland. Statistical models suggest that the RVQM score for these study sites was most strongly related to physical components (assessed under the River Hydromorphology Assessment Technique). Water quality (assessed using a benthic invertebrate metric, Q-value) also had a positive effect on RVQM score, but high ecological status was only recorded in sample sites with natural morphology and hydraulics, irrespective of water quality. Results indicate that interactions between vegetation and hydromorphological descriptors within the river corridor deserve greater consideration when assigning ecological status to lowland rivers.

AB  - The relevance of the work is justified by the need to evaluate the environmental situation in the territories of uranium mining and other mining enterprises. Such region, with high morbidity and mortality of the population from malignant neoplasms, is Northern Kazakhstan. One of the largest provinces in the Kazakhstan is situated in the Northern Kazakhstan region - the North Kazakhstan uranium ore province. This province is located in the Akmola and North Kazakhstan regions. Hair, which is capable of depositing chemical elements in its structure, was used as a bioindicator of changes in the ecological and geochemical state of the territory.
   Purpose: to evaluate the levels of accumulation of chemical elements in the hair of inhabitants of the Northern Kazakhstan regions.
   Methods. 73 chemical elements in hair have been identified using inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS).
   Results. The content of elements in the inhabitant's hair of two regions of Northern Kazakhstan was studied and a comparative analysis with other territories of the region and individual regions of Russia was carried out. The analysis showed that in the Akmola and North Kazakhstan regions there was a high content of Na, In, Te, Cs, Sm, Eu, Tb, Yb, Lu, Ta, Th, Hf and U. A general spectrum of elements characteristic of two regions of the North Kazakhstan: Na, Mg, Si, Ca. The following elements specific to the clarke noosphere in the Northern region: such as Bi, Au, S, Te, Re, Ag, Zn, Se, Ir, I, Cd, Hg, were established. General spectrum of elements for all studied territories of Kazakhstan and Russia are Au, Ag, Se and Hg.

AB  - Bar-built estuaries are generally found at the mouths of smaller watersheds with seasonal precipitation, episodic streamflow and seasonal swell dynamics. Low streamflows and constructive wave forces form a sand bar at the mouth isolating the stream from the ocean, creating a ponded lagoon, and inundating the surrounding marsh plain. Bar-built estuaries are wide spread in California comprising over 50 percent of California's more than 500 estuaries. By connecting terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms bar-built estuaries are complex and dynamic providing great habitat and ecosystem services. California has suffered some of the highest losses of wetland habitats, and the wetland habitats of bar-built estuaries continue to be threatened by further development, pollution, and climate related changes including diminished streamflows and sea level rise. Given this loss and threat we developed a California Rapid Assessment Method (CRAM) to assess the condition of California's bar-built estuaries. CRAM uses visual indicators to accurately reflect current wetland condition with regards to buffer habitat, hydrology, physical complexity, plant diversity and structure, and landscape influences. Here we validate this method by comparing results of CRAM for bar-built estuaries to other accepted measures of wetland condition that we simultaneously collected with CRAM including vegetative surveys, water nutrient levels, and GIS landscape scale measures of stress for 32 sites throughout California. CRAM correlated well with each of these three independent methods of assessing condition. Notably, the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) number of natives metric significantly correlated with CRAM Index and all Attribute scores. The strong correlations of CRAM to nutrient levels is particularly important considering the documentation of the negative impact of nutrients on fish populations, the use of bar-built estuaries by juveniles of commercially important species, and the nursery role of bar-built estuaries for maintaining imperiled populations of species such as steelhead. GIS measured percent impervious, percent agriculture, and percent dams all correlated well with expected CRAM Attribute scores at appropriate watershed scales relative to the area of inference for each CRAM metric. Further, CRAM for bar-built estuaries works well throughout California's diversity of environmental conditions and regardless of geography, timing, or whether the bar was open or closed during the survey. We hope that the availability of CRAM combined with available data repositories will enable local, state, and federal decision makers to better manage, restore, and conserve valuable bar-built estuaries in the face of continual threats like development, drought, and sea level rise.

AB  - The coherent phase microscopy (CPM) provides a convenient and non-invasive tool for imaging cells and intracellular organelles. In this article, we consider the applications of the CPM method to imaging different cells and energy-transducing intracellular organelles (mitochondria and chloroplasts). Experimental data presented below demonstrate that the optical path length difference of the object, which is the basic optical parameter measured by the CPM method, can serve as an indicator of metabolic states of different biological objects at cellular and subcellular levels of structural organization.

AB  - Monitoring indicator species is a pragmatic approach to natural resource assessments, especially when the link between the indicator species and ecosystem state is well justified. However, conducting ecosystem assessments over representative spatial scales that are insensitive to local heterogeneity is challenging. We examine the link between polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination and population density of an aquatic habitat specialist over a large spatial scale using non-invasive genetic spatial capture-recapture. Using American mink (Neovison vison), a predatory mammal and an indicator of aquatic ecosystems, we compared estimates of density in two major river systems, one with extremely high levels of PCB contamination (Hudson River), and a hydrologically independent river with lower PCB levels (Mohawk River). Our work supports the hypothesis that mink densities are substantially (1.64-1.67 times) lower in the contaminated river system. We demonstrate the value of coupling the indicator species concept with well-conceived and spatially representative monitoring protocols. PCBs have demonstrable detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems, including mink, and these effects are likely to be profound and long-lasting, manifesting as population-level impacts. Through integrating non-invasive data collection, genetic analysis, and spatial capture-recapture methods, we present a monitoring framework for generating robust density estimates across large spatial scales.

AB  - The local productivity of a reservoir on the territory of a hydrocarbon field was assessed remotely using thermodynamic indicator of the state of the geological environment. Seismic background data recorded on the surface were used as input data. A monotonic relation that was close to linear between the value of the thermodynamic indicator and the total thickness of the productive layers in the wells near the sites where the seismic background was recorded was revealed experimentally.

AB  - Individual thermal comfort models based on physiological parameters could improve the efficiency of the personal thermal comfort control system. However, the effect of thermal history has not been fully addressed in these models. In this study, climate chamber experiments were conducted in winter using 32 subjects who have different indoor and outdoor thermal histories. Two kinds of thermal conditions were investigated: the temperature dropping (24-16 degrees C) and severe cold (12 degrees C) conditions. A simplified method using historical air temperature to quantify the thermal history was proposed and used to predict thermal comfort and thermal demand from physical or physiological parameters. Results show the accuracies of individual thermal sensation prediction was low to about 30% by using the PMV index in cold environments of this study. Base on the sensitivity and reliability of physiological responses, five local skin temperatures (at hand, calf, head, arm and thigh) and the heart rate are optimal input parameters for the individual thermal comfort model. With the proposed historical air temperature as an additional input, the general accuracies using classification tree model C5.0 were increased up by 15.5% for thermal comfort prediction and up by 29.8% for thermal demand prediction. Thus, when predicting thermal demands in winter, the factor of thermal history should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUNDIn the production process of surimi, large quantities of wastewater are produced. Thus it would be interesting to develop an efficient protocol for the recovery of protein from hairtail surimi wash-water.
   RESULTSA technique involving the use of immobilized chymotrypsin-trypsin (I-CT) was developed, providing a practical method for the preparation of protein-peptide nutritional material (PPNM). Under optimized reaction conditions, the recovery rate of nitrogen of surimi wash-water was measured as 98.32.9%. Nutritional evaluation of the protein-peptide fraction demonstrated that it contained all essential amino acids (EAA) for humans, accounting for 44.1% of the total amino acid (TAA) content, which was determined to be 78.2g per 100g dry matter. The essential amino acid index (EAAI) and biological value (BV) were 101.7 (>95) and 76.7 respectively. A wide range of volatile flavor compounds (>50), including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, hydrocarbons and heterocyclic compounds, were identified in PPNM by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis.
   CONCLUSIONAn efficient and practical protocol for the recovery of protein from hairtail surimi wash-water has been developed. The PPNM prepared in this work could be used as a nutraceutical and as an ingredient of functional foods. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - A straightforward, fast and specific stability indicating RP-HPLC method was developed for the direct determination of gatifloxacin and prednisolone in ophthalmic preparation as well as in spiked human plasma and urine samples. Chromatographic separations for gatifloxacin, prednisolone as well as their degradation products (stress induced) were obtained in 16 min on BDS Hypersil C8-5 mu m (250 x 4.6 mm) as stationary phase column at 210 nm (diode array detector); mobile phase was comprised by mixture of methanol-water (60: 40 v/v) and 0.1% triethylamine, flow rate 1.5 mL/min at pH 3.0 adjusted with dilute trifluoro-acetic acid. Validation studies were performed according to ICH guidelines. There was a linear function of concentrations over the range for 21-39 mu g/mL for gatifloxacin and 70-130 mu g/mL for prednisolone. Limit of detection and limit of quantitation for gatifloxacin were determined as 0.042 and 0.140 mu g/mL, respectively, and for prednisolone were 0.110 and 0.367 mu g/mL, respectively. Good separation of analytes as well as their degradation products was observed with acceptable values of resolution and tailing. After the application of all stress conditions peak purity index was >= 0.9999 for both analytes, indicating their complete separation from degradation products peaks.

AB  - Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) is transmitted specifically from grapevine to grapevine by the ectoparasitic root-feeding nematode Xiphinema index. Limited information is available on the survival of X. index in vineyard soil and on the retention of GFLV by X. index over extended periods of time. We addressed these two issues by quantifying the numbers of living X. index recovered from soil samples that were collected in three naturally GFLV-infected vineyards in France and subsequently stored at 7 or 20 degrees C in the absence of host plants. Our data indicated a two- to eightfold decrease in X. index numbers but the recovery of 8 to 10 living fourth-stage juveniles (J4) and adults per kilogram of soil after 4 years of storage regardless of temperature. In addition, GFLV was detected readily in all groups of 20 isolated X. index adults and J4 (except for J4 that were kept 4 years at 20 degrees C) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using total nematode RNAs and a primer set located in conserved regions at the 3' end of viral genomic RNA 2. Our findings on the long-term survival of viruliferous X. index under adverse conditions emphasize the need for new control strategies against GFLV.

AB  - The ecological integrity of the Mthatha River is increasingly under threat from climate change and anthropogenic impacts of contamination by acidification, organic pollutants, industrial and agricultural chemicals, and waste water. This study assessed the ecological state of the river and the impact of water quality on benthic macroinvertebrate communities from 2015 to 2016. Faunal specimens were sampled and environmental variables measured at four sites that vary in topography and human impact along the river. A total of 2980 specimens were recorded at sites, and classified into 12 orders, 46 families and 71 species. Species composition and distribution were directly or indirectly affected by season, physico-chemical variables and habitat heterogeneity. CCA results showed that electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and vegetation accounted for species distribution patterns. Both habitat-restricted and common/widespread species can be used as indicators for assessing the quality of the Mthatha River system. Habitat management along the river should aim at preserving sufficient indigenous vegetation, especially during summer when biotope requirements are optimal. The practicality of using species-level surveys on a routine basis can be challenging. It might be advisable to select a few indicator species identified in this study and to monitor them as surrogates for the whole community.

AB  - Many globally applied biotic indices, including the AMBI benthic index, are based on species' sensitivity/tolerance to anthropogenic disturbances. The AMBI scoring primarily relies on the correct assignment of both taxon stressor-sensitivities and the disturbance thresholds or bands. Using an extensive, long-term monitoring dataset from New Zealand (NZ) estuaries, we describe how the AMBI has been strengthened through quantitative derivation of taxon-specific sensitivities and condition thresholds for two key estuarine stressors [mud and total organic carbon (TOC)], and the integration of taxon richness. The results support the use of the existing AMBI condition bands but improve the ability to identify cause; 2-30% mud reflected a 'normal' to 'impoverished' macrofaunal community; 30-95% mud and 1.2-3% TOC 'unbalanced' to 'transitional'; and >3-4% TOC 'transitional' to 'polluted'. The (refined) AMBI was also successfully validated (R-2 values >0.5 for mud, and >0.4 for TOC) for use in shallow, intertidal dominated estuaries NZ-wide. Most biotic indices lack the ability to differentiate between anthropogenic disturbances, which in turn undermine their effectiveness for applied purposes. By integrating key quantitative information to an existing benthic index, these results enable more robust identification of coastal stressors and facilitate defensible management decisions.

AB  - The Mediterranean Sea is a relatively deep, closed sea with high rates of fisheries exploitation. In recent years fishing activity has tended to shift towards deeper depths. At the same time, the Mediterranean displays some rather special hydrographic and biogeographic conditions. The present paper reviews the present state of knowledge of the fisheries, biology, and ecology of the deep-sea fish and crustacean species in the Mediterranean dwelling below 1,000 m with potential economic interest, placing special emphasis on the western basin, for which more data are available, as a basis for future studies of the ecology, biodiversity, and effects of climate change and exploitation in this zone. This review reveals that mediterranean deep-sea fishes and crustaceans employ highly conservative ecological strategies, and hence the low fecundity and low metabolic rates in a stable environment like the deep-sea make these populations highly vulnerable. Moreover, ripe females of the main species mentioned here concentrate in the deepest portions of their distribution ranges. Deep-sea fish and crustaceans have high trophic levels and low to medium omnivory index values. The ecological indices discussed here, in combination with the limited knowledge of deep-sea ecosystems, clearly call for an approach based on the Precautionary Principle.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates respond to several factors characterizing the physical habitats, as water depth, current and streambed substrate. Thus, anthropogenic disturbances altering these factors may have different effects on benthos, also depending on mesohabitats. These disturbances include sediment flushing operations, commonly carried out to recover reservoir capacity, and investigating their effects at mesohabitat scale could be relevant for an adequate ecological impact assessment of these operations. Here, we compared benthic macroinvertebrate communities sampled before and after a controlled sediment flushing operation in three different mesohabitats (a pool, a riffle and a step-pool) of an Alpine stream. Contrary from expectations, the composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages was not significantly different among mesohabitats. Moreover, the impact of sediment flushing was more significant in terms of density rather than in richness. Two stressor-specific indices were tested, but only one (the Siltation Index for LoTic EcoSystems - SILTES) clearly detected the impact of sediment flushing on the macroinvertebrate community structure. Finally, some differences in the temporal trajectories and recovery times to pre-flushing conditions were observed among mesohabitats, both if the three mesohabitats were considered separately and if all their possible combinations were accounted for. Particularly, riffle was the most sensitive mesohabitat, not fully recovering one year after the sediment disturbance.

AB  - Fixed-point and probabilistic sampling designs were compared to investigate which design best detected known contamination gradients in the marine ecosystem adjacent to McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The fixed-point sampling design included transects along historical contamination and physical disturbance gradients. The probabilistic sampling design used randomly selected hexagons spaced at 50 m intervals. In both designs, 15 stations were sampled over a small area (similar to 1 km(2)) that extended from Winter Quarters Bay to Cape Armitage. Sediment quality triad components (sediment chemical contaminants, sediment toxicity, and a benthic index of biotic integrity) were measured to indicate chemical, toxicological, and biological effects. There were higher correlations between sediment quality triad components for the fixed-point sampling design than for the probabilistic design. The fixed-point design was better at detecting the intensity of alteration because disturbance of the marine ecosystem at McMurdo Station is localized within a small area. Based on these results, a limited fixed-point design with nine stations detected no significant change in macrofaunal community structure over a four year period from 2000-2004. However, the macrofaunal assemblages present in the contaminated portions of Winter Quarters Bay are indicative of a disturbed benthic community that has been subject to organic enrichment and toxic chemical exposure.

AB  - One of the challenges of research in soil ecology is to assess the impact of tillage managements on soil invertebrates. It is known that tillage practices change soil water content, temperature, the degree of mixing of crop residues within the soil matrix and the physico-chemical environment for soil organisms. The present study tested whether no-tillage (NT) or a conventional tillage (CT) of a cereal (durum wheat; Triticum durum) field in a semi-arid zone of northwestern Tunisia could improve the biological activity and diversity of soil invertebrates, especially arthropod and earthworm communities.
   The experiment was conducted in January 2000 at two different sites (Mahasse/Kef Governorate and Krib/Siliana Governorate). Soils (Brunisols, isohumic or fersialitic soil) were silt/clay in Mahessen and sand/clay in Krib. After three and four years, soil fauna was sampled with two methods (quadrat and pitfall trap) over 7 months for the last two growing seasons (200212003 and 200312004). We hypothesized that: (i) soil fauna richness, abundance and diversity would be lower in CT soils than in NT soils and (ii) the move from CT to NT may improve the soil biological component under semi arid conditions.
   380 invertebrates (37 species) and 309 invertebrates (24 species) were collected by quadrat and pitfall trap methods, respectively. NT greatly enhanced the species richness (from 26 species in CT to 34 species in NT) and abundance (from 61 individuals in CT to 319 individuals in NT) of soil invertebrates with quadrat method. Only abundance was significantly enhanced with pitfall trap method (from 78 individuals in CT to 235 individuals in NT). So, abundance, species richness and diversity of soil arthropods were significantly higher(P < 0.05)with NT than with CT. Soil fauna patterns showed that management mode affected also the abundance of earthworm community. These findings confirm our first hypothesis.
   Predators (mostly Carabidae), detritivore (especially: Formicidae, Dolicoderidae, Lumbricidae) and herbivore (represented here by Julidae, Pyrrhochridae and some Scarabaeidae) were significantly (P < 0.05) more abundant with NT than with CT. The biological index V (index which compares the relative increase or decrease of the population density between the two tillage modes) showed that all major taxonomic groups were extremely inhibited by CT, confirming our second hypothesis.
   So, NT seems to be beneficial to biological soil component where it favoured the establishment of diverse soil communities than did CT in durum wheat cropped field. Furthermore, soil fauna may enhance crop-residues decay processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land Degradation (LD) in sodo-environmental systems negatively impacts sustainable development paths. This study proposes a framework to LD evaluation based on indicators of diversification in the spatial distribution of sensitive land. We hypothesize that conditions for spatial heterogeneity in a composite index of land sensitivity are more frequently associated to areas prone to LD than spatial homogeneity. Spatial heterogeneity is supposed to be associated with degraded areas that act as hotspots for future degradation processes. A diachronic analysis (1960-2010) was performed at the Italian agricultural district scale to identify environmental factors associated with spatial heterogeneity in the degree of land sensitivity to degradation based on the Environmentally Sensitive Area Index (ESAI). In 1960, diversification in the level of land sensitivity measured using two common indexes of entropy (Shannon's diversity and Pielou's evenness) increased significantly with the ESAI, indicating a high level of land sensitivity to degradation. In 2010, surface area classified as "critical" to LD was the highest in districts with diversification in the spatial distribution of ESAI values, confirming the hypothesis formulated above. Entropy indexes, based on observed alignment with the concept of LD, constitute a valuable base to inform mitigation strategies against desertification. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pesticide regulation requires regulatory authorities to assess the potential ecological risk of pesticides submitted for registration, and most risk assessment schemes use a tiered testing and assessment approach. Standardized ecotoxicity tests, environmental fate studies, and exposure models are used at lower tiers and follow well-defined methods for assessing risk. If a lower tier assessment indicates that the pesticide may pose an ecological risk, higher tier studies using more environmentally realistic conditions or assumptions can be performed to refine the risk assessment and inform risk management options. However, there is limited guidance in the United States on options to refine an assessment and how the data will be incorporated into the risk assessment and risk management processes. To overcome challenges to incorporation of higher tier data into ecological risk assessments and risk management of pesticides, a workshop was held in Raleigh, North Carolina. Attendees included representatives from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, United States Department of Agriculture, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, universities, commodity groups, consultants, nonprofit organizations, and the crop protection industry. Key recommendations emphasized the need for 1) more effective, timely, open communication among registrants, risk assessors, and risk managers earlier in the registration process to identify specific protection goals, address areas of potential concern where higher tier studies or assessments may be required, and if a higher tier study is necessary that there is agreement on study design; 2) minimizing the complexity of study designs while retaining high value to the risk assessment and risk management process; 3) greater transparency regarding critical factors utilized in risk management decisions with clearly defined protection goals that are operational; and 4) retrospective analyses of success-failure learnings on the acceptability of higher tier studies to help inform registrants on how to improve the application of such studies to risk assessments and the risk management process.

AB  - The Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) score system was introduced in 1980 to provide an index of river water quality for England and Wales based on aquatic macroinvertebrates. The score allocated to each taxon was set by a group of expert river biologists on the basis of their collective experience of the taxon's sensitivity to organic pollution. This paper describes an objective reappraisal of these subjectively derived scores by the statistical analysis of a large and comprehensive database of field data. Two different methods of using biological and environmental data were evaluated as a basis for revising BMWP scores, both of which accounted for variations in site type. One method, Modified New Walley-Hawkes (MNWH), used a modified average score per taxon (MASPT) as its ranking metric and required analyses performed on separated data sets divided into three site types. The other method used the environmental quality index based on MASPT (EQIMASPT) to provide its ranking metric. Both of these methods involved the use of modified BMWP values for Oligochaeta and Chironomidae for reasons that are explained. Following evaluation, the MNWH method was chosen to derive present-only and abundance-related scores for the BMWP taxa, 19 additional taxa mostly from the order Diptera, and 16 extra taxa resulting from the splitting of eight BMWP composite taxa. The MNWH scores were generally in keeping with those derived in an earlier study, except for a few rare taxa that were represented by few samples in that study. The UK Regulatory Authorities intend adopting a new index based on the MNWH scores, and this is given in two appendices. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Urban areas are characterised by the impact of negative environmental factors, such as: stress connected with extreme bio-thermal conditions or the presence of high concentrations of air pollutants. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between the hours of O-3 concentrations and the levels of physiological strain (PhS) in Legnica, during the period from December 2013 to November 2014. The hourly concentrations of O-3, NO2 and meteorological elements used in the study were obtained from the State Environmental Monitoring station in Legnica (Lower Silesia). The evaluation of the bio-thermal conditions was carried out by means of the physiological strain indicator (PhS). The basic statistics were subject to analysis, the frequency of hourly pollution concentrations and the thermal strain were evaluated, as was the Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple regression between O-3 and PhS. A detailed analysis was carried out for the summer months (June-August). The most adverse conditions in terms of pollution with tropospheric ozone and heat strain were noted in July. The strongest relations between O-3 and PhS were observed in June. In winter months (December-February) no significant dependencies were noted between the tested variables. These tests will help to contribute to increasing the current knowledge on evaluating the thermal comfort of urbanised areas and the accompanying aero-sanitary conditions.

AB  - The ecological implications of drought have been widely discussed in recent years. Ecological drought was thus proposed as a new drought type to describe the impact of drought on ecosystems. The current study used an innovative drought index, called the standardized ecological water deficit index (SEWDI), to monitor terrestrial ecological drought in Northwestern China, which is an ecologically fragile region. Droughts and their characteristics, including drought affected area, drought severity, drought duration, drought frequency, and drought orientation, were extracted using a spatial and temporal identification method based on SEWDI at a three-month timescale. To investigate the variation in dominant factors determining vegetation health, the contributions of moisture and thermal conditions during different ecological drought events were determined using a gradient boosting regression model. The main results indicated that (1) the spatial and temporal identification method successfully identified the spatio-temporal patterns of ecological drought; (2) a total of 184 ecological drought events during 1982-2020 were identified, of which 56.6% occurred prior to the 21st century. Drought events in the 21st century always exhibit larger affected areas, longer durations, a higher frequency, and greater severity, and migrated westward; and (3) in all ecological drought events, vegetation health dominated by thermal conditions accounted for 42.7% and 48.2% before and during the 21st century, respectively. This illustrated that vegetation has experienced more severe thermal stress during the 21st century.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate variation in biomass allocation and community composition of submerged macrophytes to elucidate the effect of sediment depth on the growth and species diversity of submerged macrophytes. Field investigations were conducted in 36 sampling sites located across Lake Taihu, China; six plant species were found and communities were dominated by Potamogeton malaianus and Vallisneria natans. The results showed that the plant-sediment distribution relationship was supported by a biological trait (biomass index) and a strong predictive power of sediment depth to plant biomass, and the occurrence selectivity of submerged macrophytes toward relatively firm bottoms could be demonstrated along the eastern shore. Root and stem biomass were strongly positively correlated to sediment depth over a range from 0.1 to 0.25 m (p < 0.01), and approximately 0.25 m could be regarded as an upper limit for depth effect on the growth of submerged macrophytes. The results also demonstrated that species varied in their responses to sediment conditions, which influenced the community composition of submerged macrophytes. The observed pattern suggests the effect of sediment on growth and community composition is an important aspect restricting the restoration of submerged macrophytes.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are important and fragile transitional environments for their ecological, hydrological. and conservation value. Yet, in the last 50 yr, they have been subject to a high level of anthropogenic disturbance, ranging from habitat disruption to pollution. Even important economic activities that directly or indirectly depend upon the ecological integrity of these unique environments, such as tourism, extensive fish farming, and clam rearing, may exert remarkable pressures on coastal lagoons. As a consequence, it is important to derive a methodology that allows for an integrated assessment of the ecological integrity of wetlands areas and the sustainability of the commercial activities that depend on it. In this work, we have defined a rapid, user friendly, and cost-effective tool to assess wetland condition based on an aggregated index of sustainability (ESI), which combines three scores targeted to quantifying habitat availability, functionality performance, and anthropogenic pressures, respectively. Three data forms have been compiled for 17 sites included in the LaguNet network, thus showing that (meta)data can be collected from a great deal of information coming from research centres, environmental agencies, grey literature, management bodies, and, in some cases, field surveys. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis has been performed to assess the sensitivity of the results to uncertainty or errors in the allocation of weights to the three components of the index. A randomization test applied to the 10 000 Monte Carlo replicates has allowed us to assess the robustness of the final ranking. The methodology presented here can be regarded as a cost-effective way to summarize a great deal of information and to provide a preliminary screening evaluation to help decision-makers in wetland assessment and management.

AB  - The nitrogen stable isotope ratio of NOx (delta N-15-NOx) has been proposed as a regional indicator for NOx source partitioning; however, knowledge of delta N-15 values from various NOx emission sources is limited. This study presents a detailed analysis of delta N-15-NOx emitted from vehicle exhaust, the largest source of anthropogenic NOx. To accomplish this, NOx was collected from 26 different vehicles, including gasoline and diesel-powered engines, using a modification of a NOx collection method used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and delta N-15-NOx was analyzed. The vehicles sampled in this study emitted delta N-15-NOx values ranging from -19.1 to 9.8 that negatively correlated with the emitted NOx concentrations (8.5 to 286 ppm) and vehicle run time because of kinetic isotope fractionation effects associated with the catalytic reduction of NOx. A model for determining the mass-weighted delta N-15-NOx from vehicle exhaust was constructed on the basis of average commute times, and the model estimates an average value of -2.5 +/- 1.5, with slight regional variations. As technology improvements in catalytic converters reduce cold-start emissions in the future, it is likely to increase current delta N-15-NOx values emitted from vehicles.

AB  - In rivers, lakes, and other aquatic systems throughout the world, intake pipes withdraw huge volumes of water for industrial purposes, including power plant cooling. During this process, large numbers of small-bodied, early life-stages of fish are pulled into pipes (i.e., entrained) and may be subjected to physical, thermal and chemical stress. As a result of such entrainment, these organisms can suffer direct or indirect mortality. However, given that the vast majority of larval fish are likely to die during early life due to natural processes, it is not obvious that entrainment-related mortality will have a strong influence on subsequent adult population sizes. The ability to evaluate if larval fish are dead on arrival, moribund, or in poor condition (i.e., likely to die through natural processes) at the time of entrainment could shed light on likely population-level impacts. To this end, we review the potential use of RNA:DNA ratios to index condition of entrained larval fish. Through a meta-analysis of published research studies, we demonstrate that RNA:DNA ratios of larval fish are responsive to starvation stress, with effect size increasing with duration of starvation. We relate these results to a surrogate measure of irreversible long-term negative impacts to fish populations, and demonstrate that the timescale over which RNA:DNA ratios respond to stress may not be long enough to reflect before-and-after entrainment stress. We also highlight the diverse factors contributing to variation of RNA:DNA ratios, including methodological, ontogenetic, and thermal influences. We believe that the need to account for these influences when comparing among RNA:DNA values limits the utility of broadly using RNA:DNA ratios to evaluate entrainment effects. However, the method shows promise as a quick and efficient means of determining fish condition and, used in proper context (e.g., specific to a given set of environmental conditions; in conjunction with other assessment techniques), may provide a powerful tool in assessing the effects of entrainment on fish populations. Assuming that researchers can account for sources of background variation, RNA:DNA analyses may be most useful for assessing the condition of fish larvae susceptible to entrainment (i.e., physically in the vicinity of the water intake) and/or evaluating whether fish larvae are likely to die from natural processes independent of entrainment.

AB  - Monitoring patterns of fauna diversity across the landscape, both spatially and temporally, presents special challenges due to the dynamic nature of populations and complex interactions with the local and regional environment. One area where progress is being made is the development of relationships between regional biodiversity with indirect indicators or surrogates, such as vegetative production. in this paper we discuss implementation of a dynamic habitat index, originally developed in Australia, to Canadian conditions. The index, based on the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) absorbed by vegetation, a variable which is analogous to green vegetation cover, is derived solely from satellite data. The index utilizes time series of satellite observations of greenness to derive three indicators of the underlying vegetation dynamics; the cumulative annual greenness, the minimum level of perennial cover, and the degree of vegetation seasonality. We apply the index across Canada and compare the three components by ecozones, demonstrating that Canada's terrestrial environment can effectively be clustered into five major dynamic habitat regimes. These range from those with low cumulative greenness and highly seasonal variation in cover, to regimes which have high canopy light absorbance with limited seasonality and continuous annual green cover. By comparing data from multiple years, our analysis indicates that a number of these ecozones have experienced changes in their composition over the past 6 years. We believe this methodology can provide an initial stratification of large areas for biodiversity monitoring and can be used to focus finer scale approaches to specific regions of interest or monitor regions too remote for comprehensive field surveys.

AB  - We examined long-term ecological change in two Hudson River tributaries, the Wappinger and Fishkill Creek watersheds in Dutchess County, New York State. Fish data spanning 65 years (1936, 1988, 1992, and 2001) and shorter term macroinvertebrate data (1988, 2001) were used to assess the influence of land use practices. Between 1988 and 2001, macroinvertebrate index Biotic Assessment Profile (BAP) improved by 113-165% in the Fishkill Creek watershed, and fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) improved by 117-140%. Fish IBI and fish species richness were significantly different (p < 0.01) between the watersheds, with Wappinger Creek in better condition. Long-term fish IBI scores showed degradation in both watersheds since the 1930s. Changes in species composition suggest community homogenization on par with overall changes in the fish fauna of New York. Most notable were increases in tolerant species and declines in intolerant or moderately tolerant species. Whereas Fishkill Creek IBIs showed decline in 1988 relative to 1936, followed by improvement, Wappinger Creek declined monotonically in environmental quality. Development has intensified in both watersheds, but Fishkill Creek is improving while Wappinger Creek watershed is undergoing less mitigated degradation. We find that older, semi-quantitative data can be used to construct environmental quality indicators, and can be of great use for measuring long-term change.

AB  - The generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) in urban areas is rising globally and is having a negative impact on social, economic, and environmental situations. As a result, the environmental implications and resource recovery potential of MSW management systems are gaining traction. The major goal of this research is to evaluate Bahir Dar's solid waste management procedures by developing the Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, Response and Outcome (DPSIRO) framework indicators. Edraw Max and Cmap tools software were used to create DPSIRO framework indicators. Population increase, fast urbanization, and economic growth are all thought to be driving influences. The environmental state resulting from pressure was computed using the IPCC model and statistical analysis was done using SPSS software. The response indicators and respected outcomes are taken into account when the framework is conceptualized. In the years between 2007 and 2020, the population grew from 221,991 to 414,763. Driving force generates 73 tons of solid trash per day in 2007 and 148 tons per day in 2020. In 2020, the city's greenhouse gas emissions totaled 46 Gg/year. When the replies are implemented, the city may create around 47,772 tons of organic fertilizer, saving approximately 1,313,724 Ethiopian birr per year. According to the findings, Bahir Dar should begin implementing 3R solid waste management strategies to minimize potential environmental and human health risks while also maximizing economic benefits.

AB  - A study on Lake V'ng in Denmark demonstrates a high potential for loading of phosphorous via groundwater to seepage lakes. Groundwater discharges are displayed as an important source of phosphorous to a lake due to: (1) high concentrations in the aquifer just below the lake, and (2) the main flow paths through the aquifer-lakebed interface either being overland flow through a seepage face, or focused in zones with very high discharge rates. In-lake springs have measured discharge of up to 7.45 m(3) per m(2) of lakebed per day. These findings were based on seepage meter measurements at 18 locations, stable isotope (delta O-18) analyses, temperature profiles and mapping of ice cover distribution. Groundwater-lake interaction was modelled with a 2D conceptual flow model (MODFLOW) with hydrogeology interpreted from catchment multi electrode profiling, on-lake ground-penetrating radar, well logging and borehole data. Discharge was found to be much focused and opposite to expected increase away from the shoreline. The average total phosphorus concentration in discharging groundwater sampled just beneath the lakebed was 0.162 mg TP/l and thereby well over freshwater ecological thresholds (0.043-0.612, median = 0.117 mg TP/l). The study illustrates a direct link between groundwater and lake chemistry.

AB  - Because of natural environmental and faunal differences and scientific perspectives, numerous indices of biological integrity (IBIs) have been developed at local, state, and regional scales in the USA. These multiple IBIs, plus different criteria for judging impairment, hinder rigorous national and multistate assessments. Many IBI metrics are calibrated for water body size, but none are calibrated explicitly for other equally important natural variables such as air temperature, channel gradient, or geology. We developed a predictive aquatic-vertebrate IBI model using a total of 871 stream sites (including 162 least-disturbed and 163 most-disturbed sites) sampled as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program survey of 12 conterminous western U.S. states. The selected 1131 metrics (calculated from both fish and aquatic amphibians) were vertebrate species richness, benthic native species richness, assemblage tolerance index, proportion of invertivore-piscivore species, and proportion of lithophilic-reproducing species. Mean model IBI scores differed significantly between least-disturbed and most-disturbed sites as well as among ecoregions. Based on a model IBI impairment criterion of 0.44 (risks of type I and II errors balanced), an estimated 34.7% of stream kilometers in the western USA were deemed impaired. compared with 18% for a set of traditional IBIs. Also, the model IBI usually displayed less variability than the traditional IBIs, presumably because it was better calibrated for natural variability.

AB  - This study examined the distribution of wetland plants used in macrophyte-based index of biotic integrity (IBI) metrics to determine the effectiveness of zone sampling in assessing wetland condition. Using sampling data from a previous study of 74 emergent isolated wetlands, macrophyte taxonomic data and resulting IBI metrics were analyzed for various wetland zones and compared against the original site metrics. Zones were defined by parsing each sampling transect (from wetland edge to center) into thirds-creating an outer, intermediate, and inner zone-and constructing two additional zones representing two-thirds of the original sampling area-an outer plus intermediate zone and an intermediate plus inner zone. While a highly-significant decrease in mean species richness was observed from the wetland exterior to interior, there were no significant differences between metric values derived from site data and those derived from zone data. Linear correlations between metrics from the outer zone and site data were highly significant ( > 0.94), but linear correlation strength decreased with the intermediate and inner zones, respectively. Thus, macrophyte-based indicators of biological integrity can be efficiently assessed by sampling the outer third of a wetland-a 66% reduction in the area and effort required to monitor isolated wetland condition.

AB  - Sustainability was defined as the continuous support of human quality of life within a region's ecological carrying capacity. Ecological footprint was a quantitatively measuring indicator to analyze the sustainable use of natural resources and had been widely used to evaluate whether the development of a certain region was within the range of the capacity of natural ecosystem. In the present study, production data, consumption data and statistics communique of Zhifanggou watershed were analyzed to determine per capita ecological footprint, biological carrying capacity and related indices. On the basis of theory a model was applied that showed the biologically productive land area required by a defined population-ecological footprint model before and after grain for green policy. Result showed that after introducing the grain for green policy, per capita ecological footprint was reduced from 0.733 to 0.650 hm(2) cap(-1) and biological capacity was increased from 1.559 to 1.567 hm(2) cap(-1). There was a surplus of ecosystem resources both before and after the grain for green policy and this increased as a result of the policy. The related ecological footprint indices analysis showed that 10,000 RMB of GDP of ecological footprint was reduced, but ecological efficiency, ecological footprint index, bio-diversity of ecological footprint and system development ability increased Results demonstrated that conditions in this watershed improved and development potential was enhanced. Meanwhile, the sensitive index of forestland was strengthened more than other biological productive areas after introducing the policy. In adjusting and improving the land use structure created a resource-saving mode, forming resource-saving increase mode gradually, and triggering sustained consumption which will improve the ecological environment of zhifanggou watershed in the future.

AB  - The study presents the methodological and applicative scope of mapping and assessment of forests ecosystem services within the Integrated Environmental Monitoring Programme (IEMP). The IEMP operates within the State Environmental Monitoring Programme performed under the coordination of the Chief Inspectorate for Environmental Protection. The program targeting at the ecosystem services is implemented in 11 IEMP research catchments, which are located taking into account a diversity of the landscape-ecological zones and physical-geographic regions across the country. The research, being conducted since 2015, includes: typology of ecosystems based on land use and land cover data, assessment of the potential of ecosystems to provide services using the bonitation matrix, and identification of ecosystem services indicators on the basis of the IEMP measurement programme. The results indicate that the differentiation of ecosystems mosaic between research catchments leads to a specific mixture of ecosystem services for each catchment. Regional variation of the ways and intensity of the ecosystems use by society determines the different importance of individual services. It can be concluded that the IEMP provides helpful data for recognizing the structure and value of forests ecosystem services in Poland. The vast scope of the IEMP measurement programme and diverse character of research catchments give the opportunity to investigate a broad spectrum of regulating ecosystem services. Further efforts should focus on strengthening the interpretation of the measured parameters in the context of benefits for human, and determining conditions for extrapolation of obtained values to other areas.

AB  - A frequent side-effect of soil treatment with organic amendments is the slow release of harmful metals deriving from the initial matrices, mainly municipal waste and manure from intensive farming. Contamination is amplified by repeated treatments, which is a common practice to maintain soil fertility. The aim of the present research was to compare, in a mesocosm trial, short (one year)-and long-term (ten years) effects of a single application of compost or a mixture of compost and poultry manure to limestone waste. Attention was focused on pH, organic matter content, metal availability, and microbial biomass and activity. Amendment ecotoxicity at ten years after application was also evaluated. A single application reduced the metal availability and metabolic quotient (an index of stress condition). In the long term, an overall improvement of the environmental conditions has been observed, as the microbial biomass increased, respiration decreased (suggesting low energy requirement) and mineralization activity decreased (likely due to high recalcitrance of residual organic matter). In the brief term, poultry manure played a significant role in improving the environmental conditions as it contributed to reduce the metal availability and to enhance the microbial biomass and activity. In the long term, the overall conditions of both the organic amendments appeared favorable for organisms as low ecotoxicity occurred.

AB  - Establishment of an indices system for evaluating the ecological-economic-social performances of wetland restoration projects (WRPs) is of significant importance for finding the WRPs achieving successful conservation outcomes and guiding financial investments on ecological restorations. In this study, two different indices systems were developed for WRPs I (with wetland park) and WRPs II (without wetland park) respectively. For WRPs I, the ecological performance were measured by 7 indexes: water quality, aquatic vegetation coverage, aquatic botanic biodiversity, plant community integrity, achievement of buffer function, habitat protection and improvement, and intensity of anthropogenic disturbance activities, while habitat protection and improvement and aquatic botanic biodiversity were excluded for measuring the ecological performances of WRPs II. Output value of wetland products, wetland tourism value, and increase of house price in the surrounding area of wetlands were used to measure the economic performance of WRPs I, while only one index of output value of wetland products was used for WRPs II. Integrity of management operating system, public awareness on wetland protection, public satisfaction, scientific education service, and job provision were applied to measure the social performance of WRPs I, while only one index of integrity of management operating system was used for WRPs II. By using weighted linear combination (WLC), the ecological-economicsocial performances of WRPs were obtained. This new indices system was applied to 8 WRPs in Taihu Lake Basin, China. The results showed that among the 8 WRPs, 4 of them (Shangxianhe Wetland, Changguangxi Wetland, Lianghong Wetland, Daxigang Estuary Wetland) gained good grade in ecological-economic-social performance, whereas the Shibawan Lakeside Wetland, Daxigang Estuary Wetland, Dapugang Wetland, and Taihu Lake Shore Wetland were regarded as poor or very poor. In summary, only 50% of the WRPs gained good performance after implementation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, various foulants are tested with the conventional fouling indexes such as silt density index (SDI) and modified fouling index (MFI) under high TDS conditions to evaluate the practical appliance of these indexes for RO desalination. A new approach for developing a more realistic fouling index is investigated based on flow field-flow fraction (Fl-FFF) analysis. The results showed that the SDI and MFI for the feed waters containing the particulate foulants larger than the pore size of the membranes used in SDI and MFI measurements were not significantly affected by the feed water salinity. This is due to the fact I hat the main fouling mechanism is the deposition of particles on the membrane surface and, hence, the cake filtration controls the permeate flux. In case of the particles as well as organics smaller than the pore size of the membranes, the SDI and MFI failed to accurately predict the fouling potential of feed waters with high salinity. In addition, the characteristics of membrane (i.e., hydrophobicity) also played an important role in determining membrane performance. Based on the results from Fl-FFF analyses, it was demonstrated that both qualitative and quantitative assessments of fouling potential of feed waters with different foulants and TDS conditions were possible.

AB  - Inducible enzymes of microorganisms play the most important role in degradation of polymer compounds in water. Recently, water enzymatic activity has been emphasised as a new, potentially good indicator for water saprobity and trophic state of ecosystems. The aim of this work was to determine the levels of phosphatase activity (on p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate) in the rivers Cherava and Velgoshka and the littoral area of Lake Ohrid, where the rivers inflow into the lake. The enzymatic activity and the number of organotrophic bacteria were studied in the period from September 2013 to September 2014. The water at the studied localities was characterised from satisfactorily clean to slightly and very polluted. The statistically significant correlation between phosphatase activity and microbiological parameters revealed the phosphatase activity in the water as a good indicator of the available organic matter and the degree of eutrophication.

AB  - Climate-change adaptation has become a well-established priority in urban and regional development in Germany since the adoption of the German Adaptation Strategy in 2008. Recently, the socioeconomic aspects and concepts of vulnerability and resilience have received growing attention with regard to climate-change adaptation. This article introduces the TPR special issue on climate resilience and environmental justice. In so doing, it discusses the relationship between climate change and sociospatial inequalities, and their significance for climate-resilient urban and regional development. Based on this discussion and empirical findings from German practice, as well as the assessment of the policy context and participatory reflection, the article identifies several loose ends in research and practice that need to be connected by further converging concepts and indicators in climate-change and environmental-justice research and policies.

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess the ecological characteristics of El-Daba'a area in Egypt using GIS as a first step for the development of an environmental management plan for the area. The Absence of environmental planning in the process of land use development may cause many significant negative impacts on biodiversity, ecological value, and the general environmental conditions, and therefore, reducing such negative impacts will improve land use development. The first part of this sequel of two papers, which is part of a sustainable land use development research program, aims at designing a spatial framework to improve land use planning and development in an environmental context. The research program deals with the problem of land use planning and development in an and coastal area under environmentally sensitive conditions. The study area is El-Daba'a region, located in the northwestern coast of Egypt, which can be described as a wild area. The approach used in this paper consists of studying the spatial ecological characteristics of El-Daba'a region using different spatial data including maps and Landsat remote sensing data. These data are used to create a series of superimposed informative layers managed by a geographic information system (GIS) to describe the spatial ecological characteristics of the study area. The developed GIS allows decision makers to handle large amounts of information simultaneously such as geology, geomorphology, land cover, wild life and many other different information layers. The system is designed to help decision makers to organize, relate, analyze, and visualize the ecological data and information in the study area. The developed GIS system might be used to determine the probable effects of building a nuclear power station on the ecosystem.

AB  - Rooftop photovoltaics (RPVs) have an impact on the ageing failure rate and reliability of transformers. The advantages and disadvantages of different penetrations of rooftop photovoltaic on the reliability of the transformers are studied. For the first time, the adverse effects of high penetration of RPVs on the transformer failure and power system reliability are examined. Regarding the growing interest in the widespread use of renewable energies on account of global warming, studying the negative effects of DG units presence is so important to predict the future of power system conditions. Monte Carlo simulation is used for the probabilistic nature of clearness index and reliability evaluation. Well-being criteria that show the different operation modes of the power system is used to identify the at-risk, marginal and healthy mode of the power system in the presence of different penetrations of rooftop photovoltaic. The results show that the maximum penetration of rooftop photovoltaic for improving the reliability of the power system is 5 kW per house in the feeder of Isin in Bandar Abbas, in Iran.

AB  - Effects of short- and long-term exposure to a hot environment on diet digestibility and rumen passage rate were studied in four, 10-mo-old Friesian heifers housed in a climatic chamber. The trial lasted 65 d. Twenty-five days were spent under thermal comfort (temperature-humidity index = 64), and 40 d were spent under hot conditions (temperature-humidity index = 84). Three digestibility and rumen passage rate trials were performed during the 65 d. Chromium oxide was used as an external marker. The first digestibility and rumen passage rate trial (trial 1) was performed under thermal comfort; trials 2 and 3 were performed under hot conditions. Exposure to the hot environment reduced dry matter intake and increased water intake and rectal temperature compared with those during the thermal comfort period. Digestibility coefficients for dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber were higher in trial 2 than in trials 1 and 3. No statistical differences were found between trials 1 and 3 for these variables. Rumen passage rate was more rapid in trial 1 than in trials 2 and 3. No difference was observed between trials 2 and 3.
   These results indicated that exposure to a hot environment can affect digestibility in a time-dependent fashion, suggesting an adaptation of the digestive tract to hot environments.

AB  - During the years 1971 to 1991 we analyzed temperature and moisture supply of sown grasslands depending on altitude in lowlands of Slovakia. As an integral index of temperature conditions of grasslands, the sum of temperatures during observed period (the 1st April to the 31st October) was applied. Moisture conditions were evaluated on the basis of calculated hydrothermic coefficient K-3 according to Kurpelova (1983). The results obtained were tested according to the individual districts and altitudes (Tab. I). The graphical scheme of the grasslands temperature and moisture supply in lowlands of Slovakia are stated in Pig. 1. Temperature supplied to grasslands (2 898 to 3 443 degrees C) during grazing period does not appear to be a limiting factor of the phytomass production. The values of irrigation coefficient (K-3) fluctuate from 0.77 to 1.77 in evaluated stands. The driest region is western Slovakia. On the course of the years 1991 to 1995, we registered 151 tropical days and 407 summer days (Tab. II). Balance between intake and expenditure of moisture was at the value K-3 of 1.2 (Fig. 1). The stands up to 250 m of altitude have permanent moisture deficiency. The stands above 251 m do not have permanent moisture supply and in dependence on moisture balance of the year they have relatively good conditions for sown grasslands growing and their utilization by animal grazing.

AB  - Species occurrence can be affected by the availability of environments that fit within the limits of variation of its niche and by interaction with other species. Modifications in the environment, especially those caused by mankind, are considered the leading cause for species extinction. Such a response from the species is not random, with patterns that can follow functionality and/or morphology of each taxa. In this context, the objective of this study was to assess how environmental factors affect adult Odonata species, testing the hypotheses: a) that the environment acts as a filter upon the species by means of facilitating or excluding specific characteristics and b) that because of the order's requirements for thermoregulation and reproduction, thorax width and oviposition type are the variables most affected in the group. A total of 97 streams were sampled in eastern Amazonia, distributed along a gradient of different states of preservation, from completely preserved to heavily impacted by plantations and livestock. Six functional characteristics and seven environmental descriptors were selected, and to assess their relationships, a combination of Fourth Corner and RLQ analysis was used. The Habitat Integrity Index was the descriptor with the biggest impact on the Odonata community, presenting a negative correlation with wing width, thorax width and exophytic oviposition, and a positive correlation with endophytic oviposition. Macrophyte cover was the next most relevant environmental descriptor, showing a negative correlation with abdomen length, and positive correlation with thorax width and exophytic oviposition. The results show that poorly preserved environments favour the occurrence of organisms with a wider thorax and the substitution of endophytic oviposition with the exophytic type. Since changes to the environment do not usually alter Odonata richness but rather the composition, these results show a favouritism for groups with mentioned characteristics, such as Libellulidae, to the detriment of other groups (especially Zygoptera), which can result in community homogeneity and both biodiversity and functional loss. The maintenance of well-preserved environments is therefore indispensable in assuring Odonata biodiversity, as well as the best way to preserve the different behavioural and ecophysiological groups in the order. The Odonata community's response, directed through its morphological and behavioural characteristics, sheds light on ecological patterns, and thus the addition of oviposition habits in conservation measures aimed at preserving the order can render them more adequate, as this is a critical aspect of population maintenance and colonization of new sites.

AB  - The important features of the mountain areas may be synthetically assessed, based on several methods of numerical analysis (a series of indexes) of the ecological potential. In this paper we have analyzed the following indexes: De Martonne's aridity index, continentality index of Gams, hydrothermal index, pluviothermal index and snow index. To achieve this, climate date obtain from these stations were processed and compared: Arefu, Titesti, Campulung Muscel, Fagaras and Paltinis. The De Martonne's aridity index ranges from 39 (Arefu) in the tree forest zone, 50 (Cumpana) in the mixed broadleaf-coniferous forest zone, to 70 at Piscul Negru (in the coniferous forest zone), to 130 at Balea (in the subalpine zone) and to 157 on the highest peaks. The continentality index of Gams ranges from 1.6 at Arefu, to 0.9 at Cumpana, to 0.7 at Piscul Negru (1220 m), to 0.6 at Balea and to less than 0.6 on the alpine ridges. The hydrothermal index varies between 6 (the Arefu Depression) and -3 (the high alpine ridges). The pluviothermal index ranges from 10.0 at Arefu, to 11.5 at Cumpana and to more than 30 above 1500 m. Analyzing the data obtained it may be noted that climatic vertical zonality is reflected in the values of these indices. Based on this we can differentiate bewteen vegetation and soils vertical zonality

AB  - Environmental vulnerability can be understood as a function of exposure to impacts and the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of ecological systems towards environmental tensors. The present study empirically evaluated the vulnerability of forest stands that make up the subtropical Pereque River mangrove (Paranagua Bay, S Brazil) as the basis for a more appropriate management of its resources. This mangrove is located in the coastal municipality of Pontal do Parana (Parana, Brazil) and is part of the Pereque River Mangrove Natural Park, which is still not under a management plan. This study aimed to contribute to the future management plan of this conservation unit through an environmental diagnosis and an empirical evaluation of its vulnerability. The primary data, collected from 51 plots of 100 m(2) each, involved the evaluation of: 1) the exposure to solid waste, deforestation, trails, landfills, and constructions; 2) the degree of sensitivity according to the environmental conditions of each plot; and 3) the adaptive capacity according to the recovery and reproductive potential and structural complexity of the forests. These data were integrated to compose the empirical index of environmental vulnerability (VI) expressed as VI = (SI + EI) - ACI where SI is the sensitivity sub-index, El is the exposure sub-index, and ACI is the adaptive capacity sub-index. Empirical indices calculated for local forests varied significantly due to differences in values of SI, EI and ACI. This variability defines the local mangrove as a mosaic of vulnerability conditions and suggests that the planning and implementation of local management actions consider such environmental heterogeneity. Applying or extending these actions should be based on local forest conditions at short spatial scales and should not be applied to the mangrove as a whole. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Excessive phosphorus (P) loss from soils impairs surface water resources. An assessment toot or index has been proposed to identify fields with high potential risk of P delivery. The P index integrates P source and transport factors into a decision making process that may lead to changes in current P management and soil conservation practices. The index recognizes that a single soil P threshold alone is not an appropriate evaluation factor because of the varying conditions across fields. Although most indices being developed in the United States include similar factors, source and transport characteristics are considered in various ways to best address the variable conditions across regions. The Iowa P index reflects conditions that predominate under grain-crop production systems, considers source factors in a multiplicative manner within three main transport mechanisms, and approximates loads of P likely to enter and become available to aquatic ecosystems. An erosional component considers sheet and rill erosion, P enrichment, total soil P, buffers, sediment delivery, distance to a stream, and the long term biotic availability of particulate P in take ecosystems. A runoff component considers water runoff based on a modification of the runoff curve number (RCN), soil-test P (STP), rate, time, and method of P application. An internal drainage component considers the presence of tiles, water flow to tile lines, subsurface recharge from subsurface flow, and soil-test P. When the erosion risk is high, the index weighs particulate P loss heavily compared with dissolved P toss, and emphasizes tong-term processes comparatively more than short-term processes. This P assessment toot helps identify alternative P and soil conservation management options for reducing total P delivery from fields to surface water resources.

AB  - In the work presented here, a new technique based upon stereo vision is proposed to acquire three-dimensional time-resolved trajectories with labeling support for multi-species insects under unconstrained flying conditions. A low-cost, off-the-shelf depth camera is used for stereo vision which is equipped with two wide-angle globalshutter IR imagers to compute depth map and a separate narrow-angle color imager to have color and texture information. Two novel strategies are employed to tackle the challenges imposed by the small size of insects, fast movements, and natural daylight, etc.; (i) introduction of a simple but robust technique for detection and tracking of insects using only the valid depth map data and subsequently to acquire 3-D trajectories (ii) object localization scheme for the insects in acquired trajectories in allied color frames based upon the analysis of insects' flying kinematics and their 3-D location coordinates. The object localization of flying insects in allied color frames provides support to label the multi-spp. trajectories with respective types of the species. The proposed technique provides completely generalized solution to acquire 3-D trajectories of the multi-spp. insects in natural outdoor conditions and in the presented work it is applied to acquire the trajectories of honey bees (Apis mellifera) and invasive hornets (Vespa spp.) near beehives. These hornets are serious honey bee stressors and cause severe damage to the hive's foraging force. The trajectory patterns of honey bees together with Vespa spp. can be analyzed for early detection of Vespa spp. near beehives as well as to estimate stress levels on the honey bees. Acquired 3-D trajectory data are validated for trajectory measurements as well as for the labeling support information. A mean error upper bound of 5 mm is estimated in trajectory measurements whereas 100% interspp. and up to 94% intra-spp. labeling support accuracies are recorded.

AB  - Transplantation of bivalves between culture areas or systems that vary in environmental conditions is an important tool for growers to increase aquaculture productivity, but it sometimes leads to adverse effects on growth and survival. Bivalves filter ambient water including seston. Particles are retained on the gills and transported to the palps, where edible particles are selected for further digestion and where the rest is excreted as pseudofaeces. Both quantity and quality of suspended particles in the water affect efficiency of this process. As a consequence of transplantations, shellfish are forced to spend energy on adapting the gills and palps. This has implications for the energy available for growth and reproduction and might ultimately reduce yields. Here, we investigate, using gill-to-palp ratio as proxy, if adaptations in the feeding apparatus after transplantation of mussels to a culture area with higher seston quantity but lower quality, can explain an observed reduction in yield. We hypothesize that when mussels are transplanted to an environment with higher seston concentrations, (1) the gill-to-palp ratio becomes smaller, because mussels will grow larger palps to process the filtered material, while growth of gills will be reduced to reduce the amount of seston filtered and (2) condition of mussels will remain lower than reference levels during adaptation period. Three different mussel cohorts that were transported from the Oosterschelde (OS, NL) to the Wadden Sea (WS, NL) were monitored. Wadden Sea is more turbid (-2.4 x Total Particulate Matter OS), and is higher in chlorophyll-a concentration (-1.6 x Chl-a OS), but lower in food quality (-0.65 x ratio Chl-a:TPM OS). Gill-to-palp ratios and condition indices were measured from transplanted mussel cohorts and from reference populations over a period of three months. Results reveal that the gill-to-palp ratio between OS and WS is indeed significantly different (on average respectively 3.4 and 2.3), and that transplanted mussels show a remarkable physiological plasticity by adapting the gill-to-palp ratio within 1 month after transplant to match reference levels. They achieve this by a relative increase in the growth rate of the palps, while the growth rate of the gills remain constant. Condition index of transplanted mussels were not lower than reference levels with an equivalent increase. It is more likely that observed lower yields of transplanted mussels are related to factors that affect survival, because mussel adjustment to feeding conditions seems to occur quickly and mussel condition swiftly follows the reference population trajectory.

AB  - Eighty-four Bos taurus crossbred steers were used to investigate effects of level and duration of limit-feeding feedlot cattle in a hot environment. Pens (four/treatment) of steers (seven/pen) were fed feedlot finishing diets and randomly assigned to the following treatments: 1) restricted to approximately 75% of feed consumed when offered ad libitum for 21-d duration (RES21); 2) restricted to approximately 75% of ad libitum for 42-d duration (RES42); and 3) feed offered ad libitum (ADLIB). Tympanic temperatures (TT) were measured via thermistors placed in the ear canal and attached to data loggers. Restricting feed intake for both 21- and 42-d reduced tympanic temperature when compared with ADLIB treatment groups under hot environmental conditions. Temperature reductions exceeded 0.5degreesC (P < 0.05) depending on time of day. The reduced tympanic temperature is likely due to a reduction in metabolic heat load and/or a concurrent reduction in metabolic rate. Within respective periods, no differences (P > 0.05) were found among treatments for panting or bunching score. However, different proportions of cattle were found to be bunching and panting with ADLIB cattle displaying a greater number of bunched steers that were panting when compared with the other groups. When averaged across diet treatments, dark-colored cattle had the greatest percentage of cattle showing moderate to excessive panting, while light-colored cattle displayed the least panting under thermoneutral climatic conditions. Under hot (mean daily temperature-humidity index >74) conditions, dark-colored cattle tended to bunch more (P = 0.073) and pant more (P < 0.01) than light-colored cattle. Mean TT were 0.2 to 0.6degreesC (P < 0.05) greater for dark- vs light-colored cattle under hot conditions. Limit-feeding feedlot cattle during early summer is a successful tool for enhancing animal comfort by alleviating the combined effects of high climatic and metabolic heat load.

AB  - Managers of aquatic resources benefit from indices of habitat quality that are reproducible and easy to measure, demonstrate a link between habitat quality and biota health, and differ between human-impacted (i. e., managed) and reference (i. e., nonimpacted or minimally impacted) conditions. The instability index (ISI) is an easily measured index that describes the instability of a streambed by relating the tractive force of a stream at bankfull discharge to the median substrate size. Previous studies have linked ISI to biological condition but have been limited to comparisons of sites within a single stream or among a small number of streams. We tested ISI as an indicator of human impact to habitat and biota in mountain streams of the northwestern USA. Among 1428 sites in six northwestern states, ISI was correlated with other habitat measures (e. g., residual pool depth, percent fine sediment) and indices of biotic health (e. g., number of intolerant macroinvertebrate taxa, fine sediment biotic index) and differed between managed and reference sites across a range of stream types and ecoregions. While ISI could be useful in mountain streams throughout the world, this index may be of particular interest to aquatic resource managers in the northwestern USA where a large dataset, from which ISI can be calculated, exists.

AB  - Coral reefs are amongst the most diverse ecosystems in the biosphere. However, they also represent one of the most threatened marine systems. Apart from global change, especially fishing and tourism affect coral reefs either with mechanical damage or with increase of pollution and sedimentation. Recently, the increase of disturbances has induced extensive changes in community structure and composition of coral reefs. Well-balanced and rich communities can better resist disturbances and show a more rapid recovery, compared to less biodiverse systems.
   This study assesses the status of coral reefs subjected to several anthropogenic pressures, using a modified version of Coral Condition Index (CCI) that takes into account all Acropora and Pocillopora growth forms and considers a further category of coral damage: the presence of disease. The investigations were carried out at Bangka Island (North Sulawesi, Indonesia), where some of the most flourishing reefs in the country are present. The CCI takes into account the extent of different damages on coral colonies, particularly of the genera Acropora and Pocillopora, being among the most widespread bioconstructors of local coral reefs and very sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances. The aim of the present work is to test whether the CCI is a reliable index in different coral reefs, and to evaluate if highly biodiverse reefs show a better resistance to several human stressors.
   Data showed high values of CCI (0.9 on average) at all the investigated sites and at the two depths (3 and 9 m) for each site, with the most abundant category represented by "healthy coral colonies". These data indicate a reasonably good health status of the reef in the study area (CCI> 0.8). The presence of different types of human pressure in the study area was evaluated through the use of metric proxies. Results do not seem to show any significant influence of such human activities on reef coral status, as shown by the low values of correlation between CCI values and the distances of the study sites from the three main sources of stress (Villages, Resorts and Other). Moreover, the present data seem to confirm that highly biodiverse and well-structured assemblages can resist disturbances more efficiently and that human pressure in the study area is sustainable. Compared to fishing activities, the impact of Scuba diving on coral reef is lower, resulting more sustainable and ecologically non-destructive.
   CCI summarizes many kinds of information and can be applicable in various areas with different pressures. It is a useful tool that might help to assist and guide management decisions towards alternative development models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this investigation was to compare different indices for evaluating nutritional conditions of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in an alpine environment during the autumn in order to detect the most convenient ones for management purposes in our specific situation. Body conditions of 274 red deer were evaluated using kidney fat index, back fat index and body condition scores. Body Condition Scores was the easiest but the least reliable method. Both kidney fat index and back fat index were significantly affected by age and sex class (always lower in younger animals) and, in females, also by lactation status. In stags, a negative regression effect of culling date on both kidney fat index and back fat index was observed. A significant positive correlation between kidney fat index and back fat index was recorded. Both kidney fat index and back fat index were objective indicators of nutritional status and sensitive to changes in physical conditions, but back fat index was both quicker and easier to be measured. As a direct implication, we suggest that back fat index can be a practical and reliable indicator for monitoring red deer conditions in alpine areas during the autumn, provided that the effects of sex, age and date of culling are taken into account.

AB  - Species surrogates, the use of particular species to index habitat condition or to represent ecological assemblages are commonly identified in many ecosystems, but are less tested, and therefore less employed in estuaries. Estuaries provide important ecosystem goods (e.g. harvestable species) and services (e.g. carbon processing, coastal armouring), but require protection from multiple human activities, meaning that finding surrogates for estuarine condition or faunal assemblages is a significant knowledge gap. In this study, we test the efficacy of the threatened estuary ray Hemitrygon fluviorum, as a suitable indicator of ecosystem condition and management umbrella surrogate species for conservation prioritisation and monitoring purposes within estuaries. We surveyed fish assemblages and ray presence at ten sites within each of 22 estuaries in southeast Queensland, Australia, using one hour deployments of baited video arrays. We then tested for correlations between ray presence, a series of environmental variables considered important to ecosystem management within estuaries (i.e. testing rays as indicator species), and the co-occurring fish species (i.e. testing rays as umbrella species). Estuary rays function as both umbrella species and ecological indicators of habitat status in subtropical Australian estuaries. As umbrellas, ray occurrence concords with elevated species richness. As ecological indicators, ray distribution concords with habitats of good water quality (especially low turbidity) and more natural vegetation remaining in the catchment. These results highlight the potential for other threatened aquatic vertebrates that are both readily detectable and that are reliable proxies for ecosystems status to be become useful management tools in estuaries. The protection of such large, threatened species in coastal seascapes allows managers to address multiple targets for conservation, especially; (1) protecting species of conservation concern; (2) maintaining diversity; and (3) protecting optimal habitats by better placing reserves.

AB  - In this study we have developed an index for assessing trophic status and water quality in transitional aquatic ecosystems of Southern Europe. The index has been developed from the water quality index of the U.S. National Sanitation Foundation and integrates the main causal factors (inorganic nutrients), the key biological elements (primary producers) and indicator of effects (oxygen) of eutrophication. Six main variables have been used: relative coverage of benthic phanerogams and opportunistic macroalgae species, and concentrations of dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton chlorophyll-a, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. Non-linear functions are used to transform each measured variable into its quality value. Each quality value is then multiplied by a weighting factor, to take into account the relative contribution of each variable to the overall water quality. Finally, the index value is calculated as the sum of the weighted quality values, ranging from 0 (poorest state) to 100 (best condition). The index has been tested and validated in six transitional water ecosystems which differ in anthropogenic pressures and eutrophication levels, for which data sets were available from 1989 to 2004: Sacca di Goro (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy), Lesina Lagoon (Southern Adriatic Sea, Italy), Ria Formosa (Algarve, Southern Portugal), Mar Menor (Murcia, Southern Spain), Etang de Thau (Herault, Southern France) and Gulf of Gera (Lesvos Island, Greece). The index assessments have been compared with evaluations from the IFREMER (French Research Institute for the Exploitation of the Sea) classification scheme (France) and the trophic index TRIX (Italy), which are currently used for national monitoring of coastal waters and lagoons. Based on the conclusions of this study we suggest to use the index for monitoring water quality in shallow coastal transitional waters, where benthic vegetation controls primary productivity, which makes indices based on phytoplankton only (e.g., TRIX) unsuitable.

AB  - The effect of several abiotic factors (salinity, temperature and pH) on bacterial proliferation and survival time of the sea mussel Mytilus edulis L. were studied under anoxic incubations. In addition, the presence in the incubation media of ammonium and the volatile fatty acids propionate and acetate, both excreted fermentation products of the bivalve, was tested. Anoxic incubations with seawater diluted with demineralised water showed at the lowest salinity (50% seawater, SW) a significant increase in the capacity of M. edulis to survive anoxia as compared to both 75% SW and control [100% SW, corresponding to 32 practical salinity units (psu)]. Formation of biotic sulphide and ammonium occurred in all incubations. However, bacterial proliferation was postponed by 2-3 days at lowest salinity and accordingly, concentrations of both compounds were lower. Anoxic survival profiles of mussels collected from different habitats in the Dutch Scheldt area, characterised by differences in salinity (range from 17 to 31 psu), corresponded with the above salinity effect. Walsoorden mussels (17 psu) showed the longest (P<0.001) survival time under anoxia (LT50=17.2 days) as compared with Paulina (27 psu) and Wemeldinge (31 psu) mussels (LT50 = 12.8 and 9.8 days, respectively). Condition index (ratio of soft body weight to shell volume) was not correlated with anoxic survival time in untreated mussels, although this was clearly the case when the antibiotic chloramphenicol was added to the anoxic seawater. Acidification of the anoxic incubation medium had a positive effect on survival time. LT50 values significantly (P<0.001) increased from 10.2 days at pH 8.1 to 11.6 and 11.5 days at pH 7.3 and 6.5, respectively. Biotic sulphide and ammonium accumulation as well as bacterial numbers were significantly lower at pH 7.3 and 6.5 as compared with pH 8.1. Anoxic incubations at 10 degreesC (LT50 = 12.0 days) strongly increased survival time as compared to 18 degreesC (LT50 = 5.9 days). The benefit of antibiotic addition was also stronger at lower temperature (10 degreesC). Addition of both propionate and acetate (0.5 mM) displayed no effect on mortality of mussels under anoxia, but ammonium (0.5 mM) caused a negative effect (P<0.001). Biotic sulphide and ammonium concentrations measured in both volatile fatty acid incubations were lower than the control situation, as well as total bacterial numbers. This study shows that environmental factors play a significant role in determining the course of bacterial infection and death of bivalves exposed to anoxia.

AB  - The coordinated development of ecology and economy is one of the key issues of sustainable development. A full understanding of the relationship between ecology and economy is necessary for the coordinated development of the two. This paper takes Sichuan Province as the research area and county-level administrative districts as the research unit. Based on the medium value of the ecological quality index and economic growth index of each unit, Sichuan Province is divided into dual pressure zones (DPZ), economic backward zones (EBZ), ecological crisis zones (ECZ), and coordinated development zones (CDZ) and the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of each unit is studied. The results show that: (1) On the whole, the eastern part of Sichuan Province has a better level of economic development, and the southern part of the western region has a higher ecological quality. The ecological quality and economic growth pattern are highly correlated with topographical conditions. (2) The distribution characteristics of the four types of partitions are significantly different. The EBZ are more distributed in the western and southern of Sichuan Province, the ECZ are more distributed in the eastern, the DPZ and CDZ are relatively more sporadic. More than 90% of the partition changed zones are distributed in the eastern area. (3) The CCD of more than 95% units belongs to moderate coordination and high coordination. The overall CCD of the four types of zones has shown an upward trend from 2010 to 2015. Based on the results, Sichuan Province should follow the path of clear waters and green mountains are as good as mountains of gold and silver, and targeted sustainable development suggestions for DPZ, EBZ, ECZ, and CDZ are put forward. This paper provides guidance for formulating regional sustainable development strategies, especially in areas with unbalanced development due to congenital topographical conditions.

AB  - Plants that use crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) have the potential to meet growing agricultural resource demands using land that is considered unsuitable for many common crop species. Agave americana L., an obligate CAM plant, has potential as an advanced biofuel crop in water-limited regions, and has greater cold tolerance than other high-yielding CAM species, but physiological tolerances have not been completely resolved. We developed a model to estimate the growth responses of A. americana to water input, temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The photosynthetic response to PAR was determined experimentally by measuring the integrated leaf gas exchange over 24 h after acclimation to six light levels. Maximum CO2 fixation rates were observed at a PAR intensity of 1250 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Growth responses of A. americana to water and temperature were also determined, and a monthly environmental productivity index (EPI) was derived that can be used to predict biomass growth. The EPI was calculated as the product of water, temperature, and light indices estimated for conditions at a site in Maricopa (Arizona), and compared with measured biomass at the same site (where the first field trial of A. americana as a crop was completed). The monthly EPI summed over the lifetime of multi-year crops was highly correlated with the average measured biomass of healthy 2- and 3-year-old plants grown in the field. The resulting relationship between EPI and biomass provides a simple model for estimating the production of A. americana at a monthly time step according to light, temperature, and precipitation inputs, and is a useful tool for projecting the potential geographic range of this obligate CAM species in future climatic conditions.

TI  - Climate risks and socio-economic vulnerability in Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Climate risks, emerging threats to humanity, increase the level of disaster in many ways. A comprehensive understanding of climate risks and their impacts is a pre-requisite for developing suitable adaptation strategies toward sustainable development. This paper assessed the socio-economic vulnerability based on sustainable development goals (SDG) in the state of Tamil Nadu in the context of climate risks to comprehend the links between climate risks and the physical setting of Tamil Nadu, along with its capability to adapt. An indicator-based methodology of vulnerability assessment as per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was adopted to understand the links between the sensitivity of the state and its ability to cope and adapt. The climate extremities, which cause risks, were determined based on India Meteorological Department (IMD) norms. The indicators which directly or indirectly label specific/integrated goals of SDG were used as sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators. Data from each district for all identified indicators were collected from authentic sources and categorized into four components: natural, social, economic, and infrastructure. The indicators were analyzed and weights were assigned to the indicators using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The district-wise vulnerability indices were calculated and categorized as natural vulnerability index (NVI), social vulnerability index (SVI), economic vulnerability index (EVI), infrastructure vulnerability index (IVI), and overall cumulative vulnerability index (CVI). The study revealed the significant contributing indicators of risk and the vulnerable districts of Tamil Nadu. Ariyalur was identified as the most vulnerable district due to its high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity to climate risks. The other top vulnerable districts were Nagapattinam, Ramanathapuram, Thiruvarur, Thiruvallur, Thanjavur, Perambalur, Pudukottai, and Thiruvannamalai. The outcome of the study may be deliberated as an indicator of alarming socio-economic and infrastructural conditions of the districts and may help planners to prioritize their actions toward climate resilience.

TI  - An index of sustainable economic welfare (ISEW) for Chile
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
LA  - English
KW  - economic welfare
KW  - economic growth
KW  - accounting
KW  - Chile
AB  - Chile has experienced a period of strong economic growth. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has doubled in the past 12 years, however, income inequality remains relatively the same as in the 1960s. The economic growth is primarily attributed to the exports of natural resources, which accounts for 80% of total exports. However, the GDP fails to account for the loss of natural capital and non-marketed services. The objective of this paper is to more clearly indicate the status of the Chilean economy in terms of welfare using the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) designed by Daly and Cobb (1989). The ISEW provides corrections to the GDP that includes income inequalities, household labor and damage to natural capital. This index has been applied in several case studies for developed countries. In general, the results show that ISEW runs parallel with GDP until the 1970s when a decline in welfare occurs due to a loss in natural capital. This study is the first attempt to utilize the ISEW for the purpose of analyzing whether or not similar trends exist for Chile, a developing country. The ISEW for Chile grew at a much slower annual rate over the past 30 years, compared with GDP (-0.16% vs. 2.9%). The Chilean ISEW parallels the GDP until the 1980s; a decline in the ISEW then occurs, showing that Chile is not on a sustainable path and that there is a strong link between economic growth and the depletion of natural resources.

AB  - Biomarkers are measurable indicators of a biological state. As our understanding of diseases meliorates, it is generally accepted that early diagnosis renders the best chance to cure a disease. In the context of proteomics, the discovery phase of identifying bonafide biomarkers and the ensuing validation phase involving large cohort of patient samples are impeded by the complexity of bodily fluid samples. High abundant proteins found in blood plasma make it difficult for the detection of low abundant proteins that may be potential biomarkers. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have reignited interest in the field of biomarker discovery. EVs contain a tissue-type signature wherein a rich cargo of proteins and RNA are selectively packaged. In addition, as EVs are membranous structures, the luminal contents are protected from degradation by extracellular proteases and are highly stable in storage conditions. Interestingly, an appealing feature of EV-based biomarker analysis is the significant reduction in the sample complexity compared to whole bodily fluids. With these prescribed attributes, which are the rate-limiting factors of traditional biomarker analysis, there is immense potential for the use of EVs for biomarker detection in clinical settings. This review will discuss the current issues with biomarker analysis and the potential use of EVs as reservoirs of disease biomarkers.

AB  - Facing the pandemic COVID-19 is of highest priority for all researchers nowadays. Recent statistics indicate that the majority of the cases are home-treated. Two drugs of interest, Guaifenesin and Bromohexine HCl, are among the add-on therapy for treatment of COVID-19 mild cases, which has raised the need for their simultaneous determination. The analysis of the two drugs of interest was described using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) in plasma of healthy human volunteers using tetryzoline HCl as an internal standard (IS) after liquid-liquid extraction. The applied chromatographic conditions were Kinetex C18 (100 angstrom, 2.6 mu m X 50 mm X 4.6 mm) column and a mixture of methanol: water (95: 5, v/v) as a mobile phase at flow rate 1 mL/min. The positive ionization mode was used for detecting the ions, by observing the pairs of transition m/z 199 < 125 for GUF, m/z 377 < 114 for BRM and m/z 201 < 131 for IS. The linearity range was from 50 to 1500 ng/mL for GUF and 0.5-50 mu g/mL for BRM. Limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 35.16 and 0.43 ng/ml for GUF and BRM, respectively. The method was validated according to FDA guidance. The proposed method was assessed to be more eco-friendly versus the reported method using the greenness assessment tools: National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI), Assessment of Green Profile (AGP), Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) and Eco-Scale. The proposed method was applied for the application of a pilot pharmacokinetic study.

AB  - Infrastructure development in Canada's northern regions remains a challenge. Although scholars and policy-makers recognize the significant socio-economic potential of northern infrastructure, the prevailing piecemeal approach does not respond to many of the challenges faced by Indigenous communities. A pan-Canadian approach, such as a Northern Corridor, can circumvent some of the disadvantages stemming from fractured and uncoordinated initiatives but it still underlies the diverse environmental and socio-economic conditions across the Canadian North. The Nordicity index, originally developed by Hamelin, reflects northern Canada's diversity and has been applied as a public policy tool, e.g. for determining northern living allowances or adapted for transportation development. However, these indices are spatio-temporally fixed which means they do not recognize changing spatial patterns of northern mobility. Thus, this paper argues that northern infrastructure development should be informed by Indigenous spatial practices of mobility. To this aim, the paper investigates the role of Nordicity in Canadian policy-making and analyses how northern Indigenous spatial practices of mobility have transformed throughout the last century. The Nordicity index recognizes the environmental and socio-economic conditions across Canada's diverse northern regions but it should be complemented with an analysis of the spatial practices of northern Indigenous Peoples to inform future infrastructure development.

AB  - AHTN (tonalide) is a polycyclic musk that is widely used as fragrance additive in numerous consumer products. AHTN is of great worldwide concern owing to its adverse effects on aquatic organisms and frequent detection in both domestic and foreign aquatic environments. Therefore, derivation of the aquatic life criteria for AHTN exposure is urgently needed. In this work, AHTN toxicity data for eight Chinese native freshwater organisms were used to derive a criterion maximum concentration of 59.39 mu g/L and a criterion continuous concentration of 22.43 mu g/L using United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines. Toxicity tests showed that the annelid L hoffmeisteri and the amphibian R. nigromaculata were the least and most sensitive species to AHTN, respectively. The sensitivity of the planktonic crustacean D. magna to AHTN obviously differed from that of the benthic crustacean M. nipponense. The AHTN and HHCB correlation analysis exhibited a strong positive linear correlation (R-2 = 0.8622) in water. The ecological risk assessment showed that AHTN and HHCB posed a higher risk in foreign surface waters than Chinese waters, but a lower risk in foreign wastewater treatment plant effluent than in China. The ecological risks of AHTN and HHCB in most surveyed water bodies of various countries were at acceptable levels, with a few exceptions.

AB  - Since 1978, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has investigated the uptake and deputation by C. virginica of radionuclides released by the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant (CCNPP), which is located on the western shore of Chesapeake Bay in southern Maryland. This ongoing program presented a unique opportunity to compare radionuclide transfer dynamics and other parameters such as growth, mortality, disease status, and pleat condition for Crassostrea virginica and C. ariakensis in a side-by-side, in-situ environmental setting. Introducing the Asian oyster, C. ariakensis, into Chesapeake Bay has been proposed to help restore an oyster population to historical levels, to enhance the Bay ecosystem, and to contribute to the revival of the commercial oyster fishery. The population of the indigenous C. virginica has declined dramatically throughout the bay in part as a result of infection by two non-native protozoan parasites that cause MSX (Haplosporidium nelsoni) and Dermo (Perkinsus marinus) diseases. Other factors including habitat loss, reduced water quality, and overfishing have also reduced population size. Crassostrea ariakensis is known to be more tolerant to these diseases and thus may have greater potential for survival and growth in Chesapeake Bay than the native oyster. Triploid C. ariakensis and diploid C. virginica were immersed in cages in the vicinity of the CCNPP discharge for two exposure periods between July and December 2004. After retrieval, oysters were analyzed for radionuclide concentrations, growth rate, mortality, disease status, and meat condition. Fouling of oysters and cages was also observed. Quantities of radionuclides released by the CCNPP for both exposure periods were insufficient to produce detectable concentrations in either C. virginica or C. ariakensis, precluding a comparison of uptake of Co58, Co60, or Ag110 m, radionuclides that have been detectable historically. Shell lengths were not significantly different between the two species for the two sampling periods, despite the fact that there were considerable age differences between them, but C. ariakensis did show a greater rate of growth. Meat weights and condition indices for C. ariakensis were significantly greater than for C. virginica (P < 0.01). Mortality and Dermo prevalence and intensity were also significantly greater for C. virginica than for C. ariakensis (P < 0.01). Although quantities of radionuclides were insufficient to produce detectable concentrations in either species, this study provided a unique opportunity to examine C. ariakensis in an area of the Maryland Chesapeake Bay where C. ariakensis has not previously been observed.

AB  - Holistic indicators such as exergy and ascendency have been widely employed to assess the health of ecosystems given by their structure, function and organization. In this study we calculate the exergy, specific exergy and ascendency for the microbenthic loop that represents a major sub-system within the marine food chain. The analysis of the microbenthic loop investigated in terms of organic matter, bacteria, microphytobenthos and meiofauna reflected changes occurring in the trophic state of benthic ecosystems and provided a tool for comparison between different environments. Temporal and spatial variability of the holistic indicators were evaluated using benthic measures collected at different times for different environments in the Mediterranean Sea. Exergy was strongly correlated with the organic contents of the sediments, and did not provide a useful description of the investigated system. In contrast, specific exergy resulted related to the microbenthic loop structure and complexity while Ascendency mostly reflected its activity and organization. Temporal analysis showed that in natural ecosystems specific exergy and ascendency showed convergence and follow similar seasonal trends. On the contrary in strongly eutrophicated systems an uncoupling between the two indicators occurred indicating a malfunctioning of the microbenthic loop that become strongly dissipative.
   As a result specific exergy and ascendency calculated within the microbenthic loop appeared to be sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and trophic state and may be proposed as useful tools for the health assessment of marine benthic ecosystems.

AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) has been widely used to objectively address the physical condition as an index of stress. Though a numerous accounts of investigations on aquatic organisms' ECGs have been made, differentiation of ECG parameters in responding to specific toxic chemicals has not been extensively studied. In this research, it is hypothesized that zebrafish (Danio rerio) ECG parameters would differently respond to different types of pollutants, a heavy metal, thallium (TI, 0.10 and 13.00 mu g/L) and an organic chemical, deltamethrin (DM, 0.52 and 2.00 mu g/L). Based on the SOM training and statistical analyses, QRS complex could be specified as an indicator of TI stress, while QT interval might be used to evaluate DM stress. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that QRS complex and QT interval were significantly associated with TI stress (r = 0.854, p = 0.0002) and DM stress (r= 0.792, p = 0.001), respectively. QRS complex and QT interval had the highest R-2, the minimum of SSE and the lowest AIC value in TI and DM treatments, respectively. Bases on the current experimental results and previous reports, QRS complex and QT interval could be considered as a specific indicator of TI and DM disturbances in the environment, respectively.

AB  - Many states are replacing microbiological water quality standards based on "fecal" or thermotolerant coliforms (ThCs) with new standards that employ Escherichia coli its the indicator organism. Implicit in these new standards are assumptions about the equivalence of E coli enumeration tests and the E.. coli levels that will provide protection equivalent to former ThC standards. To investigate these assumptions, E coli levels in split samples (tests conducted on portions of the same grab sample) collected from small urban streams were determined using enzyme-specific media (Colilert (R), m-ColiBlue24 (R), and nutrient agar with MUG) and compared to levels determined with conventional culture media (m-FC and m-TEC). Although levels observed with all tests were highly correlated, significantly fewer E coli were enumerated with m-TEC than with enzyme-specific media (paired Student's t-test, alpha > 99%). In addition, E. coli were found to comprise a larger fraction (84-104%, depending on the test) of the total presumptive ThC concentration than that suggested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (63%). Both of these observations (1) the improvement in E. coli yields observed with enzyme-specific media, and (2) the greater proportion of ThC organisms that are E. coli, indicate that more water quality violations will occur when enzyme-specific media are used for testing than if conventional culture media are used.

AB  - Current energy quality evaluation indexes mainly focus on depicting energy quality in systems whose character temperature and pressure are higher than environment. However, when the temperature and the pressure are lower than environment, these indexes sometimes fail to properly assess the energy quality of the system. Meanwhile, quoting different references or benchmarks in the calculation of some thermodynamics quantities, one of which is energy quality, may also confuse energy system designers. These situations will thereby result in potentially incomplete or partial evaluation of energy quality in complicated energy systems like combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) systems. In this research, an adapted computational method of energy level which describes energy quality from thermal and mechanical perspectives has been proposed. In this method, energy quality of all-temperature and all pressure conditions can be quantified without quoting different benchmarks, which allows thorough energy quality analysis for complicated energy systems. Energy quality evolution of a CCHP system with energy storage units (ESUs) has been discussed in terms of the proposed energy levels. The thermal energy quality evolution depicted by thermal energy level indicates that high energy level from waste heat of power generation units will cause large energy quality loss in the absorption refrigerator (AR), since the generation temperature in the AR confines the energy level in the generator to a comparatively low value. In the CCHP power generation unit, thermoacoustic engines prevail over gas turbines in energy quality conservation. Furthermore, mechanical energy level analysis shows that the absorption refrigerator and the absorption cooling storage units have higher mechanical energy levels than other components in CCHP systems due to the high vacuum conditions. Finally, an energy level matching map is provided to suggest matching strategies between waste heat sources and energy storage techniques in CCHP systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The application of ecological restoration programs, related to water resources protection and soil erosion control, may have some undesirable outcomes. An important example is the effect that vegetation restoration may have in reducing surface water resources. After searching peer-reviewed articles, we selected 38 publications from 16 countries in comparable areas - semiarid conditions (aridity index <0.5), surface coverage >50% and fine soil texture - to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of vegetation (i.e., forestland, scrubland and grassland) in regulating runoff and sediment transport. In particular, we used three indices: the runoff reduction effect, the sediment reduction effect and the ratio between runoff and sediment reduction. These indices were calculated from measured data reported in the original articles. Results showed that scrubland had higher runoff reduction effect (59% in gentle slopes; 65% in steep slopes) than in grassland (39% on gentle slopes; 43% on steep slopes) and forestland (33% on gentle slopes; 51% on steep slopes). For the three types of vegetation, the sediment reduction effect was >70%. Concerning the ratios between runoff and sediment reduction, grassland showed the lowest ratios (56% on gentle slopes; 53% on steep slopes) compared to forestland (63% on gentle slopes; 65% on steep slopes) and scrubland (93% on gentle slopes; 81% on steep slopes). Our results indicate that low values of ratios between runoff and sediment reduction are the most suitable because they indicate an effective soil erosion and sediment delivery reduction but maintaining surface runoff. Overall, our study demonstrates that grassland may be the best choice for optimizing the trade-off between catchment water yield and soil conservation during the implementation of ecological restoration programs in semi-arid regions.

AB  - The trophic state of ten dam reservoirs was assessed using a zooplankton community. In order to determine the trophic state of dam reservoirs, we used indices calculated on the basis of density and species structure of Rotifera and Crustacea communities. Samples were collected once during summer 2012 in ten dam reservoirs. The largest numbers of zooplankton taxa were found in a lowland high meso-eutrophic dam reservoir (Koronowski) and the lowest ones in a submontane low eutrophic dam reservoir (Lubachowski). The trophic state was determined for the investigated dam reservoirs. In the case of the Rotifera community, the percentage of the tecta form in the Keratella cochlearis population and the proportion of high-trophic species in the total species density were the best indices to describe the water trophic status. In the case of the crustacean community, the best indices were the density of Crustacea and the biomass of Cyclopoida. The high value of all indices calculated on the basis of density and species structure of Rotifera and Crustacea was determined for Zygmunt August Lake, whose trophic status was defined as highly eutrophic to polytrophic. Our study has shown that zooplankton could be a good ecosystem indicator of the water trophic level in dam reservoirs.

AB  - In recent decades, there has been increasing interest in the application of ecological indices to assess ecosystem condition in response to anthropogenic activities. An Index of Waterbird Community Integrity was previously developed for the Chesapeake Bay, USA. However, the scoring criteria were not defined well enough to generate scores for new species that were not observed in the original study. The goal of this study was to explicitly define the scoring criteria for the existing index and to develop index scores for all waterbirds of the Chesapeake Bay. The standardized index then was applied to a case study investigating the relationship between waterbird community integrity and shoreline development during late summer and late fall (2012-2014) using an alternative approach to survey methodology, which allowed for greater area coverage compared to the approach used in the original study. Index scores for both seasons were negatively related to percentage of developed shorelines. Providing these updated tools using the detailed scoring system will facilitate future application to new species or development of the index in other estuaries worldwide. This methodology allows for consistent cross-study comparisons and can be combined with other community integrity indices, allowing for more effective estuarine management.

AB  - X-ray fluorescence analysis was applied to assess the ecological state of the area potentially polluted by emissions of the aluminum industry and heat power engineering. Soil and pine needle samples were collected in areas with industrial activity and analyzed using wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) and total-reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) techniques. Both techniques were validated using the matrix-matched certified reference materials. Different sample preparation procedures, such as fusion and pressing for WDXRF and acid digestion and suspensions for TXRF as well as quantification approaches (the external calibration for WDXRF and the internal standard for TXRF) were applied according to the features of the analyzed samples. The rock-forming oxides (Na2O, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, P2O5, K2O, CaO, TiO2, MnO, and Fe2O3) and trace elements (V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Ba, and Pb) were quantified in soils, as well as several elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, Sr, Pb, and Ba) were quantified in pine needles. Comparing the results of soils and pine needles analysis with the regional background values indicated a significant contamination pollution level of the studied area.

AB  - While phytoplankton studies on large potamal rivers have increased in number in recent years, upper river sections have received considerably less attention. However, in order to better understand processes that govern the development of dominance of euplanktonic elements in the lower river sections, detailed studies of the upstream areas are necessary. We studied the composition, diversity and recruitment of the planktonic algal communities in the River Sago and in its main tributary River Hernad, two characteristic rhithral river systems in Central Europe. Results revealed that diatoms are dominant elements of the phytoplankton in the upper river segments both in terms of taxa richness, and relative abundance. We found that composition of the phytoplankton showed the closest resemblance to that of benthic communities of soft substrates, highlighting the key role of riverbed characteristics in river phytoplankton recruitment. The occurrence of euplanktonic elements was not restricted to human impacted river segments, these taxa also occurred in pristine headwaters. Accordingly, planktonic algae potentially colonise small headwater streams naturally, although their dominance is expected to occur only at downstream reaches following impounded river segments. Diatom metrics used in ecological state assessment were calculated for the rithroplankton. These metrics fell in the range of values calculated for diatom flora on the hard substrates. However, the potential use of rithroplankton for quality assessment might be limited, because the high variability of index values at site level would result in misclassification of the ecological status.

AB  - Understanding how climate change and increasing human impacts may exert pressure on ecosystems and threaten biodiversity requires efficient monitoring programs. Indicator species have been proposed as useful tools, and predators and their diet may be particularly suitable. The vast and remote arctic tundra represents a good case study as shifts in ecosystem states are presently occurring, and monitoring is a major challenge. Here we assess what stable isotopes reflecting the diet of the arctic fox, a widespread and highly flexible top predator, can contribute to effective monitoring of the vertebrate prey basis of Arctic tundra. We used data collected over 2-5 years from six sites in the Eurasian Arctic and Greenland. Stable isotope signatures of arctic fox winter fur reflected both spatial and temporal variability in the composition of the vertebrate prey basis. Clear contrasts were apparent in the importance of marine resources, as well as of small rodents and their multiannual density fluctuations. Some important resources could however not be separated because of confounding isotopic signatures. Moreover, except for preferred prey, the proportions of prey in the diet may not necessarily reflect the relative importance of species in the community of available prey. Knowing these limitations, we suggest that the arctic fox diet as inferred from stable isotopes could serve as one of several key targets in ecosystem-based monitoring programs.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate the relationship between reduced air pollution and ecosystem services in Karaj metropolis, Iran. To the end, the trends in the concentrations of O-3, NO2, CO, SO2, PM10, and PM(2.5)as the main atmospheric pollutants of Karaj were studied. Five time series models of autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), autoregressive moving average (ARMA), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) were used to predict changes in air pollutant concentrations. Air pollution zoning is conducted via ArcGIS(10.3)by using spline tension interpolation method. Then, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images to analyze vegetation dynamics as an index of ecosystem functioning. NDVI thresholds were selected to present guidelines for qualitative and quantitative changes in green cover and were divided into five different categories. Based on the results, AR (1) and ARIMA (1,2,1) were recognized as appropriate models for predicting the concentration of air pollutants in the study area. A decrease in very dense vegetation coverage and increase in poor vegetation areas, followed by an increase in air pollution, revealed that the loss of urban green coverage and decreased ecosystem services were positively related. Furthermore, the expansion of urban lands toward the north and the west from the baseline to future condition led to great changes in the land cover and losses in vegetation along these axes, which finally resulted in increased air pollution in these areas. Thus, the results of this study can be directly used in decision-making in the area of air pollution.

AB  - Environmental proxies of soil erosion on Iceland, and oceanographic conditions on the adjacent shelf, were measured on a 50 cm box core taken from the southwest Iceland shelf in 1993 during cruise 93030 of the Canadian ship, CSS Hudson. These data, covering the last several centuries, are compared with the documentary record of sea-ice changes around Iceland since A.D. 1600. The site is under the influence of The Irminger Current, which carries warm, saline, Atlantic water northward along the shelf. Because of the relative warmth of this current, sea ice rarely occurs off southwest Iceland, even during the most severe sea-ice intervals of the historical record. In severe sea-ice years, however, the ice drifts clockwise around Iceland from the northeast and east and, in rare cases, reaches the southern coasts (Ogilvie, 1992). The chronology of the core was established by converting the basal radiocarbon date to calendar years and assuming a linear sedimentation rate from the base of the core to the year of collection, 1993. Organic carbon, stable C and O istotope ratios, planktonic foraminiferal assemblages, and sediment magnetic parameters were measured on samples from the core, plotted against calendar years and compared to the Icelandic sea-ice index. The environmental proxies suggest that increased soil erosion, reduced salinity, and, possibly, decreased marine productivity prevailed during the severe sea-ice interval lasting from the last quarter of the eighteenth century to around 1920. Such a situation could develop with climatic cooling, increased storminess, and toss of vegetation cover to stabilise the soil. Although the core site generally lies outside the sea-ice limits, the evidence clearly shows the influence of sea ice and fresh water, and is sensitive to the overall climatic deterioration manifested by the sea-ice record.

AB  - Minimal attention is paid towards the performance of the 40 million small-scale digesters which frequently operate at psychrophilic temperatures. Understanding the levels of microbial and chemical indicators at various loading rates and temperatures is useful for improving treatment efficiency and management strategies for small-scale digesters. In this study, semi-continuous anaerobic digesters were operated in replicate at four different loading rates (control, 0.3, 0.8 and 1.3 kg VS/m(3)/day) and housed in an environment that simulated seasonal change (27.5 degrees C,10 degrees C and 27.5 degrees C). The results illustrate that class B quality biosolids were generated for all treatments as per guidelines from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The simulated seasonal change did not influence Escherichia coli or faecal coliform levels, while it did appear to have an effect upon levels of Enterococci. Reduced loading rates led to a more stable environment (in terms of pH, levels of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and total inorganic carbonate (TIC)) as well as lower levels of indicator bacteria, but generated slightly lower biogas volumes (high - 53.23 L vs. low - 53.19 L) over the course of the study. The results provide important data to improve the performance of small-scale psychrophilic digesters, specifically by reducing loading rates to prevent souring during winter months.
