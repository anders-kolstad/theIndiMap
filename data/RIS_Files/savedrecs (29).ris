AB  - The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the firm- and regional-level determinants of a firm's adoption of open innovation practices. In particular, we categorise sixteen Korean regions into seven regional innovation types to account for each regions' varying innovation conditions. Using data from the Korean Innovation Survey and a hierarchical linear model, we find that firm-level factors such as firm size, R&D innovation capability and the number of networks for absorbing external knowledge and regional-level factors such as local government R&D funds matching had a significantly positive effect on open innovation. We also find that of the firm-level determinants, the number of networks had a strong effect on open innovation, and that this differed by regional innovation type. Based on these findings, we argue that innovation policy should strive to stimulate open innovation through measures that take each region's innovation resources and environment into account, rather than attempting to look for a single optimised model for all regions.

AB  - The analysis of the major and trace element geochemistry of Paleozoic terrigenous sediments from the Oldoi terrane, eastern Central Asian orogenic belt, supports a predominantly felsic source consisting of granites and recycled sediments. The geological data suggest that detrital material could be derived from Early Paleozoic granitoids, which were identified within tectonic blocks in the Silurian and Devonian terrigenous successions. The analysis of conventional discrimination diagrams indicates that the initial stage was marked by deposition along a passive continental margin, which continued in island-arc or active continental margin environments. This interpretation is consistent with geological evidence, such as the presence of volcanic interlayers and lenses in the Middle-Late Devonian successions and granitoids with ages of 386 +/- 10 and 371+/- 5.5 Ma. The timing of changes in geodynamic settings constrained by tectonic reconstructions corresponds to the age of the inception of the Norovlya continental-margin magmatic arc.

AB  - A routine was developed in C++ for the processing of social and environmental census data acquired by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The routine employs a simple graphical environment. The data generated are presented in a tabular format, which facilitates a broad and objective view of the values, and provides a convenient means of querying the database. The source code used to develop the routine permits updates and changes, as required by the user. Statistical and mathematical analysis enables the generation of social and environmental indicators, together with quantitative and qualitative classification of the socio-environmental quality of the region analyzed. As an example, the routine was applied using census data for the city of Sorocaba (Sao Paulo State, Brazil), including conditions of household occupation, water supply, sanitation, level of education, income, and other factors. It is envisaged that the proposed analytical model will assist professionals from different fields of research and teaching to develop urban planning and management strategies.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed the growth of new information technologies and their applications to various disciplines. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the two innovative methods, upper level set scan (ULS) hotspot detection and the multicriteria prioritization scheme, facilitate population health and break new ground in public health surveillance. It is believed that the social environment (i.e. social conditions and social capital) is one of the determinants of human health. Using infant health data and 10 additional indicators of social environment in the 159 counties of Georgia, ULS identified 52 counties that are in double jeopardy (high infant mortality and a high rate of low infant birth weight). The multicriteria ranking scheme suggested that there was no conspicuous spatial cluster of ranking orders, which improved the traditional decision making by visual geographic cluster. Both hotspot detection and ranking methods provided an empirical basis for re-allocating limited resources and several policy implications could be drawn from these analytic results.

AB  - With high variation in environmental conditions, especially during the extensive grazing season, genotype by environment interaction is potentially important to lamb production in Norway. Using breed as an indicator of genotype, the interaction between breed and environment, i.e. production level of farm and year calculated as solutions of a random farm*year variable, on 52 farms keeping both long-tailed Dala and short-tailed Spael during 1989-98 was studied. The dataset included 48,946 Dala lambs and 38,299 Spael lambs. The breed by environment interaction affected lamb autumn weights, and though Dala lambs were always heavier, the difference was substantially smaller at lower than at higher production levels: 1 kg increase in production level was related to Dala lambs' weights increasing 0.09 kg more than the Spael lambs' weights. The results indicate that breed by environment interaction may be of importance, and potential bias in the data and need for further research is discussed.

AB  - Algae are increasingly used for the purpose of environmental biomonitoring, for instance in the long-term program of the Federal Environmental Specimen Bank of Germany. Therefore, for the studies presented here, freeze-dried samples of Fucus vesiculosus collected from the North Sea shores were analyzed for a broad range of elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), while inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were carried out on digests. The entire analytical procedures, including held sampling, cleaning of material, sample handling, determination of blanks and instrumental parameters, are described. Certified reference materials analyzed in parallel with real samples and intermethod comparisons were used for assuring the accuracy of the analytical data. Reproducibility of INAA measurements was between 4 and 6% depending on the element considered. Possible sources of uncertainty and variation of the contaminant origins are discussed. Boundary conditions for the performance of algae sampling within environmental monitoring programs and the application of this marine bioindicator for the purpose of controlling time-dependent and local differences in element patterns are presented.

AB  - A rapid and simple method was developed to detect enteroviruses in large-volume water samples. It relies on the adsorption of the virus capsids to silica particles under acidic conditions, allowing their recovery by relatively gentle centrifugation. Different reagents used in enterovirus concentration and detection were seeded with Coxsackievirus B5 and used to optimise the recovery method, which was then used to detect the enteroviruses from seeded and unseeded 101 seawater samples in one PCR tube rather than in up to 50 sub-sample volumes, demonstrating its use for routine environmental monitoring. Concentrates from 36 recreational water samples from three sites in N.E. England were analysed for enteroviruses by regular and the new method semi-nested PCR, and infectivity in cell culture. Some of the samples were also analysed for faecal indicator bacteria and F-specific bacteriophage. The results showed a marked increase in detection sensitivity when the whole sample concentrate was assayed as compared with a small volume aliquot. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

LA  - English
AB  - A simple analytical expression aimed at assessing the theoretical reliability of a full-history time-temperature indicator placed on the surface of a food item as a predictor of the remaining shelf-life in the presence of heat transfer limitations within the food is obtained. Such expression, which depends on three dimensionless parameters only, can be written as a univariate function of a single parameter containing the thermal properties of the food via a suitable algebraic scaling. The derivation of the relevant formulae is based on the integration of a generic quality function across the slab-shaped food item under the assumption that the temperature on the surface of the food undergoes a sinusoidal variation with time. The analysis reported is useful because it provides a quick estimate of the effect of the thermal diffusivity of the food on the relative error associated with the use of a TTI when the activation energies of the food and the indicator are matched (as should happen in the idealistic case) under realistic environmental conditions of storage.

AB  - In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, single-use equipment is becoming popular for small-scale production schemes instead of stainless steel equipment. In this work, a decision support framework is presented to systematically generate alternatives at multiple decision layers. The framework includes decision layers for product specifications, the process flowsheet, equipment material, and operating conditions. Generated alternatives are evaluated on their economic and environmental impacts in addition to the risks regarding product quality and supply robustness. A case study was performed, where a comprehensive set of alternatives for equipment material was investigated with representative elements from other layers for the sterile filling of biopharmaceuticals. The results confirmed the preference for single-use equipment for small-scale and short-term production. Results also showed a preference for using fixed equipment for large-scale and long-term production. Generated hybrid alternatives outperformed empirically generated alternatives and provided a compromise between the competing environmental and economic indicators.

AB  - In this paper, the thermodynamic performance evaluations of the two-stage cooling cycle are investigated comparatively for different refrigerants under the same operating conditions. Due to their environmentally friendly properties, CO2, R600, R600a, R161, and R134a are selected as the refrigerants. The change in energy performance coefficient (COPen) and exergy performance coefficient (COPex) of the defined cycle are investigated according to the various indicators, such as reference temperature, gas cooler outlet temperature and pressure. Results are shown that, at the evaporator temperature of -5 degrees C and the gas cooler outlet temperature of 40 degrees C, the COPen of the cooling cycle are 1.644, 1.603, 1.452, 2.0356 and 1.928 for the refrigerants CO2, R600, R600a, R161 and R134a, respectively. Furthermore, COPex of the cycle are computed as 25.94%, 15.57%, 14.07%, 19.73% and 18.68% for the same refrigerants in the same order. In addition, the overall exergy destruction rate of the cooling cycle for CO2 refrigerant is calculated as 145.69 kW.

AB  - Water and sediment quality, macrobenthos diversity and mercury levels were assessed in the Salado Estuary, Gulf of Guayaquil (Ecuador) during 2008, 2009 and 2014. Severe hypoxia, anoxia and large fluctuations of salinity occurred in an impacted sector within Guayaquil city relative to a mangrove area within the Salado Mangroves Faunal Production Reserve. Significant inter-site and temporal differences were observed for dissolved oxygen, salinity, total dissolved solids, percentage of silts and clays, and species diversity. Macrobenthos' species richness for both sectors was greater during 2008. Sediments revealed high concentrations of total mercury (THg) (1.20-2.76 mg kg(-1) dw), exceeding Ecuador's SQG (0.1 mg kg(-1) dw). Sediment THg were significantly lower in 2014 than 2008/09.

AB  - Many recreational beaches suffer from elevated levels of microorganisms, resulting in beach advisories and closures due to lack of compliance with Environmental Protection Agency guidelines. We conducted the first statewide beach water quality assessment by analyzing decadal records of fecal indicator bacteria (enterqcocci and fecal coliform) levels at 262 Florida beaches. The objectives were to depict synoptic patterns of beach water quality exceedance along the entire Florida shoreline and to evaluate their relationships with wave condition and geographic location. Percent exceedances based on enterococci and fecal coliform were negatively correlated with both long-term mean wave energy and beach slope. Also, Gulf of Mexico beaches exceeded the thresholds significantly more than Atlantic Ocean ones, perhaps partially due to the lower wave energy. A possible linkage between wave energy level and water quality is beach sand, a pervasive nonpoint source that tends to harbor more bacteria in the low-wave-energy environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A major structural inconsistency of the traditional curve number (CN) model is its dependence on an unstable fixed initial abstraction, which normally results in sudden jumps in runoff estimation. Likewise, the lack of pre-storm soil moisture accounting (PSMA) procedure is another inherent limitation of the model. To circumvent those problems, we used a variable initial abstraction after ensembling the traditional CN model and a French four-parameter (GR4J) model to better quantify direct runoff from ungauged watersheds. To mimic the natural rainfall-runoff transformation at the watershed scale, our new parameterization designates intrinsic parameters and uses a simple structure. It exhibited more accurate and consistent results than earlier methods in evaluating data from 39 forest-dominated watersheds, both for small and large watersheds. In addition, based on different performance evaluation indicators, the runoff reproduction results show that the proposed model produced more consistent results for dry, normal, and wet watershed conditions than the other models used in this study.

AB  - Evaluations of technologies for heavy metal control mainly examine the residual and leaching rates of a single heavy metal, such that developed evaluation method have no coordination or uniqueness and are therefore unsuitable for hazard control effect evaluation. An overall pollution toxicity index (OPTI) was established in this paper, based on the developed index, an integrated evaluation method of heavy metal pollution control was established. Application of this method in the melting and sintering of fly ash revealed the following results: The integrated control efficiency of the melting process was higher in all instances than that of the sintering process. The lowest integrated control efficiency of melting was 56.2%, and the highest integrated control efficiency of sintering was 46.6%. Using the same technology, higher integrated control efficiency conditions were all achieved with lower temperatures and shorter times. This study demonstrated the unification and consistency of this method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Internationally the inclusion of health within environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been shown to be limited. While health-focused research has focused on the technical provision of health information, policy analysis theory may enable description and explanation of the institutional conditions surrounding health inclusion in EIA. However, whether this framework is considered useful by practitioners has yet to be tested. To investigate this, data were collected via a workshop (n = 22) and the results were analysed using 'Institutionalist' units of analysis (ideas, actors, organisations and institutions). These results were then emailed to participants who were asked to undertake a follow-up survey about the analysis and approach (n = 9). The workshop results suggested various influences on how and why health is considered or not in EIAs. Overall the survey respondents agreed that the approach was conceptually and practically useful but that the framework alone is insufficient and further work is needed to convince potential users of the value of health in EIA. The findings support the need for more detailed research.

AB  - An integrated fisheries management tool based on a bio-economic model was applied to the small pelagics (sardine) fishery in central Algeria (Mediterranean Sea). The basic bio-economic conditions of the fishery were established and relevant biological and economic indicators were analysed under different management scenarios defined by changes on fleet capacity and daily fishing time. The results show that the fishery is subject to high fishing pressure (1,548 units in 1990 and 4,445 units in 2007) (Maouel, 2003, Medrous, 2013) and current government policies aiming to increase fishing capacity (1,493 new units are projected for 2025) (MPRH, 2008) would likely worsen the conservation status of the resource, without contributing to a significant volume of catches or economic profits. Instead, a reduction of daily fishing time would allow decreasing the fishing mortality, without significantly reducing the total production or profits of the fishery to the current fleet. However, the short-term loss faced by the industry is a major constraint towards the acceptability of this type of management measures by the fishing sector.

AB  - The signature of carbonate minerals has long been suspected in the mid-infrared spectra of various astrophysical environments such as protostars(1). Abiogenic carbonates are considered as indicators of aqueous mineral alteration(2) in the presence of CO2-rich liquid water. The recent claimed detection of calcite associated with amorphous silicates in two planetary nebulae(3) and protostars(4,5) devoid of planetary bodies questions the relevance of this indicator; but in the absence of an alternative mode of formation under circumstellar conditions, this detection remains controversial(6-8). The main dust component observed in circumstellar envelopes is amorphous silicates(9), which are thought to have formed by non-equilibrium condensation(10). Here we report experiments demonstrating that carbonates can be formed with amorphous silicates during the non-equilibrium condensation of a silicate gas in a H2O-CO2-rich vapour. We propose that the observed astrophysical carbonates have condensed in H2O(g)-CO2(g)-rich, high-temperature and high-density regions such as evolved stellar winds, or those induced by grain sputtering upon shocks in protostellar outflows.

AB  - Industrial CNC-milling centers demand adaptive control systems for better product quality. Surface roughness of machined parts is a key indicator of product quality, as it is closely related to functional features of parts such as fatigue life, friction, wear, etc. However, on-line control systems for surface roughness are not yet ready for industrial use. One of the main reasons is the absence of sensors that provide measurements reliably and effectively in a hostile machining environment. One potential solution is to combine readings from several different kinds of sensors in an intelligent sensor-fusion monitoring system. We implemented such a system and compared three modelling approaches for sensor-fusion: multiple regression, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and a new probabilistic approach. Probabilistic approaches are desirable because they can be extended beyond simple prediction to provide confidence estimates and diagnostic information as to probable causes. While our early experimental results with aluminum show that the ANN approach has the greatest predictive power over a variety of operating conditions, our probabilistic approach performs well enough to justify continued research given its many additional benefits.

AB  - Nitzschia frustulum (Kutzing) Grunow is a widely distributed diatom taxon and very common in different types of habitats. It presents a wide range of variation in length, width and shape. The morphological variation of N. frustulum was studied in a culture experiment using specimens isolated from a Mediterranean salt marsh, where environmental conditions fluctuate over a wide range. The effect of three environmental variables on valve morphology was tested in a factorial design: salinity (0.5, 7.0, 17.5parts per thousand); N : P ratio (6.5:1, 16:1, 32:1) and water movement (movement/no movement). Salinity is the main factor affecting length, width and fibula density, but changes in N : P ratio and water movement also affect fibula density and width, respectively. Stria density is the most stable character studied. Short and wide valves were observed in all salinity treatments. The results corroborate the conspecifity of N. frustulum and N. inconspicua, formerly considered characteristic of N. inconspicua, a species limited to freshwater.

T2  - SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL

CP  - 10th Annual European Service Research Network RESER Conference
AB  - Analysts rarely consider that commercial malls offer a global service to the consumer It is commonly assumed that the consumers' decision concerning the place they choose usually for shopping depends essentially on the distance to the mall. This paper shows that, for such decisions, the consumer's satisfaction (an indicator widely used for evaluating the quality of a service) plays at least an equally important role in metropolitan areas where commercial zones are numerous enough to lead consumers to choice decisions. How the consumer builds up his/her satisfaction is the second point of this article. Different aspects (perception of shopping possibilities, expected pricing practices, general global environment) of each commercial zone do combine in the consumer's mind producing satisfaction or dissatisfaction. In these combinations, access conditions appear clearly to play a secondary role. It confirms that the two variables (access and satisfaction) are independently assessed by consumers. The city centre pedestrian streets are generally evaluated by the consumers with the same criteria as the outer commercial malls but they differ on some important aspects. These differences distinctly arise from specific consumers expectations towards the two kinds of commercial zones.

AB  - Microbiological studies of the digestive tracts of flounder (Platichthys flesus), burbot (Lota lota), herring (Clupea harengus), cod (Gadus morhua), smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), black sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), pike-perch (Lucioperca lucioperca), whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus), ruff (Acerina cernua), and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) from the Lithuanian coast (Baltic Sea) were carried out in 1995. Although heterotrophic bacteria predominated in the bacteriocoenosis of the tested fish, proteolytic and amylolytic bacteria were isolated. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were detected in high abundance in all tested species, but counts were highest in autumn with a maximum of about 3 x 10(5) g(-1) in ruff. Oil products taken up by fish with their food may be partly degraded by enzymes of micro-organisms present in the intestines. We argue that fish with a well-developed intestinal microflora have greater opportunity to adapt to changing nutritional substrates and to assimilate food with high efficiency, and that increasing environmental pollution by xenobiotics may affect the bacteriocoenosis of the digestive system.

AB  - Absorption spectra of six alkyl and two aryl substituted benzimidazoles (BI's) have been studied in Tween-20, Tween-40, and Tween-80 at pH 8 (neutral) and pH 2 (monocation). Absorption band maxima of the neutral as well as of the monocations of alkyl derivatives of BI's are hardly affected on micellization, whereas 5 to 6 nm red shift is noticed for the phenyl substituted BI's, under similar conditions, Effective dielectric constant (D-eff) at the micellar interface has been determined using the apparent pK(a) values for the monocation-neutral equilibrium of BI's from the correlation diagrams drawn between the pK(a) values and the dielectric constants of dioxane-water mixtures. High values of D-eff observed from the apparent values of alkyl derivatives of Bl's are due to the more water soluble nature of their monocations. Spectral data and the results of the apparent pK(a), values have shown that the hydrophobic character of the Tweens increases with increase in the Tween number.

AB  - During the period 2014 - 2016 in the Research Institute of Mountain Stockbreeding and Agriculture in Troyan was conducted a research experiment to determine the economic effect of imported bioproducts in the following fertilizing variants: 1. Control /untreated/; 2. Lumbrex - 1.5 L/ha; 3. Lumbrex - 2.0 L/ha; 4. Lumbrical - 150 ml/m(2); 5.Lumbrical - 200 ml/m(2). Based on the presented economic indicators, biofertilizer and fertilizing dose were chosen, combining high economic and ecological effect. It was found that for the conditions of light gray pseudo-podzolic soils, fertilizing with Lumbrex at a dose of 1.5 L/ha showed high productivity (11.3 t/ha), the lowest production costs (924.40 BGN/ha), the highest gross profit (2825.60 BGN/ha) and profitability (305.67%). The introduction of this bioproduct in the production of meadow grasses is an alternative for the realization of high yield and economically important technological solution for obtaining ecologically clean fodder production.

AB  - One of the main environmental problems attributed to land use in the Chichiriviche river watershed (Vargas state, Venezuela) is linked to agricultural activity, which causes conditions that trigger erosive processes in the soil due to the impact of the rainfall. The erosive potential and extreme rainfall intensities were analyzed as indicators of erosivity on the Chichiriviche River mountainous watershed. The spatio-temporal rainfall distribution and extreme event frequency were analyzed. The Indices of Annual Fournier, Modified Fournier, Rainfall Concentration, Total Erosivity and the Rain Erosive Potential. The spatial distribution of rainfall is controlled by the altitude. Its annual regime is characterized by a greater concentration of rainfall at year end. The maximum intensities ranged between 56.43 mm/h and 81.95 mm/h for events of 1 hour and 100-year return period. The indices indicated low to moderate rainfall erosive potential. The occurrence of erosive processes on the studied area is more related to extraordinary rainfall as isolated punctual events.

AB  - This study examined the removal of heavy metals Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+ from water solution by using perlite, perlite activated with oxalic acid and perlite modified with chitosan. The adsorption isotherms were also calculated. The conditions that affect the adsorption process were asserted as pH, adsorption dose and operation time. The highest adsorption yield among the four different adsorbent examined was provided by perlite activated with oxalic acid. The metal holding capacities were determined as 16.72 mg/g for Cu, 18.48 mg/g for Pb and 14.184 mg/g for Zn. This capacity was interpreted as the indicator of usability on the heavy metal removal functions in industrial treatment facilities. The experimental metal sorption of perlite activated forms is described best by the Freundlich adsorption isotherm model with determination values over 0.99. The research results prove that perlite and modified perlite are good natural adsorbents for the removal of heavy metal from water.

AB  - European beavers (Castor fiber) from two regions were examined to identify exposure to persistent environmental contaminants. A reference group was comprised of six animals from the Forest Division of Srokowo, and an exposed group was comprised of five animals from the vicinity of a former military airport operated in 1918-1986-both from Warmia land in Poland. Cs-137 in beavers' muscles was considered negligible for the overall condition and reproduction of the animals. Elevated levels of Cd and Pb occurred in the kidneys and liver of beavers from a former military airport area. dl-PCBs were found in the liver of all specimens, and pCB no. 118 was a dominant compound. Beavers as animals living both in water and land habitats can be good bioindicators of heavy metal environmental pollution caused by human activity. Despite the significant contamination of former military sites in northeastern Poland, the beaver population shows an upward trend, reflecting the excellent adaptation of this species to a changing environment.

AB  - Here we describe use of a mitochondrial targeted Cameleon to produce stably transformed Arabidopsis plants that enable analyses of mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics in planta and allow monitoring of the intra-mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration in response to physiological or environmental stimuli. Transgenic plants co-expressing nuclear and mitochondrial targeted Cameleons were also generated and analyzed. Here we show that mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation is strictly related to the intensity of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ increase, demonstrating a tight association between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic Ca2+ dynamics. However, under all experimental conditions, mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics were substantially different from those monitored in the cytoplasm, demonstrating that mitochondria do not passively sense cytosolic Ca2+, but actively modulate the intra-mitochondrial level of the cation. In particular, our analyses show that the kinetics of Ca2+ release from mitochondria are much slower than in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The mechanisms and functional implications of these differences are discussed.

AB  - Directives and policies increasingly call for more integrated management of land and water. Frameworks such as integrated catchment management may address these calls, and yet their implementation requires decisions to be taken under conditions of extreme complexity and uncertainty. This paper summarises a participatory framework through which decision-makers, experts and system modellers can collaboratively develop an integrated model to support such decisions. A feasibility study showed the potential of the framework. An operational version of the model, able to analyse the effects of 50 management options on 20 indicators, is estimated to require in the order of 225 man-months from system modellers, alongside substantial inputs from stakeholders. The significant technical challenges confronting such an exercise may be overshadowed by the institutional challenges, including the fundamental question of whether organisations are truly committed. However, the reward for overcoming such challenges is the opportunity to achieve genuine improvements in the social, economic and environmental quality of our catchments.

AB  - We intended to establish how efficient the leaf antioxidant responses of C. echinata are against oxidative environmental conditions observed in an urban environment and their relations to growth and biomass parameters. Plants were grown for 15 months in four sites: Congonhas and Pinheiros, affected by pollutants from vehicular emissions; Ibirapuera, affected by high O(3) concentrations; and a greenhouse with filtered air. Fifteen plants were quarterly removed from each site for analysis of antioxidants, growth and biomass. Plants growing in polluted sites showed alterations in their antioxidants. They were shorter, had thicker stems and produced less leaf biomass than plants maintained under filtered air. The fluctuations in the levels of antioxidants were significantly influenced by combined effects of climatic and pollution variables. The higher were the antioxidant responses and the concentrations of pollutant markers of air contamination in each site the slower were the growth and biomass production. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A growing literature on small-area effects has linked neighborhood conditions with indicators of child well-being. This paper addresses some of the challenges in identifying and understanding these linkages, with a focus on children's definitions and perceptions of their neighborhood geographies. The study included 60 children aged 7 to 11 and one of their parents in five neighborhoods (census tracts). Neighborhood maps were elicited from both children and parents. Child and parent maps showed only a modest correlation, suggesting that children have their own conceptions of their neighborhoods. Also, home range was not equated with children's definitions of neighborhood boundaries. Accurate and meaningful measures of neighborhood, including child-centered measures, are needed. Child-centered neighborhood indicators are an important complement to the measures that are increasingly available for standard neighborhood units. The neighborhood is a potentially important context for improving child well-being by developing area-based programs to address spatial inequality in child well-being.

AB  - We investigate the tsunami hazard associated with the Perachora fault at eastern Corinth Gulf, Greece. Realistic faulting parameters are used to model expected coseismic displacements of the seafloor. This study also investigates the effect that rupture complexity has on the local tsunami wave field. Several earthquake scenarios are used as initial conditions for tsunami stimulation either considering the numerous published constant slip models or taking into account the fault rupture complexity with the help of a realistic finite-extent k(-2) stochastic kinematic source model with k-dependent rise time. The obtained results indicate that there is substantially more variation in the local tsunami wave field derived from the inherent complexity of the shallow fault zone than predicted by a simple elastic dislocation model. Rupture complexity, as represented by heterogeneous slip-distribution patterns, has an important effect on near-field tsunami records. Tsunami hazards assessments based on only a few scenario earthquakes may not accurately account for natural variation in tsunami amplitude caused by earthquake rupture complexity.

AB  - Anadromous salmonid females exhibit indicators of mate choice based on male size. Direct benefits to females of mating with larger males have not been identified for semelparous Pacific salmon, Oncorhynchus spp. We tested the null hypothesis that females forced to spawn naturally in a stream channel and artificially (gametes removed manually) with males about half their body mass would experience egg fertilization rates similar to that of females forced to spawn with males of about equal mass. Fertilization rates did not differ significantly between large- and small-male pairs. The fertilization rates were also very similar for eggs deposited naturally and those that we fertilized artificially. Therefore, fertilization success does not appear to be the mechanism responsible for female mate choice based on male size. Benefits of females mating with larger males probably have only indirect (i.e., genetic) benefits to a female's offspring, as suggested by previous authors.

AB  - A dataset of well and spring locations in NW Anglesey with accompanying geological observations was recently discovered at the British Geological Survey. The data are likely to have been recorded as part of an environmental survey in the late 1960s or early 1970s. The area comprises Palaeozoic and Precambrian rocks partly covered by moderately permeable till. The bedrock forms a shallow fracture aquifer, which offers individual well and spring discharges upto 21 s(-1). The newly discovered data provided an indicator of the hydraulic characteristics of each bedrock type such that the Holyhead Quartzite Formation offers the least favourable hydraulic conditions, whereas a small area of Silurian (Llandovery) strata at Parys Mountain offers the most favourable hydraulic characteristics. The occurrence of discontinuities caused by dyke intrusion and metamorphic foliation make some Precambrian strata better disposed to successful well digging than others. Base flow index data indicate that storativity is greatest in the Precambrian and the Carboniferous Limestone Formation. Groundwater chemistry reflects shallow, short groundwater flowpaths.

AB  - A tracer test to examine in situ denitrification in shallow groundwater by a piezometer with a packer system used bromide as a tracer of dilution and acetylene (10%) to block the denitrification process at the nitrous oxide stage. During the test, dissolved oxygen, nitrate (NO3-) bromide (Br-), nitrous oxide (N2O) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured. To calibrate the experimental method, comparison with numerical simulations of the groundwater transfer were carried out, taking into account the environmental characteristics. The method was tested by measurements undertaken in different environmental conditions (geology, land use and hydrology) in two riparian wetlands. Denitrification rates measured by this method ranged from 5.7 10(-6) g N-NO3-L-1 h(-1) to 1.97 10(-3) g N-NO3-L-1 h(-1) The method is applicable in shallow aquifers with a permeability from 10(-2) to 10(-4) m s(-1).

AB  - Specimens of the woodlouse Oniscus asellus were collected at four clean field sites and from a recently closed iron foundry heavily contaminated with zinc, lead, chromium, and nickel. Each of the 30 woodlice per group was housed individually and acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 2 d on a humid plaster of paris substrate. Thereafter, the locomotor behavior of each animal was measured for 4 h employing automated computer-aided video tracking. Linear discriminant analysis of five locomotor parameters revealed average velocity and path length as the principle components separating the polluted site and control animals. Post hoc analysis of the discriminant variable for animals from all five sites showed that the animals from the polluted site where significantly hyperactive when compared to all controls. Further, control animals collected from sites separated by several hundred kilometers were remarkably similar in their locomotor behavior. This preliminary study highlights the potential utility of quantitative analysis of animal locomotor behavior in environmental monitoring.

AB  - The occurrence and extension of avian mycobacteriosis in house-sparrows (P. domesticus) and mountain-sparrows (P. montarus) have been followed under different epidemiological conditions. Out of 2.929 totally examined house-sparrow pathological changes of tuberculosis were found in 3 (0.10 %) animals and in 14 (0.48 %) animals the mycobacteria were isolated. By an examination ofanimals the mycobacteria were isolated. By an examination of 544 mountain-sparrow the mycobacteria in 12 (2.20 %) cases and in 1 case were isolated and the mycobacteria were found in the intestinal contents.
   Out of 11 different locations the mycobacteria were found only in places where a contact between sparrows and poultry contaminated by TBC was possible. In some cases the sparrow could be a source of mycobacteria for cattle as well. Simultaneously, the occurrence of TBC in sparrows out of cattle stables correlated with high incidence of avian tuberculin reactions in cattle stabled there. The sparrow could be here not only the source but also an indicator of mycobacteria environment infection. All isolated strains of mycobacteria were virulent for poultry.

AB  - Sublethal (0-2.1 kg/ha) effects of glyphosate were evaluated on white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) seedlings grown outdoors and under controlled-environment conditions. Leaf fluorescence, photosynthetic pigments, ethylene, and changes in the shikimic acid pathway were used as indicators of these effects. Leaf fluorescence steadily increased in treated birch seedlings for 9 days, indicating decreased photosynthetic efficiency. After this period, a gradual decline occurred, suggesting recovery of the photosystems. Chlorophyll a and b levels decreased within 4 days of application, whereas carotenoid content increased. Treated seedlings exhibited increased ethylene production compared with control seedlings. Shikimic acid levels increased 10-fold within 24 h of application, even at 1% of the field rate, and were still elevated in the spring of the following year. Gallic acid, another compound on the shikimic acid pathway, also increased in treated seedlings. Of the several parameters measured, glyphosate had the greatest effect on shikimic acid and differences occurred long before visual injury was observed. Shikimic acid level showed responses to low concentrations of glyphosate that produced no visible symptoms.

AB  - Improvement of a city's liveability, especially in developing countries, is increasingly viewed as a way to enhance city dwellers' quality of life. This study applied remote sensing and GIS-based techniques to assess urban livability conditions based on the World Health Organization guidelines. For this, 21 fine-grained spatial indicators were selected, and a geographically weighted principal component analysis was applied to evaluate the spatial pattern of urban livability in Raiganj. The results showed that the city's central and eastern part had a livability index score over 0.75 (5.31 km(2) area) appeared as the most livable. The southwestern part of the city was the least livable. Finally, the predicted Land Use Land Cover for 2025 in Raiganj based on the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network-Markov Chain showed that the city (+19.50%) will expand mainly in the eastern direction at the expense of green and blue spaces.

AB  - Luz Marina Garcia Herrera, professor at the University of La Laguna, colleague, teacher and friend, passed away in June 2020. A reference in Spanish Urban Geography, her contribution to the debate on the shaping of the city and the social dynamics inherent to it has opened up timely and necessary lines of work. She anchors her background in the interpretation of urban social processes under capitalism, focusing on key issues such as marginal developments, gentrification mechanisms or different facets of urban segregation. In addition she also approaches other issues in which we have been able to share time and space with her. Among them the constant and changing conditioning between physical and social environments in the city and consequences, or the reading of public spaces, their use and appropriation keys, as an indicator of cohesion as well as an instrument for the transformation of specific realities.
   All of this, and even more his commitment and his profound humanity, which we are proud to have learned from, motivate these lines.

AB  - Social capital is a widely recognized critical intangible resource for firm success, especially in family businesses, which are considered "emotional arenas". CEOs' social capital could represent a decisive factor, although its influence is unclear. This research aims to deepen the relationship between CEOs' social capital and firm investment opportunity set (IOS). The research hypothesis assumes a positive relationship between CEO social capital and firm's IOS. CEO social capital is estimated considering network centrality indicators suggested by the authoritative social network analysis literature. The IOS is represented by a single composite indicator of four price-based proxies and one accounting variable. Using a wide sample of listed Italian family firms, the analysis shows that a CEO with a broader relational network decreases firm investment opportunities. The findings suggest that family businesses, in the Italian context, lack the environmental conditions and critical factors to valorize the CEO's social capital in terms of future investment opportunities.

AB  - The heavy metal pollution status of oyster reefs has been assessed with respect to ten metals pollutants in seawater, sediments, and tissues of above two oysters (soft tissues and shells) for assessing the pollution status in a short food chain in Hab River Delta. The results showed that heavy metals accumulated in M. bilineata were higher than those in M. cuttackensis. Simultaneously, the population of M. bilineata species has been ironically decreasing as a results of high pollution. The determined concentrations revealed a significant differences in their profiles among sediments, seawater and bioaccumulation in tissues and shells of two native oysters. The present study also compared these metal concentrations with national and international database by applying different pollution indices. Heavy metals in all samples were above the national environmental quality standards (NEQS-Pakistan). High level of pollution with an alarming condition of Hab River Delta need more attention for coastal management.

AB  - In this study, the vibration characteristics of a thin eccentric rotating circular cylindrical shell with simply supported boundary conditions are studied. Energy formulations based on Flugge's thin shell theory, Hamilton's principle, and the method of linear approximation are applied to derive the governing equations of motion. In addition to the effects of centrifugal and Coriolis forces, the effect of nonuniform initial stresses resulting from eccentric rotation are taken into account. The natural frequencies of the shell with respect to rotating speed and eccentricity are obtained using Galerkin's method. To validate the present analysis, comparisons are carried out with the results in published literatures and finite element analysis, and good agreements are obtained. The effect of the eccentricity on the natural frequency of the eccentric rotating cylindrical shell is investigated. Some further numerical results are given to illustrate the irregular frequency mutation behaviors resulting from the eccentricity. The effects of the eccentricity on the critical speed and flutter speed of the eccentric rotating circular cylindrical shell are also investigated.

AB  - As a result of habitat fragmentation, the environmental structures of forest remnants change and alter their microclimatic conditions. Edaphic beetles comprise several families that are considered effective bioindicators. In this study, we analyzed how environmental parameters and fragment size affect edaphic beetle assemblage in a fragmented rainforest landscape in Brazil. Beetles were sampled in 12 forest fragments using pitfall traps. Fragment size, tree density and diameter, litter depth and dry weight, and canopy cover were measured in each forest fragment. Staphylinidae and Carabidae were the beetle families with the highest species richness, whereas Scarabaeidae and Nitidulidae were the most abundant families. Beetle abundance was positively affected by litter dry weight and fragment size. In addition, species composition was significantly affected by fragment area. In conclusion, forest patch size is an important parameter for maintaining edaphic beetle assemblages in tropical rainforests, causing major shifts in its abundance and species distribution.

AB  - Heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) pose a significant health hazard through bioaccumulation and biomagnification. By penetrating cell membranes, heavy metal ions may lead to pathological conditions. Here we examined the responses of Ammonia parkinsoniana, a benthic foraminiferan, to different concentrations of Hg in the artificial sea water. Confocal images of untreated and treated specimens using fluorescent probes (Nile Red and Acridine Orange) provided an opportunity for visualizing the intracellular lipid accumulation and acidic compartment regulation. With increased Hg over time, we observed an increased number of lipid droplets, which may have acted as a detoxifying organelle where Hg is sequestered and biologically inactivated. Further, Hg seems to promote the proliferation of lysosomes both in terms of number and dimension that, at the highest level of Hg, resulted in cell death. We report, for the first time, the presence of Hg within the foraminiferal cell: at the basal part of pores, in the organic linings of the foramen/septa, and as cytoplasmic accumulations.

AB  - Potassium utilization efficiency (KUE) for plants is related to genotype difference, soil characteristics, application of fertilizer and irrigation. Up to now, the KUE of different genotypes worldwide has been extensively studied, but the influence of environment stress on KUE of cotton is infrequently reported. Thus, we selected a high K utilization efficiency cotton genotype (HEG) and a low K utilization efficiency cotton genotype (LEG) as indicator plants. The results showed that both soil water stress and K stress limited the growth of cotton genotypes. The change of soil water levels had significant influence on yield, KUE, rates of fallen leaves and bolls (RF), biomass and potassium accumulation in cotton. Deficient of soil water restricted the uptake and translocation of K. The absence of soil K greatly increased the proportion of biomass of reproductive organs and K distribution to reproductive organs in this experiment. The HEG exhibited higher physiological compared with LEG under the stress conditions, especially under low K treatment.

AB  - Shira Lake is a good representative object for detail weather-climate modeling due to its local hydroclimatic information and annually laminated bottom sediments. Carbonate biochemical mineralization in Shira Lake shows not only seasonal but also centennial pulses over each 450-500 years. An age-depth model has been built by layer counting combined with Cs-137 and C-14 isotopic dates. Thermodynamic estimation of the rock-water multisystem in conformity with local conditions and source matter provides grounds for interpretation of measured geochemical parameters in sediments including environmental indicators such as temperature, salinity, and pH. Scanning X-ray fluorescence for sub-millimeter microstratigraphic study of varves connects geochemical oscillations of microelement content (Rb, Ti, Ca, Sr, Br, XRD) with seasonality, as well as revealing centennial pulses of environmental change. Quantitative environmental reconstruction using multiple regression for precipitation calibrated by hydrometeorological time series year by year was carried out for the lake over the last 2500 years.

AB  - In a naphtha distillation process, the natural objective is to perform an entire process maximization of the production rate while meeting required product qualities by searching for an optimal operating condition by manipulating the operating variables. The objective of this paper includes performing an energy process optimization. Not only is an adequate production rate met with the required product qualities but the operating cost is also minimized through a data mining approach. The study of the influence of all process attributes in the defined Energy Efficient Indicator (EEI) allows the construction of a multivariate linear model to aid human experts in the recovery of energy losses. A canonical discriminant function carried out the data prediction step. The quality of the Decision Support System framework is illustrated by a case study considering a real database. Also, a commercial software supported by this mining framework is presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present paper addresses the issue of buffalo welfare. Firstly, the biological characteristics and behavioural needs of buffalo are considered. Subsequently, the effects of intensive farming and some animal-related indicators, to be used for a monitoring scheme of buffalo welfare at farm level, are described. The attention was focused on the following indicators: excessive thinning or fattening assessed with Body Condition Score (BCS) systems; cleanliness (the presence of mud may be considered positively, whereas a thick and compact layer of dung may be regarded negatively); health status (lameness, hoof overgrowth, injuries, etc.); social, aggressive, oral abnormal behaviours; animal-human relationship (avoidance distance at manger); positive indicators (qualitative assessment of behaviour, etc.); housing factors. The indicators are discussed on the basis of their validity (meaningful with respect to animal welfare), reliability (reflecting the tendency to give the same results on repeated measurements) and feasibility (concerning time and money consumed). For some aspects, the differences between buffalo and dairy cattle are also highlighted.

AB  - Treatment and application of agricultural drainage water (ADW) has become mandatory to cope with the shortage of potable water. In Egypt, current water supply plans comprise increasing utilization of the ample resource of ADW. The current limitations facing wider utilization of secondary sources in general and, ADW of particular, need extensive funding requirements. Best available technologies and consequently high level of capital have been required to implement treatment works. This paper presents techno-economic aspects of treatment and reuse of polluted surface water resulting from mixing river water with ADW. Proposed technological treatment schemes are first discussed. Further, the selected integrated treatment scheme based on conventional and advanced physicochemical techniques is elucidated. Membrane separation has been incorporated to achieve removal of residual pollutants as well as salinity reduction. Further, the paper is concluded with a techno-economic assessment of the proposed treatment train for 110,000 m(3)/d treatment facility. The results indicate promising features of the proposed scheme. Complementary studies are needed to assess potential environmental impacts under normal conditions.

AB  - In this study, a mathematical model has been developed for the submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) combining the activated sludge model No.1 (ASM1) with a membrane fouling model. The ASM1 was modified to take account into biological characteristics of the SMBR process, and the resistance-in-series model was integrated into the modified ASM 1 to describe membrane fouling. Four additional 1st-order linear differential equations were newly established to describe the fate of soluble microbial products (SMP) and its effects on membrane fouling. Using the model developed here, one can easily predict not only effluent quality but also membrane fouling behavior during the SMBR process. From numerical experiments, F/M ratio and SRT are found to be critical factors controlling SMP concentration in reactor. It also appears that SMP plays an important role in membrane fouling and effluent quality as well. The model developed in this study would provide a useful tool in optimizing operation conditions as well as design parameters for a SMBR system.

AB  - Vascular plants were recorded in a long-term (28-year) experiment on semi-natural grassland vegetation comparing six treatments: continued grazing, mowing every year, mowing every third year, annual spring burning, removal of woody plants, and untreated control. The treatments had created very different vegetation types: the annually mown and grazed plots had the highest species number while the untreated plots had the lowest. The species' ordination scores correlated with Ellenberg indicator values for nutrient status and light: species indicating poor nutrient conditions were mainly in grazed and mown plots, and shade-tolerant species were mainly in untreated and grazed plots. The original aim of this experiment was to evaluate alternative ways of maintaining semi-natural grassland vegetation, but there were no satisfactory long-term alternatives to annual mowing or grazing. An ordination contrasted annual mowing and grazing, ranking species from those associated with mowed plots (e.g. Leucanthemum vulgare, Luzula pilosa, Campanula persicifolia, Ajuga pyramidalis) to those associated with grazed plots (e.g. Ranunculus spp., Geum spp., Vicia sepium).

AB  - Until now the use of acoustic bio-responses in bio-environment control as indicators of animal-condition is limited to human perception. Coughing is a frequent symptom of many respiratory diseases affecting the airways and lungs of humans and animals.
   Registration of coughs from different pigs in a controlled test chamber was done in order to analyse the acoustical signal. A new approach is presented to distinguish cough sounds from other sounds, such as grunts, metal clanging and background noise, using neural networks as the classification method. Other signals (such as grunts, metal clanging, etc.) could also be detected.
   The best performance was obtained with a hybrid classifier that classifies coughs and metal clanging separately from the rest, giving better results compared to a probabilistic neural network (PNN) alone. The hybrid classifier, which consists of a 2- and a 4-class PNN, gave high discrimination performance in the case of grunts, metal clanging and background noise (91.4, 63.9 and 82.6%, respectively) and a performance of (91.9%) for correct classification in the case of coughs.

AB  - Mycoplasma gallisepticum is a well-known disease of poultry but until 1994 it had not been observed in passerine birds. From 1994 to 1996, tens of millions of house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) are believed to have died in an epidemic of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis, similar to 'pinkeye' in humans. The outbreak of Mycoplasma gallisepticum affected finches of both sexes, but disproportionately killed males, shifting the sex ratio from male-biased to female-biased. This differential male mortality is consistent with a cost of testosterone, which is a key prediction of the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis. Males and females that survived the epidemic weighed significantly less and had significantly shorter wing chords, tarsi, and bills than did individuals before the epidemic. Male survivors also had significantly redder plumage than males that did not survive, supporting the idea chat plumage brightness serves as an indicator of condition, as proposed by the honest advertisement model of sexual selection.

AB  - Conservation work carried out at Trinity College, Dublin, highlighted problems of decay in granite which is widely regarded as a durable stone. Visual condition assessment of stone work identified an association between decay of granite and the presence of salts. Salt build-up was related to the presence of sources of soluble salts. Mortar joints and limestone features in particular were identified as potential sources of damaging salts. Petrographic analysis of thin sections taken from high and low salt surface environments revealed decay processes typical of granite weathering. Fracturing and chemical alteration of minerals were evident. Decay processes in the sample from the high salt location were more extreme. Analysis of calcium and sulphate in these locations revealed an association between disruption of the stone and high levels of salts. The physical role of mortar in controlling the water movement through the stone is also important in determining where damaging salts are deposited. A new repointing mortar was developed and tested. This mortar has high permeability and flexibility while having a low soluble salt content.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA  - English
AB  - The scavenging processes of marine particles in Osaka Bay was investigated using bioelement (C,N,P) distribution as an indicator. Nutrient concentrations in the water and bioelement contents in suspended particles, sinking particles and surface sediments were monitored for three years (1985 to 1987). Large variations appeared to depend on environmental conditions. Bioelement concentrations in suspended particles and sinking particles decrease remarkably going from the inner part of the bay to the offshore water area.
   Our results suggested that the position of the tidal front in Osaka Bay agrees very closely with 20 - 30 m water depth; the chemical character of suspended particles and sinking particles was considerably different from across the tidal frontal area. According to the chemical character of sinking particles at the offshore water area station, these particles are mainly made up of "old particles" of which the labile organic matter fraction was already decomposed. Sedimentation of nitrogen in the inner part of the bay accounts for approximately 6 % of all nitrogen inputs to Osaka Bay. These results are very important in learning how marine particles participate in scavenging and cycling in Osaka Bay.

AB  - A saline circuit has been studied as a model of coastal evaporite systems.  The lipid composition of diverse salt ponds encompassing calcite, gypsum and halite domains has been determined.  Most of the lipid material has been found in the carbonate samples and is related to algal/cyanobacterial debris.  Lipids in the gypsum domain are of heterotrophic microbial origin and extreme halophilic bacteria constitute the main lipid contribution in the halite samples.  n-Alkane distributions with high predominance of n-docosane constitute a previously described feature of sedimentary evaporitic conditions that is characteristic of the intermediate calcite/gypsum samples.  In the calcite domain, the presence of C20 highly branched isoprenoid olephines, tetrahymanol and the large amounts of phytol constitute likely precursors of lipids usually found in evaporitic environments (i.e. C20 highly branched isoprenoid alkanes, gammacerane and high phytane/pristane ratios).  Their occurrence point to dehydration and hydrogenation as two main diagenetic processes leading to the formation of "evaporitic molecular markers".

AB  - X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been used to investigate the composition of perovskite films upon exposure to different environmental factors, such as moisture, heat, and UV light. However, few research studies have determined that the X-ray itself could cause damage to the perovskite crystals. In this study, the X-ray-induced degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films was investigated via XPS within an in situ ultrahigh vacuum system. It is demonstrated that fresh methylammonium lead iodine contains Pb2+ without the initial existence of Pb-0. The Pb-0 signal was discovered after a few hours of soft X-ray exposure, which indicates that the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite structure undergoes a decomposition process to form metallic Pb. In addition, the nitrogen content was found to be significantly decreasing in the first hour of X-ray exposure. The discovery of the X-ray-induced chemical state change and the volatile methylamine of perovskite crystals could be further applied as an indicator for the field of X-ray sensors or detectors.

AB  - Epiphytic lichens are sensitive to deteriorating air quality, but levels of nitrogen and especially sulphur deposition have been in decline over most of Europe in recent decades. We assessed the response of epiphytic lichens to this decline, using data from long-term monitoring sites in Sweden. We analyzed 20 years of data to investigate temporal trends in lichen communities' sensitivity to sulphur, nitrogen preference, species richness and alpha and beta diversity. We found only limited and partial evidence of recovery in the area that previously had high levels of deposition, and a decline in mean sulphur sensitivity at a northern site with low deposition levels throughout the monitoring period. The slow recolonization of sensitive species, even where environmental conditions are now suitable, is probably a result of impoverished regional species pools and the inherent limited dispersal capacity of many lichen species. We suggest due consideration of these factors in the use of epiphytic lichens as environmental indicators in a period of improving air quality.

AB  - Tar balls are frequently reported as indicators of the extent of marine pollution owing to spill incidents of crude oil or petroleum products. Representative tar ball samples collected on a beach on Zirje Island, Croatia, were geochemically characterised by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in order to identify correlations between them and investigate potential sources. The chemical analysis of petroleum biomarkers, hopanes, and steranes, detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) generates information of great importance to environmental forensic investigations in terms of determining the source of spilled oil, differentiating and correlating oils, and monitoring the degradation process and weathering state of oils under a wide variety of conditions.
   The chromatographic signatures of hopane and sterane biomarkers in tar ball samples from Zirje Island were compared. Characteristic hopane and sterane fingerprints show that all the tar ball samples originated from crude oil spills. This study indicates that, the major source of tar balls was likely to be the same type of crude oil as evident from the petroleum biomarker fingerprints.

We noticed the impact of physical forces on substantial variations in abundance and distribution of the HBC, total coliforms, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the study region. Based on our results Escherichia coli and other PBC were not much influenced by the physical conditions. It has been noticed that the perennial existence of the high abundance of IBC and PBC above the standard limits during the entire study period leading to an alarming situation in the coastal waters off Visakhapatnam.

AB  - Depletion of fossil fuel reserves, unpredictable fluctuation of diesel prices, and global warming issue have motivated numerous countries to produce new policies for energy that engorge the utilization of alternative energy sources. Renewable energy resources like solar, hydro, and wind are clean and have potency to be more widely used. Integration of these sources together with back-up units can produce a better clean, economic, and reliable power for all loads conditions as compared to single source systems. The feasibility study of using integrated energy system to supply electric energy for remote rustic school in the southern part of Iraq is investigated in this research paper. In order to carry out the feasibility study of the hybrid system, HOMER software is employed as a tool for the technical, economic, and environmental assessments. The analyses of the optimal energy systems are explained in details to find the most feasible off-grid system. Then, this system is compared with the options of extension to the grid and diesel generator system.

AB  - Words and melodies are some of the basic elements infants are able to extract early in life from the auditory input. Whether melodic cues contained in songs can facilitate word-form extraction immediately after birth remained unexplored. Here, we provided converging neural and computational evidence of the early benefit of melodies for language acquisition. Twenty-eight neonates were tested on their ability to extract word-forms from continuous flows of sung and spoken syllabic sequences. We found different brain dynamics for sung and spoken streams and observed successful detection of word-form violations in the sung condition only. Furthermore, neonatal brain responses for sung streams predicted expressive vocabulary at 18 months as demonstrated by multiple regression and cross-validation analyses. These findings suggest that early neural individual differences in prosodic speech processing might be a good indicator of later language outcomes and could be considered as a relevant factor in the development of infants' language skills.

AB  - A theoretical wireless nanosensor network (WNSN) system that gives information about the food packaging condition is proposed. The protection effectiveness is estimated by measuring many factors, such as the existence of microorganisms, bacteria, gases, and contaminants. This study is focused on the detection of an antimicrobial agent (AA) attached on a polymer forming an active integrated package. All monitoring technologies for food conservation are analyzed. Nanobiosensor nanomachine (NM), which converts biological or chemical signals into electrical signals, is used. A mathematical model, which describes the constituent's emigration from the package to food, is programmed in Mat Lab software. The results show three nanobiosensors forming a WNSN. The nanobiosensors are able to carry out the average concentration for different spots in the package. This monitoring system shows reading percentages in three degrees and different colors: excellent (green), good (cyan), and lacking (red). To confirm the utility of the model, different simulations are performed. Using the WNSNs, results of AA existing in food package (FP) through time were successfully obtained.

AB  - Environmental conditions are one of the key components that determine the design life and maintenance required for road pavements. This study investigates how climate change can impact road pavement design life and the required maintenance regimes required to maximise the life of the surface. Using a pavement degradation model previously adapted by the authors for use with the Thornthwaite Moisture Index climate indicator, the authors investigate the impact of climate change on the design life and maintenance requirements along a real life case study corridor in South Australia. A literature review conducted by this study determines how climate change is being considered in infrastructure related policies and literature, with a focus on road pavements. The paper then further discussed the impacts of climate change on road pavement degradation and the implications for management and maintenance of this infrastructure, and the associated impacts for transport policy makers.

AB  - Monitoring of pH, especially under highly alkaline conditions, is necessary in various processes in the industrial, biotechnological, agricultural, and environmental fields. However, few pH indicators that can function at highly alkaline levels are available, and most of which are organic-based pH indicators. Several years ago, it was reported that gold nanoparticles prepared using trisodium citrate dihydrate were rapidly aggregated at pH values higher than similar to 12.7. A shift of surface plasmon resonance for such aggregated gold nanoparticles can be applied to pH indicators, allowing for the substitution of traditional organic-based pH indicators. The most important characteristic of pH indicators is the transition pH range. Herein, gold and silver nanoparticles are prepared using different reducing agents, and their transition pH ranges are examined. The results showed that all nanoparticles prepared in this study exhibit similar transition pH ranges spanning 11.9-13.0, regardless of the nanoparticle material, reducing agents, and concentration.

AB  - Temperature greatly affects the food quality and safety. Temperature control is an important condition during distribution and storage. An intelligent and biodegradable temperature indicator packaging material was developed based on a natural and heat-sensitive pigment (anthocyanin - ATH). Different concentrations of ATH were incorporated into chitosan matrix films (2.00%, w/w) that were applied as a surface coating on card paper, forming the chitosan card paper system (CH-Sys). The novelty of this work is an alternative packaging material that is biodegradable, simple manufacturing and indicates temperature variations in a specific range by irreversible visual colour changes. The CH-Sys changed irreversibly the colour from light violet to light yellow in response to different temperature exposition (40 degrees C until 70 degrees C), independently of luminosity (0 or 1000 lx). The results indicated that the CH-Sys has a great potential for use as a temperature indicator prototype in the specific temperature range studied in this work. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To improve the water quality of the four major rivers in Korea, Ministry of Environment of Korea (MOE) has introduced the Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) management system since 2002 and BOD was selected as one of the target materials during the first period (2004-2010). For an effective watershed management, it is necessary to have one or more quantitative measures that can be used to evaluate the relationship between pollutant sources and their impacts on water quality. Such measurable quantities are termed water quality indicators. Once an indicator is selected, target values for that indicator must be established to distinguish between the impaired and unimpaired state of the water-body. Various factors such as available data, application, management conditions and cost will be considered for the selection of an appropriate watershed management indicator. This paper introduces various factors required for choosing target water quality indicators and establishes reasonable target values during the second TMDLs period (2010-2015).

AB  - The Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway regulates diverse physiological processes by transmitting signals from membrane based receptors to various nuclear, cytoplasmic and membrane-bound targets, coordinating a large variety of cellular responses. Function of Raf family kinases has been shown to play a role during organism development, cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation and differentiation, cell survival and apoptosis and many other cellular and physiological processes. Aberrations along the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway play an integral role in various biological processes concerning human health and disease. Overexpression or activation of the pathway components is a common indicator in proliferative diseases such as cancer and contributes to tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. In this review, we focus on the physiological roles of Raf kinases in normal and disease conditions, specifically cancer, and the current thoughts on Raf regulation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The target of our study was the determination of urinary t,t muconic acid concentration, as a biomarker of benzene intake in a population. Urinary samples of 101 subjects, males and females were obtained to whom. Information regarding modification and confounding factors were recorded by questionnaire. The samples were analysed by HPLC, after extraction of trans,trans muconic acid on strong anionic exchange cartridges. In these analytical conditions the detection limit with good care is 10 mug/l. A concentration range from 10 to 1300 mug/l was found. High levels found in the population could explained by confounding factors present. The obtained results were correlated with sex, age and smoking or non smoking. There was a significant difference in mean concentrations between heavy smokers,(160 mug/l) and non smokers (110 mug/l), that showed tobacco as an interference factor. The study showed that it is strictly necessary carry out a thorough anamnesis before sampling with the objective of finding eventual interference factors such as smoking, diet and drugs taken.

AB  - The results of a study on the evolution of the vegetation in a reclaimed area contaminated with dioxin are presented. Phytosociological releves were carried out in 1992-1993 and in 1998 in 25 easily recognizable points. Elaborations on the species number, life forms, chorological types, vertical structure and ecological indicator values were realized.
   The most outstanding results regard the biodiversity, with floristic changes; the ecology, with increase in the ecological diversity, and the structure, with increase in the cover and complexity.
   The increase in the shrub layer is a clear indication of structural evolution. If, on the one hand, the vegetation structure indicates evolution of the system, on the other, the present floristic composition is still the result of the starting conditions. The observed floristic changes arise from autogenic floristic readjustments because there are no allogenic floristic increases. This is due to the isolation of the area which is completely surrounded by human sites, mostly of an urban type. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using formulated sediment as the test substrate and field exposures, we examined the effects of zinc contamination on the benthic invertebrate community in Mobile Bay. Formulated sediment was mixed to match field sediment in grain size and organic matter content. Clean sediments and sediments dosed with zinc to target concentrations from 250-5000 mu g g(-1) were exposed in field holding racks anchored on the bottom, The abundance and diversity of benthic invertebrate recruits were used as indicators of sediment quality, We found significant differences in both indicators between clean and zinc contaminated sediments, All taxa did not respond similarly to changing zinc concentrations, Several families of polychaetes, harpacticoid copepods and ostracods appeared to be most sensitive to zinc. Under certain conditions, some taxa, particularly gastropods, were attracted to zinc-contaminated sediments, Taken together, the results suggest that zinc contamination can profoundly affect the nature of the benthic community recruiting into such sediments, Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Incremental growth structures of fish and molluscs have been used as palaeoenvironmental indicators for nearly two decades, but the validity of the method's underlying assumptions has not been fully explored, particularly with regard to the use of fish remains. Towards this goal, the basic assumption - that annulus width is correlated with changing temperature - is reviewed and a test on two species of Nile fish (Lutes niloticus and Clarias spp.) is conducted to investigate the validity and limits of the method. Using the geological record of Holocene environments in Egypt as a standard for comparison. results suggest that incremental growth of the tested species is a reasonable measure of local environmental conditions over periods of rime represented by the collective life span of the studied individuals. The environmental changes inferred by this study, in turn, appear to be correlated with changes in human subsistence and settlement patterns in the western desert of Egypt and the Nile valley.

AB  - Changes in public values, beliefs, and expectations are leading to calls for transformational change in natural resource management agencies. Paradoxically, however, organizational features of management agencies condition them to seek stability rather than change. We evaluated quantitative data from 2012 to 2017 surveys of personnel and coded employee focus groups and individual interviews to evaluate an organizational change effort within a state wildlife agency (SWA). Results suggested that employees perceived increased positive changes and increased support from management for the change initiative, which contributed to greater personal commitment to the change initiative. No differences, however, were detected in other indicators of change in the culture, such as openness to new ideas, over the five-year period. Qualitative findings revealed specific drivers and barriers to change. We interpret these findings and provide recommendations to leaders in other SWAs who may be considering organizational change efforts. Our findings suggest that tempered expectations among stakeholders and organizations are warranted regarding the rate and magnitude at which organizational change can occur.

AB  - In outdoor spaces where children spend time outside their homes, certain conditions should be provided for the healthy development and increase of their quality of life. The main problem is that the regulations do not contain anything about outdoor standards, so spaces are designed without considering the needs of children. In this study, 105 spatial indicators were determined together with the needs of children for public green spaces. This study was carried out in urban parks serving the whole city within the scope of outdoor spaces. The status of the selected areas in the study to meet these indicators was examined and it was determined that the place with the best score (62.25%) was Hudavendigar Urban Park, the largest urban park in Bursa. Improvement suggestions have been developed for children by introducing indicators that are not found outdoors. These spatial indicators, which are determined by considering the needs of children, will benefit the process of creating all the spaces where children spend time for well-being.

AB  - This study compared the capacity of the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa and the green alga Ulva lactuca to sequester the trace elements Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn, in seawater and benthic sediments, under the same environmental conditions. Samples of C. nodosa leaves and U. lactuca thalli were collected in four sites off the coast of Sicily (Italy), with varying degrees of anthropogenic impact. C. nodosa accumulated generally higher levels of trace elements, suggesting a better performance in marine phytoremediation. In turn, C. nodosa and U. lactuca showed a similar performance regarding the bioindication of trace elements. Since salinity, temperature and pH had relatively constant values, their role in the accumulation processes in both species should be considered as secondary. Although C. nodosa and U. lactuca fulfill several criteria as bioindicators, including widespread distribution, abundance and tolerance to toxicity, their regular use in biomonitoring programs is still limited.

AB  - Innovation in colorimetric sensors to detect early signs of food spoilage is a growing interest in food safety and quality control. Currently available chemical dyes for sensor applications have concern because of their possible migration into food packaging and food in contact. In this study, a colorimetric indicator was developed using natural butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea) anthocyanin with Sago (Metroxylon sagu) as polymeric film. The principle was based on pH shift due to chemical processes produced by microorganism causing anthocyanin color to change. The film was fabricated by solvent casting method and characterized by color change at different pH values, total water solubility, swelling rate, and morphological structure. Trials on chicken breast samples in various conditions exhibited that the film indicator responded well according to pH variation enabling a real-time monitoring due to spoilage. Thus, our natural pH indicator with visible color variation allows for simple, economic and safe monitoring of perishable foods.

AB  - The level of human serum albumin (HSA) in biological fluids is a key health indicator and its quantitative determination has great clinical importance. In this study, we developed a selective and sensitive fluorescent HSA probe by fluorescence-based high-throughput screening of a set of fluorescent thieno[3,2-b]pyridine-5(4H)-one derivatives against major plasma proteins: HSA, bovine serum albumin (BSA), globulin, fibrinogen, and transferrin. The fluorophore chosen finally (4) showed noticeable fluorescence enhancement in the presence of HSA (160-fold increase), and it exhibited rapid response, high sensitivity (detection limit 8 nM), and the ability to clearly distinguish HSA from BSA in pH 9 buffer condition. Moreover, the probe could be applicable to detect trace amounts of HSA in an artificial urine sample; further, it might be applied to the determination of the HSA concentration in complex biological samples for pre-clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Electroactive biofilms are intensely studied not only for energy conversion and electrosynthesis, but also as sensing systems. The electrical current produced by the layer is largely proportional to the rate of metabolism and therefore decreases when the biofilm experiences adverse environmental conditions. Acoustic measurements may complement this approach. The layer's softness can be inferred from shifts of resonance frequency and resonance bandwidth of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) contacting these layers. The layer's softness responds to the environment. Both negative potentials of the electrode (the equivalent of "suffocation") and lack of nutrient supply (the equivalent of "starvation") were studied. For comprehensive analysis, torsional resonators operating on three different modes of vibration are suited best. Such data can be fitted with a viscoelastic model, leading to a quantitative estimate of the shear modulus. On a more empirical level, one might also use the ratio of the shift in bandwidth to the negative shift in frequency as an indicator of stress. For ease of operation, one might even replace the torsional resonators with thickness-shear resonators.

AB  - Tropical savannas comprise mixed woodland grassland ecosystems in which trees and grasses compete for water resources thereby maintaining the spatial structuring of this ecosystem. A global change in rainfall climatology may impact the structure of tropical savanna ecosystems by favouring woody plants, relative to herbaceous vegetation. Here we analysed satellite data and observed a relatively higher increase in woody vegetation (5%) as compared to the increase in annual maximum leaf area index (LAI(max), an indicator of the total green vegetation production) (3%) in arid and semi-arid savannas over recent decades. We further observed a declining sensitivity of LAI(max) to annual rainfall over 56% of the tropical savannas, spatially overlapping with areas of increased woody cover and altered rainfall climatology. This suggests a climate-induced shift in the coexistence of woody and herbaceous vegetation in savanna ecosystems, possibly caused by altered hydrological conditions with significance for land cover and associated biophysical effects such as surface albedo and evapotranspiration.

AB  - Oxidation processes in the sulfide component of the concentration located in the Dalnegorsk district were modeled in the range from-25 to 0 degrees C. The modeling showed crystallization of the following minerals from the model solutions: hypergene Fe, Cu, Pb, Zn, Al, Mg, and Ca sulfate, arsenate, silicate, oxide, and hydroxide minerals at the tailing dumps of the Central concentrating mill and hypergene Fe, Pb, Sb, and Ca sulfate, carbonate, oxide, and hydroxide minerals at the tailing dumps of the Krasnorechensk concentrating mill. The concentrations of sulfide ore elements in the solution in the negative temperature range are much higher compared to those at positive temperatures. This takes place, because the most part of the solution passes to the solid phase (ice), and the volume of the liquid phase decreases. As a result, the hydrosphere of the district is experiencing severe anthropogenic impact from the elements of sulfide ores (S, Zn, Cu, Pb, Fe, Ag, As, and Sb) and their host rocks (Mg, K, Na, Ca, Si and Al).

AB  - Effort-based decision making paradigms are increasingly utilized to gain insight into the nature of motivation deficits. Although these tasks are being used to assess effort and motivation in schizophrenia, little work has been done to confirm that effort-based decision making tasks validly manipulate effort. In the current study, we adapted the effort component a cognitive effort-based decision making task (the Deck Choice Effort Task) for use with pupillometric assessment. We sought to confirm with psychophysiology that cognitive effort is manipulated. We also examined correlations between physiological indicators of effort exertion and cognition and negative symptoms. The results confirmed manipulation of cognitive effort: there was a significant difference in pupillary responses between easy and difficult task conditions. Pupillary responses were also correlated with cognitive ability, and with negative symptoms when controlling for cognition. Thus, our findings offer physiological validation of an effort manipulation included in a cognitive effort-based decision making task for schizophrenia. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lagoons in the southeast coast of Brazil have experienced eutrophication due to the exponential increase of human population and sewage discharges. Living benthic foraminifera have demonstrated to be good bioindicators of such impacts. This study aims to evaluate the organic matter accumulation effects on the foraminiferal distribution in the Itaipu lagoon (Brazil). On the basis of the biotic and abiotic analyses, three sectors are identified. The Sector I, an inner area, is characterized by high dissolved oxygen values and foraminiferal species with preference for marine conditions, demonstrating the sea influence. The Sector II, in the mangrove margins, is associated to sandy sediment and biopolymers and mainly represented by euryhaline species. The Sector III is marked by low density or absence of living foraminifera and corresponds to a low quality organic matter enriched area (North, Southwest and Centre).

AB  - Using an extensive dataset of over 44,000 firms for a period that includes an economic upswing and a recession, this article examines how time-varying, firm-specific variables and changes in the macroeconomic environment affect the probability of firms' financial distress. Traditional single-period approaches used to predict financial distress are based on unrealistically restrictive assumptions and cannot dynamically account for changes in financial indicators and macroeconomic conditions. Therefore discrete-time hazard models (using logit and cloglog) are applied; these indicate that the probability of distress is strongly influenced by both firm-specific and macroeconomic variables. Although firm-specific variables play an essential role, the results show that macroeconomic variables are important for understanding the fluctuations in the probability of distress over time. Furthermore, the findings provide evidence that both the legal criteria and a firm's financial health should be considered when identifying firms in emerging economies that are in distress because existing bankruptcy laws are not applied.

AB  - Understanding the process whereby fishing capital accumulates and excess capacity emerges, particularly in fisheries where incentives for race to fish and race to invest are present, and where capital is not perfectly malleable, remains an important topic. We develop a dynamic model, incorporating quasi-malleable capital, race to fish and invest behaviors and myopic expectations, in which the level of excess capacity is endogenously determined. We show the importance of capital malleability, and of other biological and economic conditions, in determining the existence and strength of persistent equilibrium excess capacity in the fishery. We also highlight a link between the state of the fishery at the time race behavior emerges and the resultant level of excess capacity. Our results have implications for both the management of excess capacity and the use of empirical measures of excess capacity as performance indicators in fisheries where race behaviors are present.

AB  - Micromorphology of calcic accumulations (calcite, whewellite and gypsum) and geochemical indices were considered as indicators of genesis and evolution of pedogenic accumulations in soils and paleosediments of the Argentinean Pampa. Two groups of separate and independent calcic accumulations were studied using scanning electron microscopy: (i) in situ Argiudolls, reflecting the current soil formation; (ii) in the layers of calcrete (locally named tosca), reflecting the past environments and conditions of these layers sedimentation. New pedogenic gypsum accumulations in Argiudolls were described and possible ways of their formation were suggested. Combined analyses of morphology of carbonate accumulations and geochemical indices in different horizons of Argiudolls and layers of tosca showed that the tosca is paleopedocomplex with complicated formation history. Influence of current environment on tosca morphology is absent, so it is possible to use these pedofeatures for paleoreconstructions in further studying.

AB  - The poisoning of wildlife with fly-bait containing the active ingredient methomyl is an intentional and illegal act in many jurisdictions. A case of 2 animals poisoned by methomyl through consumption of tainted bait at multiple stations is described. Although thermally and ultraviolet-labile, methomyl can be identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and is detected in abundance in bait samples; however, it is not readily observed in tissues, owing to its rapid metabolism and elimination. The application of derivatizing functionalities, such as trimethylsilyl groups, stabilizes the methomyl-oxime metabolite to facilitate its detectability during exposure to the relatively harsh conditions of gas chromatography. This brief communication reports on the analytical detection of methomyl in baits and biological samples from poisoned wildlife. Essential to the case were the added determination of a fly-bait coactive ingredient, (Z)-9-tricosene, and identification of a chemical indicator, caffeine, to confirm both the type of pesticide product involved in the poisoning incident and the vehicle used to perpetrate its delivery.

AB  - Compassion has been suggested to be a strong motivator for prosocial behavior. While research has demonstrated that compassion training has positive effects on mood and health, we do not know whether it also leads to increases in prosocial behavior. We addressed this question in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we introduce a new prosocial game, the Zurich Prosocial Game (ZPG), which allows for repeated, ecologically valid assessment of prosocial behavior and is sensitive to the influence of reciprocity, helping cost, and distress cues on helping behavior. Experiment 2 shows that helping behavior in the ZPG increased in participants who had received short-term compassion training, but not in participants who had received short-term memory training. Interindividual differences in practice duration were specifically related to changes in the amount of helping under no-reciprocity conditions. Our results provide first evidence for the positive impact of short-term compassion training on prosocial behavior towards strangers in a training-unrelated task.

AB  - The Mesopotamian marshes of southern Iraq had been all but destroyed by Saddam Hussein's regime by the year 2000. Earlier assessments suggested that poor water quality, the presence of toxic materials, and high saline soil conditions in the drained marshes would prevent their ecological restoration and doom the reestablishment of the Marsh Arab culture of fishing and agriculture. However, 'the high volume of good-quality water entering the marshes from the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, a result of two record years of snowpack melt in Turkey and Iran, allowed 39% of the former marshes to be reflooded by September 2005. Although reflooding does not guarantee restoration success, our recent field surveys have found a remarkable rate of reestablishment of native macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, fish, and birds in reflooded marshes. However, the future availability of water for restoration is in question, which suggests that only a portion of the former marshes may be restored. Also, landscape connectivity between marshes is greatly reduced, causing concern about local species extinctions and lower diversity in isolated wetlands.

AB  - Although bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of a chemical may vary considerably due to different species, laboratories, lipid content, and test conditions it is generally agreed that high BCFs are cause for concern whereas low BCFs signalise no risk. Results of bioaccumulation studies with phenol and two other chemicals are compared demonstrating that low BCFs may be obtained by testing with high concentrations and vice versa, the differences covering 2 - 3 orders of magnitude. However, when compared on the basis of body burden concentrations, differences are in the same order. Since the BCF directly influences classification, labelling of dangerous substances and environmental risk assessment, low BCFs due to high test concentrations may be misleading arid underestimating the risk. Hence the consideration of the complexity of bioaccumulation processes including investigations on metabolism, organ-specific bioconcentration and bound residues, and relating these data to critical body burden concentrations for the respective ecotoxicological end point will be a better approach for risk assessment than consideration of the BCF alone.

AB  - Biomarkers identification of aromatic hydrocarbon fraction of Cepu oil samples was carried out to determine the ancient depositional environment, the source of origin and indicators of the maturity of the old well of the Cepu Block oil, Wonocolo Formation, East Java Indonesia. Biomarkers were identified through the Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) method. The distribution of aromatic hydrocarbon biomarkers indicates the presence of naphthalene compounds and their derivatives, sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids and heterocyclic aromatic groups. The presence of identified biomarkers indicates the source of the oil organic compound coming from higher plants Angiosperms. The presence of methyl phenanthrene and aromatic heterocyclic biomarkers such as dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran, as well as fluorene shows that Cepu Block oil was deposited not only in the terrestrial environment, but also lacustrine and marin under oxidic precipitation conditions. The presence of methyl phenanthrene with MPI value of 0.86 and isocadalene abundance higher than cadalene indicates moderate to high maturity of the Cepu Block oil analyzed.

AB  - The objective of the article is to make the identification and spatial analysis of situations of socio-environmental vulnerability on an intra-urban scale in the municipality of Guarulhos-SP, developing an empirical operationalization of the concept of socio-environmental vulnerability, through the integration of sociodemographic indicators of the 2010 Demographic Census with cartographies that represent areas of environmental risk. The results reveal that certain areas, spread over the territory of the municipality and where 119 thousand people live, have high socio-environmental vulnerability and have significantly worse socioeconomic conditions than those areas with low and even moderate vulnerability. Therefore, the results of the article can provide subsidies for planning public policies to mitigate situations of socio-environmental vulnerability and adapt to climate change in the city of Guarulhos, in addition to contributing to the development of indicators and methodologies for analyzing vulnerability situations to climate change in urban and metropolitan areas of Brazil.

AB  - Slope streaks have been frequently observed in the equatorial, low thermal inertia and dusty regions of Mars. The reason behind their formation remains unclear with proposed hypotheses for both dry and wet mechanisms. Here, we report an up-to-date distribution and morphometric investigation of Martian slope streaks. We find: (i) a remarkable coexistence of the slope streak distribution with the regions on Mars with high abundances of water-equivalent hydrogen, chlorine, and iron; (ii) favourable thermodynamic conditions for transient deliquescence and brine development in the slope streak regions; (iii) a significant concurrence of slope streak distribution with the regions of enhanced atmospheric water vapour concentration, thus suggestive of a present-day regolith-atmosphere water cycle; and (iv) terrain preferences and flow patterns supporting a wet mechanism for slope streaks. These results suggest a strong local regolith-atmosphere water coupling in the slope streak regions that leads to the formation of these fluidised features. Our conclusions can have profound astrobiological, habitability, environmental, and planetary protection implications.

AB  - Using statistical-field techniques, we develop a molecular-based dipolar self-consistent-field theory (DSCFT) for charge solvation in liquid mixtures under equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions, and apply it to compute the solvent reorganization energy of electron-transfer reactions. In addition to the nonequilibrium orientational polarization, the reorganization energy in liquid mixtures is also determined by the out-of-equilibrium solvent composition around the reacting species due to preferential solvation. Using molecular parameters that are readily available, the DSCFT naturally accounts for the dielectric saturation effect and the spatially varying solvent composition in the vicinity of the reacting species. We identify three general categories of binary solvent mixtures, classified by the relative optical and static dielectric permittivities of the solvent components. Each category of mixture is shown to produce a characteristic local solvent composition profile in the vicinity of the reacting species, which gives rise to the distinctive composition dependence of the reorganization energy that cannot be predicted using the dielectric permittivities of the homogeneous solvent mixtures.

AB  - Constructed wetlands have been used to treat wastewater because of their efficiency at removing fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), their low cost, and their ease of maintenance. This study investigates the ability of a surface-flow wetland (0.03 ha in size), constructed in the rural village of Elsah, Illinois, to treat FIB pollution. The objectives of this study were to: 1) compare mean FIB concentrations (specifically thermotolerant coliforms [TTC] and enterococci [ENT]) in the wetland during low versus high precipitation conditions; 2) compare mean FIB levels among different sampling locations along the wetland's treatment gradient; and 3) determine whether FIB and other environmental variables were significantly correlated. Both TTC and ENT levels increased during storm events, likely due to increased mobilization of sediment. Both TTC and ENT were significantly lower in zones located further from the inflow point. The strongest correlation was observed between TTC and ENT, and both parameters were strongly correlated with precipitation.

AB  - The compensatory effect of environmental subsidies for agri-environmental output constraints was evaluated through a comparative analysis observing the 'pure' technical efficiency, as a benchmark for prevailing production conditions, and the 'compensated' technical efficiency, as a proxy indicator of the compensation. An unbalanced data panel covering 3578 observations of 668 Swedish dairy farms in the period 2002-2012 was used. The analysis showed that in the study period, environmental farm support decreased the differences in farm revenue generated by agri-environmental output constraints in Sweden. However, the environmental support distribution did not succeed in meeting regional needs, so difficulties emerged in farmers' ability to generate output in southern and central forest and valley areas of Sweden. Furthermore, the environmental agricultural support had only a partial subsidisation effect on 'output-reducing' farm management practices, with full compensation being achieved for organic and capital-extensive farming, whereas low livestock density farming was not sufficiently compensated for. This analysis reveals incentives with policy implications for farm technical performance and provides direct input to future policy recommendations for environmental support allocation.

AB  - The massive data centre energy consumption has motivated significant efforts to use energy efficiency strategies and the implementation of renewable energy sources that reduce their operational costs and environmental impact. Considering that the potential of many of these measures is often closely linked to the climate conditions, the location of data centres can have a major impact on their energy demand. Moreover, from a holistic approach, differences among regions become even more important when accounting for the electricity attributes from the grid. To assess these differences this work compares by the use of energy indicators the behaviour of a data centre located at different representative emplacements in Europe. To do so, a dynamic energy model which incorporates free cooling strategy and photovoltaic energy is developed. The paper concludes by suggesting that future data centre developments could consider site selection as a new strategy to limit the environmental impact attributable to this sector.

AB  - The continued depletion of fresh drinking water resources throughout the world has increased the need for a variety of water treatment and recycling strategies. Conventional wastewater treatment processes rely on extensive chemical post-disinfection to comply with the stringent microbiological safety for water reuse. When well designed and operated, membrane bioreactors (MBRs) can consistently achieve efficient removals of suspended solids, protozoa and coliform bacteria. Under optimal conditions, MBR systems can also significantly remove various viruses and phages. This paper provides an in-depth overview of the mechanisms and influencing factors of pathogen removal by MBR and highlights practical issues, such as reduced chemical disinfectant dosing requirements and associated economic and environmental benefits. Special attention has been paid to the aspects, such as membrane cleaning, membrane imperfections/breach and microbial regrowth, in the distribution system on the overall pathogen removal performance of MBR.

AB  - Blood parasites are often considered as indicators of immunity in birds, and data on parasite prevalence and intensity of infections are essential to reveal information about the condition of both individuals and populations. We prevented parasite vectors from biting and infecting nestling great tit Parus major by using insect repellent inside nest boxes. We found that in the absence of blood parasites, great tit nestlings had higher concentrations of haemoglobin, and they survived at significantly higher rates through the nestling phase and also during the first weeks of their fledgling period. This is the first demonstration so far of the impact these parasites have on haemoglobin levels of the hosts, which reveals one mechanism of adverse impact by blood parasites. This study shows that the effects of blood parasites can be assessed without using anti-malaria drugs, which can cause additional risk of oxidative stress.

AB  - The steppe pika (Ochotona pusilla), a representative of the lagomorph family Ochotonidae, is restricted today to Kazakhstan and Russia. This subspecies-rich form belongs to a morphologically distinct, monospecific group of relatively small pikas, inhabiting steppe-like habitat. In the fossil record, it serves as a bioindicator of dry, grassland environment. The steppe pika was abundant and widespread in Europe during the Last Glaciation, and its unquestionable presence has been reported there since the middle Pleistocene. A new discovery of O. pusilla, from the Kielniki 3B locality (Poland), dated to the latest Pliocene, moves back the species appearance in Europe about one million years, almost coeval with its first record from the late Pliocene of Kazakhstan. Presence of such a typical steppe inhabitant as O. pusilla indicates significant climate change towards more arid, continental conditions, which started influencing Europe at 2.6 Ma. We present the first reliable record of the earliest O. pusilla entry deep into Europe in the latest Pliocene.

AB  - We examined, under laboratory conditions, the physiological responses of the aquatic liverwort Jungermannia exsertifolia subsp. cordifolia to artificially enhanced ultraviolet (UV) radiation for 82 days, especially considering the responses of five hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. This species lives in mountain streams, where it is exposed to low temperatures and high UV levels, and this combination is believed to increase the adverse effects of UV. Enhanced UV radiation hardly caused any change in several physiological variables indicative of vitality, such as F-v/F-m and chlorophylls/phaeopigments ratio (OD430/OD410). Thus, this liverwort seemed to be tolerant to UV radiation, probably due to the accumulation of three UV-absorbing hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives: p-couinaroylmalic acid, 5 ''-(7 '',8 ''-dihydroxycoumaroyl)-2-caffeoylmalic acid, and 5 ''-(7 '',8 ''-dihydroxy-7-O-beta-glucosyl-coumaroyl)-2-caffeoylmalic acid. These compounds might serve as bioindicators of enhanced UV radiation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The study analyses some macroeconomic determinants of entrepreneurial decisions to invest in Argentina during the Convertibility Regime. This regime transformed the macroeconomic context in a direction that would increase business confidence. I selected two indicators to measure different aspects of business confidence. Firstly, I measure rather objective conditions of the environment that would affect predictability for business. Secondly, l evaluate the business climate optimism, as the entrepreneur perceives it. The empirical analysis uses panel data for 2.133 firms during the period 1992-2001 to estimate Probit, Random /Fixed Effects and Tobit models on the decision to invest and how much to invest in Research and Development (R&D) and in machinery. The study suggests that, on the one hand, a macroeconomic context that promotes predictability contributes to taking the decision to invest, both in machinery and in R&D However, it does not affect that clearly the intensity of these long-term investments. On the other hand, temporary states of optimism positively affect investment in machinery but do not influence investment in R&D.

LA  - English
KW  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The concept of urban deprivation has emerged as an important theme in urban geography and urban studies. In light of the significant problems and issues affecting cities in North America and Europe there is a growing need for researchers to acquire a better understanding of the process of urban social change. In this paper the author proposes a model of urban deprivation change and applies it with the use of census indicators to East Montreal, a section of the central city, and the Montreal Urban Community. The changing spatial structure and nature of urban deprivation is examined at the neighbourhood level in this study area over the period 1986 - 96. The author finds that urban deprivation is largely an economic problem, with declining conditions apparent throughout a large part of Montreal's central city and in several inner-suburban municipalities. The model, selection of indicators, and statistical techniques presented in this paper can be used as a guide for further research into urban deprivation change in other urban centres.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of a weak magnetic field (50 muT, 20 Hz sinusoidal, 5 a duration) on concurrent perceptions of visual stimuli. Subjects were seated between Helmholtz coils and gave post-exposure ratings for the affective content and arousing nature of presented images. They were blind as to the presence or absence of a simultaneously presented field. Skin conductance and arousal ratings did not show significant differences between experimental and control conditions, but the affective content rating did (P = 0.041), with the images viewed under field exposure being rated as having a more positive affect. Such measures might thus be useful as additional indicators of magnetic field detection. A post-hoc analysis of skin conductance profiles showed that 48% of subjects exhibited a lowering of skin conductance during field exposure, 34% exhibited no apparent reaction, and 17% exhibited an increase. Overall ratings given by each of the groups appeared to relate to these physiological profiles. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The assessment of patient quality of life is assuming increasing importance in medicine and healthcare. In addition to their biological effects, illnesses, diseases and their treatments can have significant impact on mobility, mood, life satisfaction, cognition and the ability to fulfil occupational, social and family roles. The emerging quality of life construct may be viewed as a paradigm shift in outcome measurement since it shifts the focus of attention from symptoms to functioning. This holistic approach more clearly establishes the patient as the centre of attention and subsumes many of the traditional measures of outcome. This paper introduces the concept of quality of life and describes the significant difficulties in definition, measurement and interpretation that must be addressed before such measures can be used as reliable and valid indicators of disease impact and treatment outcomes. It is argued that the unique individual perspective of the patient on his or her own quality of life must be incorporated into outcome assessments aimed at improving the quality of healthcare delivery in chronic diseases and in terminal conditions.

AB  - The colored pH indicator method introduced by Weisenseel et al. (1979) is particularly useful for localizing the zones along roots where acidification/alkalinization occurs. It can also be used to assess the direction and intensity of the proton fluxes. Because the method has not been quantitatively evaluated, however, it is nowadays little used or used in conjunction with other such as potentiometry. In the present study we examine the theoretical basis underlying this method of colorimetric visualization and show its similarity to spectrodensitometry. It thus becomes possible to quantify the luminous information and express it in terms of environmental pH. We describe the method used, emphasizing in particular the conditions required to achieve maximum accuracy of measurement, and an appropriate experimental device. pH distribution around roots can be mapped with a relative error of 0.03 pH units. The experimental device is easy to use and incorporates a computer-controlled video camera, thanks to which all acquisition and calculation procedures can be automated.

AB  - This paper reports on the results of using artificial neural network (ANN) technology to estimate treatment costs of heart bypass patients based on their diagnostic condition and clinical criteria. Our applications include: (1) predicting total episode cost using clinical data; (2) a method for providing rapid feedback to assess change in total costs within a turbulent environment; and (3) a procedure for identifying activity-based cost driver candidates that would normally not surface from an analysis of accounting data. Clinical data were collected on 250 heart bypass patients at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute. The data analysed support the following conclusions: (1) clinical and diagnostic indicators obtained before surgery for individual patients can be used to estimate the total cost of their heart bypass surgery; (2) the average cost estimate error decreases as we add clinical information available during and after the surgical event; (3) the procedure used to estimate individual patient cost does not require access to accounting records; (4) the forecasting system we describe may improve exception reporting for individual patients by tracking costs and clinical criteria on a real-time basis throughout the treatment episode.

AB  - The study of internal and external factors in the formation of an urban geosystem is determined by its complex structure and multiple connections. Based on geoinformation modelling, an analysis of the landscape structure of the city territory is carried out, which can be a basis for further geoecological research. Morphometric indicators, which make it possible to determine the elementary geochemical landscapes, are indicated according to the data of the digital elevation model. A standardised topographic position index (TPI) is used to determine locations. Spatial zoning according to the type of land use reflects the qualitative features of the external load and technogenic impact. The data on the composition of the lithogenic base show the properties of the depositing medium and determine the natural background. Number of categories of landscapes identified are 58, characterised by a homogeneous geological composition, technogenic load and conditions for the migration of matter. The ratios of various landscape zones have been calculated. The study area as a whole is characterised by the predominance of migration processes over accumulation.

AB  - This study examines the impact of air pollution on research and development (R&D) in China on the basis of province-level data for the period 2007-2016. The study discovers a significant adverse impact of air pollution on both R&D input and output in China. The estimation results in this study are robust to the different indicators used to measure R&D input and output and control for possible endogeneity problems via the instrumental variable approach. According to our estimates, if the concentration of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5) increases by 1%, then the scales of annual R&D personnel, expenditures, and new patents will decline by 0.359%, 0.169%, and 0.293%, respectively. The findings indicate that air pollution is a considerable threat to innovation and technological progress in China. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, mixing time measurements were carried out in two wells of square and cylindrical cross sections for small orbital diameter shaker, d(o) = 3 mm, commonly used in commercial microwell platforms (i.e. ThermoMixer) and compared against measurements obtained in lab scale reactors for larger orbital diameters. The Dual Indicator System for Mixing Time (DISMT) method was employed for all the operating conditions investigated, and a range of rotational speeds was identified where mixing is less effective due to reduced free surface oscillation. An effective scaling parameter between microwell platforms and lab scale reactors was identified based on the natural frequency of the system, which depends only on fill volume, size and cross section of the reactor.

AB  - Biological, economic and chemical characteristics of ten foreign varieties of Burley tobacco were investigated and their prospect was evaluated. The varieties had favourable biometric indicators. Kentucky 8959 variety is characterised by short vegetative period and thus may be used in selection programmes to shorten the vegetative period. Varieties Kentucky 908 and Banquet 102 may be used in selection programmes, as donors for increasing the height, length and number of leaves, and the Tennessee 86 variety - for increasing the width of the leaves. The yield and percentage of first class of all introduced varieties were higher than control varieties Burley 21 and Pliska 2002. The highest yield per hectare had North Carolina 3 variety while the highest percentage of first class - Banquet 102 variety. The Banquet 102 variety was characterised by the most balanced chemical composition. The data obtained serve as hybridization for creating new Bulgarian tobacco varieties Burley. The investigation established the plasticity of the studied tobacco varieties, which are grown under atypical soil, climatic conditions and agrotechnical measures.

AB  - Emerging contaminants including pharmaceuticals are a class of compounds that are causing great concern due to several environmental problems. Conventional water and wastewater treatments do not achieve high removal efficiencies for many of these drugs. Therefore, the present work investigated the removal of ibuprofen (IBP) by heterogeneous photocatalysis using TiO2 irradiated with artificial UV light or solar radiation. The treated solutions were tested against Daphnia similis and Raphidocelis subcapitata, which are species commonly used as bioindicators of environmental conditions. The results indicated that IBP removal reached 92 % after 1 h of treatment using artificial UV and 1000 mg L-1 of TiO2, which was the optimum catalyst concentration in the range studied (20-1000 mg L-1). TOC removal reached up to 78 % after 60 min of treatment using TiO2/artificial UV. Ecotoxicological bioassays indicated that the treated solutions had acute effects, with 30 % immobilization of D. similis and 40 % growth inhibition of R. subcapitata.

AB  - Foliar chlorophylls are the most important pigments related to the physiological function of plants. Quantitative estimation of photosynthetic pigments can provide important information about relationships between plants and their environmental conditions. In this study, new spectral indices were designed to enhance spectral resistance to noise, using the area of the spectral curve and axis. The specific area was around the red edge (R (daa)), instead of the sum of the first derivative of the spectrum, specifically the area of red edge (R (da)). Meanwhile, three reference indices were also introduced as non-sensitive bands of chlorophylls. The results show that by dividing spectral references, a kind of re-projection, the spectral indices can be calibrated to allow direct and reasonable comparisons of the results. The sensitivity of these reference indices to chlorophylls was also evaluated in this study. The regression results show that R (daa) and its derivates are highly related to chlorophylls and resistant to noise.

AB  - Toxicity testing is becoming a useful tool for environmental risk assessment. A biosensor based on the metabolic properties of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) has been applied for the detection of toxic chemicals in water. The methodology exploits the ability of SOB to oxidize elemental sulfur to sulfuric acid under aerobic conditions. The reaction results in an increase in electrical conductivity (EC) and a decrease in pH. Five hours after Cr6+ was added to the SOB biosensor operated in semi-continuous mode (1 min rapid feeding and 29 min batch reaction), a decrease in effluent EC and an increase in pH (from 2-3 to 6) were detected due to Cr6+ toxicity to SOB. The SOB biosensor is simple; it can detect toxic levels of Cr6+ on the order of minutes to hours, a useful time scale for early warning detection systems designed to protect the environment from further degradation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to apply a popular aquatic plant ordination method to results obtained during a bioindication study on tropospheric ozone. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) yields information about the variable inclination of plant reaction and environmental parameters. This analysis revealed positive correlations between tropospheric ozone concentration, wind speed, temperature, solar radiation and leaf injury of sensitive cultivars, as well as dry matter content of both sensitive and resistant cultivars. Moreover, this analysis revealed that leaf growth is positively correlated with solar radiation and negatively with ozone concentration. This test also indicated a negative relationship between ground-level ozone and physiological parameters, such as chlorophyll content. CCA may be a very useful tool for multidimensional analysis when many impact parameters are found. This also applies to bioindication studies, such as evaluation of plant response to tropospheric ozone in connection with other environmental parameters under field conditions.

AB  - Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) extraction was applied for the determination of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in activated sludge Quantification was performed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The highest extraction yields of PLFA, at a concentration of 7 28 nmol/mg-dry activated sludge, was obtained at a temperature of 80 degrees C, pressure of 25 MPa and 10% (v/v) methanol for a 15-min extraction time. ScCO2 extraction results obtained in these conditions were comparable with those obtained by liquid organic solvent extraction (LSE) based on diversity and equalibility indices. The repeatability test showed that the relative standard deviation values were less than 13% The experimental results show that the scCO(2) extraction saves time and uses much less organic solvent. In addition. scCO(2) extraction is a promising and alternative method for the analysis of microbial community structure in environmental assessment using the PLFA profile (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.

AB  - In Europe and some Asian countries, rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are an important source of meat. In literature, only limited microbiological data are available for rabbit carcasses. In the present study, 500 rabbit carcasses were investigated during a seven-month period (March to September 2007) by wet-dry swabbing and examined for total viable counts (TVC), Enterobacteriaceae and coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS). Average TVC on rabbit carcasses accounted for 3.3 log(10) CFU cm(-2). On the single carcasses, TVC ranged from 1.8 to 5.3 log(10) CFU cm(-1). Enterobacteriaceae as an indicator for fecal contamination and CPS as an indicator for Staphylococcus aureus were detected on 118 (23.6%) and 153 (30.6%) rabbit carcasses, respectively. Frequency in June (Enterobacteriaceae) and September (CPS) was higher than those in the other months (P<0.05). In daily practice, the maintenance of slaughter hygiene conditions in the slaughter of rabbits can be measured by regular slaughter process analysis, complemented by microbiological verification examinations of the environment and carcasses in accordance with HACCP principles.

AB  - More ornamented individuals are supposed to signal their superior quality and health, however the development of larger ornaments or brighter plumages can affect their survival probabilities. The survival of male serins Serinus serinus in relation to the color characteristics of carotenoid-derived breast coloration was analyzed in a six-year capture-recapture study in northeastern Spain. A total of 210 males were individually marked generating 340 captures, between 1997 and 2003. The model with the best fit indicated a quadratic relationship between brightness of carotenoid-derived coloration and survival, independent of time and age of the birds, so that individuals with intermediate plumage brightness survived longer. Hence, results stress that plumage color in male serins is under stabilizing natural selection, with reduced survival both in drabber and brighter individuals. While lower condition of drabber individuals can explain their lower survival, brighter birds can suffer more from predation risk or from a higher investment of resources into mate attraction and/or reproduction.

AB  - Hypothesis: Structural coloration (iridescent ornamentation) should vary more greatly among individuals and with age than pigment coloration. Structural coloration requires nano-scale precision and might thus more honestly signal male age and condition than pigment-based colours.
   Organism: A natural population of the orange sulphur butterfly, Colias eurytheme. C. eurytheme females prefer young males, choosing them on the basis of an unknown signal. Site: Cultivated alfalfa (Medicago sativa) fields near Avondale, Arizona, August-September 2004.
   Methods: I randomly sampled 70 'pristine' males and an additional 98 males in five age classes. I then measured key reflectance characteristics (brightness, hue and chroma) of the dorsal structural ultraviolet markings and of the coincident pigmentary yellowish-orange.
   Conclusions: Consistent with the sexual selection hypothesis, structural reflectance parameters are more phenotypically variable. Structural reflectance also fades more with age. However, the higher phenotypic variance of structural colour renders it a less precise indicator of male age than pigment colour.

AB  - The microplate assay for measuring antibacterial activity was adapted by incorporating a known concentration range of gentamicin as an internal standard. Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus strain ATCC 6538P, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Lactobacillus spp. were used as target organisms, although other indicator organisms and antibiotics can be examined. Assay range and sensitivity were dependent on the species and density of indicator organism, and conditions (e.g., type, concentration, and pH of growth medium). Plotting the area under the growth curve (AUGC) versus gentamicin concentration (log transformed) yielded a linear curve that was used to quantify in units of gentamicin the antibacterial activity of a secretory fluid (SCF; pancreatic juice) and for comparisons of samples collected at different times, analysed on different days, and from different studies. This adaptation of the microtiter broth method will be useful for investigating man-made compounds, and the antibacterial activity of secretory fluids and the influences of age, diet, and health status.

AB  - The results of kinetic studies of bacterial depyritization of HCl-kerogen concentrate of Alcksinac (Serbia) oil shale by the chemolithoautotrophic thionic bacteria Thiobacillus ferriooxidans under discontinuous laboratory conditions at various temperatures (0, 20, 28 and 37 degreesC) at a pH of ca. 1.5 are presented in this paper. Low pH prevents the occurrence of the precipitation of iron(III)-ion hydrolysis products on the substrate particles and thereby reduces the process efficiency. Bacterial depyritization is developed as per kinetics of the first order. The activation energy which points to a successive mechanism of pyrite biooxidation. was computed from the Arrhenius plot. The biochemical kinetics indicators point to a high affinity of the bacteria to-ward pyrite but small values of which are probably die result of decelerated metabolic processes due to die low pH value of die environment resp. the large difference of die pH between the external medium and the cell interior.

AB  - Depth profiles of carotenoids, chlorophyll derivates, and other biogenic indicators, such as biogenic silica (BGS), total organic carbon (TOC), total organic nitrogen (TON), and perylene, were measured in C-14-dated sediments (<2 m thick) sampled from the Southern basin of Lake Baikal. The photosynthetic pigments, BGS, and TOC (TON) accumulated in the upper part (80 cm) of the core (dated at 12-13 ka BP), whereas biogenic perylene occurs in its lower part (below 80 cm). Biogenic silica in the upper part shows a negative correlation with total carotenoids and no significant positive correlation with TOC and total chlorophyll a. This indicates that high contents of BGS providing oxidizing conditions in the lake stimulate aerobic decomposition of organic compounds in the water and in the surface sediments. The high concentrations of perylene in the lower part of the core against the background of the low lake productivity suggest specific processes of sedimentation in the past.

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the initiatives for sustainable development taking place in Italy at the urban and provincial levels, stressing some limits they met: unsatisfactory knowledge of environmental conditions, use of too general indicators, modest public participation. The case of the plan for the Province of Trento, currently in progress, is examined. This experience applies an eco-systemic approach to analyze the interactions among the different resource use cycles. Moreover, it tends to overcome the drawbacks of the top-down approach typical of plans, by means of a structured public involvement. In the Province of Trento, aspecific attention has to be devoted to the Alpine environment, which is endangered by the urban sprawl and the intensive use of resources. The plan will provide a deeper knowledge of environmental processes and will produce a set of appropriate indicators to assess the level of sustainability of the province, thus giving guidelines for improving policies and actions.

AB  - Emission spectra of the photolabile Ca2+ chelators DM-nitrophen, nitr-5, and diazo-2 were studied alone, and in the presence of indo-1, to investigate potential interactions that would make the simultaneous manipulation and ratiometric measurement of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration difficult. Neither diazo-2 nor its photoproduct were found to be significantly fluorescent, and consequently concentrations of diazo-2 up to 20 times that of indo-1 did not distort the emission spectra of indo-1. DM-nitrophen was scarcely fluorescent, but its fluorescence did increase upon photolysis. In contrast to diazo-2 and DM-nitrophen, nitr-5 itself was found to be quite fluorescent, and this fluorescence was significantly increased upon photolysis. Thus, combined use of nitr-5 and indo-1 poses the most difficulty. The emission spectra of all the investigated compounds were used to define experimental conditions and calibration procedures that make possible simultaneous measurement and manipulation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.

AB  - Plants of Tillandsia balbisiana, T. paucifolia, T. recurvata and T. utriculata exposed to 0.15, 0.30 or 0.45 ppm O3 or to 0.30, 0.60 or 1.20 ppm SO2 for 6 hr or sequentially to 0.30 ppm O3 (2 hr), 0.30 ppm O3 plus 0.60 ppm SO2 (2 hr) and 0.60 ppm SO2 (2 hr) did not exhibit visible injury. Fumigations also had no effect on foliar conductance or on DELTA-H+ associated with Crassulacean acid metabolism. Characteristics responsible for plant tolerance to short exposures to these two gases probably included low stomatal conductance, the insulating indumentum of absorbing foliar hairs and inherently slow metabolism. Reasons for postulating that Tillandsia is a better indicator for technological metals and certain other pollutants than for brief exposures to O3 and SO2 are discussed. We also conclude that epiphytic Tillandsia spp. offer advantages over lichens for air quality assessments under appropriate conditions. As vascular plants they exhibit sensitive, easily measured responses to stress and can be transplanted with ease to areas where neither they nor lichens occur naturally.

AB  - Heavy metals entered in the soil from numerous sources and reduce the crop growth, productivity, and the quality of the soil environment. Uptake of heavy metals by plants and microorganisms is synchronized through the influences of many factors, such as complex soil-plant and microorganism processes. Soil microorganisms are closely associated with soil fertility and are considered important indicators of healthy soils. Various microorganisms have different strategies and mechanisms for survival in heavy metal-contaminated environments such as biosorption, and secretion of compounds that form complexes with heavy metals. The present paper reviewed the recent literature pertaining to heavy metal uptake and tolerance mechanisms of the most important microbial genera viz Aeromonas, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas. This review also focused on the survival and adaptations of selected microbial genera in heavy metal polluted soil habitats which may be helpful in maintaining healthy conditions of agricultural soils. Overall, this review provided the comprehensive knowledge pertaining to heavy metals, their effects on living organisms, and the metal uptake and resistance mechanisms of the selected bacterial genera.

AB  - In this work, technological feasibility of autonomous corrosion assessment of reinforced concrete structures is studied. Corrosion of reinforcement bars (rebar), induced by carbonation or chloride penetration, is one of the leading causes for deterioration of concrete structures throughout the globe. Continuous nondestructive in-service monitoring of carbonation through pH and chloride ion (Cl-) concentration in concrete is indispensable for early detection of corrosion and making appropriate decisions, which ultimately make the lifecycle management of RC structures optimal from resources and safety perspectives. Critical state-of-the-art review of pH and Cl- sensors revealed that the majority of the sensors have high sensitivity, reliability, and stability in concrete environment, though the experiments were carried out for relatively short periods. Among the reviewed works, only three attempted to monitor Cl- wirelessly, albeit over a very short range. As part of the feasibility study, this work recommends the use of internet of things (IoT) and machine learning for autonomous corrosion condition assessment of RC structures.

AB  - Understanding what and how physico-chemical factors of a ligand configure conditions for ligand-receptor binding is a key to accurate assessment of toxic potencies of environmental pollutants. We investigated influences of the dipole-driven orientation and resulting directional configuration of ligands on receptor binding activities. Using physico-chemical properties calculated by ab initio density functional theory, directional reactivity factors (DRF) were devised as main indicators of toxic potencies, linking molecular ligand-receptor binding to in vitro responses. The directional reactive model was applied to predict variation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated toxic potencies among homologues of chrysene with structural modifications such as the numbers of constituent benzene rings, methylation and hydroxylation. Results of predictive models were consistent with empirical potencies determined by use of the H4IIE-luc transactivation bioassay. The experiment-free approach based on first principles provides an analytical framework for estimating molecular bioactivity in silico and complements conventional empirical approaches to studying molecular initiating events in adverse outcome pathways.

AB  - The North American Project to Evaluate Soil Health Measurements was initiated with the objective to identify widely applicable soil health measurements for evaluation of agricultural management practices intended to improve soil health. More than 20 indicators were chosen for assessment across 120 long-term agricultural research sites spanning from north-central Canada to southern Mexico. The indicators being evaluated include common standard measures of soil, but also newer techniques of visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy, a smart phone app, and metagenomics. The aim of using consistent sampling and analytical protocols across selected sites was to provide a database of soil health indicator results that can be used to better understand how land use and management has affected the condition of soil ecosystem provisioning for agricultural biomass production and water resources, as well as nutrient and C cycling. The objective of this paper is to provide documentation of the overall design, and methods being employed to identify soil health indicators sensitive across agricultural management practices, pedologies, and geographies.

AB  - The excessive use of nitrogen (N) has significant negative impacts on the environment and human health. Increasing N use efficiency and reducing N surplus balances are agricultural priorities. Here, we have developed new indicators that can be used to help manage N levels in production systems. These indicators represent an improvement over those currently in use.
   We describe a new nitrogen use efficiency - indicator and a new N balance indicator; both account for the impact of N inputs and variation in soil organic matter. Our third indicator makes it possible to compare a farm's current nitrogen use efficiency with its potential nitrogen use efficiency.
   We calculated values for these three indicators for 38 dairy - farms in Brittany to assess the farms' nitrogen performance. We found that our indicators yield useful results, especially when evaluating conditions on mixed crop-livestock farms.
   Farmers, agricultural advisors, and researchers can use a free online tool (https://www.nefficiencycalator.fr/en/) to calculate indicator values, which can help them identify strategies for improving their agricultural systems.

AB  - The regionalization studies of common bean genotypes are very important, having in to account the specific interaction between genotype and environment. The objective of this work was to determine the morphophysiological response of four commercial cultivars of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in late planting season in two types of soil at Remedios municipality. The experiments were developed in La Granja Agropecuaria "Liberacion de Remedios" whose soil is red ferralitic compacted and in the Agricultural Cooperative of Credits and Services "Celestino Gutierrez" with a soft carbonated brown soil. The plant morphophysiological indicators evaluated were height. number of leaflets, leaf area, total fresh and dry mass. For the study, an experimental random block design was used, consisting of four treatments (cultivars) and four replications. For each evaluation, a random sample of 50 plants per plot was taken. All variables evaluated were significantly higher in soft carbonated brown soil. Notable differences were observed among soil types, mainly in the acidity of the soil, which could influence the morphophysiological response of the commercial cultivars studied.

AB  - NADH and NADPH are ubiquitous coenzymes in all living cells that play vital roles in numerous redox reactions in cellular energy metabolism. To accurately detect the distribution and dynamic changes of NAD(P)H under physiological conditions is essential for understanding their biological functions and pathological roles. In this work, we developed a near-infrared (NIR)-emission fluorescent small molecule probe (DCI-MQ) composed of a dicyanoisophorone chromophore conjugated to a quinolinium moiety for in vivo NAD(P)H detection. DCI-MQ has the advantages of high water solubility, a rapid response, extraordinary selectivity, great sensitivity (a detection limit of 12 nM), low cytotoxicity, and NIR emission (660 nm) in response to NAD(P)H. Moreover, the probe DCI-MQwas successfully applied for the detection and imaging of endogenous NAD(P)H in both living cells and tumor-bearing mice, which provides an effective tool for the study of NAD(P)H-related physiological and pathological processes.

AB  - Statistical models poorly predict bacteria in near-shore environments of tropical islands due to inaccuracies in runoff and discharge characterization of storm events. Intense, short duration storms on small, steeply sloped watersheds produce high rates of runoff, resulting in rapid pulses of discharge that influence the physical and physiological conditions of the fate and transport of pathogens. As such, increasing rates of discharge are expected to have a different influence on sediment transport and pathogen load compared to decreasing rates of discharge. Regression modeling was used to examine the affect of antecedent streamflow on the interaction between environmental parameters and two fecal indicator bacteria, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens. Including the relative change in discharge incorporates a proximate representation of the energy available to transport particulates, improving predictions of near-shore water quality. Understanding factors that influence pathogen loads improves management of watersheds and protects public health.

AB  - Background: Proximity ligation-mediated methods are essential to study the impact of three-dimensional chromatin organization on gene programming. Albeit significant progress has been made in the development of computational tools that assess long-range chromatin interactions, next to nothing is known about the quality of the generated datasets.
   Method: We have developed LOGIQA (www.ngs-qc.org/logiqa), a database hosting quality scores for long-range genome interaction assays, accessible through a user-friendly web-based environment.
   Results: Currently, LOGIQA harbors QC scores for >900 datasets, which provides a global view of their relative quality and reveals the impact of genome size, coverage and other technical aspects. LOGIQA provides a user-friendly dataset query panel and a genome viewer to assess local genome-interaction maps at different resolution and quality-assessment conditions.
   Conclusions: LOGIQA is the first database hosting quality scores dedicated to long-range chromatin interaction assays, which in addition provides a platform for visualizing genome interactions made available by the scientific community.

TI  - Tracer Method to Determine Residence Time in a Permeable Reactive Barrier
T2  - GROUND WATER

KW  - PRECIPITATION
KW  - URANIUM
AB  - A method is presented to evaluate ground water residence time in a zero-valent iron (ZVI) permeable reactive barrier (PRB) using radon-222 (Rn-222) as a radioactive tracer. Residence time is a useful indicator of PRB hydraulic performance, with application to estimating the volumetric rate of ground water flow through a PRB, identifying flow heterogeneity, and characterizing flow conditions over time as a PRB matures. The tracer method relies on monitoring the decay of naturally occurring aqueous Rn-222 as ground water flows through a PRB. Application of the method at a PRB site near Monticello, Utah, shows that after 8 years of operation, residence times in the ZVI range from 80 to 486 h and correlate well with chemical parameters (pH, Ca, SO4, and Fe) that indicate the relative residence time. Residence times in this case study are determined directly from the first-order decay equation because we show no significant emanation of Rn-222 within the PRB and no measurable loss of Rn-222 other than by radioactive decay.

AB  - A palynological analysis was undertaken on 16 samples from seven piston cores collected along two offshore transects near Seymour and James Ross Islands. Diverse assemblages of reworked marine microplankton (including organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts, cymatiosphaerids leiospheres,and other acritarchs) and terrestrial palynomorphs (including pollen and spores) were recovered from glacio-marine sediments' of late Pleistocene age. Among the reworked taxa, four species belonging to the acritarch genus Palaeostomocystis Deflandre 1937 comprise up to 17% of all palynomorphs. Highest abundances were recorded from sites close to the coast. The potential use of Palaeostomocystis as a proxy for early ice-sheet development on the Antarctic margins is evaluated in light of earlier studies. This evaluation suggests that the high abundances of Palaeostomocystis on the Antarctic Peninsula reflect neritic-type environments (shallow waters, bay-like areas, or marginal seas) and sub-polar to polar conditions as exist in the Bering Sea, Greenland margins, and other sub-arctic to arctic areas today.

AB  - The relevance of the study is associated with the speed of modern sociopolitical processes in the territories, the emergence of new participants and tools for achieving their own and collective interests. The aim of the article is to describe the real urban processes of sociopolitical interaction in the conditions of reactive relations, taking into account the interests and positions of the participants, the content and dynamics of interaction. The methodological basis of the study is the concept of social action and power relations by M. Weber, the concept of resources by A. Giddens, research works by L.L. Shpak, who considers interaction in the aggregate of regional everyday sociopolitical practices. The article proposes a framework for the study of rapid reactive actions and relationships that can significantly accelerate the flow of social and political interactions. The analysis of reactive relations, the dynamics of the nature of social and political interaction on the scale of the urban space, as well as confirmation of signs of reactivity of relations, is based on the analysis of two cases of Kemerovo related to the improvement of the urban space, demonstrating at the same time the practice of social and political communications. For the Statue of Saint Barbara case, the method of content analysis is used to study the Internet audience; the method allows analyzing the density and coherence of information communications taking into account the inclusion and/or belonging of users in relation to the analyzed data. The use of the method of analyzing event data in the media (event analysis) for the Lazurny case illustrates the dynamics of social and political interaction. As a result, it has been revealed that, in the context of new reactive relations, the communicative potential of ordinary users (citizens) grows in the social and political interaction of a city or a certain territory. The practices of social interaction considered in the article are replenished from the implementation of innovative projects within the framework of urban communities. An important role is played by the constantly changing conditions for the transmission and accumulation of information significant in the urban space, as well as by the activity resource active drivers of modern communication. The prospect of further research is the search for new tools and indicators of a new quality of social and political interaction in the context of reactive relations.

AB  - A survey was conducted in central inland Queensland, Australia of 108 sites that were deemed to contain Aristida/Bothriochloa native pastures to quantitatively describe the pastures and attempt to delineate possible subtypes. The pastures were described in terms of their floristic composition, plant density and crown cover. There were generally similar to 20 (range 5-33) main pasture species at a site. A single dominant perennial grass was rare with three to six prominent species the norm. Chrysopogon fallax (golden-beard grass) was the perennial grass most consistently found in all pastures whereas Aristida calycina (dark wiregrass), Enneapogon spp. (bottlewasher grasses), Brunoniella australis (blue trumpet) and Panicum effusum (hairy panic) were all regularly present. The pastures did not readily separate into broad floristic sub-groups, but three groups that landholders could recognise from a combination of the dominant tree and soil type were identified. The three groups were Eucalyptus crebra (narrow-leaved ironbark), E. melanophloia (silver-leaved ironbark) and E. populnea (poplar box). The pastures of the three main sub-groups were then characterised by the prominent presence, singly or in combination, of Bothriochloa ewartiana (desert bluegrass), Eremochloa bimaculata (poverty grass), Bothriochloa decipiens (pitted bluegrass) or Heteropogon contortus (black speargrass). The poplar box group had the greatest diversity of prominent grasses whereas the narrow-leaved ironbark group had the least. Non-native Cenchrus ciliaris (buffel grass) and Melinis repens (red Natal grass) were generally present at low densities.
   Describing pastures in terms of frequency of a few species or species groups sometimes failed to capture the true nature of the pasture but plant abundance for most species, as density, herbage mass of dry matter or plant crown cover, was correlated with its recorded frequency. A quantitative description of an average pasture in fair condition is provided but it was not possible to explain why some species often occur together or fail to co-exist in Aristida/Bothriochloa pastures, for example C. ciliaris and E. bimaculata rarely co-exist whereas Tragus australianus (small burrgrass) and Enneapogon spp. are frequently recorded together. Most crown cover was provided by perennial grasses but many of these are Aristida spp. (wiregrasses) and not regarded as useful forage for livestock. No new or improved categorisation of the great variation evident in the Aristida/Bothriochloa native pasture type can be given despite the much improved detail provided of the floristic composition by this survey.

AB  - Surface lake sediments, 28 from Hoh Xil, 24 from northeastern China, 99 from Lake Bosten, 31 from Ulungur and 26 from Heihai were collected to determine C-13 and O-18 values. Considering the impact factors, conductivity, alkalinity, pH, TOC, C/N and carbonate-content in the sediments, Cl, P, S, and metal element ratios of Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Fe/Mn of bulk sediments as environmental variables enable evaluation of their influences on C-13 and O-18 using principal component analysis (PCA) method. The closure and residence time of lakes can influence the correlation between C-13 and O-18. Lake water will change from fresh to brackish with increasing reduction and eutrophication effects. Mg/Ca in the bulk sediment indicates the characteristic of residence time, Sr/Ca and Fe/Mn infer the salinity of lakes. Carbonate formation processes and types can influence the C-13-O-18 correlation. O-18 will be heavier from Mg-calcite and aragonite formed in a high-salinity water body than calcite formed in freshwater conditions. When carbonate content is less than 30%, there is no relationship with either C-13 or O-18, and also none between C-13 and O-18. More than 30%, carbonate content, however, co-varies highly to C-13 and O-18, and there is also a high correlation between C-13 and O-18. Vegetation conditions and primary productivity of lakes can influence the characteristics of C-13 and O-18, and their co-variance. Total organic matter content (TOC) in the sediments is higher with more terrestrial and submerged plants infilling. In northeastern and northwestern China, when organic matter in the lake sediments comes from endogenous floating organisms and algae, the C-13 value is high. C-13 is in the range of -4%o to 0 parts per thousand when organic matter comes mainly from floating organisms (C/N<6); in the range of -4 parts per thousand to 8 parts per thousand when organic matter comes from diatoms (C/N=6 to 8); and -8 parts per thousand to -4 parts per thousand when organic matter comes from aquatic and terrestrial plants (C/N>8).

TI  - Financial health indicators for prediction models of Slovak firms' financial situation
T2  - EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA  - Slovak
AB  - The analyses of both external and internal environment of Slovak business sector have led us to the following result: the business conditions as well as the firms' economic efficiency cause very different level of financial ratios of the Slovak firms compared to their level in the firms operating in the standard market environment. That's why it is not possible to expect the comparable results in the incomparable conditions.
   The results of the realized analysis document that - in spite of the fact that both economic environment and firms results as well are not standard - it is possible to identify the differences of certain financial ratios level in the compared groups. In the sense of the prediction methodics these indicators represents potential indicators of the Slovak firms' financial health. The analysis based on quantiles has shown the expressive distinction of these indicators as well as the stability of differences in time.
   From the methodological point of view our analysis resulted in the knowledge that it is possible to create the prediction models with the adequate reliability. That means we are able to identify the Slovak firms financial health indicators. These indicators are not identical with the ones used in the foreign models. At the same time we realize that our research represents only a first step in the prediction models creation. However, the identification of the financial health indicators is the important starting point for both the approaches used in Slovak economy for their creation - empirical as well as mathematic; and statistical (mainly by means of the discriminatory analysis). We can not forget more and more deepening trends taking into account the nonfinancial and nonquantifiable factors for the Slovak firms' financial health evaluation (i. e. the innovative potential or management quality).
   To ensure informatically the prediction models creation, i.e. to obtain the informative and examining sample of firms we recommend to concentrate on the representative database administrated by the DataCenter (Slovak Rating Agency and INFIN). The possibility of an annual actualization of models (solving the possible influence of expected fundamental changes of Slovak economic environment), completing of the built financial analysis system of Slovak business subjects as well as the extension of their application into both bank and non-bank sectors are considered as undoubted advantages of the mentioned institutional and organizational assurance proposal of the Slovak prediction models creation. The conception of the electronic register of financial statements published in accordance with the Commercial Code would help the creation of the informational base for the realization of the mentioned analysis.

AB  - The use of the relative ureide abundance (RUA) in the sap of mainly tropical ureide-producing legumes as a means to estimate the contribution of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is potentially an useful technique as it does not require the use of reference plants or additions of N-15-labelled fertilizer, and the analyses necessitate only relatively simple equipment. However, one problem in the application of the technique arises from the difficulty of obtaining sap samples from such legumes, especially small-stemmed forage legumes under field conditions. This study was conducted to investigate the possibility of using RUA in hot-water extracts of the stems of two forage legumes, Desmodium ovalifolium and a Centrosema hybrid, to estimate the contribution of BNF. In this case only ureide and nitrate are analysed to calculate RUA (100 x ureide-N/(ureide-N + nitrate-N)). The technique was calibrated with the N-15 isotope dilution technique in sand culture where the plants were fed with 5 different levels of nitrate (0, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mg N pot(-1)). Despite the fact that in many stem extracts more than 90% of the N was neither nitrate or ureide, the colorimetric techniques utilised proved reliable and relatively immune to interference from other solutes in the extracts. One problem with the use of the N-15 dilution technique to calibrate the RUA technique is that the former gives an integrated estimate of the BNF contribution since planting (or between harvests) and the latter is a point estimate at the time of sampling. This was overcome by using a 'plant to plant simulation technique' where estimates of BNF are calculated from the daily accumulation of total N and the labelled N derived from the growth medium by the legumes using a curve-fitting strategy. These estimates of BNF for the days when stem extracts were analysed for nitrate and ureide showed linear correlations (r(2) = 0.82 and 0.90 for the D. ovalifolium and Centrosema hybrid, respectively). This indicated that RUA of stem extracts of these two legumes was a reliable indicator of the BNF contribution, at least under controlled conditions.

AB  - This work was carried out in the course of research aimed at finding the possibility of non-hormonal-stimulation of the reproductive function of rams outside the lambing season. The subjects of the study were sheep of different breeds. The research was conducted in production conditions. Natural preparations were used, which were administered as injections or as a feed additive. When stimulating the reproductive function of rams through the use of non-hormonal drugs, the indicator sof sexual activity and the parameters of reproduction were taken into account. Also, biochemical blood parameters and testosterone levels were monitored. The positive influence of the used stimulation schemes on sexual activity and the quality of the sperm of rams were established.Testosterone levels in sheep experimental groups to the end of the study were 9.85 +/- 5.23 and 18.21 +/- 8.28 mmol/l, and in the control was 6.05 +/- 2.5 mmol/l. Some regularities of changes in biochemical indices of rams' blood are noted in experimental groups.Copyright (C) 2013 - All Rights Reserved - Pharmacophore

AB  - No other branch of social production is as closely concerned with the use of natural resources as agriculture - animal husbandry in general and dairy farming in particular. The intensification of the dairy industry causes constant changes of the priority principles of selection of animals on breeding grounds. The minimum percentage of cows leaving the main herd has been established with the indicators of linear estimator: udder depth of 6 points, the attachment of the anterior lobes of the udder at 5 points, the placement of front teats at 6 points. The probable (p<0.01) effect of anterior teat placement on the number of somatic cells in cow's milk has been found in both tied housing (eta(2)=12.0%) and free-stall housing (.2=3.6%). In order to effectively assess the condition of the udder of high-yielding cows during their selection for machine milking at modern dairy complexes, a method has been developed to classify the suitability of cows for industrial use into three categories.

AB  - The Cambrian Shoalbulak Formation is the most important source layer in the Tarim Basin. It is well exposed in the Keping Uplift in the northwestern Tarim Basin. In order to study the geochemical characteristics and sedimentary environment of the Yuertuss source rocks, we conducted a systematic geochemical analysis of the source rock samples of Sugetbulak profile and Well Shen 5 in Keping area. The results show that the TOC content of the Shoalbulak Formation outcrop samples in the Keping area is high and the biomarker compounds are abundant. The analysis results of element ratio, chloroform asphalt "A" component content, kerogen carbon isotope content and biomarkers show that the source rock of the Shoalbulak Formation is mainly type II kerogen. The type of kerogen is related to palco productivity and deposition conditions. The calculated results of the equivalent vitrinite reflectance and the characteristics of the biomarker compound match the higher maturity of the source rock. The source rock is mainly marine carbonate rock, and its depositional environment is the marine salinity

AB  - In the present study, we focus on the analysis of the volatile organic compound (VOC) contents in the grain of a representative set of winter wheat cultivars grown in Central Europe. The cultivars were grown in control conditions or were inoculated with the fungus Fusarium culmorum. In the analysed samples, hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones, aromatics, terpenes and others were found. Among them, results for terpenes seem particularly important. The discriminant analysis allowed complete separation of the quality groups of wheat based on VOCs. Simultaneously, a genetic matrix was created based on the genetic distance between the wheat cultivars and the Mantel test was used to compare it with the VOC matrix. The analysis revealed relationships between the genetic matrix and the overall VOCs, as well as terpenes. The obtained results indicate a significant relationship between microorganisms that exist in the environment, genetic features of plants and VOCs formed in the grain.

AB  - We propose a framework for the preliminary screening of chemical process designs according to sustainability criteria. Through the implementation of each flowsheet in a process simulator, several indicators based on sustainability pillars, i.e. economy, society, and environment, are calculated and then analyzed employing data envelopment analysis (DEA) in order to select the most efficient designs considering multiple criteria simultaneously. Suboptimal alternatives are further investigated by adopting a retrofit analysis, aiming to identify the parameters that most contribute to the final indicators scores, and therefore highlighting the major sources of deviation from optimal conditions. We applied this framework on a case study based on various patents regarding the production of pioglitazone hydrochloride in order to validate the capabilities of our methodology. Our approach, which embeds process simulation, sustainability indicators, and DEA within the same procedure, will support practitioners during the sustainability assessment of promising process designs, removing the inefficient ones.

AB  - Applying indicators in the context of vulnerability assessments is widespread but remains challenging for various reasons. This article focuses on quantitative estimates of urban vulnerability to climate change related hazards. It presents a methodology to assess three components of residential vulnerability in areas of different socio-environmental conditions: exposure, susceptibility and coping capacity, including the selection of indicators, combination of variables and building of indices. The overall purpose is the assessment of urban vulnerability in order to allow for a more precise consideration of who is vulnerable and why, and to demonstrate the potential coping capacities of people living in flood and heat prone areas. This acknowledges that in Santiago de Chile, the case study used to underpin this article empirically, only hazard exposure assessments have been undertaken so far. The case study findings of the vulnerability assessment confirm that the indicator-based approach is appropriate for analysis of exposure and susceptibility, but that coping capacity appraisal remains a challenge.

AB  - This contribution determines the coastal erosion risk of Necochea and Quequ,n cities, Necochea Municipality, Buenos Aires Province (Argentina). Both risk components, hazard and vulnerability, were assessed by the construction of indices. The hazard index is composed of four indicators: the erosion or accretion rate, coastal geomorphology, storm waves effects, and sediment supply. The vulnerability index is comprised of land use/cover, demographic, life conditions, and work and consumption indicators, and includes population census data such as demographic, education, health, sanitary, economic, production, work and population exposure aspects. The analysis concluded that coastal erosion risk ranges from very low to high along the study area, Quequ,n yielding the highest values. Risk levels vary in both cities based on the uneven spatial distribution of hazard. The risk assessment developed herein constitutes a practical and adequate tool that can be utilized with other elements and tasks in the elaboration of a coastal management program.

AB  - Nanofiltration (NF) of waste water originated from nanofiltration drinking water plant stationed in town of Kikinda (Northern Serbia) was investigated. Experiments on removal characteristics of nanofiltration membranes when exposed to influent rich in arsenic and natural organic matter under different flux and transmembrane pressure (TMP) conditions were conducted in order to obtain drinking water from waste water and reduce total amount of waste water. Applied NF membranes showed remarkable removal characteristics. Also, obtained result for concentrate yield, an indicator of reduced concentrate amount, of 8.89% under optimum flux value presents considerable amount of reclaimed drinking water. Calculated empirical and theoretical concentration factors quotients were indicated to probable accumulation of some inlet water components at NF membrane surface. Based on the obtained results that nanofiltration membranes remove natural organic matter, arsenic, ammonia and sodium with high efficiencies of around 98, 96, 80 and 93%, respectively, the conceptual design of drinking water plant for City of Kikinda was defined and presented.

AB  - I assess the outcomes of issues related to environmental justice under conditions of scientific uncertainty and cultural diversity using the case of the Tseng-Wen Reservoir Transbasin Water Diversion Project, Taiwan, to explore policy stakeholders' perceptions and the policy implications of indigenous struggles and local action. This water conflict reflects the expansion of a development-focused and resource-securing state, and represents a pattern of exclusion and control that disturbs traditional indigenous land and water systems. This study underscores the interrelationship among problems related to the inequitable distribution of interests and risk; the lack of recognition of cultural differences, local knowledge, and perspectives; and exclusion from the environmental impact assessment and decision-making processes. The findings also highlight local distrust of experts and the conflicts and confrontations among experts in differing disciplines. I argue that in order to reach a consensus through intercultural and interdisciplinary dialogue, local circumstances and knowledge must be included in knowledge production and policymaking.

AB  - This paper will demonstrate the use of a potential drop sensor to monitor strain. In particular, the suitability of the technique to high temperature or harsh environment applications presents an opportunity for monitoring strain in components operating under creep conditions. Monitoring creep damage in power station components is a long standing technological challenge to the non-destructive evaluation community. It is well established in the literature that strain rate serves as an excellent indicator of the progress of creep damage and can be used for remnant life calculations. To facilitate the use of such strain rate based evaluation methods, a permanently installed, strain sensitive, potential drop technique has been developed. The technique has very simple and robust hardware lending itself to use at high temperatures or in harsh environments. Strain inversions are presented and demonstrated experimentally; a room temperature, plastic deformation experiment is used for validation and additionally an accelerated creep test demonstrates operation at high temperature (600 degrees C+). Excellent agreement is shown between potential drop inverted strain and control measurements. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The isothermal adsorption kinetics of Cu2+ onto Carbon Black (CB) and Oxidized Carbon Black (OCB) were studied under different solution conditions and compared with bentonite and organic bentonite with the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA). The adsorption capacities followed the order of OCB > CB > organic bentonite > bentonite, which was consistent with the orders of their surface roughness and specific surface area. The Fourier transmission infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) were used to explore the adsorption mechanism at molecular level. The adsorption process onto CB was physical adsorption. However, with the increase of oxygen-containing functional groups (C=O, C-O, and CNO), the chelation adsorption onto OCB became gradually dominant except physical adsorption. The ion exchange adsorption was the major adsorption mechanism of bentonite. The compounds were introduced into clay interlayer by complexing reaction with Cu2+, which improved the adsorption capacity of organic bentonite. The results present a significant implication for the environmental fate assessment of heavy metal pollution.

AB  - Observational data of rainfall from a rain radar in Darwin, Australia, are combined with data defining the large-scale dynamic and thermodynamic state of the atmosphere around Darwin to develop a multicloud model based on a stochastic method using conditional Markov chains. The authors assign the radar data to clear sky, moderate congestus, strong congestus, deep convective, or stratiform clouds and estimate transition probabilities used by Markov chains that switch between the cloud types and yield cloud-type area fractions. Cross-correlation analysis shows that the mean vertical velocity is an important indicator of deep convection. Further, it is shown that, if conditioned on the mean vertical velocity, the Markov chains produce fractions comparable to the observations. The stochastic nature of the approach turns out to be essential for the correct production of area fractions. The stochastic multicloud model can easily be coupled to existing moist convection parameterization schemes used in general circulation models.

KW  - SERVICE QUALITY
AB  - There is significant potential in young talent for enhancing the credibility of the scientific assessments such as the IPCC's by contributing to quality assurance and quality control. In this essay, we reflect on an experiment that was done by the Dutch government as part of its government review of a contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). In an effort to review the entire Working Group II contribution to the AR5 within the official review period for the Second Order Draft (SOD), the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency turned to PhD students. This article shows that a systematic review focusing on transparency and errors of a large scientific assessment document using young talented scientists can be successful if certain conditions are met. The reviewers need to have intrinsic motivation to conduct the review. There needs to be a communication plan that fosters engagement and a clear methodology to guide the reviewers through their task. Based on this experiment in review, we reflect on the wider potential for openness and crowdsourcing in scientific assessment processes such as the IPCC's.

AB  - A single stage nitritation-anammox SBR was operated for 300 days to investigate the impact of cycle operation strategies on process performance and the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as process monitoring parameter. Different combinations of feeding (interval, continuous, one-time) and aeration (interval, continuous) strategies were tested revealing that interval feeding and interval aeration was the most suitable case in terms of process performance (ammonium removal, nitrate production and pH stability) and use of the ORP value as indicator parameter.
   Further investigations into the use of the ORP value showed clear correlations of the ORP slope with the air flow rate and the maximum ORP peak with the ammonium loading under varying operation conditions. Depletion of the main substrates (ammonium and oxygen) was also detectable fastest following the ORP value proofing its worth for process control. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial distribution, movement, and impact of the untreated wastewater outfall from McMurdo Station, Antarctica, were investigated under early austral summer conditions, The benthic environment was examined to determine the distribution of Clostridium perfringens in sediment cores and the intestinal contents of native invertebrates and fish along a transect of stations. These stations extended ca, 411 m south of the outfall, The findings revealed that the concentration of C, perfringens decreased with depth in the sediment and distance from the outfall, High percentages of tunicates and sea urchins were colonized with this bacterium along the transect. Coprostanol concentrations were also measured in sediment samples taken from each of the transect stations, and a similar trend was observed. These results are in agreement,vith the findings of previous studies performed with the water column and collectively provide evidence that the disposal of domestic wastes deserves special consideration in polar marine environments.

AB  - As a part of the WHO-initiated MONICA project 248, 50- and 60-year-old men participated in a study on the relations between HbA1C (glycated haemoglobin) and job stress indicators.  The participants answered a questionnaire on work, social and health conditions and underwent clinical examinations which included measurements of blood pressure, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and HbA1C.  Using the demand-control model for measuring job strain suggested by Karasek, we classified the employed participants according to those who had suffered job strain and those who had not.  This was done in two different ways.  The subjective classification was based on the participants' statements regarding demand and control in their job, whereas the objective one was based on job title, mode of payment, etc.  The levels of HbA1C were significantly higher among participants with objective job strain, high daily coffee consumption and low alcohol consumption.  Coronary risk factors and subjective job strain did not correlate significantly with the level of HbA1C.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) neural microtissues are a powerful in vitro paradigm for studying brain development and disease under controlled conditions, while maintaining many key attributes of the in vivo environment. Here, we used primary cortical microtissues to study the effects of neuroinflammation on neural microcircuits. We demonstrated the use of a genetically encoded calcium indicator combined with a novel live-imaging platform to record spontaneous calcium transients in microtissues from day 14-34 in vitro. We implemented graph theory analysis of calcium activity to characterize underlying functional connectivity and community structure of microcircuits, which are capable of capturing subtle changes in network dynamics during early disease states. We found that microtissues cultured for 34 days displayed functional remodeling of microcircuits and that community structure strengthened over time. Lipopolysaccharide, a neuroinflammatory agent, significantly increased functional connectivity and disrupted community structure 5-9 days after exposure. These microcircuit-level changes have broad implications for the role of neuroinflammation in functional dysregulation of neural networks.

AB  - The measured composition and distribution of methyltrimethyltridecylchroman (MTTC) compounds in the crude oils from Wenliu (salt-rich zone) and Machang (salt-free zone) areas of the Dongpu Depression were correlated with redox conditions and paleosalinity. The oil samples derived from the mesosaline environment were found with all alkylated MTTC series present. In addition, the dimethyl MTTCs developed more favorably in the oils derived from a relatively reducing and hypersaline environment (Wenliu) compared to those from the fresh lacustrine settings (Machang), while the trimethyl MTTCs developed more favorably in the fresh water environment (Machang). Determination of the oil maturity in the "oil window" by a series of aromatic maturity indicators suggests that MTTC compounds are not only present in immature or low-mature oils but also distributed in mature oils. Therefore, the "low-mature" oil found with abundant MTTC compounds, especially derived from the saline lacustrine settings, should be assessed with caution.

AB  - Visually-based approaches using techniques such as sediment surface images as well as sediment profile imaging (SPI) have been applied previously in the assessment of benthic impacts of organic enrichment. New visually-based benthic health indices (VBH and Surface Index) that integrate various visual properties was developed for muddy and sandier sediments, respectively. Visual indices were compared to the existing sulfide-based thresholds often used in environmental monitoring programs (EMPs). We utilized both techniques as well as geochemical indicators of eutrophication to detect benthic impacts at shallow shellfish and finfish farms in Nova Scotia, Canada. The visual indices were able to capture a non-sulfidic anaerobic condition in the sediments missed by the current sulfide-based system. Our results indicate that as presently configured, the visual based index will provide a more stringent standard in the EMPs that currently rely on a sulfide-based classification system, and thus affect regulatory judgement.

AB  - Three strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including two strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and one strain of Lactococcus lactis isolated from spontaneously fermented Yucha, a traditional Chinese home-made fermented fish product, were evaluated as starter cultures for Yucha production. All three starter cultures could drive Yucha fermentation processes by rapid colonizing and fast acidifying the raw fish materials, and restricting the growth of undesirable bacteria. As a result, the starter-inoculated Yucha products were safer than their spontaneously-fermented counterpart, and fewer biogenic amines were detected in them. During the late stage of Yucha fermentation, the initial L. lactis was gradually replaced by endogenous L. plantarum, indicating that Yucha environmental condition is a favorable niche of L. plantarum. Volatile compounds profiling combined with cluster analysis demonstrated that the competition between the two species significantly shaped the development of aroma and flavor compounds in Yucha. Besides, correlation analysis suggested that 1-methyl-naphthalene could be a potential indicator to evaluate the degree of ripeness in Yucha products.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a novel system dynamics (SD) model for better understanding the interrelation and feedback mechanism between the wastewater collection (WWC) and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) systems. Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) are developed and discussed to depict and understand feedback and inter-connections between physical, financial, and consumer sectors. The developed SD model is then extended to include the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as a proxy for the environmental sector and for an environmental sustainability assessment of strategic decisions related to asset management planning of wastewater infrastructure system. It also adds new policy levers, such as population growth and urban densification in the social sector, and minimum fee-hike rates in the finance sector to enhance the representation of real-world conditions in the asset management planning. This new SD model will enable decision-makers to assess the sustainability impacts of their strategic decisions on wastewater systems, find synergistic cost-saving opportunities, and improve the sustainability performance of their asset management plans.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe influence of three irrigation treatments (T0, no stress; T1, soft stress; and, T2, moderate stress) on the key functional properties [fatty acids, sugar alcohols, organic acids, minerals, total polyphenols content (TPC), and antioxidant activity (AA)], sensory quality, and consumers' acceptance of table olives, cv. Manzanilla', was evaluated.
   RESULTSA soft water stress, T1, led to table olives with the highest oil and dry matter contents, with the highest intensities of key sensory attributes and slightly, although not significant, higher values of consumer satisfaction degree. Besides, RDI in general (T1 and T2) slightly increased green colour, the content of linoleic acid, but decreased the content of phytic acid and some minerals.
   CONCLUSIONThe soft RDI conditions are a good option for the cultivation of olive trees because they are environmentally friendly and simultaneously maintain or even improve the functionality, sensory quality, and consumer acceptance of table olives. (c) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Mechanical looseness in induction motors is a common problem caused by loose bolts, structural damage, improper fit, or increased clearance between components, and results in increased vibration and wear. Detection of mechanical looseness in the sleeve bearing of industrial motors mainly relies on vibration analysis. However, there are many motor applications in the field where vibration analysis cannot be applied due to cost, environmental, and/or sensitivity limitations. The feasibility of using existing voltage/current measurements available in the motor control center for remote, low-cost monitoring of mechanical looseness due to improper fit between the bearing-housing and bearing-shaft is evaluated in this paper. It is shown through experimental testing on a custom built sleeve bearing test setup and on a 6.6 kV, 2250 hp motor that monitoring of the one-half and one-third subsynchronous components in the instantaneous power spectrum can serve as a reliable indicator of mechanical looseness.

AB  - Mate choice and sexual displays are widespread in nature, but their evolutionary benefits remain controversial. Theory predicts these traits can be favored by runaway sexual selection, in which preference and display reinforce one another due to genetic correlation; or by good genes benefits, in which mate choice is advantageous because extreme displays indicate a well-adapted genotype. However, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and the adaptive benefits underlying mate choice can themselves evolve. In particular, examining how and why sexual displays become indicators of good genes is challenging in natural systems. Here, we use experimental evolution in digital organisms to demonstrate the origins of condition-dependent indicator displays following their spread due to a runaway process. Surprisingly, handicap-like costs are not necessary for displays to become indicators of male viability. Instead, a pleiotropic genetic architecture underlies both displays and viability. Runaway sexual selection and good genes benefits should thus be viewed as interacting mechanisms that reinforce one another.

AB  - The Almendares River watershed covers a large portion of Havana city. Human activities have negative impacts over it. We studied the alteration of biological processes in fish from polluted sites. Stressor-based cumulative effects assessment was applied at individual level in Gambusia puncticulata (Poey, 1854). Three sites of Almendares River were sampled monthly from July 2006 to June 2007. Length and weight of females, and condition factor for both sexes, were higher in the impacted sites. An increase of food supply due to eutrophication can explain why fishes are heavier and longer at polluted sites. Gonadosomatic, specific fecundity index and embryo numbers were significantly higher on the reference site. The Hepatosomatic index was higher in females from the most contaminated sites. Differences in delta C-13 and delta N-15 among contaminated and reference sites suggest that the food source is not the same. Rev. Biol. Trop. 56 (4): 1991-2004. Epub 2008 December 12.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of fluoride on leaves of aquatic Salvinia auriculata Aubl., to supply subsidies for the use of this species as an environmental pollution bioindicator. The plants were cultivated under controlled conditions in pots containing nutritive solutions, and were submitted to simulated rain containing KF, in concentrations of 0, 13, 26 and 39 mM, in the morning, during five consecutive days. Results evidenced the occurrence of morphological and anatomical damages involving trichome and adaxial surface of the leaf necrosis. Alterations in the activity of peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase enzymes indicated the occurrence of oxidative damages in response to fluoride, although lipid peroxidation tests showed negative results. Alterations in pigment concentration also pointed to the occurrence of oxidative stress, caused by fluoride present in the simulated rain. The morphological, anatomical, enzymatic, and pigment composition alterations in S. auriculata can be used in atmospheric pollution biomonitoring, because they are easy to detect through simple methodologies.

AB  - Variations in the structure and dynamics of a phytoplankton community were determined during two periods in 2001, along five cascading reservoirs of the Iguacu River, Parana State (Brazil). The vertical dynamics of the phytoplankton was related to underwater light availability and the water column-mixing regime. Correlations between physical and chemical variables and phytoplankton abundance were evaluated by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). No significant cascading effect throughout the serial reservoirs was obtained. Thus, the main factor affecting the structure of the phytoplankton assemblages of each reservoir was the hydrodynamic pattern. The instability of the water column during the winter favored the development of R-strategist species such as Aulacoseira granulata, Urosolenia longiseta and U. eriensis in most reservoirs. In the period of the highest hydraulic stability and temperature, the greatest contribution to biomass came from Cyanophyceae S-strategists such as Aphanocapsa sp.l, Anabaena planctonica and A. crassa. The phytoplanktonic associations recorded were important indicators of the environmental conditions of these reservoirs.

The aim of this paper was to determine the 10-HDA in pure royal jelly and products containing royal jelly, using HPLC methodology. 10-HDA is the natural indicator of the presence of royal jelly in products and also gives the authenticity of pure royal jelly. The chromatographic conditions used were: isocratic system, C-18-H column, auto sampler, diode array UV-VIS detector (225 nm), mobile phase with methanol/water (45:55), pH= 2.5 and alpha-naphtol as internal standard. The results obtained using laboratory samples for pure royal jelly were 2.37%, varying from 0.15% for honey with 10% of royal jelly to 2.10% for honey with 90% of royal jelly respectivelly. For commercial products, the 10-HDA content varied from no detectable to 0.026%. The recovery test presented a minumum of 100.44% The detection limit was 45.92 ng/mL and the quantification limit was 76.53 ng/mL.

AB  - Recently, quality of life has become a commonly used concept and is showing growing significance in economic and political terms. Additionally, quality of life issues have been recognized within the migration processes. In one view, quality of life relates to the degree to which the necessary conditions for satisfaction exists in a given society or region.
   It is argued that quality, as a measurable variable would refer to both the subject and the object of inquiry. In this sense, quality of life has two aspects, psychological and environmental ones. Nevertheless, this limitation constitutes a major problem since some researchers have totally neglected the perception of the people who live there, while another limitation is about the components, indices and indicators chosen in a certain analysis.
   In this paper, the aim is to test some measurement methods of the quality of life and to show the possibilities and limitations of a developing area in comparison to developed ones. In this way, some comparative analysis can be performed on the measurement methods of the quality of life levels with respect to regional variations.

AB  - Holstein heifers from 47 dairy herds in France were enrolled in a field study to determine predictors for clinical mastitis within the first month of lactation. Precalving and calving variables (biochemical, hematological, hygienic, and disease indicators) were collected. Early clinical mastitis (ECM) predictive variables were analyzed by using a multiple logistic regression model (99 cows with ECM vs. 571 without clinical mastitis throughout the first lactation). Two variables were associated with a higher risk of ECM: a) difficult calving and b) medium and high white blood cell (WBC) counts in late gestation. Two prepartum indicators were associated with a lower ECM risk: a) medium and high serum concentrations of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and b) high percentage of eosinophils among white blood cells. Calving difficulty and certain biological blood parameters (IgG1, eosinophils) could represent predictors that would merit further experimental studies, with the aim of designing programs for reducing the risk of clinical mastitis in the first lactation.

AB  - The morphology of gonads and development of offspring of the scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis sampled from six stations in Peter the Great Bay (Sea of Japan) were studied. The retardation of gametogenesis, oocytes resorption, autolysis of spermatozoa and their phagocytosis were observed in the gonads of the scallops from polluted sites. The number of hermaphrodites was about 6% against 0.3-0.4% in the scallop populations from clean areas. In the offspring development, a decrease in fertilisation success, diminution in percent of normal trochophores, D-veligers, veligers, and retardation of larval growth were recorded. The scallop populations inhabiting polluted areas of Peter the Great Bay seem to be incapable of normal reproduction. Development of offspring was a more sensitive index of disturbance of the reproductive function than morphology of scallop gonads. Analysis of the offspring development of common species of marine invertebrates is suggested to be used as a sensitive indicator of adverse environmental conditions.

AB  - The Russian city of Murmansk has about 300,000 inhabitants and is located inside the Arctic Circle in NE Scandinavia (Russia). It has one of the largest such concentrations of people in the Arctic. The city is a scientific, industrial, cultural, and transportation centre (an ice-free port in the so-called Northern Sea Route, connecting Europe with Asia). Currently, air pollution in the city is associated with outdated city heating technology, coal dust from the port and vehicular traffic, and so-called "small emissions". The authors propose practical solutions based on known examples of Scandinavian cities with similar climatic conditions such as: the modernisation of heat energy acquisition; diversification of energy acquisition including renewable sources; thermal insulation of buildings; arrangement of urban greenery with dust-catching plants, and proposals for changing the habits within the population by promoting the use of public transport.

AB  - Soil stress, such as salinity, is a primary cause of global crop yield reduction. Existing crop phenotyping platforms cannot fully meet the specific needs of phenomics studies of plant response to soil stress in terms of throughput, environmental controllability, or root phenotypic acquisition. Here, we report the WinRoots, a low-cost and high-throughput plant soil cultivation and phenotyping system that can provide uniform, controlled soil stress conditions and accurately quantify the whole-plant phenome, including roots. Using soybean seedlings exposed to salt stress as an example, we demonstrate the uniformity and controllability of the soil environment in this system. A high-throughput multiple-phenotypic assay among 178 soybean cultivars reveals that the cotyledon character can serve as a non-destructive indicator of the whole-seedling salt tolerance. Our results demonstrate that WinRoots is an effective tool for high-throughput plant cultivation and soil stress phenomics studies.

AB  - In this study, the yield and growth performance of lettuce in an open-air rooftop hydroponic system were investigated. Lettuce was grown in a closed recirculating nutrient film technique (NFT) unit using a standard nutrient solution (NS). Yield, fresh weight, and nutrient content in the leaf tissue of the harvested lettuce were measured. The results were compared with the results obtained in indoor hydroponic lettuce growth with artificial lightning. Despite strong winds during the growth period, 25% of the total lettuce heads weighed twice the marketable weight; however, 25% of the total lettuce heads were below the marketable weight. A more efficient nutrient uptake was indicated by the lettuces in the rooftop system compared with the uptake in the indoor system. Foliar analysis revealed a higher content of all nutrients in the leaves of rooftop hydroponic lettuce compared with indoor hydroponic lettuce. This study suggests that hydroponic rooftop-grown lettuce can be competitive with their indoor counterparts if the rooftop hydroponic system is protected from extreme weather conditions.

AB  - A method has been developed for calculating the standard indicators of the reliability of elements of restored gas analytical systems for monitoring chemical pollution of the environment according to experimental reference data which differ in the simultaneous use of different results of processing experimental information obtained by the standard method, the interval method, and the Kaplan-Meier method, making it possible to test the reliability of small (cost-effective) samples of products under the conditions of their possible elimination from observation for reasons not related to failure. This methodology makes it possible to reduce the cost of development work and reduce the degree of uncertainty in the development of a maintenance and repair strategy not only for the specialized gas analytical systems under consideration, but also to solve the problems of optimal control of the operational reliability of a wide class of refurbished complex chemical and technical systems at the design stage.

AB  - The edible herbs Puerariae lobatae root, Pinus massoniana needle, Citrus reticulata peel and their mixture "SGLUAP" were extracted by supercritical CO2 fluid replacing usual ethanol solution. Optimal conditions of the extraction were determined by conducting series of experiments with Box-Benhnken Design of three-variables and three-levels, data fitting and modeling, and analyzing the visual 3D response surface plots. Scavenging free radical rate (DPPH%) and inhibiting xanthine oxidase rate (XO%) of 14 major ingredients in herbs and total phenolic compounds in SGLUAP were assessed. Among them, gallic acid gave DPPH (%) of 94.5 % to be higher than the reference Vitamin C, and daidzein possessed XO (%) of 97.8 % to be much higher than the reference allopurinol. This work has demonstrated a reliable and efficient methodology for extraction optimization, antioxidant activity evaluation and quality assessment of natural products from herbs or plants.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are deemed sensitive indicators of environmental conditions. Triggers and magnitudes of faunal response to environmental changes are yet poorly constrained. Benthic foraminiferal faunas were monitored annually at Ria Formosa (Algarve, Portugal) coastal lagoon since 2013. Distinct environmental changes were recognised during the monitoring period. The relocation of a tidal inlet in winter 2015 effected faster flushing, higher tidal levels, and stronger currents in the Esteiro do Ancao tidal channel. The epibenthic foraminiferal species Asterigerinata mamilla increased in abundance and the population densities of the whole fauna were double as high as before inlet relocation. Enhanced sediment redeposition was recorded and extensive polychaete colonies successively replaced firmground patches with oysters. The standing stock of the foraminiferal fauna declined in the next year due to food impoverishment, while the high hydraulic energy levels and high percentages of Asterigerinata mamilla maintained. Benthic foraminifera responded much faster to environmental perturbations than macroorganisms identifying them as powerful proxies in environmental studies.

AB  - Toxic cyanobacterial blooms, their prevalence in freshwaters, and their impact on water quality are well documented. In contrast, the impact on the recreational value of bathing sites of the cyanotoxin-contaminated inland waters, transported to estuarine and coastal marine waters, has been less frequently studied. The aim of this work was to assess water quality at bathing sites located in the southern Baltic Sea and the Curonian Lagoon, using cyanotoxins concentrations as an indicator. Our results showed that higher diversity and concentrations of cyanotoxins in some areas of the coastal zone are related to the transport of waters from the Curonian Lagoon. The studied bathing sites had a relatively low probability of adverse health effects, with a potential higher risk in the southern part of the Curonian Lagoon (Lithuania). Due to the observed changes in the cyanobacteria community, the determination of cyanotoxins concentrations, irrespective of the analysis of cyanobacteria, is recommended.

AB  - Landscape resource assessment of compound ecological system is the basic condition for planning various management activities. After field survey and obtaining landscape photos of the Badaling region, we built the evaluation system of landscape resources. Then, we recruited people to evaluate the indicators of different scenic spots with evaluation system and overall evaluation by scenic beauty estimation method (SBE). The results showed that A01 and A05 gave a good impression to tourists from the point of view of scenic spots. Judging from the evaluation indicators, the entire region had a high score in geological landscape, while some of the scenic spots had low scores in humanity landscape. Overall evaluation has better practicability for the area with better landscape. The two evaluation methods are consistent in evaluating good landscape by SBE, through analyzing the main reasons for the differences in evaluation. The results and methodology can benefit landscape resource assessments as well as provide support on planning and management for compound ecological system.

AB  - The authors conducted the economic analysis of the efficiency of using the reserves of the agro-industrial complex during the integration of energy conservation processes and the transition to energy conserving production. The authors used various theoretical and analytical methods, since the energy sector is more susceptible to permanent forecasting and planning, because present state energy policy depends on the knowledge of available and consumed energy resources in the future. It was established that the agro-industrial complex can be an important source of "green" energy, since waste, organic oils, wood can be recycled and in such way clean energy can be obtained. This significantly saves natural resources, time for transportation, processing, marketing. In addition, agriculture is the most attractive industry for economic investment in the world. It was determined that the state policy in the field of alternative energy sources is unique for each country, which is due to the specifics of economic development and the climatic conditions.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal proportions of interaction between foreign and domestic suppliers and investors in the institutional structure of the Vietnam Textile and Garment Industry (VTGI). Based on a survey of representatives of 388 VTGI enterprises, the economic efficiency of the industry's enterprises and the degree of dependence on foreign suppliers and investors are assessed. The survey was conducted in a stable market environment (April-June 2019) and in a crisis (April-June 2020). Regression models of the influence of indicators of dependence on foreign suppliers and investors on the enterprise performance indicator are constructed. By solving a system of equations (dependence functions), the optimal proportions of the structure of interaction between foreign and domestic suppliers and investors are determined quantitatively in order to maximize the economic efficiency of clothing and textile enterprises in the context of crisis manifestations in the market conditions of operation.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to design a mathematical model with a multi-objective approach to improve the integral management of the supply chain of the urban solid waste collection process in the canton of Quevedo in Ecuador. The proposed model resolves inadequacies in the scientific literature and proposes to generate information for the decision making by the authorities of the canton of Quevedo. To achieve this, a diagnosis is made of the current conditions of the process of collecting, transporting, transferring and treating urban solid waste, then identifying the indicators that will serve to measure the current management of the process of urban solid waste collection, and later a multi objective mathematical model is elaborated in which three objective functions are posed whose goal is the optimization of the problem, considering a series of restrictions. The result is based on redesigning the supply chain for the management of urban solid waste, achieving minimizing the cost, maximizing the environmental impact savings and maximizing customer satisfaction.

AB  - Infrastructures such as roads and pipelines have environmental impacts that diffuse far beyond the local development footprint, including fragmenting habitat or changing hydrology. Broad-scale diffuse impacts are challenging to incorporate into conservation planning and strategic environmental assessment due to difficulties in determining how impacts spread across landscapes. We built curves representing expert-elicited magnitudes and spatial extents of direct and diffuse impacts of infrastructure on biodiversity groups, to incorporate these impacts into a spatial conservation prioritization. We demonstrate how different prioritization outputs inform different steps of the impact assessment mitigation hierarchy. In southern Australia we find the diffuse-impact footprint to be four times higher than direct (i.e., local) infrastructure impacts, with >75,000 km(2) of spatial priority areas for mitigation and >37,000 km(2) of spatial priority areas for offsets potentially missed if diffuse impacts are ignored. Understanding both direct and diffuse infrastructure impacts will avoid inefficient spatial allocation of environmental mitigation, restoration, and offsetting efforts.

AB  - Although there are many conditions to be met for the disease to occur (genetic predisposition, environmental factors, stress, exposure to pollutants, noxes, xenobiotics, diet), chronic inflammation is the way how the body responds to these substances. Excess weight leads to an alteration of the immune response, to an increased oxidative stress, and damage to the cellular Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) structure. The study aims to evaluate inflammation in obese mothers. The study group consisted of 30 pregnant women in which inflammation was analysed, with a mean age of 30.80 +/- 6,94 years old divided in 2 groups depending on their weight, that is 25 pregnant women with obesity and 5 normoponderal pregnant women. From the markers found in the blood samples, only CRP (AUC=0.740; IC95%: 0.466-1.014), leptin (AUC=0.616; IC95%: 0.296-0.936) and glycaemia (AUC=0.648; IC95%: 0.369-0.927) were good indicators of immune inflammation. The estimated risk of immune inflammation is 5 times higher in obese pregnancies with CRP levels above 6.

AB  - The ecohydrology aims at integrating the concepts of hydrology and ecology, creating a broader approach to understand the water resources' dynamics, facilitating the plan and management of resources. One way to integrate hydrology with ecology is by developing Habitat Suitability Index (HSI), a process that stands out by providing relevant information on wetlands. HSI is obtained by relating the information about the bioindicators and ecohydrological conditions necessary to ensure these species' survival, enabling to evaluate the impacts on them. The development of HSIs integrated with hydrodynamic modeling and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allows us to obtain spatialized habitat suitability information, that provide information about the quality of a species' (or group of species') habitat, contributing to the improvement of water resources management strategies combined with the biodiversity conservation in wetlands. Regarding this, the present article presents the HSI's development process and its application to evaluate the suitability of the Taim Basin, inserted in Taim Ecological Station, an important Southern Coastal wetland located in the State of Rio Grande do Sul.

AB  - The need to balance agricultural production and environmental protection shifted the focus of Brazilian land-use policy toward sustainable agriculture. In 2010, Brazil established preferential credit lines to finance investments into low-carbon integrated agricultural systems of crop, livestock and forestry. This article presents a simulation-based empirical assessment of integrated system adoption in the state of Mato Grosso, where highly mechanized soybean-cotton and soybean-maize double-crop systems currently prevail. We employ bioeconomic modeling to explicitly capture the heterogeneity of farm-level costs and benefits of adoption. By parameterizing and validating our simulations with both empirical and experimental data, we evaluate the effectiveness of the ABC Integration credit through indicators such as land-use change, adoption rates and budgetary costs of credit provision. Alternative scenarios reveal that specific credit conditions might speed up the diffusion of low-carbon agricultural systems in Mato Grosso.

AB  - This paper presents a study on reduction of energy consumption in buildings through behaviour change informed by wireless monitoring systems for energy, environmental conditions and people positions. A key part to the Wi-Be system is the ability to accurately attribute energy usage behaviour to individuals, so they can be targeted with specific feedback tailored to their preferences. The use of wireless technologies for indoor positioning was investigated to ascertain the difficulties in deployment and potential benefits. The research to date has demonstrated the effectiveness of highly disaggregated personal-level data for developing insights into people's energy behaviour and identifying significant energy saving opportunities (up to 77% in specific areas). Behavioural research addressed social issues such as privacy, which could affect the deployment of the system. Radio-frequency research into less intrusive technologies indicates that received-signal-strength-indicator-based systems should be able to detect the presence of a human body, though further work would be needed in both social and engineering areas.

AB  - Over recent years, fisheries managers have been going through a paradigm shift to prioritize ecosystem-based management. With this comes an increasing need to better understand the impacts of fisheries management decisions on the social well-being and sustainability of fishing communities. This article summarizes research aimed at using secondary data to develop socioeconomic and fisheries involvement indices to measure objective fishing community well-being in Alaska. Data from more than 300 communities in Alaska were used to create a database of socioeconomic and fisheries involvement indices of objective well-being and adaptability for Alaska communities dependent on marine resources. Each index was developed using a principal components factor analysis to assess the relative position of each community compared to all other communities in Alaska. We find that creating performance measures, such as the indices presented here, provides a useful way to track the status of socioeconomic conditions and fisheries involvement by communities over time.

AB  - Developing a herd localization system capable to operate unattended in communication-challenged areas arises from the necessity of improving current systems in terms of cost, autonomy or any other facilities that a certain target group (or overall users) may demand. A network architecture of herd localization is proposed with its corresponding hardware and a methodology to assess performance in different operating conditions. The system is designed taking into account an eventual environmental impact hence most nodes are simple, cheap and kinetically powered from animal movements - neither batteries nor sophisticated processor chips are needed. Other network elements integrating GPS and batteries operate with selectable duty cycles, thus reducing maintenance duties. Equipment has been tested on Scandinavian reindeer in Lapland and its element modeling is integrated into a simulator to analyze such localization network applicability for different use cases. Performance indicators (detection frequency, localization accuracy and delay) are fitted to assess the overall performance; system relative costs are enclosed also for a range of deployments.

AB  - To evaluate the influences of soil acidification on soil microorganisms and soil fertility, soil physicochemical and microbial properties were studied in pear orchards of Wendeng city where soil acidification is severe with soil pH value ranging from 4.06 to 6.59. Soil pH value was found to be significantly positively correlated with the amount of culturable bacteria (r = 0.935) and total extractable microbial fatty acids (r = 0.931) by correlation analysis and stepwise regression analysis, as well as amount of culturable actinomycetes (r = 0.865) and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis activity (r = 0.780) by correlation analysis. Soil pH was determined to have a large influence on microbial community structure by principal component analysis of fatty acid methyl ester, which showed that microbial community structures were similar in soils with similar pH values. Being sensitive to environmental changes, soil microorganisms proved to be good indicators for the evaluation of soil health conditions and to monitor changes of soil quality.

AB  - Taphonomic signatures on modern bivalve shells, such as traces of drilling organisms, encrusters, fragmentation, and abrasion function as indicators of environmental differences on Belize atoll reefs. Glovers Reef, Lighthouse Reef, and Turneffe Islands are three adjacent Caribbean atolls showing variations in geomorphology, lagoonal depth, sedimentation, mangrove growth, sea-grass cover, and exposure to winds and currents, as well as differences in their lagoonal development and age. A variety of bivalve assemblages characterize lagoonal subenvironments and also mirror the above-mentioned environmental variations. Taphonomic signatures, such as shell-size distribution, disarticulation, sorting, boring traces, encrustations, fragmentation, and abrasion, were identified on bivalve shells from a total of 111 surface sediment samples. Shell-size distribution and sorting of right and left valves indicate in situ deposition of populations on each atoll. Increasing residence times of shells on the sediment surface due to decreasing sedimentation rates from Turneffe Islands to Lighthouse Reef to Glovers Reef cause an increase in taphonomic shell signatures.

AB  - Modem chironomid assemblages consisting of 68 taxa were extracted from the sediments of 39 lakes in southwest Yukon and northern British Columbia, Canada. Important factors accounting for the distribution of the chironomid taxa include sediment organic matter (LOI; weight-loss-on-ignition), total phosphorus, bottom water temperature, and lake alkalinity. The results show the importance of organic matter, which is associated with water depth and lake productivity, in affecting chironomid community composition. Tanytarsus sp. C, Tanytarsus pallidicornis type, Allo/Mesopsectrocladius, Polypedilum, and Procladius were associated with lakes having high LOI values and shallow lake depths, while Paratanytarsus, Sergentia, and Corynocera oliveri type were more prevalent in deeper lakes with more minerogenic sediments. Surprisingly, Chironomus was most abundant in deeper lakes with low LOI values, which might be partially explained by low oxygen levels. Contrary to some findings, Tanytarsus lugens group was common in shallow, productive lakes in this region.

AB  - Assessments of the long-term natural regeneration of tropical forests following selective logging are today mostly based on extrapolation of limited empirical observations. Mounting evidence suggests that current logging policies overestimate forest regrowth by a wide margin, and are therefore not sustainable. The need for more reliable assessment of natural forest growth dynamics has led to the development of a vertically and spatially structured dynamic simulation model of natural forest development. The model accounts explicitly for biomass and tree numbers in five distinct canopy layers (seedlings, saplings, poles, main canopy, emergents). Energy accounting of assimilation and dissimilation rates leads to biomass, diameter, and height growth in each layer. Leaf mass in each layer determines photoproduction, and light and photosynthesis conditions in lower layers. Transitions to higher layers, mortalities in each layer, and seed events are accounted for. The basic model simulates the development dynamics of a forest gap. Parallel computation of spatially distributed single gap models with stochastic mortalities and seed dispersal provides a simulation of the spatial dynamics of the tropical forest mosaic. Simulation results are provided with parameters corresponding to unlogged and logged Malaysian lowland dipterocarp forest.

AB  - Urban areas in developing countries face many challenges to improve Quality of Urban Life (QUL). This highlights the need for providing a systematic approach for assessing QUL on regular basis, which can assist in identifying main areas for improvement and support planning and management effort. For this purpose, this paper intends to identify key determinates of QUL and estimate their contribution to housing prices by employing a spatial hedonic pricing approach in Alexandria city. To attain this objective, a three-step methodology was applied involving identification of QUL indicators, determining the sampling procedure and collecting data, and spatial econometrics analysis through Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). GWR showed that the considered QUL attributes have a noticeable explanatory power exceeding 0.80. These attributes include housing physical conditions, environmental quality and aesthetic attributes, and socio-demographic attributes. Accordingly, city planners and managers should target these attributes in order to improve QUL in the city.

AB  - Sequential indicator simulation algorithm is one of the popular stochastic simulation algorithms for reservoir geomodelling. It has been used to model delineated lithofacies and depofacies units within the OPO field, western Niger Delta. This simulation algorithm was chosen because of its ability to honour the well logs as local conditioning data using the global histogram, areal and vertical geological trends of the data, as well as the patterns of correlation. Three lithofacies were identified and modelled, namely sand, shaly sand and shale units. Vertical succession of the depositional facies within the field reveals five major facies which are basal shelf shale facies, heterolithic (sand-shale) facies, lower shoreface sand facies, upper shoreface sand facies and shoreface channel systems. The general environment of deposition is interpreted to be shoreline-shelf systems where the shoreface channel units, upper shoreface sand, lower shaly sand and heterolithic units constitute the parallic reservoir sequences, while the shale units within the shoreface and coastal environments act as potential source rocks and caprocks for hydrocarbon accumulation.

AB  - No-tillage and inter-crops have been progressively introduced into traditional Brazilian tobacco plantations. However, there is a lack of information about their impact on soil erosion rates and soil properties. We studied 10 experimental plots in Parana (Brazil) that rotated from no-tillage tobacco to two different inter-crop types (black beans and oats) and conventionally tilled tobacco to quantify erosion rates from September 2014 to February 2016. The results show that soil loss (18Mgha(-1)) and runoff coefficient (8.3%) were higher under conventional tillage tobacco than under no-tillage tobacco (3.4Mgha(-1) and 0.6%). Bulk density was higher at the end of the cropping cycle than at the beginning. We concluded that conventional crops increased soil erosion, and the use of inter-crops and no-tillage is highly recommended for soil and water conservation. The findings should be valid for other regions that have similar cropping systems and environmental conditions.

AB  - The maintenance of energy homeostasis is achieved with 'detectors' that receive signals from the external and internal environment and with multidirectional 'communication routes' including neuronal networks and body fluids, such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Changes in the energy demands of organisms are caused by current physiological status and environmental conditions, including season and food availability. Little is known about the interactions between the metabolic indicators involved in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, e.g., leptin, orexins and ghrelin. Sheep and other seasonal animals are highly adaptable to their environments because of the plasticity of their neural and endocrine systems. Sheep exhibit leptin resistance and are thus an extremely interesting model for research on the relationship between hormonal indicators of energy metabolism. The paper is focused mainly on the anatomical and functional communication between leptin, ghrelin and orexins, which play principal roles in the adaptation of energetic demands to environmental fluctuations.

AB  - Despite availability of guidance on scoping in environmental impact assessment (EIA) in several jurisdictions, there is limited documented evidence about how scoping is actually conducted in practice. We benchmark internationally recommended good practices and develop a conceptual framework to evaluate scoping practice, applying it to the Brazilian federal EIA process. Practices are organized in four categories: provision of initial information, scope determination, stakeholder involvement and process management. Scoping of 10 projects was analyzed through document review and interviews with government officials. Results show that the process: (i) is supported by interagency review but not by public participation, (ii) features limited focus on relevant issues and impacts; and (iii) strongly concentrates on requiring descriptions of baseline conditions. The research found that deficiencies in scoping led to delays in the review phase and did not prevent conflicts during public consultation. Although staff at the federal environmental agency acknowledges those shortcomings, there is no shared understanding about key actions for improvement.

AB  - The sustainable management of China's rivers is very important to the well-being of both the environment and its people. Yet the country's rivers are now facing imminent threats from river overexploitation. The deteriorating condition serves as a stark reminder that relevant policies must be revised to ensure their wiser stewardship. In this short critical review, we first briefly stated river development history and various impacts arising from river overexploitation. We then elaborated the issues in river management, which connived numerous behaviors neglecting river degradation happened at all institutional levels. Based on the weakness, we proposed some policy recommendations to sustain China's rivers and balance river development and conservation. The article concludes by proposing the development of a national river protection law to reinforce integrated river management, improve the implementation of environment impact assessments, and fulfill long-term goals for river conservation and sustainable development.

AB  - Coral reefs are threatened by impacts such as from scuba diving, and ongoing research is required to assess diving impacts, diver behavior and environmental knowledge. This study investigated perceived diving impacts, reef condition and norms among scuba divers at Sodwana Bay (South Africa). Divers viewed contact with coral as damaging, and perceived environmental degradation at dive sites. However, most divers saw activities such as photography as causing little or no damage to reefs. One meter or less was believed to be a safe distance from the reef or the wildlife to avoid contact or disturbance, and encounter norms were high. Age and experience influenced most perceptions, although cannot be accepted as reliable indicators of divers' perceptions or behavior, due to the heterogeneous conduct of divers of various experience and age as described in literature. The importance of human perceptions to understand what strategies need implementation in diving management is discussed.

AB  - The degradation of natural resources worldwide has led to important questions about how to use these resources and the prospects for future development at the pace of current exploitation. In Mexico, forest management is mainly in the hands of ejidos and communities. This research evaluated in 2010 the impact of the Pilot Forest Plan (PFP) established in Quintana Roo in the 1980s. The study examined the socioeconomic and cultural aspects of forest management in two ejidos: Noh Bec and Xhazil. Welfare, natural conditions and the change in social, economic and cultural aspects were analyzed with a wellbeing index in relation to forest management, which took into account natural, human social, economic and cultural systems. The current well-being status in relation to forestry was medium high and medium for Noh Bec and Xhazil, respectively. Forest management with the strategic PFP guidelines was an adaptive process for both ejidos, which showed significant differences in community organization, marketing, diversification and financial support.

AB  - Phytoliths were extracted from 14 woody plants collected on the northern slope of the Changbai Mountain, including 10 broad-leaved species and 4 conifers. A total of 14 morphotypes of phytoliths were identified, including 3 types first examined in this study. Phytoliths in broad-leaved species were mostly silicified epidermal cells, cell walls, and vascular tissues; phytoliths in conifers were mainly silicified epidermal cells, cell walls, hypodermal cells, and parenchyma cells. Phytoliths produced by broad-leaved species in this region were usually not well silicified, and were fragile, whereas those produced by conifers were better silicified; this might be because of the different lengths of the growth periods. Phytoliths were found have potential in studies of fluctuations of the tree line in this region, and this study also provided a reference for further study of phytoliths in this region and the regional contrast of phytolith assemblages.

AB  - The present paper deals with an important environmental issue: air pollution with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in oil terminals. In attempt to determine the dependence of VOCs concentration in the air on the wind speed and oil loading intensity analyses were carried out during shorter time intervals, when the fluctuations of ambient temperature are minimal (1-3)degrees C. VOCs concentrations were analysed by gas chromatography method in different chosen observation posts during different seasons. A complex analysis of experimental study and impact of meteorological conditions on the air pollution was performed taking into account the oil loading intensity in oil terminals and the types of loaded oil products. A new indicator was introduced for the analysis of the obtained results - a loading indicator that characterizes the amount and type of handled products as well as the number and type of operations carried out in the terminal. The dependence of the change of VOCs concentration on the loading indicator has been determined.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of bacterial agents, especially the contamination by Staphylococcus spp., Salmonella spp. Coliform bacteria and coliforms in frozen quail carcasses marketed in Recife-PE. Were analyzed 26 samples of frozen quail carcasses from illegal slaughterhouses. The study revealed that 13 samples (50%) had counts of Staphylococcus spp. above the Microbiological Sanitary Standards for chilled, frozen and "in natura" poultry meat. The study of microorganisms as indicators of fecal contamination revealed that 14 (53.86%) samples had scores above the established limits for the group of total coliforms and thermotolerant, being considered as unacceptable. The search for Salmonella spp. revealed that 1 (7.69%) sample was positive, being considered unfit for consumption. It is concluded that part of the samples of quail carcasses from the studied illegal abattoirs showed unsatisfactory conditions for consumption and that sanitary measures should be implemented since slaughtering to marketing of this meat to reduce the risks to consumers.

AB  - Adsorption mechanisms of toxic non-ionic organic contaminants (NOCs), aniline and nitrobenzene, with natural-zeolite and organo-zeolite (OZ) were investigated in both batch and continuous systems. In batch tests, the adsorption capacity of aniline and nitrobenzene onto natural zeolite surface is very low or almost nil but becomes significant upon modifying the zeolite surface by hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA). A partitioning mechanism is proposed to be responsible for the adsorption of NOCs onto OZ. The effectiveness of the partitioning mechanism is directly connected with hydrophobic properties of the NOCs. The column tests were carried out as an indicator for continuous system. The breakthrough curves were constructed for OZ/NOC system and the adsorption capacity of NOCs onto OZ under the present conditions were determined as 2.36 and 3.25 mg per gram of OZ, for aniline and nitrobenzene, respectively. A schematic model is proposed to account for the adsorption of NOCs onto OZ.

T2  - INTERCIENCIA
LA  - Spanish
KW  - WATER
AB  - The presence of a hypolemnitic anaerobic cone, maintained by the salinity stratification, and the high productivity; has been proposed as evidence of an advanced eutrophication of Lake Maracaibo. Since salinity has increased with the deepening of the navigation channel, it has been proposed, as a remedial measure, the elimination of the channel and the relocation of shipping facilities to a multiport in the nearby Gulf of Venezuela. The high yield of fisheries (71700 MT/year) and the stability of the catch of indicator commercial species imply that there is not an advanced deterioration of the system. The historic baselines support the alternative hypothesis that the high phytoplanktonic productivity and the presence of an anaerobic zone are natural traits of the Lake that were present prior to the deepening of the channel. The Maracaibo depression is an important oil producing basin, and the anaerobic condition and high production and accumulation of non-degraded organic matter, are characteristics of the processes leading to oil accumulation. Research on the paleoenvironments of the late Quaternary may contribute to strengthen this hypothesis.

TI  - A NEW APPROACH FOR ROCK MASS CAVABILITY MODELING
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES & GEOMECHANICS ABSTRACTS
LA  - English
CP  - 34th U.S. Symposium on Rock Mechanics
AB  - The proposed approach to study rock mass cavability consists of an attentive caving analysis incorporating main geotechnical parameters that rule this phenonenon.  The modeling was elaborated in three main stages. First, numerous simulations, conducted in plasticity with the finite element method, allowed to establish a cavability relation between initial stresses, excavation dimensions and rock mechanical strength. The second step takes over if the rock material is strong enough to avoid caving, and the analysis is pursued taking into account the natural joints as a complementary parameter. The rock joints are analysed in terms of density and block volumes to check if the rock mass is fractured enough or if the block volume distribution allow possible cavability. If rock strength as well as joint density and block volume distribution do not allow to conclude rock cavability, the third stage is required and the motion of the blocks is studied. A model based on the distinct element method, enabled to simulate the caving process and to outline the conditions required for cavability with regard to the excavation's shape and dimensions as well as the orientations and the mechanical characteristics of the joints.

AB  - Analysis of helium distributions in the formational gases of the North-American continent has been carried out taking into account possible influence of formation of hydrocarbons, methane in the first instance.  Helium contents decrease with increasing of the thickness of sedimentary cover (these variations are detectable in the depths of less than 1 km) and the depth, particularly under the shallow bedded evaporites.  The helium distributions observed is a consequence of mass exchanged between low-helium formational gases from significant depths and high-helium underground water that was not involved in the process of gas formation and bed in the depths of gas accumulation.  Only primary helium containing in the formational gases provides information on the gas formation reservoir.  Total helium isotope composition in the formational gases does not contradict to the mantle origin of this primary helium in very low concentrations, and, as a consequence, to the genetic connection of hydrocarbon layer gases with the mantle outgassing.

AB  - In the working condition, the fault-excited impulses of axial piston pump bearings may be entirely buried by violent natural periodic impulses. Aiming at this problem, a fault frequency bands location method based on improved fast spectral correlation (Fast-SC) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the Fast-SC is applied to analyze the original vibration signal to generate the cyclic spectral correlation image. Then, a new indicator named kurtosis enhanced spectral entropy (KESE) is exhibited to locate the fault frequency bands from the whole spectral frequency band, thereby highlighting the fault-excited impulses. Finally, the squared enhanced envelope spectrum (SEES) is employed to further extract feature frequencies and identify the fault type of the bearing. Experimental results validate the superiority and efficiency of the presented method. The fault-excited impulses extraction ability of the presented method is better than the traditional Fast-SC algorithm and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) algorithm.

AB  - Plants display sophisticated mechanisms to tolerate challenging environmental conditions and need to manage their ontogenesis in parallel. Here, we set out to generate an RNA-Seq time series dataset throughout grapevine (Vitis vinifera) early bud development. The expression of the developmental regulator VviAP1 served as an indicator of the progression of development. We investigated the impact of changing temperatures on gene expression levels during the time series and detected a correlation between increased temperatures and a high expression level of genes encoding heat-shock proteins. The dataset also allowed the exemplary investigation of expression patterns of genes from three transcription factor (TF) gene families, namely MADS-box, WRKY, and R2R3-MYB genes. Inspection of the expression profiles from all three TF gene families indicated that a switch in the developmental program takes place in July which coincides with increased expression of the bud dormancy marker gene VviDRM1.

AB  - Knowledge of the ecological traits of insects has a fundamental importance for their conservation and, at the same time, for a better interpretation of the effects of climate change. Orthoptera appear to be good indicators of global warming. The goal of this study was to take a census of the species overwintering at the adult stage in a xerothermic oasis in an Alpine Valley. With this purpose, in the month of February, the available, observable species were monitored for two consecutive years, focused on repeatedly monitoring the same plots. Overall, the study recorded four species, two of which (Pezotettix giornae and Chorthippus brunneus brunneus) had never before been reported overwintering as adults in the Italian Alps before. Considering the potential effect of warmer winters that are forecast for the next few decades, the ability of some species to survive in winter as adults may increase in the study area, and may even become possible in others areas of occurrence where climatic conditions currently do not allow it.

AB  - Since SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly around the world, data have been needed on the natural fluctuation of viral load and clinical indicators associated with it. We measured and compared viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 from pharyngeal swab, IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2, CRP and SAA from serum of 114 COVID-19 patients on admission. Positive rates of IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2, CRP and SAA were 80.7%, 36% and 75.4% respectively. Among IgM-positive patients, viral loads showed different trends among cases with different severity, While viral loads of IgM-negative patients tended to increase along with the time after onset. As the worsening of severity, the positive rates of CRP and SAA also showed trends of increase. Different CRP/SAA type showed associations with viral loads in patients in different severity and different time after onset. Combination of the IgM and CRP/SAA with time after onset and severity may give suggestions on the viral load and condition judgment of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Water indicators and indices are useful tools to assess river basin performance, that is, to measure whether the basin operates satisfactorily under a wide range of possible future demands and hydrological conditions. Spanish regulations assess the performance of water demands by using reliability indicators (RIs), established by law in 2008. This article raises the possibility of updating RIs by comparing them with sustainability indicators (SIs). SIs are widely used for the assessment of river basin performance and several policy scenarios. We applied a water allocation model to the Guadiana River basin in Spain to compare indicators under three scenarios. The study was framed within the science of socio-hydrology, combining the physical environment of a water system with its influence on social aspects. SIs gave better results than RIs when comparing future scenarios. We also propose the introduction of a vulnerability indicator into Spanish regulations.

AB  - Botryococcus braunii is a colonial microalga that appears early in the fossil record and is a sensitive proxy of environmental and hydroclimatic conditions. Palaeozoic Botryococcus fossils which contribute up to 90% of oil shales and approximately 1% of crude oil, co-localise with diagnostic geolipids from the degradation of source-signature hydrocarbons. However more recent Holocene sediments demonstrate no such association. Consequently, Botryococcus are identified in younger sediments by morphology alone, where potential misclassifications could lead to inaccurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Here we show that a combination of flow cytometry and ancient DNA (aDNA) sequencing can unambiguously identify Botryococcus microfossils in Holocene sediments with hitherto unparalleled accuracy and rapidity. The application of aDNA sequencing to microfossils offers a far-reaching opportunity for understanding environmental change in the recent geological record. When allied with other high-resolution palaeoenvironmental information such as aDNA sequencing of humans and megafauna, aDNA from microfossils may allow a deeper and more precise understanding of past environments, ecologies and migrations.

AB  - Forest resilience to climate change is a global concern given the potential effects of increased disturbance activity, warming temperatures and increased moisture stress on plants. We used a multi-regional dataset of 1485 sites across 52 wildfires from the US Rocky Mountains to ask if and how changing climate over the last several decades impacted post-fire tree regeneration, a key indicator of forest resilience. Results highlight significant decreases in tree regeneration in the 21st century. Annual moisture deficits were significantly greater from 2000 to 2015 as compared to 1985-1999, suggesting increasingly unfavourable post-fire growing conditions, corresponding to significantly lower seedling densities and increased regeneration failure. Dry forests that already occur at the edge of their climatic tolerance are most prone to conversion to non-forests after wildfires. Major climate-induced reduction in forest density and extent has important consequences for a myriad of ecosystem services now and in the future.

AB  - Urban, traffic-related air pollution remains a concern to healthcare and environmental professionals, with mounting evidence connecting diverse disease conditions with exposure. Wildlife species such as European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) cohabit urban neighborhoods and may serve as sentinels for these contaminants. In this novel approach, we use passive, personal-type air samplers to provide site-specific measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes, or BTEX), and account for the effects of confounding environmental factors when teasing out the responses to exposure. This study examines biomarkers of exposure to predominately traffic-related, urban air contaminants in European starlings, including morphometric measurements, immunotoxicology, oxidative stress and hepatic detoxification, and analyses responses in the context of multi layered factors including year, hatch date, weather and location, confirming that this experimental approach and the selected health indicators can be used for contaminants. comparing locations with different levels of contaminants.

AB  - Economic and social changes that are taking place in society raise new requirements for farmers and their activities, and therefore farmers' cooperation into agricultural cooperatives is becoming an inevitable today's routine. It is noteworthy that activities of the farmer's economy must be effective and become a target not only for the farmer himself but also for the cooperative he belongs to. Consequently, under current, ever-changing conditions, the agricultural cooperative is becoming an instrument for helping the farmer to adapt to a changing environment and operate effectively. The aim of this paper is to select a system of indicators for assessing the efficiency of farmers' farms by analyzing the significance of cooperation. Research methodology: scientific articles of 1995-2015, examining the significance of cooperation for farmers' farms as well as methods, indicators and systems for the assessment of farms' efficiency, were analyzed. Based on the analysis carried out, the Balanced Scorecard, covering four criteria such as farm finance, internal business, customers and innovations, was selected to assess the efficiency of farmer's farm in the context of cooperation.

AB  - The honey bee has been regarded as a key species in the environmental risk assessment of biotech crops. Here, the potential adverse effects of Cry1Ie toxin on the midgut bacteria of the worker bees (Apis mellifera ligustica) were investigated under laboratory conditions. Newly emerged bees were fed with different concentrations of Cry1Ie toxin syrups (20 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, and 20 mu g/mL), pure sugar syrup, and 48 ppb of imidacloprid syrups, then sampled after 15 and 30 d. We characterized the dominant midgut bacteria and compared the composition and structure of the midgut bacterial community in all samples using the Illumina MiSeq platform targeting the V3-V4 regions of 16S rDNA. No significant differences in the diversity of the midgut bacteria were observed between the five treatments. This work was the first to show the effects of Cry1Ie toxin on honey bees, and our study provided a theoretical basis for the biosafety assessment of transgenic Cry1Ie maize.

AB  - The subject of study is the multicomponent condensation in the low-temperature plasma, which forms when shielded metal arc welding is applied. The modeling of heterogeneous ion-induced nucleation and nuclei growth in the strongly ionized environment with account of their coagulation is performed. The formation of the bimodal size distribution of the liquid particles after start of nucleation of the predominant component (iron) is demonstrated. This distribution consists of the nano-sized mode of nuclei and the larger-sized mode of the aggregated droplets. The condensation of the accompanying low-boiling components on these droplets causes the termination of nucleation earlier than conditions for the condensation growth of the equilibrium nuclei arise. Therefore, the growth of the nuclei occurs only by their coalescence. The deposition of the accompanying components on the iron nuclei leads to replacement of the iron by these components in the particles of the nuclei mode. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Group 14 elements (C, Si, and Ge) exist as various stable and metastable allotropes, some of which have been widely applied in industry. The discovery of new allotropes of these elements has long attracted considerable attention; however, the search is far from complete. Here we computationally discovered a tetragonal allotrope (12 atoms/cell, named T12) commonly found in C, Si, and Ge through a particle swarm structural search. The T12 structure employs sp(3) bonding and contains extended helical six-membered rings interconnected by pairs of five- and seven-membered rings. This arrangement results in favorable thermodynamic conditions compared with most other experimentally or theoretically known sp3 species of group 14 elements. The T12 polymorph naturally accounts for the experimental d spacings and Raman spectra of synthesized metastable Ge and Si-XIII phases with long-puzzling unknown structures, respectively. We rationalized an alternative experimental route for the synthesis of the T12 phase via decompression from the high-pressure Si- or Ge-II phase.

AB  - The species composition of phytoplankton and quantitative parameters of its abundance are indicators of ecological conditions in a water body. This paper deals with the analysis of phytoplankton in the Irkutsk Reservoir, which was formed more than 50 years ago on the Angara River flowing out of Lake Baikal. The level of phytoplankton development in the reservoir is directly dependent on the abundance of diatoms in Lake Baikal. The dominant assemblage of algal species is stable and consists mainly of diatoms, chlorophytes, and chrysophytes. Cyanobacteria are represented by a small number of species with low abundance. According to the composition of indicator species, the water in the lower reaches of the Irkutsk Reservoir can be classified as clean. The saprobity index in the open-water period is 1.2, increasing to between 1.3 and 1.5 in small bays. The values of phytoplankton biomass and chemical parameters of water recorded in 2008 indicate that the Irkutsk Reservoir is an oligotrophic water body. Its trophic status has not changed significantly since the time of impoundment (1956-1958).

AB  - Feathers are commonly used biomarkers of mercury (Hg) contamination in waterbird species. Most studies that analyze waterbird feathers for Hg content report concentrations on a per-unit mass basis. While this is appropriate for intraspecific comparisons, we suggest a more effective method for studies comparing multiple species of similar size and with similar foraging habits. Ptilochronology is a technique for determining the rate of feather growth in individuals based on their nutritional condition. When paired with Hg analysis, feather growth rates can be used to calculate the average daily Hg deposition into a feather. In this study we used this technique in comparison with the commonly used metric of Hg per-unit feather mass in two waterbird species.

AB  - This study aimed to elucidate trends in socioeconomic inequalities in health during the past half century in Japan. Association of life expectancy and age-adjusted mortality with per capita income was examined using data on prefectures and municipalities in Japan of 1955 to 2000 via the slope index of inequality (SII) and Poisson regression. Although there were a few differences among health indicators and sex, health inequalities by prefecture, measured by the SII, decreased from 1955 to 1995. However, health inequalities increased from 1995 to 2000 both for life expectancy and mortality. Similar trends were found in municipal analyses: the association between income and mortality, measured by the rate ratio from Poisson regression, decreased until 1995 but increased from 1995 to 2000. In the past half century, and especially until 1995, geographical health inequalities decreased in Japan, while from 1995 to 2000 health inequalities appeared to increase. Recent social conditions including the possible increase in social inequalities may have contributed to this increase. Careful monitoring and elimination of social and health inequalities should be encouraged.

AB  - Pathological conditions, especially neoplasms, in feral animals have been shown to be indicators of environmental degradation by pollutants. A gonadal neoplasm in soft shell clam (Mya arenaria) has been identified among certain populations of clams in Maine, but the etiology of these neoplasms is unknown. We have undertaken a study of these neoplasms to determine whether they may be a result of exposure to contaminants. One approach we have taken is to identify genes that are differentially expressed by neoplastic cells. Such genes may be part of the molecular pathway that is responsible for the neoplastic phenotype, and their identification could shed light on the etiology of the neoplasm. By using differential display polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), we found at least four genes that are involved in biosynthetic activities related to cell growth and proliferation. These findings demonstrate that ddPCR can be a useful tool to study neoplasms in feral animals, especially for species that have not been genetically well characterized.

AB  - The expanding interest towards biogas generation from biowaste via complex anaerobic digestion (AD) opened new avenues in the improvement of biogas production processes and their up-gradation. The adsorption/removal of impurities particularly hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the biogas stream will significantly improve the efficiency of biogas for its further use as a renewable energy fuel. The production and upgradation of biogas rely upon the types of feedstocks, AD condition, microbial diversity, purification methods along with the application of various additives. In that context, this review aims to emphasize the current state of the art in the field of biogas production via AD using diverse bio-waste. Further, this review will critically explore the biogas up-gradation technologies adopted so far and their pros and cons. Finally, techno-economic and environmental impact assessment of the biogas production process will be underlined to make the process costeffective and environmentally sustainable.

AB  - Postfire restoration of sagebrush steppe is limited by poor sagebrush establishment from seed. Transplanting may improve seedling establishment, but it requires more labor and expense. Given variable transplant survival in big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate Nutt.), establishing links between restoration practices and survival related to exposure to adverse weather, via plant response to stress, could significantly improve transplant efficacy. We tested how planting season and transplant age (size), two restoration practices likely to affect seedling survival across a range of environmental conditions, related to transplant survival and stomatal conductance, an indicator of seedling ecophysiological performance. We found low mean stomatal conductance during key periods in spring and early summer was associated with subsequent growing season mortality across all size-classes. Overall, these findings suggest managers should consider the importance of plant performance during key stressful periods in evaluating transplant survival related to restoration methods.

AB  - The article substantiates approaches to making decisions of obligations management in the conditions of increasing the assets by types of economic activity in Ukraine. The possibility of using correlation - regression analysis to determine the most favorable variations (in relation of density) between the effective indicator (types of assets) and production factors (types of liabilities) has been proved. A method of analyzing the operating environment is applied to identify the shortest possible reduction in current and long-term liabilities and maximize the volume of current assets. It was found that (i) the most efficient type of economic activity due to the increase in current assets in Ukraine was administrative and support service activities (0.90), the least efficient - agriculture, forestry and fisheries (0.47); (ii) education and training activities (0.93) are the most effective types of economic activity due to reduce liabilities, and health and social assistance (0.44) are the least effective. The results of the study can be used in planning the sustainable development of different types of economic activity.

AB  - The construction sector must advance in a more sustainable way and to achieve this goal, the application of global methodologies is needed. These methodologies should take into account all life stages of a building: planning, design, construction, use and demolition. The quantity and variety of the materials used in building construction condition the buildings' environmental and energy impacts. Life Cycle Assessment offers a standardized framework to evaluate the environmental loads of a product, process or activity. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to select facilities in the construction sector, which minimize environmental and energy impacts. To facilitate the understanding of the proposed methodology, a comparative LCA is performed, to determine the type of thermal insulating material in a double sheet ceramic facade and its thickness, which allows reducing the environmental impacts associated to the enclosure. The three most used enclosure types used in the city of Malaga (Spain) have been selected for this study. The results show the adequacy of the procedure used. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The problem of blind sparse analysis of electrogram (EGM) signals under atrial fibrillation (AF) conditions is considered in this paper. A mathematical model for the observed signals that takes into account the multiple foci typically appearing inside the heart during AF is firstly introduced. Then, a reconstruction model based on a fixed dictionary is developed and several alternatives for choosing the dictionary are discussed. In order to obtain a sparse solution, which takes into account the biological restrictions of the problem at the same time, the paper proposes using a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularization followed by a post-processing stage that removes low amplitude coefficients violating the refractory period characteristic of cardiac cells. Finally, spectral analysis is performed on the clean activation sequence obtained from the sparse learning stage in order to estimate the number of latent foci and their frequencies. Simulations on synthetic signals and applications on real data are provided to validate the proposed approach.

AB  - Applying the principles of functional ecology helps better predict the services which can be provided by permanent grassland. Farming practices and environmental characteristics influence the functional composition of grassland. Functional plant types have a generic effect on forage services which can be assessed. 13 types of grassland composed of distinct functional types were defined based on 1,283 sample grassland fields located on 8 sites. This approach was validated by checking 8 Ellenberg indicator values (used to evaluate environmental characteristics and farming practices) against climatic data and descriptive data for farming practices. The interest of a functional approach is discussed as a means of understanding the structure of plant communities, estimating the effect of changes in climatic conditions and farming practices, and predicting input services and services not included in farm income.

AB  - While both traditional criminological inquiry and mental health research have identified internal and external constellations of risk factors associated with juvenile offending, interdisciplinary discourse has been limited. This paper takes a step in bridging the gap between criminological literature and work in the field of children's mental health by evaluating the combined effects of social and mental health predictors on juvenile delinquency in a sample of youth with diagnosed clinical disorders. Results of multivariate analyses indicate that both traditional social risk factors as well as indicators of the nature and severity of youths' mental health disorders contribute to delinquency. Moreover, the influence of one well-established risk factor, self-control, on delinquency is moderated by the presence of oppositional defiant disorder. The results of this study suggest that researchers and practitioners should consider the cumulative influence of social risk factors and psychological impairment in the etiology of delinquency.

AB  - Results of a cross-cultural study of adult crying across 37 countries are presented. Analyses focused on country differences in recency of last crying episode and crying proneness and relationships with country characteristics. Three hypotheses on the nature of country differences in crying were evaluated: (a) distress due to exposure to taxing conditions, (b) norms regarding emotional expressiveness, and (c) personality (at country level). Individuals living in more affluent, democratic, extraverted, and individualistic countries tend to report to cry more often. These indicators relate to freedom of expression rather than to suffering; therefore, our data provide support for a model that views country differences in crying as being connected with country differences in expressiveness and personality rather than in distress. Gender differences in crying proneness were larger in wealthier, more democratic, and feminine countries. Differences in the meaning of crying at individual level (usually viewed as a sign of distress) and country level (as a sign of expressiveness and personality) are discussed.

AB  - Natural wild-type strains of Bacillus subtilis are extensively used in agriculture as biocontrol agents for plants. This study examined two antagonist B. subtilis strains, KB-1111 and KB-1122, and the results illustrated that KB-1122 was a more potent inhibitor of the indicator pathogen than KB-1111. Thus, to investigate the intrinsic differences between the two antagonist strains under normal culture conditions, samples of KB-1111 and KB-1122 were analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS. The main differences were related to 20 abundant intracellular and 17 extracellular proteins. When searching the NCBI database, a number of the differentially expressed proteins were identified, including 11 cellular proteins and 10 secretory proteins. Among these proteins, class III stress-response-related ATPase, aconitate hydratase, alpha-amylase precursor, and a secretory protein, endo-1, 4-beta-glucanase, were differentially expressed by the two strains. These results are useful to comprehend the intrinsic differences between the antagonism of KB-1111 and KB-1122.

AB  - Annual growth rings of roots in perennial forbs have been used in studies of climate change and the ecology of grasslands. However, little has been done in this aspect of research in China. In this study, we report the characteristics of growth rings in the main roots of 13 herb species sampled in Duolun of the Inner Mongolia grassland in northern China. The results show that around two thirds of the species possess clearly demarcated annual rings in the root xylem. Some species of the same genera show different patterns in anatomical structure of the root xylem. Standardized annual ring widths of three species, Potentilla anserine L., Cymbaria dahurica L. and Lespedeza daurica (Laxm.) Schindl., show a common linear trend, indicating a continued favorable growth condition in the sampling sites. Our results provide evidence that growth rings in roots of some perennial forbs in the Inner Mongolia grassland can serve as a new and useful indicator of past changes in the grassland environment.

AB  - The Cartesian separation of body and mind has underpinned medical conceptualizations of conversion symptoms over the last four centuries. Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century models explained conversion symptoms on the basis of assumed organic lesions. Subsequent psychological formulations focused on mental phenomena, which were disembodied from underlying neurobiological processes. Contemporary theories challenge this disconnection. They place conversion symptoms within an evolutionary framework, arguing that mind is embodied in physical processes and confers significant survival advantage. Current neurobiological models explain conversion symptoms as part of the human emotional response to threat, reflecting either errors in how information about body state is processed and represented, or the motor component of an automatic emotional response. Patients with conversion disorder experience their body functions in a range of distressing and disturbing ways. In order to understand these phenomena, clinicians require conceptual models that expand the conventional dualistic mind-body paradigm, integrate multiple theoretical perspectives, and take into account environmental factors that shape evolutionary and individual development.

AB  - Ozone concentrations are valuable indicators of possible health and environmental impacts. However, they are also used to monitor changes and trends in the sources of both ozone and its precursors. For this purpose, the influence of meteorological variables is a confusing factor. This study presents an analysis of a year of ozone concentrations measured in a coastal Spanish city. Firstly, the aim of this study was to perceive the daily, monthly and seasonal variation patterns of ozone concentrations. Diurnal cycles are presented by season and the fit of the data to a normal distribution is tested. In order to assess ozone behaviour under temperate weather conditions, local meteorological variables (wind direction and speed, temperature, relative humidity, pressure and rainfall) were monitored together with ozone concentrations. The main relationships we could observe in these analyses were then used to obtain a regression equation linking diurnal ozone concentrations in summer with meteorological parameters.

AB  - Despite their economic importance, there are no recent studies of the distribution of flatfish in the Irish Sea, and the knowledge of this is important for an effective management of the resource. In the present study, data on flatfishes were collected during demersal fish surveys carried out by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland (DARD) in the North Irish Sea between March 1995 and October 1998. Distribution and abundance patterns were ascertained using the total number caught per species. Differences in the condition factor and hepatosomatic index were associated with season and sediment type, and were used as indicators of habitat quality. Higher index values indicated higher habitat quality, and it was expected that these areas would also be associated with elevated abundances. Once the habitat requirements for each species are known, predictions on the abundance and distribution of flatfishes can be given for changes in habitats caused by natural or anthropogenic events.

AB  - The aim of this research was to compare the environmental impacts of applying thermal vitrification, recycling in clinker furnace, or final disposal of asbestos in a hazardous waste landfill in a case study in Argentina. The methodology of life cycle assessment (LCA) was used to compare scenarios through a series of midpoint and endpoint indicators. Recycling asbestos in a clinker furnace was found to be the most beneficial alternative. Transport stage contributed the most to the negative impacts of the actual management system, while vitrification was the most important one in the corresponding alternate scenario. Two sensitivity analyses were performed to compare fuel consumption variables and different scopes for the system. It was observed that changing the scope of the analysis led to major modifications in the results, reversing the trend of considering recycling as the best option. However, the initial scope was considered adequate. On-site thermal treatment was environmentally comparable to the current transport stage and might be a game changer if risk of asbestos release is considered under current conditions of landfilling.

AB  - Images obtained in hazy environments present the phenomenon of low contrast, low saturation, and hue offset. Therefore, the main requirements for a dehazing system are accurate color restoration effects and high visual range. In this paper, an improved atmospheric scattering model based on elliptic curve is proposed to remove haze from a single image. Traditional atmospheric scattering model is improved in the following two aspects. Because of uneven illumination in hazy environment, scene incident light is improved by localized operation to replace the global atmospheric light. Considering multiple scattering effects of reflected light, the scene albedo is refined into two parts, the direct transmission item and the indirect transmission item. An elliptic curve model is established to adaptively estimate weights of the two terms. Thus, the reflected light under different conditions of depth and fog density is finely described. Experimental results show that our method achieves good visual performance. Compared with current methods, the indicator of image visibility and visual contrast increased by 40% and 86.6% on average.

AB  - Companies operating in the energy sector are under pressure to boost the level of green energy production. The use of renewable energy sources will have a positive impact on the environment, but the basic question is whether power plants that produce electricity using renewable energy sources are in better financial condition than those that use only traditional energy sources. We address the latter using a new hybrid approach that extends prior research by combining three analyses: ratio analysis with a large set of indicators, the Altman model and cluster analysis. To test the statistical significance of differences between groups, Student's t-test is applied. The sample concerns companies from the Baltic States and Central Europe in the years 2008-2017. The results indicate that in most cases there is no statistical difference in the financial standing of companies that use renewable energy sources and those that generate only fossil fuel-based energy.

AB  - We report current distributions of 16 species of Keratella Bory de St. Vincent, 1822 within lakes and reservoirs of the U.S. Specimens were identified from 988 lakes and reservoirs during spring and summer 2012 as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment (NLA). We performed a co-occurrence analysis to determine correlations between species-pair occurrences and a niche-centroid analysis to predict optimal water quality conditions for each species. While a high degree of overlap in geographic range was observed among the species, distribution maps showed that K. quadrata was largely confined to more northern latitudes and K. americana was confined primarily to the eastern U.S. Other common species were either ubiquitously or sparsely distributed across ecoregions, suggesting that their distribution may be more related to inter-species competition or local water quality parameters. This study expands the limited pool of knowledge on rotifer biogeography within the U.S.

AB  - Radiological atmospheric releases require population dose calculation for proper determination of preventive measures. The old concept of relative concentrations requires long lasting constant emission which is not realistic.
   The proposed concept of the "relative doses" is the generalization and expansion of the known concept of relative concentrations. Relative doses allow an evaluation of the general non-stationary pollutants emission under the real weather conditions over complex terrain. Relative doses can be calculated even before the actual source term - quantified emission - is known.
   The relative impact is also very useful for considering the possible impact of an accident scenario on the surroundings for various meteorological situations. This is applied for environmental impact assessments which require long term statistical evaluation. The method has a practical possible application for realistic dose assessment of effectiveness of additional protection achieved by installation of Passive Containment Filtered Venting Systems (PCFVS). PCFVS is considered an obligatory safety upgrade after the Fukushima accident.

AB  - Akimotoite (Mg,Fe)SiO3 is one of the most common mineralogical indicators for high-level shock metamorphism in meteorites. First described 1997, its occurrence has been amply confirmed in a number of highly shocked chondrites. Yet, a thorough structure analysis of natural akimotoite has remained extant. Here we report accurate cell parameters, fractional atomic coordinates, and site occupancies for natural akimotoite from the holotype specimen based on synchrotron microdiffraction. The variation of unit cell shape and volume with Fe content define mixing volumes. Based on the mixing volume relation for akimotoite and hemleyite, we constrain the unit cell volume of endmember hemleyite to 273.8 +/- 1.0 angstrom(3). We show that mixing is nearly ideal for low Fe content but evolves to positive excess volume toward the Fe endmember. Based on this finding and the actual composition of akimotoite in Tenham, we show that this mineral has formed by solid-solid transformation prograde from enstatite, not by crystallization from melt.

AB  - The variation of the composition of macroalgae assemblages at different taxonomic aggregation was assessed at two different wave exposure conditions on the coast of Mar del Plata, Argentina, at the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. The macroalgae assemblages attached in two sites were compared: an inside Harbor, a sheltered site from the waves, and a wave-exposed site in Playa Grande, a nearby open-beach. The species composition was significantly different between sites. Ulva lactuca, Ulva spp., Corallina officinalis and Gigartinaceae sp.1 were the most conspicuous species in the wave-sheltered site, while Hildenbrandia sp., Ulva lactuca, Ahnfeltiopsis sp. and Ceramium uruguayense were the most abundant species in the wave-exposed site. This spatial pattern was similar throughout the year. The sites were different regarding to species, genera, order and phyla levels. The different assemblage composition founded could be a result of the variation of both waves exposure and water pollution level in the two sites.

AB  - Protura, an almost neglected taxon in ecological studies of soil microarthropods, were examined at highly vulnerable sites of fluvial forest stands of the Transcarpathian Lowland. To compare the effects of different hydrologic disturbance regimes on Protura assemblages, we examined part of a river floodplain subjected to periodical inundation, and a non-inundated part with limited fluvial activity, behind the river embankment. Ten sites were selected for sampling, with four sites dominated by oak and one dominated by poplar in each part. The type of hydrologic disturbance regime in the river floodplain shaped Protura assemblages and influenced their variability. Highest abundance and species richness were correlated with the non-inundated part of the floodplain under oak stands, although Protura also tolerated soil conditions of exposure to regular inundation. We present and discuss several hypotheses concerning the causes of distribution patterns of Protura in the river floodplain with different hydrologic disturbance regimes, including sensitivity to mycorrhizal associations and the role of Protura assemblages as a potential ecological bioindicator of pedogenic transformations in riverine wetlands.

AB  - The digestibility of a starch-polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) biopolymer insulated cardboard coolbox was investigated under a defined anaerobic digestion (AD) system with key parameters characterized. Laboratory results were combined with industrial operational data to develop a site-specific life cycle assessment (LCA) model. Inoculated with active bacterial trophic groups, the anaerobic biodegradability of three starch-PVOH biopolymers achieved 58-62%. The LCA modeling showed that the environmental burdens of the starch-PVOH biopolymer packaging under AD conditions on acidification, eutrophication, global warming and photochemical oxidation potential were dominated by atmospheric emissions released from substrate degradation and fuel combustion, whereas energy consumption and infrastructure requirements were the causes of abiotic depletion, ozone depletion and toxic impacts. Nevertheless, for this bio-packaging, AD of the starch-PVOH biopolymer combined with recycling of the cardboard emerged as the environmentally superior option and optimization of the energy utilization system could bring further environmental benefits to the AD process.

AB  - Nanotechnology is the latest in a series of general purpose technologies (GPT), earlier examples of which, have transformed household life, industry structure and firm performance. This paper traces the development to date of one of the first uses of nanotechnology to synthesise a new drug. Using an innovation systems framework, the paper compares the commercialisation process of this drug with that typically employed by a biotechnology company, to explore differences arising from the novel nature of the underlying technology.
   The study finds that the commercialisation process, followed by the company developing the drug, conforms substantially to the empirical literature on biotechnology commercialisation. However it departs in two important ways. One is the absence of venture capital involvement and the second is the failure to date to form an alliance with a major pharmaceutical company. The evidence suggests that while both reflect factors that relate to conditions in the Australian market, the novel nature of the technology may he an issue in the latter.

AB  - Arsenic is a priority pollutant found in soil and groundwater contaminated by arsenic pesticides and industrial wastes. Assessing the natural attenuation capacity of the subsurface for arsenic is a key step leading to successful site remediation. Chemical reactions between arsenic and several iron hydroxides (goethite, lepidocrocite and green rust) were studied. By comparing the arsenic attenuation capacity of iron hydroxides, clay minerals and feldspars, an order was established: iron hydroxides>clays>feldspars. Results showed that arsenic was more strongly bound by iron hydroxides than clays, and that the iron minerals studied can extensively oxidize As(III) to As(V). Under reducing conditions, the concentration of As(III) significantly decreases due to the presence of green rust and parasymplesite. The studies provide evidence that some minerals could act as mineral indicators for site characterization. Integration of mineral indicators with geochemical parameters should aid in determining the potential of natural attenuation of the subsurface with arsenic contamination.

AB  - Two environmental assessments considered the potential cumulative environmental impacts resulting from the development of eight proposed hydropower projects in the Nooksack River Basin and 11 proposed projects in the Skagit River Basin, North Cascades, Washington, respectively. While not identified as a target resource, slope stability and the alteration of sediment supply to creeks and river mainstems significantly affect other resources. The slope stability assessment emphasized the potential for cumulative impacts under disturbed conditions (e.g., road construction and timber harvesting) and a landslide-induced pipeline rupture scenario. In the case of small-scale slides, the sluicing action of ruptured pipeline water on the fresh landslide scarp was found to be capable of eroding significantly more material than the original landslide. For large-scale landslides, sluiced material was found to be a small increment of the original landslide. These results predicted that hypothetical accidental pipeline rupture by small-scale landslides may result in potential cumulative impacts for 12 of the 19 projects with pending license applications in both river basins.

AB  - The spectral complex conductivity of a water-bearing sand during interaction with carbon dioxide (CO2) is influenced by multiple, simultaneous processes. These processes include partial saturation due to the replacement of conductive pore water with CO2 and chemical interaction of the reactive CO2 with the bulk fluid and the grain-water interface. We present a laboratory study on the spectral induced polarization of water-bearing sands during exposure to and flow-through by CO2. Conductivity spectra were measured successfully at pressures up to 30 MPa and 80 degrees C during active flow and at steady-state conditions concentrating on the frequency range between 0.0014 and 100 Hz. The frequency range between 0.1 and 100 Hz turned out to be most indicative for potential monitoring applications. The presented data show that the impact of CO2 on the electrolytic conductivity may be covered by a model for pore-water conductivity, which depends on salinity, pressure and temperature and has been derived from earlier investigations of the pore-water phase. The new data covering the three-phase system CO2-brine-sand further show that chemical interaction causes a reduction of surface conductivity by almost 20 per cent, which could be related to the low pH-value in the acidic environment due to CO2 dissolution and the dissociation of carbonic acid. The quantification of the total CO2 effect may be used as a correction during monitoring of a sequestration in terms of saturation. We show that this leads to a correct reconstruction of fluid saturation from electrical measurements. In addition, an indicator for changes of the inner surface area, which is related to mineral dissolution or precipitation processes, can be computed from the imaginary part of conductivity. The low frequency range between 0.0014 and 0.1 Hz shows additional characteristics, which deviate from the behaviour at higher frequencies. A Debye decomposition approach is applied to isolate the feature dominating the data at low frequencies. We conclude from our study that electrical conductivity is not only a highly sensitive indicator for CO2 saturation in pore space. When it is measured in its full spectral and complex form it contains additional information on the chemical state of the system, which holds the potential of getting access to both saturation and interface properties with one monitoring method.

AB  - The capillary transport mechanism has an important role on natural building stones that could be affected by moisture due to atmospheric conditions. Travertine with its natural porous structure is more sensitive to water which has a significant impact on durability. One of the important indicators of stone-water interaction is color variations, while natural stones with high capillary water absorption potential are in contact with water due to atmospheric conditions. As far as water absorption is concerned, water absorption by weight (WAW), water absorption by volume (n, apparent porosity), and capillary water absorption (CWA) parameters are in close relation with each other. To develop the relationships between capillary water absorption and the other water absorption parameters, regression and artificial neural network (ANN) analyses were performed. Within the scope of this study, the ANN models with three different input structures were established using various input variables in order to determine the relationship between CWA and the other parameters. The results of the different ANN structures of these models have been calculated and evaluated. For this purpose, travertine samples quarried from Denizli region in Turkey were studied. In order to evaluate the model results of regression and ANN methods, statistical performance evaluation parameters, i.e., the coefficient of correlation (CORR), efficiency (E), and root mean square error (RMSE), were calculated. In both regression and ANN models, reasonable coefficients of correlation were calculated. The capillary water absorption test is time consuming. The necessary periodical measurements make the process even more impractical. It is known that capillary water absorption is directly correlated with similar water absorption parameters such as water absorption by weight and apparent porosity. In this study, the estimation of capillary water absorption by means of other water absorption parameters is proposed. Moreover, there is no proposed classification in literature for natural stones based on their capillary water absorption. In the final stage of this study, by using the relationships between porosity and capillary water absorption, a capillary water absorption classification was proposed for travertine. Proposed classification consists of five categories and capillary water absorption coefficient which is ranging between very high (> 68 g/m(2) s(0.5)) and very low (< 1 g/m(2) s(0.5)). It is thought that this study could provide significant advantages in engineering practice and also make contribution to the related literature.

AB  - The working conditions of donkeys and mules in the Egyptian brick kilns are often very challenging. Common problems for these equids include the following: overloading, overworking, heat stress, harness lesions, poor body condition scores (BCSs), and poor treatment by handlers. However, mechanization of the Egyptian brick kilns is not yet realistic without entirely renovating all kilns for additional space requirements, which would be cost-prohibitive at this time. In the brick kilns in the Helwan area (approximately 185 kilns, supplying all bricks for the cities of Cairo and Giza), more than 2,000 donkeys and 400 mules move similar to 200 million bricks per month, year round. From July 2012 to December 2013, the first author assessed 1,140 donkeys and 250 mules to answer the question of whether donkeys or mules are better suited for brick kiln work. Health parameters were assessed (e.g., pulse and respiratory rate, rectal temperature, mucous membranes, skin tent test, and capillary refill time); body lesions and BCSs were assessed on a 5-point scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (obese). Several behavior parameters (e.g., animal demeanor and human-animal interaction) were also assessed. The data were analyzed using SPSS 17.1. There were (mean +/- standard error) 32.6% +/- 0.99% of kiln mules and 53.5% +/- 0.98% of kiln donkeys scoring a BCS <= 2 (P < 0.001). Heat stress and fever indicators were separated from each other for each measure and then respective scores were aggregated. Again, mules showed more favorable scores with the average aggregate heat stress score of mules being 26.8 +/- 0.15 and of donkeys being 48.3 +/- 0.25 (P < 0.001). Mules also showed fewer overwork-type body lesions (19.1 +/- 0.45) than donkeys (32.9 +/- 0.74; P < 0.001). When all health parameters were considered, it was apparent that mules are faring better than donkeys in the brick kiln environment. Should the kiln owners decide to replace donkeys with mules, one problem will need to be addressed: Mules more frequently showed aggressive behaviors and avoidance behaviors to unfamiliar handlers (19.2% +/- 0.17% aggressive mules versus 3.0% +/- 0.02% aggressive donkeys; P < 0.001). Educational programs to assist with proper training and handling of mules should be implemented and then assessed for outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The large-scale vegetation fires instigated by the local farmers during the dry period of the major El Nino event in 1997 can be considered as one of the worst environmental disasters that have occurred in southeast Asia in recent history. This study investigated the local meteorology characteristics of an equatorial environment within a domain that includes the northwestern part of Borneo from the 17 to 27 September 1997 during the height of the haze episode by utilizing a limited area three-dimensional meteorological and dispersion model., The Air Pollution Model (TAPM).
   Daily land and sea breeze conditions near the northwestern coast of Borneo in the state of Sarawak, Malaysia were predicted with moderate success by the index of agreement of less than one between the observed and simulated values for wind speed and a slight overprediction of 2.3 of the skill indicator that evaluates the standard deviation to the observed values. The innermost domain of study comprises an area of 24,193 km(2), from approximately 109 degrees E to 111 degrees E, and from 1 degrees N to 2.3 degrees N, which includes a part of the South China Sea. Tracer analysis of air particles that were sourced in the state of Sarawak on the island of Borneo verified the existence of the landward and shoreward movements of the air during the simulation of the low level wind field. Polluted air particles were transported seawards during night-time, and landwards during daytime, highlighting the recirculation features of aged and newer air particles during the length of eleven days throughout the model simulation. Near calm conditions at low levels were simulated by the trajectory analysis from midnight to mid-day on the 22 of September 1997. Low-level turbulence within the planetary boundary layer in terms of the total kinetic energy was weak, congruent with the weak strength of low level winds that reduced the ability of the air to transport the pollutants.
   Statistical evaluation showed that parameters such as the systematic RMSE and unsystematic RMSE between the observed and simulated values indicated the modest skill of the model in simulating the low level winds. Otherwise, the equatorial meteorological parameters such as wind speed and temperature were successfully simulated by the model with comparatively high correlation coefficients, lower RMSEs and moderately high indices of agreement with observed values.

AB  - Since the Xiagou Formation was confirmed to be the primary source rock of the crude oil discovered in the Yumen oilfield, geologists have performed many studies on the sedimentology of the formation, source rock evaluation and migration, as well as petroleum accumulation. In this study, the carbonate-bearing mudstones were investigated using synthetic organic and inorganic geochemical analyses to reconstruct the paleo-environment and study the origin of organic matter during deposition in correlation with organic matter enrichment. The analysed samples have total organic carbon (TOC) and S-1 + S-2 values in the range of 0.20-3.39 wt% and 0.07-19.50%, respectively, which indicate fair to good hydrocarbon potential. Biomarker studies on the pyrolysis data of the samples suggest that the predominant origin of the organic matter is terrigenous high plants with partial aquatic algae and micro-organisms, primarily oil- and gas-prone. The trace elements P and Ba are considered to be the main proxies for paleoproductivity, and values for the two elements hosted in samples range from 48 to 1724ppm (a mean of 658 ppm) and from 322 to 1701ppm (a mean of 550.34 ppm), respectively, which indicates that the sediments in the Xiagou Formation have high paleoproductivity. Additionally, organic geochemical studies reveal that the sediments were deposited in a lacustrine environment with brackish water (low C-31-22R-homohopane/C-30-hopane ratios; moderate gammacerane and -carotane), which is consistent with the medium degree of the Sr/Ba ratio, which ranges from 0.22 to 1.42 (a mean of 0.64). Furthermore, the wide range of Cu/Zn and Rb contents are important indicators of a suboxic to relatively anoxic paleoredox condition. This outcome is consistent with the biomarker parameter Pr/Ph, which ranges from 0.05 to 1.37. Moreover, the major oxides and trace elements [high Fe/Mn, low Mg/Ca, low CIA and the plot of SiO(2)vs (Al2O3 + K2O + Na2O)] also indicate that the sedimentary paleoclimate was semiarid to arid. Lack of correlation between TOC content and paleo-environment (suboxic, brackish and semiarid) or productivity indicators indicates that the accumulation of organic matter was controlled by combined action, rather than a single factor, such as redox condition or productivity.

AB  - In arid environments dominated by desert dunes, aeolian sediments represent a major source of potential palaeoenvironmental information. However, the extent to which dune sedimentology can be used for past environmental reconstruction is unclear. This paper assesses the value of dune sediments as palaeoenvironmental indicators by investigating the sedimentological characteristics of linear dunes in the Strzelecki and Tirari Deserts of central Australia. We use thin section microscopy, particle size analysis and X-ray Diffractometry (XRD) mineralogy to characterise the sediments occurring within the dunefields of the region, and examine the stratigraphic record in the context of dune preservation and sediment reworking. We find that it is rarely possible to reconstruct past environmental change within desert dunefields purely on the basis of sedimentological evidence. However, limited palaeoenvironmental information is preserved within dune sediments which can be combined with additional arid zone proxies and geochronological techniques to enable the most reliable reconstruction of past conditions.
   Paleosols provide the most informative and unambiguous palaeoenvironmental indicators within dune sediments, acting as markers of relative environmental stability. Paleosols are characterised by pedogenic carbonates and gypsum, and illuviated clays in the form of intact grain coatings. The potential for incomplete stratigraphic preservation within dunes is a critical consideration for reconstructing palaeoenvironments, however the preservation of paleosols indicates that the dunes in this region have not been completely reworked. Grain coatings provide important evidence both for pedogenesis when they are intact, and for aeolian reworking when they are partially abraded. Abraded cutans are ubiquitous across the region studied. Linear dune mineralogy of the Sttzelecki and Tirari Deserts is dominated by quartz, with minor feldspar and clay minerals, the latter in the form of grain coatings and aggregates. The occurrence of intact sand-sized aggregates composed of clay and silt particles at several sites indicates incipient rather than peak aridity, and may, within this geomorphic context, indicate reduced stream discharges. Grain size shows a regional bias, although silt-sized material is most likely to have been deposited as long-travelled dust. The regional grain size characteristics, combined with local occurrences of rock fragments and high feldspar content, suggest that sediments are mostly derived from local sources.

AB  - Sugar content and bacterial contamination levels are important indicators for the health and safety of food, respectively. Therefore, it is important to construct a method that can detect both glucose and bacterial activity. Herein, natural compounds (gallic acid and glucose oxidase) were assembled into nanozyme (GOx@GA-Fe (ii)) for mild cascade detection. The nanozyme catalyzes glucose to produce hydrogen peroxide, which is then converted to & BULL;OH and oxidized colorless TMB from blue oxidized TMB. Under the optimal conditions, the method has a good linear relationship in the glucose concentration range of 1-500 mu M (R-2 = 0.993) with minimum detection concentration of 0.43 mu M. Based on the glucose consumption of bacteria metabolism, the cascade reaction was then applied to detect the viability of 5 common bacteria. As such, a cascade method based on a natural self-assembled nanozyme was fabricated to monitor the quality of food.

AB  - Existing cross-national studies have identified that country-level economic and environmental factors can affect environmental concern at the individual-level. However, we know little in regard to how these contextual factors and their interaction with individual-level factors shape environmental concern within countries. Using China as an example, we examine three hypotheses: the affluence hypothesis, the degradation hypothesis, and the need contingency hypothesis. We measure environmental concern in three dimensions using twelve indicators. The latent mean comparison and multilevel structural equation modeling results show that provincial economic development and environmental degradation as well as their interactions with individual social-economic status have significant impacts on one's environmental concern. Such impacts vary by the dimension of environmental concern. People from provinces with better economic conditions generally have higher environmental concern, especially for the perceived dangerousness of pollution and environmental behavior dimensions. The degradation hypothesis receives mixed support that depends on the measure of environmental degradation. Theoretical and methodological contributions as well as policy implications are discussed.

AB  - According to the monthly comprehensive air index ranking in China in 2016, Beijing ranked in the bottom tenth three times, indicating that the air pollution situation is very serious compared to other cities in China. In this study, we chose 23 urban environmental assessment points, which covered all districts and counties in Beijing. We used ArcGIS software to analyze atmospheric concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) for each month of 2016 in each district/county of Beijing. Our results showed that PM2.5 concentrations in winter and spring were generally higher than those in summer and autumn. The higher monthly average PM2.5 concentrations were primarily in the southwest and southeast areas. The higher annual average values were distributed in Fangshan, Daxing, and Tongzhou, which were closely related to the high terrain in the northwest and the low-lying terrain in the southeast, the "Beijing Bay" terrain, and local climatic conditions. The temporal and spatial distributions of PM2.5 constitute a warning signal for human life and production during different seasons and regions.

AB  - Growth phenotypes of microorganisms are a strong indicator of their underlying genetic fitness and can be segregated into 3 growth regimes: lag-phase, log-phase, and stationary-phase. Each growth phase can reveal different aspects of fitness that are related to various environmental and genetic conditions. High-resolution and quantitative measurements of all 3 phases of growth are generally difficult to obtain. Here we present a detailed method to characterize all 3 growth phases on solid media using an assay called One-cell Doubling Evaluation of Living Arrays of Yeast (ODELAY). ODELAY quantifies growth phenotypes of individual cells growing into colonies on solid media using time-lapse microscopy. This method can directly observe population heterogeneity with each growth parameter in genetically identical cells growing into colonies. This population heterogeneity offers a unique perspective for understanding genetic and epigenetic regulation, and responses to genetic and environmental perturbations. While the ODELAY method is demonstrated using yeast, it can be utilized on any colony forming microorganism that is visible by bright field microscopy.

AB  - Recent work suggests that episodes of drought and heat can bring forests across climate zones to a threshold for massive tree mortality(1). As complex systems approach a threshold for collapse they tend to exhibit a loss of resilience, as reflected in declining recovery rates from perturbations(2). Trees may be no exception, as at the verge of drought-induced death, trees are found to be weakened in multiple ways, affecting their ability to recover from stress(3,4). Here we use worldwide time series of satellite images to show that temporal autocorrelation, an indicator of slow recovery rates(5), rises steeply as mean annual precipitation declines to levels known to be critical for tropical forests. This implies independent support for the idea that such forests may have a tipping point for collapse at drying conditions. Moreover, the demonstration that reduced rates of recovery (slowing down) may be detected from satellite data suggests a novel way to monitor resilience of tropical forests, as well as other ecosystems known to be vulnerable to collapse.

AB  - The Antarctic ice cap significantly affects global ocean circulation and climate. Continental glaciogenic sedimentary deposits provide direct physical evidence of the glacial history of the Antarctic interior, but these data are sparse. Here we investigate a new indicator of ice sheet evolution: sulfates within the glaciogenic deposits from the Lewis Cliff Ice Tongue of the central Transantarctic Mountains. The sulfates exhibit unique isotope signatures, including delta S-34 up to + 50% for mirabilite evaporites, Delta O-17 up to + 2.3% for dissolved sulfate within contemporary melt-water ponds, and extremely negative delta O-18 as low as -22.2%. The isotopic data imply that the sulfates formed under environmental conditions similar to today's McMurdo Dry Valleys, suggesting that ice-free cold deserts may have existed between the South Pole and the Transantarctic Mountains since the Miocene during periods when the ice sheet size was smaller than today, but with an overall similar to modern global hydrological cycle.

AB  - In the characterization of biosorbent (natural sugar cane bagasse, NB) were determined different physicochemical parameters: moisture, bulk density, particle density, porosity, buoyancy, sorption capacity and scanning electron microscopy. The obtained results allowed define the fraction of interest (+1 -2 mm) given by the sieving yield (41%), the homogeneity of said fraction and its sorption capacity (2g diesel/g BN). The results obtained in the sorption equilibrium studies were adjusted using the Langmuir and Freundlich sorption isotherms models.
   The breakthrough curve was obtained using a continuous flow system (1 L / h) of oleaginous water, through a fixed bed of 59,997 g of BN. Studies showed that the BN has potential as hydrocarbon biosorbent studied the grain size (+1 -2 mm). For statistical analysis, we used the software Statgraphics centurion XV.II. The breaking point or bankruptcy was observed at 12 hours of operation, under the experimental conditions at laboratory scale. We conclude that the tested biosorbent is effective in removing in removing pollution indicators: fats, oils (98,5%) and total hydrocarbons (94,8%).

AB  - A coastal community vulnerability index (CCVI) was constructed to evaluate the vulnerability of coastal communities (Buhangin, Pingit, Reserva, Sabang, and Zabali) in the municipality of Baler, Aurora, Philippines. This index was composed of weighted averages of seven vulnerability factors namely geographical, economic and livelihood, food security, environmental, policy and institutional, demographic, and capital good. Factor values were computed based on scores that described range of conditions that influence communities' susceptibility to hazard effects. Among the factors evaluated, economic and livelihood, policy and institutional and food security contributed to CCVI across communities. Only small variations on CCVI values (i.e., 0.47-0.53) were observed as factor values cancelled out one another during combination process. Overall, Sabang received the highest CCVI, which was contributed mainly by geographical and demographic factors. This technique to determine factors that influenced communities' vulnerability can provide information for local governments in enhancing policies on risk mitigation and adaptation.

AB  - Tipping points, at which complex systems can shift abruptly from one state to another, are notoriously difficult to predict(1). Theory proposes that early warning signals may be based on the phenomenon that recovery rates from small perturbations should tend to zero when approaching a tipping point(2,3); however, evidence that this happens in living systems is lacking. Here we test such 'critical slowing down' using a microcosmin which photo-inhibition drives a cyanobacterial population to a classical tipping point when a critical light level is exceeded. We show that over a large range of conditions, recovery from small perturbations becomes slower as the system comes closer to the critical point. In addition, autocorrelation in the subtle fluctuations of the system's state rose towards the tipping point, supporting the idea that this metric can be used as an indirect indicator of slowing down(4,5). Although stochasticity prohibits prediction of the timing of critical transitions, our results suggest that indicators of slowing down may be used to rank complex systems on a broad scale from resilient to fragile.

AB  - The three major harbours from the central west coast of India were investigated for their benthic environmental status using nematodes as surrogate community. As these three harbours have shown deteriorated conditions revealed from macrobenthic community, our main objective was to investigate and inter-compare the nematode communities within these harbours and with other similar habitats worldwide. A total of 50 nematode species was encountered in the study area, wherein highest (34 species) were recorded at Mormugao harbour and lowest (23 species) at Ratnagiri harbour. The presence of dominant species like Vasostoma sp. (41%), Sabatieria sp.1 (23%) and Sabatieria sp.2. (20%) designate these harbours as altered benthic habitats under stress. The diversity indices demonstrate Ratnagiri harbour as the most stressed and Karwar being the least stressed comparatively. Intense anthropogenic activities, input of many pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, petroleum derivatives, TBT's and dredging activity in the harbours can be held responsible for the altered nematode community.

TI  - Indirect effects to include in strategic environmental assessments of transport infrastructure investments
T2  - TRANSPORT REVIEWS
LA  - English
KW  - TRAVEL
AB  - Indirect effects are important considerations when making consequence analyses in general and in strategic environmental assessments in particular of potential transport solutions and infrastructure plans. The primary objective of this paper is to emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of the long-term system effects of investments in transport infrastructure with a focus on the structuring effects that roads and railways have on society, e. g. altered transport patterns, altered settlement structures and changes in use of the built environment. Special attention is given to the following potential indirect effects: increased total transport volume, increased share of private motorists and truck transport, increased urban sprawl, and increased energy use in buildings. The conditions that determine the power of the effects are discussed and a number of key factors to be considered in transport infrastructure planning, especially in strategic environmental assessments, are suggested. Since many indirect effects emerge over time, an extended time perspective is of essence. Therefore, scenario techniques may be useful when analysing indirect effects in transport planning processes.

AB  - The study of mammal communities provides useful knowledge of paleoenvironments and paleoclimates during the Quaternary Period, and better documentation about the main fossil sites is making this task easier. Paleoecological reconstructions of this study are based on (i) rodent evolution and species richness, (ii) the cenogram method, and (iii) methods for quantifying climatic parameters. These analyses applied to a Pliocene-Quaternary faunal sequence of Spain indicate that a climatic change occurred at the end of the Pliocene when considerable cooling led to the onset of the glacial-interglacial cycles. Subsequently, during the Quaternary Period, alternating environmental patterns occurred, with a rather open and arid environment during the cold phases that contrasts with a somewhat more closed and comparatively wet environment during warmer phases. These observations are generalized from Spain to the remainder of the continent, noting that climatic conditions were less harsh and more arid in Spain than elsewhere in Europe.

AB  - St Helena is an isolated oceanic island located in the tropical South Atlantic, and knowledge of broadscale oceanography and productivity in its surrounding waters is limited. This study used model outputs (2007-2017), remote sensing data (1998-2017) and survey measurements (April 2018 and 2019) to determine background conditions for nutrients, chlorophyll and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in offshore waters and propose standards (thresholds) for assessing inshore water quality based on 50% deviation from seasonal (usually June to November) or annual averages. Seasonal thresholds were proposed for surface nitrate (average 0.18 mu M), phosphate (average 0.26 mu M), silicate (average 2.60 mu M), chlorophyll (average 0.45 mu g chl l(-1)), and SPM (average 0.96 mg l(-1)). Associated background values for most surface parameters (phosphate 0.17 mu M, silicate 1.57 mu M, chlorophyll 0.30 mu g chl l(-1); from model outputs and remote sensing) were slightly higher than offshore observations (April 2019). For nitrate, the average background value (0.12 mu M) was lower than the observed average (0.24 mu M). At depth (150-500 m), annual background values from model outputs were high (nitrate 26.8 mu M, phosphate 1.8 mu M, silicate 17.3 mu M). Observed water masses at depths >150 m, identified to be of Antarctic and Atlantic origin, were nutrient-rich (e.g., 16 mu M for nitrate, April 2019) and oxygen deficient (<4-6 mg l(-1)). A thermocline layer (between ca. 10 and 230 m), characterized by a sub-surface chlorophyll maximum (average 0.3-0.5 mu g chl l(-1)) near the bottom of the euphotic zone (ca. 100 m), is likely to sustain primary and secondary production at St Helena. For assessing inshore levels of chemical contaminants and fecal bacteria estimated from survey measurements, standards were derived from the literature. A preliminary assessment of inshore observations using proposed thresholds from surface offshore waters and relevant literature standards indicated concerns regarding levels of nutrients and fecal bacteria at some locations. More detailed modeling and/or field-based studies are required to investigate seasonal trends and nutrient availability to inshore primary producers and to establish accurate levels of any contaminants of interest or risk to the marine environment.

AB  - Few studies have previously investigated how poor animal welfare might be associated with infection of zoonotic pathogens in humans. This paper assesses the predictive value of the presence of Campylobacter spp. in broiler chicken flocks when animal-based measures related to footpad dermatitis, hock burns, body lesions and arthritis are identified under commercial conditions (high density). The study population included 32 flocks analysed on farm and at slaughter, slaughtered between April and August 2008 in six different slaughter plants in Brittany, France. Welfare and health indicators are those indicated by the European legislation and sampling was carried out in the framework of the European baseline survey on the prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler chicken. Caecal contents, sampled both on farm and at slaughter, and carcass skin samples from the neck and breast at slaughter, were investigated for the presence of Campylobacter spp. Logistic models/classification trees were used to estimate the probability of the presence (or absence) of a specific foodbome pathogen in a flock based on specific animal-based measures (or combinations of measures) in order to study the potential relationship between welfare indicators and foodbome pathogen prevalence/incidence levels. On farm, flocks with more than 25% animals with severe lesions on between 25 and 50% of the footpad are predicted to be Campylobacter-positive whereas flocks where less than 13 individuals have arthritis are predicted to be Campylobacter-negative. The error rate on farm and at slaughter was 10 and 4% respectively indicating good predicting abilities. A poor welfare environment may result in stress, which reduces chicken immunocompetence making them more susceptible to Campylobacter spp. An infection with Campylobacter spp may lead to impaired defence and susceptibility to other pathogens which may result in greater intestinal excretion. Poor welfare and high growing rate lead to digestive troubles that lead to litter humidity. Litter humidity that, among other things, causes footpad dermatitis may also influence the horizontal transmission of the Campylobacter spp. infection due to the normal coprophagic behaviour of poultry. Reducing welfare problems by a better management of rearing conditions would not only improve broiler welfare, but it would also decrease the risks of Campylobacter contamination, of carcass condemnations and of economic loss for the poultry industry.

AB  - A method for assessing regional debris flow susceptibility at the watershed scale, based on an index composed of a morphometric indicator and a land cover indicator, is proposed and applied in 106 peri-urban mountainous watersheds in Bogota, Colombia. The indicator of debris flow susceptibility is obtained from readily available information common to most peri-urban mountainous areas and can be used to prioritise watersheds that can subsequently be subjected to detailed hazard analysis. Susceptibility is considered to increase with flashiness and the possibility of debris flows occurring. Morphological variables recognised in the literature to significantly influence flashiness and occurrence of debris flows are used to construct the morphometric indicator by applying principal component analysis. Subsequently, this indicator is compared with the results of debris flow propagation to assess its capacity in identifying the morphological conditions of a watershed that make it able to transport debris flows. Propagation of debris flows was carried out using the Modified Single Flow Direction algorithm, following identification of source areas by applying thresholds identified in the slope-area curve of the watersheds. Results show that the morphometric variables can be grouped into four indicators: size, shape, hypsometry and (potential) energy, with energy being the component that best explains the capability of a watershed to transport debris flows. However, the morphometric indicator was found to not sufficiently explain the records of past floods in the study area. Combining the morphometric indicator with land cover indicators improved the agreement and provided a more reliable assessment of debris flow susceptibility in the study area. The analysis shows that, even if morphometric parameters identify a high disposition to the occurrence of debris flow, improving land cover can reduce the susceptibility. However, if favourable morphometric conditions are present but deterioration of the land cover in the watershed takes place, then the susceptibility to debris flow events increases. The indicator of debris flow susceptibility is useful in the identification of flood type, which is a crucial step in flood risk assessment especially in mountainous environments, and it can be used as input for prioritisation of flood risk management strategies at regional level and for the prioritisation and identification of detailed flood hazard analysis. The indicator is regional in scope, and therefore it is not intended to constitute a detailed assessment but to highlight watersheds that could potentially be more susceptible to damaging floods than others in the same region.

AB  - The post-anthesis dynamics of the water content of whole sunflower achene and its major parts (pericarp, embryo) were examined for seven genotypes that spanned a broad range of final achene size (30-100 mg achene(-1)). Objectives were: (i) to establish the relative contributions of pericarp and embryo to whole-achene water content dynamics. (ii) to determine the relationship between maximum water content of the pericarp and final achene size, and (iii) to examine the effect of final achene size (as affected by genotype and environment) on achene dry-clown dynamics after physiological maturity (=maximum achene weight). Four experiments were conducted over 2 years under field and glasshouse conditions. Across genotypes and growth conditions, whole-achene and pericarp water contents peaked earlier and more sharply during grain filling (ca. 35% of grain filling duration, or 30% of final achene weight), maximum embryo water content was achieved somewhat later and declined less sharply. Although the pericarp was a minor (17-35%) component of final achene dry weight, it contained 65-70% of achene maximum water content. Absolute pericarp water content did not fall to values close to those of the embryo until after physiological maturity. Final achene and embryo dry weights were closely (r(2) 0.90 and 0.85, respectively) associated with maximum pericarp water content. After maximum achene water content, rates of whole-achene dry-down were linear (ca. 1.35% d(-1)), and absolute rates of water loss per achene (range = 1.1-3.7 mg H2O achene(-1) d(-1)) were strongly associated with achene maximum water content and final achene dry weight (r(2) 0.86 and 0.75, respectively). Excluding the inbred line HA89, the remaining genotypes achieved harvest (17%) and storage (11%) achene water concentrations at about 15 and 20d, respectively, after physiological maturity, largely because absolute rates of achene water loss increased with achene size. We conclude that the pericarp is the dominant component of whole-achene water content dynamics, and that pericarp and achene maximum water contents are good indicators of potential final achene and embryo sizes and achene dry-down rates. Present results also provide a first approximation to the quantification of post-physiological maturity dry-down in this crop. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to demonstrate the influence of the metabolic CO2 derived from the diet and of the atmospheric CO2 on the shell carbonate delta(13)C of the pulmonate snail Helix aspersa maxima raised under controlled conditions. Adult snails were analyzed and compared with three hatching and 1-day old young snails stemming from the same breeding. One day after, the 2-day old individuals were raised during I month. Three groups of gastropods were fed with fresh lettuce (C-3 plant, delta(13)C= -27.49 parts per thousand), three groups with corn (C-4 plant, delta(13)C= -11.7 parts per thousand), and three groups ate alternately both (C-3+C-4). The difference between the average VC values of the adult snails on the one hand and the hatched and 1-day old snails on the other hand indicates a depletion of 2.47 parts per thousand. Therefore, the isotopic parents offspring signal is not preserved. The depleted ingested albumen by the snail embryo in the egg during the building of the shell could explain this depletion. The C-3 diet experiment gave the expected isotopic composition difference between the diet (lettuce) and the shells (average Delta(13)C(shell-lettuce) = 13.75 parts per thousand +/- 0.52). This result shows a clear diet effect on the isotopic composition of the snail shells. For the C4 experiment, the difference in carbon isotope composition between the corn and the shell (Delta(13)C(shell-corn)) yielded an average value of 4.89 parts per thousand +/- 0.87. The main result is that Delta(13)C is not constant and appears to depend on the type of ingested food. Several hypotheses can arise from this study to explain the different fractionations: (a) differences in the quality of the two diets, (b) differences in turnover rate for C-3 and C-4 feeders. The groups regularly fed with mixed diet yielded delta(13)C values showing a preferential use of C-3 food for most values. The C-3-C-4 mixed dietary alternation probably led snails to use mainly the lettuce instead of the corn powder. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Merlino Wood is a typical oak-hornbeam forest in the Po Plain hydrographic region. It is one of the few remaining lowland forests in Northern Italy and is a Regional Natural Reserve and a Site of Community Interest (code IT1160010). This is the first survey on hoverflies in the study area and they act as bioindicators to assess habitat conservation. Sampling was performed with three Malaise traps and an entomological net. A total of 61 species of Syrphidae were recorded between March and October 2019. Three of the species observed are considered to be under threat in Europe, three species have been recorded for the first time in Piedmont and Heringia latitarsis (Egger, 1865) has been recorded for the first time in Northern Italy. The Syrph the Net analysis has been used to assess habitat conservation. It shows good preservation of xylosaprophagous species, while the conservation conditions of other larval trophic categories are poor.

AB  - Soil enzyme activity data from a lysimeter pot trial involving four dissimilar soils irrigated over two simulated seasons (SS) with winery wastewater (WW) and municipal water (MW), were converted to numerical scores using the alteration index three (AI3). Unlike the activities of individual enzymes which are substrate specific and do not reflect the overall status of the soil microbiome, AI3 enabled differences in treatment-induced alteration states between combinations of soil and water to be quantified and statistically assessed. The more negative AI3 scores corresponded to a more altered state in the WW than the MW treatments, after SS3 than after SS4 and in the 0-10 cm compared to the 10-20 cm soil depth interval. AI3 is therefore a potentially useful adjunct to soil enzyme activity assays in monitoring and management of biological activity in vineyard soils. These findings, however, require verification under commercial vineyard conditions.

AB  - Rangelands comprise a large component of the terrestrial land surface and provide critical ecosystem services, but they are degrading rapidly. Long-term rangeland monitoring with detailed, nonsubjective, quantitative observations can be expensive and difficult to maintain over time. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an alternative means to gather unbiased and consistent datasets with similar details to field-based monitoring data. Comparing summer 2017 UAV images with long-term plot measurements, we demonstrate that rangeland vegetation cover changes can be accurately quantified and estimate an increase in total absolute shrub/subshrub cover from 34% in 1935 to > 80% in 2017 in central Arizona. We recommend UAV image-based rangeland monitoring for land managers interested in a few specific and dominant species, such as the foundation species, indicator species, or invasive species that require targeted monitoring. Land managers can identify and continuously monitor trends in rangeland condition, health, and degradation related to specific land use policies and management strategies. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - We characterize the ecological, economic, and community performance of 21 major tuna fisheries, accounting for at least 77% of global tuna production, using the Fishery Performance Indicators. Our analysis reveals that the biggest variations in performance among tuna fisheries are driven by the final markets that they target: international sashimi market tuna fisheries considerably outperform a comparison set of 62 non-tuna fisheries in the Fishery Performance Indicator database, international canned tuna market fisheries perform similarly to the comparison set, and tuna fisheries supplying local markets in coastal states considerably underperform the comparison set. Differences among regional fishery management organizations primarily reflect regional species composition and market access, despite stark variation in governance, management, and other enabling conditions. With a legacy of open access, tuna's harvest sector performance is similar across all fisheries, reflecting only a normal return on the capital and skill invested: industrial vessels slightly outperform semi-industrial and artisanal vessels. Differences emerge in the post-harvest sector however, as value chains able to preserve quality and transport fish to high value markets outperform others.

AB  - Management of water supply systems under shortage conditions due to drought requires computational tools able to relate the past precipitation regime over different time scales to future water resources availability. This work proposes a modelling framework to address the occurrence of shortage for water supply systems whose resource is constituted by natural or artificial reservoirs. The proposed methodology aims at identifying management triggers for possible mitigation measures. Emphasis is given on the use of standardized indices to promote information sharing. The implemented tool is structured into five modules: hydrological module; scenarios module; reservoir module; a module for the evaluation of indices of shortage; and a support to early-warning module. The whole procedure has been applied to three Italian reservoirs. For each water body, a case specific shortage early-warning system, based on standardized precipitation indices has been identified, allowing the implementation of efficient local mitigation measures.

AB  - Numerous climate futures are now available from global climate models. Translation of climate data such as precipitation and temperatures into ecologically meaningful outputs for managers and planners is the next frontier. We describe a model-based open platform to assess vulnerabilities of agricultural systems to climate change on pixel-wise data. The platform includes a simulation modeling engine and is suited to work with NetCDF format of input and output files. In a case study covering a region (Auvergne) in the Massif Central of France, the platform is configured to characterize climate (occurrence of arid conditions in historical and projected climate records), soils and human management, and is then used to assess the vulnerability to climate change of grassland productivity (downscaled to a fine scale). We demonstrate how using climate time series, and process-based simulations vulnerabilities can be defined at fine spatial scales relevant to farmers and land managers, and can be incorporated into management frameworks.

AB  - The transition of nomadic pastoralism to more sessile forms of rangeland utilization and increased stocking rates can result in the degradation of pasture. After political changes in the 1990s in Mongolia, population growth and missing alternative livelihoods intensified the grazing pressure on pastures, and further decreased the condition of the fragile arid ecosystems. To learn more about the productivity and quality of pasture land in Khovd Aimag in the western region of Mongolia, standing biomass was measured in the alpine region, mountain steppe and semi-desert. Plant samples were analyzed for nitrogen and fiber contents by wet chemistry and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). Results show clear differences in distribution of biomass with reduced biomass in the vicinity of temporary settlements. From July to early September plant nitrogen contents decreased in the alpine region, remained unchanged in the mountain steppe and increased in the semi-desert. Nitrogen concentrations were elevated in vegetation close to temporary settlements. For fiber contents (ADF) no clear patterns were found. Neither biomass/m(2) nor vegetation cover were appropriate indicators for food quality.

AB  - Turloughs are groundwater dependent grazed wetlands of conservation importance that occur in limestone depressions in the karst landscape, mostly in the west of Ireland. Data on Carabidae, hydrological regime, soils and management (using grazing exclosures) were collected to assess the effects of both hydrological regime and grazing management on ground beetles of Skealoghan turlough. Distinct ground beetle communities have been found associated with different hydrological regimes with carabid beetle community composition sensitive to both changes in hydrological regime and vegetation structure. The hydrological regime is the primary factor controlling the carabid species composition of this grazed wetland. Grazing, particularly selective grazing by animals plays an important but subordinate role to hydrology in providing suitable habitat conditions for many species of conservation importance. This paper provides a detailed assessment of species responses to wetland management and demonstrates the need to maintain a range of hydrological and grazing regimes.

AB  - Air quality control usually requires a monitoring system of multiple indicators measured at various points in space and time. Hence, the use of space-time multivariate techniques are of fundamental importance in this context, where decisions and actions regarding environmental protection should be supported by studies based on either inter-variables relations and spatial-temporal correlations. This paper describes how canonical correlation analysis can be combined with space-time geostatistical methods for analysing two spatial-temporal correlated aspects, such as air pollution concentrations and meteorological conditions. Hourly averages of three pollutants (nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone) and three atmospheric indicators (temperature, humidity and wind speed) taken for two critical months (February and August) at several monitoring stations are considered and space-time variograms for the variables are estimated. Simultaneous relationships between such sample space-time variograms are determined through canonical correlation analysis. The most correlated canonical variates are used for describing synthetically the underlying space-time behaviour of the components of the two sets.

AB  - Laboratory methodologies characterizing a suite of water-extractable, elemental fractions of broiler litter (BL) are necessary to provide data representing field conditions once BL is land-applied and to address subsequent potential environmental mobility of litter constituents. This study evaluated the effects of water extractant (rainwater and deionized water), extractant/litter dilution ratio (10:1, 20:1, 30:1, and 40:1), and extraction time (5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, 360, 720, and 1440 min) on the chemical composition of BL. Water extractant did not affect water-soluble elements. Water-soluble elemental concentrations increased with increasing extraction times and either increased or were unaffected by increasing extractant/litter dilution ratio. Results based on achieving at least 70% of the maximum observed concentration suggest a minimum recommended extraction time of 30 min. However, extraction times exceeding 360 min indicated microbial immobilization of dissolved organic carbon. Therefore, an extraction time between 30 and 360 min is recommended.

AB  - Trends in flow-adjusted concentrations (indicators of anthropogenic changes) and observed concentrations (indicators of natural and anthropogenic changes) of total phosphorus and total nitrogen from 1993 to 2003 were evaluated in the eastern, central, and western United States by adapting the Regional Kendall trend test to account for seasonality and spatial correlation. The only significant regional trend was an increase in flow-adjusted concentrations of total phosphorus in the central United States, which corresponded to increases in phosphorus inputs from fertilizer in the region, particularly west of the Mississippi River. A similar upward regional trend in observed total phosphorus concentrations in the central United States was not found, likely because precipitation and runoff decreased during drought conditions in the region, offsetting the increased source loading on the land surface. A greater number of regional trends would have been significant if spatial correlation had been disregarded, indicating the importance of spatial correlation modifications in regional trend assessments when sites are not spatially independent.

AB  - Agricultural drainage water (ADW) may be considered as a strategic reserve to cope with the ever-increasing demand for fresh water. Numerous technological solutions must be examined to enable safe reuse of the ADW. Three technological sets must be addressed simultaneously. The first set is related to removal of suspended and soluble organic contaminants from the ADW. The second set comprises most of the known commercial desalting technologies. The third technological set includes hazardous contaminants removal systems. The appropriate schemes for treatment and reuse of ADW include the selection and integration of two or three subsets from the prementioned treatment categories. This paper is dedicated to the analysis of the first technological set, which includes the ADW pretreatment options prior to desalination. Five subsets will be discussed namely; biological treatment, chemical treatment, chemically enhanced biological treatment and filtration. The analysis comprises the characteristics of Egyptian drainage water and technological requirements to pretreat this wastewater category for subsequent desalting stage. The paper is concluded with selection guidelines encompassing technical and financial indicators under Egyptian and developing countries conditions.

AB  - Substrates that are cleaved to yield fluorescent products can be used to quickly quantify enzyme activity in vivo with image analysis or in vitro with fluorometry. This study was carried out to determine whether enzyme activity in rotifers is useful for assessing the physiological condition of rotifers. Neonates of Brachionus plicatilis Muller hatched from cysts were exposed to a concentration series of unionized ammonia ranging from 0 to 9.8 p.p.m., increasing seawater viscosity relative to 1.17 to control sea water by the addition of methyl cellulose and the addition of the protozoan Euplotes sp. to a density of 40 mL(-1.) Rotifer glucosidase and esterase activities decreased with increasing unionized ammonia and viscosity respectively. Activities of glucosidase and phospholipase decreased with increasing protozoan contamination. There was a significant relationship between enzyme activities and rotifer population growth. In vivo activities of certain rotifer enzymes can therefore serve as biomarkers for the rapid assessment of environmental stressors in rotifer mass cultures.

AB  - Animal behavior has been defined as the interaction of an animal with its environment.  During this interaction the animal must make decisions, based on its evaluation of the environment and its needs, of whether or not the environment is adequate or appropriate for specific behaviors.  The environment includes both physical and biotic components, so sheep adjust their behavior in response to such diverse characteristics as the thermal conditions of their environment, the flora present, or the characteristics of other sheep.  Although an animal's subjective experiences may not lend themselves to direct evaluation, we may be able to address these questions indirectly by using behavior as an indicator of the animal's decisions.  This paper reviews research on the use of space, maternal and neonatal recognition, sexual behavior, and aversiveness.  The majority of methods involve preference or acceptance tests.  Assumptions, which often affect how tests are conducted and results interpreted, should be made only after the alternatives are carefully considered.

AB  - Institutional performance is a critical element that stakeholders must collectively strengthen to better respond to marine tourism development challenges. The institutional strength of a community has the power to influence the behaviour of local people, which drives them to conduct activities effectively and create a foundation for management. This paper uses qualitative approaches specifically through the case study method. The results of this paper show that: (1) beyond the potential of marine ecotourism development, there are several unsolved problems specifically within the ecological, social and economic areas; (2) ten indicators strengthen the institutional performance in developing Raja Ampat Tourism Villages. These indicators consist of: (1) community cooperation with outside institutions; (2) clarity of management area borderlines; (3) correspondence of regulations towards the local conditions; (4) active engagement of the community in the development and management of regulations; (5) the presence of local institutions; (6) effectiveness of supervision; (7) the imposition of sanctions; (8) conflict resolution mechanisms; (9) governmental recognition through the establishment of regulations; (10) equal access for resource users.

AB  - In recent decades, nanostructured silica has become a key component in several materials developed at the industrial length scale. Used for its outstanding ability to structure food, drugs, and rubber, to fulfil specific needs in numerous applications, it has also led to the widespread development of sustainable energy-based materials. Superinsulation materials endowed with an exceptionally low thermal conductivity are a major goal regarding energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission. However, because the properties of insulation materials greatly depend on their nanostructures, it is crucial to ensure their hygrothermal stability, by limiting ageing phenomena. Here, we thoroughly characterize the hygrothermal ageing of a fractal industrially relevant silica using a complementary set of experimental techniques, providing local (TEM and electron tomography) and statistical indicators of structural evolution. For the first time, we unambiguously evidence the smoothing of elementary particles and quantify their growth (from 4.3 to 10.0 nm), which results in the densification of aggregates at the upper length scale.

AB  - This study aims to integrate sustainability indicators into the traditional assessment of networklevel pavement maintenance budget scenarios. A conceptual framework is developed based on a multi-attribute method by systematically considering road conditions, economic, environmental, and social sustainability. A case study is then adopted to demonstrate the usefulness of this framework. Out of eight network-level pavement maintenance budget scenarios, the 85M plan (representing an annual maintenance budget of AUD$85M) is selected as the optimal solution in an initial experiment in which equal weights are allocated to the four attributes. In an additional experiment with 1000 sets of randomly assigned weights, the 85M plan was also selected as the optimal option for 596 trials. The proposed framework provides a straightforward method for road agencies to select the optimal network-level pavement maintenance budget scenario or obtain preliminary insights when the precise weight of each sustainability attribute cannot be accurately obtained.

AB  - Environmental conditions influence fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) levels, which are routinely used to characterize recreational water quality. This study examined 15 years of environmental and FIB data at Puntarenas and Jaco beach, Costa Rica. FIB relationships with sea level, wave height, precipitation, direct normal irradiance (DNI), wind, and turbidity were analyzed. Pearson's correlations identified lags between 24 and 96 h among environmental parameters and FIB. Multiple linear regression models composed of environmental parameters explained 24% and 27% of fecal coliforms and enterococci variability in Jaco, respectively. Puntarenas's models explained 17-26% of fecal coliforms and 12-18% enterococci variability. Precipitation, sea level anomalies, and wave height most frequently explained FIB variability. Hypothesis testing often identified significant differences in precipitation, wave height, daily sea level anomalies, and maximum sea level 24 h prior between days with and without FIB threshold exceedance. Unexpected FIB interactions with DNI, sea level, and turbidity highlight the importance of future investigations.

AB  - Utilising a potential coastal trace element bioindicator requires understanding its accumulation patterns under varying environmental scenarios. The present study aimed to understand, from two experiments, the influence and effect of low light (15.3 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and variable salinity (normal 36 and reduced 29) on Zostera muelleri accumulating variable Cu concentrations (control, low 5 mu g L-1 and high 50 mu g L-1) in order to de termine its capability as a potential trace element bioindicator. Initial (24 h) leaf Cu concentration was in proportion to exposure Cu concentrations, irrespective of manipulated environmental conditions, suggesting passive accumulation. Final below-ground Cu concentrations, during the low light experiment, significantly increased over time, suggesting active Cu accumulation. Zostera muelleri leaves could act as a Cu bioindicator at times of reduced light and salinity while further interpretation is required of below-ground Cu concentrations. It is recommended that Z. muelleri could be utilised as a Cu bioindicator.

AB  - Freshwater supply remains limited in West Africa due to lack of operational governance frameworks. In this study, the Water flow and balance Simulation Model (WaSiM) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) were applied in the Ouriyori catchment (14.5 km(2), Benin) to assess hydrological ecosystem services (HES) in terms of service flow and service capacity using the ecosystem accounting framework. The modelling exercises indicated satisfactory goodness-of-fit coefficients greater than 75% with an absolute bias of less than 25%. The HES capacity was in general higher than the HES flow for crop and household (surface/groundwater) water supplies, indicating that the catchment can potentially supply more water under optimal storage and management conditions. Positive and negative shifts in service capacities of crop water and household supplies were observed over the simulation period. These significant results can support sustainable interventions in securing water and food productions through increasing HES flow and capacity.

AB  - The consensus on mechanisms responsible for how chloride-based salts attack concrete has yet not been achieved. This work exposed laboratory-fabricated concrete samples to MgCl2 solutions of various concentrations along with freeze/thaw and wet/dry cycles, with NaCl solutions as the control. The laboratory investigation revealed a new chemical mechanism during the MgCl2-induced deterioration of concrete, i.e., the formation of multi-phase nano-sized crystals, including CaCl2, Mg(OH)(2), and Mg-3(OH)(5)Cl center dot(H2O)(4). This mechanism was further corroborated by the testing of concrete samples cored from several selected concrete bridge decks, where cumulative exposure to MgCl2 deicer resulted in significantly compromised splitting tensile strength (as high as 50%) as well as reductions in microhardness (up to 60%, often at a depth of 25 to 50 mm). This study provides new insights into the risks of MgCl2 to the concrete-built environment. It also alerts that visual inspection could be misleading for condition assessment of concrete exposed to MgCl2.

AB  - The replacement of refrigerants in domestic refrigerators is nowadays one of the approaches used to enhance the performance and environmental impact of these systems. Theoretical and experimental research, mainly focused on energy or exergy analysis, is currently found in the literature, but only a few studies are focused on exergoeconomic approaches. Therefore, in order to include the overall costs of a domestic refrigerator, an exergoeconomic cost analysis is applied to an experimental installation. Exergoeconomic parameters such as the unit exergy cost (c(p)) and the exergoeconomic factor (f) are used as a comparative indicator of performance. Based on the unit exergy cost, the results show that R134a performs better than R1234yf at different operating conditions. The exergoeconomic factor presents higher values for R134a than for R1234yf, which implies less exergy destruction in the system. The optimization allows reducing the cost of the produced cold by 9.8% when using R134a and by 6.5% when using R1234yf. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid growth and adoption of nanomaterial-based technologies underpin a risk for unaccounted material release to the environment. Carbon-based materials, in particular fullerenes, have been widely proposed for a variety of applications. A quantitative understanding of how they behave is critical for accurate environmental impact assessment. While their aqueous phase reactivity, fate, and transport have been studied for over a decade, aerosol phase reactivity remains unexplored. Here, the transformation of C-60, as nanocrystal (nC(60)) aerosols, is evaluated over a range of simulated atmospheric conditions. Upon exposure to UV light, gas-phase O-3, and (OH)-O-., nC(60) is readily oxidized. This reaction pathway is likely limited by diffusion of oxidants within/through the nC(60) aerosol. Further, gas-phase oxidation induces disorder in the crystal structure without affecting aerosol (aggregate) size. Loss of crystallinity suggests aged nC(60) aerosols will be less effective ice nuclei, but an increase in surface oxidation will improve their cloud condensation nuclei ability.

AB  - There is a general concern of adopting incentive compensation plans to motivate employees effectively. The major focus is to ensure that risks and rewards are commensurably and fairly distributed among contracting parties to achieve specific project objectives. The paper assesses the how risks and rewards can be combined together in a compensation plan within the Nigerian construction industry. An exploratory sequential approach was adopted in the research survey. The research findings reveal the most critical risk factors as financial stability, contract conditions, environmental factors and bank interest rate. The most important factors in rewarding for the key performance indicators were identified as measurement and correction of works, reasonable claims of extension of time, minimize defects and response to incident rate. The study provides an insight on how to combine risks with rewards in an incentive compensation plan. The paper recommends that project practitioners should consider the use of incentive plan by incorporating risk factors to achieve efficiency in project delivery.

AB  - This paper analyzes the impact of droughts on agricultural water productivity in the period 2004-2012 in the Guadalquivir River Basin using the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Water (SEEA-Water). Relevant events in this period include two meteorological droughts (2005 and 2012), the implementation of the Drought Management Plan by the basin's water authority (2006, 2007 and 2008), and the effects of irrigated area modernization (water-saving investment). Results show that SEEA-Water can be used to study the productivity of water and the economic impact of the different droughts. Furthermore, the results reflect the fact that irrigated agriculture (which makes up 65% of the gross value added, or GVA, of the total primary sector) has considerably higher water productivity than rain-fed agriculture. Additionally, this paper separately examines blue water productivity and total water productivity within irrigated agriculture, finding an average productivity of 1.33 EUR/m(3) and 0.48 EUR/m(3), respectively.

AB  - Phenology is believed to be a suitable bio-indicator to track climate change. Based on the strong statistical association between phenology and temperature phenological observations provide an inexpensive means for the temporal and spatial analysis of the urban heat island. However, other environmental factors might also weaken this relationship. In addition, the investigation of urban phenology allows an estimation of future phenology from current information since cities with their amplified temperatures may serve as a proxy for future conditions. Nevertheless, the design of spatial compared to long-term studies might be influenced by different factors which should be taken into consideration when interpreting results from a specific study. In general, plants located in urban areas tend to flush and bloom earlier than in the countryside. What are the consequences of these urban-rural differences? This review will document existing findings on urban phenology and will highlight areas in which further research is needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sexual signals can be used to attract mates, but to be honest indicators of signaller quality they need to convey information reliably. However, environmental variation and genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions have the potential to compromise the reliability of sexual signals. Here, we test the reliability of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) as signals of heritable aspects of male attractiveness in Drosophila simulans. We examined the heritability of male attractiveness and a measure of the difference between fathers' and sons' CHC profiles across dietary and temperature environments. Our results show that environmental heterogeneity disrupts the similarity of some components of father and son CHC profile. However, overall male attractiveness is heritable within and across environments, so that sire attractiveness is a good predictor of son attractiveness even with environmental heterogeneity. This suggests that although some male CHC signals are unreliable, attractive genotypes retain their attractiveness across environments on average.

AB  - This work presents an electricity consumption-forecasting framework configured automatically and based on an Adaptative Neural Network Inference System (ANFIS). This framework is aimed to be implemented in industrial plants, such as automotive factories, with the objective of giving support to an Intelligent Energy Management System (IEMS). The forecasting purpose is to support the decision-making (i.e. scheduling workdays, on-off production lines, shift power loads to avoid load peaks, etc.) to optimize and improve economical, environmental and electrical key performance indicators. The base structure algorithm, the ANFIS algorithm, was configured by means of a Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), with the aim of getting an automatic-configuration system modelling. This system was implemented in an independent section of an automotive factory, which was selected for the high randomness of its main loads. The time resolution for forecasting was the quarter hour. Under these challenging conditions, the autonomous configuration, system learning and prognosis were tested with success. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of alkaline dust emitted from a cement plant for over 40 years on the anatomy of needles of Scots pine and lignin accumulation were analysed. Comparative analytical studies were conducted in stands similar as to their silvicultural indicators, climate and age in alkalised and in a relatively unpolluted area. Cross-section of needles were stained, photographed under microscope and measured. It was found that, due to the alkalisation of the environment, the total area of the needle cross-section, needle width and thickness and the area of mesophyll had decreased. At the same time, the vascular bundles and epidermis had increased. The greatest anatomical and biochemical differences between the needles from trees growing under optimum conditions and in the alkalised area were observed in the oldest needles. Visual analysis of cross-sections and biochemical analysis showed accumulation of lignin in older needles but more intensively in alkalised areas than in control.

AB  - Some of the greatest forest health impacts in North America are caused by invasive forest insects and pathogens (e.g.. emerald ash borer and sudden oak death in the US), by severe outbreaks of native pests (e.g., mountain pine beetle in Canada), and fires exacerbated by changing climate. Ozone and N and S pollutants continue to impact the health of forests in several regions of North America. Long-term monitoring of forest health indicators has facilitated the assessment of forest health and sustainability in North America. By linking a nationwide network of forest health plots with the more extensive forest inventory, forest health experts in the US have evaluated current trends for major forest health indicators and developed assessments of future risks. Canada and Mexico currently lack nationwide networks of forest health plots. Development and expansion of these networks is critical to effective assessment of future forest health impacts.

AB  - Impervious surface is often used as an indicator of non-point source pollution in urban areas due to the strong relationship between percent impervious surface cover and water-quality impacts. In many cases, a threshold effect exists where water quality rapidly degrades above a given percent cover, but the exact threshold level appears to vary across regions. This study explores the relationship between pH, specific conductance, and percent impervious surface cover in the urbanizing coastal zone of New Jersey (USA) to determine the nature of the relationship in the region. The results of the analysis suggest the system is very sensitive to impervious surface, with a threshold potentially existing between 2.4% and 5.1 % impervious surface cover. An examination of future conditions suggests that by 2020 water quality in more than 50% of the catchments in the study area will be negatively impacted by non-point source pollution associated with impervious surface.

AB  - Large benthic foraminifers are considered to be good indicators of shallow marine carbonate environments in fossil series. Over the last 50 years, the palaeoenvironment of Tertiary Nummulites accumulations has been a matter of debate, particularly because of difficulties in interpreting these deposits, and in this way, the absence of analogues in present-day seas does not help. The aim of this paper is to insight the different ways Nummulites tests and clasts may accumulate according to their hydrodynamic behaviour. Based on experimental measurements and on SEM observations, it appears that the high primary skeletal porosity of Nummulites made them easily transportable. The calculated threshold shear velocities confirm that large-sized Nummulites can be moved by weak wave-driven currents. This peculiar hydrodynamic behaviour of Nummulites could explain the diversity of depositional models. Depending on local hydrodynamic conditions, autochthonous Nummulites deposits can be preserved as in situ winnowed bioaccumulations or be accumulated offshore, onshore or alongshore, away from the original biotope.

AB  - We studied the variation in the number of chaetae of 15 characters in Saduria entomon (L.) (Crustacea, lsopoda) from the Baltic (2 samples), White, and South-eastern Barents Seas. The following parameters were analysed: (i) means, (ii) inter-individual variance, (iii) intra-individual or stochastic variance measured by fluctuating asymmetry, i.e. random deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry, which is a measure of developmental instability. The samples from the Baltic Sea were characterised by a greater number of chaetae than those from the White and Barents Seas in almost all characters. Inter-individual variance in the Barents Sea sample was lower than in the other samples, possibly because of low genetic variation. Fluctuating asymmetry was the least in the sample from the Baltic Sea (Gulf of Gdansk), indicating that environmental conditions in this location are the most favourable. In juveniles the magnitude of the fluctuating asymmetry and its contribution to the total variance was higher than in adults.

AB  - Background Most family studies of psychiatric disorders examine one syndrome at a time, and identify probands in clinical rather than epidemiological settings.
   Method In the National Comorbidity Survey, 5877 respondents were asked about the history of five psychiatric disorders in their parents: major depression (MD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), antisocial personality disorder (ASP), alcohol abuse/dependence (AAD) and drug abuse/dependence (DAD).
   Results Significant familial aggregation was seen for all disorders. Controlling for other disorders produced only modest reductions in the odds ratios for MD,GAD and AAD and larger reductions for ASP and DAD. The familial transmission of these disorders can be explained by underlying vulnerabilities to internalising and to externalising disorders transmitted across generations with moderate fidelity.
   Conclusions Familial aggregation of common psychiatric and substance use disorders is substantial in epidemiologic samples. The examined environmental adversities account for little of the observed parent-offspring transmission of these conditions.

AB  - Standard measures of economic growth do not adequately reflect changes in aggregate welfare over time.  Sustainable national income is therefore defined as Net National Product with adjustments for the degradation of renewable and non-renewable capital.  Productivity loss rather than replacement cost is the most theoretically correct way to value resource depletion.  Modified net product is estimated for the agriculture and forestry sectors of Zimbabwe by valuing the loss of forest stock and soil erosion.  The results show that traditional measures overstate the value of the agricultural sector's product by approximately 10% in 1989.  It is argued that indicators of sustainable national income do not ensure sustainable development; as with all macroeconomic indicators, they do not account for distributional and equity issues which are at the crux of sustainable development, nor do they point to mechanisms that would ensure sustainable resource management.  Rising sustainable income over time is therefore a necessary but not sufficient condition for the achievement of sustainable development.

TI  - PHARMACOTHERAPY OF DYSTHYMIA - A REVIEW
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The clinical significance of chronic mild depression (dysthymia) is well recognized, but has not been the focus of extensive research. In particular, basic research on the phenomenology and treatment of these conditions is limited. Clinical lore suggests that psychotherapy, rather than pharmacotherapy, is the treatment of choice. This is based more on a theoretical understanding of chronic depression as a personality disorder rather than on actual treatment studies. This paper reviews the literature on the pharmacotherapy of dysthymia. The results provide substantial evidence for the efficacy of antidepressants in dysthymia, although the treatment response is less than that typically found in major depression. Furthermore, the findings suggest the possibility that monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may be superior to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in the treatment of dysthymia, although this needs to be more rigorously evaluated. Some of the methodological problems with these studies are discussed. Additional areas of research, including the clinical and biological indicators of drug response, the use of nonTCA, nonMAOI drugs, the effects of pharmacological intervention on the development and maintenance of chronicity, and the comparison of and interaction between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are identified and suggested for future study.

AB  - Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the most important pulses consumed in the world. Total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, total monomeric anthocyanin content and antioxidant capacity were determined, using ferric reducing antioxidant power and free radical scavenging activity, in 255 lines grown under the same environmental conditions. For all parameters analysed, there was a wide range of variability, with differences always above one order of magnitude. Phenolic compounds in beans with coloured coats were found to be more efficient antioxidants than those with completely white coats, and samples with more strongly coloured coats (red, cream, black, pink and brown) showed the highest antioxidant capacities. Based on the strong correlation detected between the variables, total phenolic content can be considered an appropriate indicator of antioxidant activity. The results provide a robust database for selecting those lines of greater functional and nutritional interest in terms of cultivation for direct consumption, for inclusions in food formulations or for use in future breeding programs.

AB  - After 1990, the problem of finding econometric models to assess the influence of economic development on the environment becomes a global goal, a central element of regional, national and Community policies. A perception on the evolution of global climate change and on the impact of human activity on them has been determined by the hypothesis that in the early stages of economic development, pollution and incomes are growing almost simultaneously, and beyond a certain level of incomes, the trend is reversing, therefore at high levels of incomes and economic growth occur improvements in environmental conditions. In this paper, we aim to analyze the relationship between the level of pollution (CO2 emissions) and revenues (GDP per capita) using the Kuznets Environmental Curve (EKC). To apply the econometric model, two indicators were used: CO2 emissions and GDP per capita, using a panel analysis for the period 2000 - 2016, which included 31 European countries and 527 observations. The article contributes to the development of econometric applications based on panel data and the Kuznets Environmental Curve.

AB  - The percentage of filter-feeder species in benthic ostracod assemblages shows evident changes during the Late Devonian Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) transition with two sharp rises in the event stratal interval based on materials collected from the Yangdi section, South China. Neither anoxia nor oligotrophy, eustasy should have been the only primary cause of filter-feeders signal in the F-F event. The sea level fall and rise would create deteriorative environmental conditions such as lower oxygenation and less nutrients, which altogether reduced the diversity and abundance of the benthic ostracods in the F-F transition. The percentage of filter-feeders showed a decrease during the regression, and vice-versa. Therefore, the filter-feeders may be potentially an indicator of sea level changes in the F-F event.

AB  - The current paper proposes a method to detect mechanical faults in rotating machines using three-phase electrical currents analysis. The proposed fault indicator relies on the use of instantaneous symmetrical components (ISCs), followed by a demodulation step enhancing the small modulations generated in electrical signals by mechanical faults. The limitations due to the multi-component nature of electrical signals, as well as to the noise naturally present in the measured signals are studied and taken into account in order to elaborate a proper and efficient algorithm to compute a mechanical fault indicator. It is theoretically shown that the ISCs based approach results in an increase of the signal-tonoise ratio compared to a single-phase approach, finally leading to an improvement of early fault detection capabilities. This result is validated using both synthetic and experimental signals where the proposed method is used to detect bearing faults and the obtained results are compared to single-phase results.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Assemblages of dinoflagellate cysts in lakebed sediments across the deep, meromictic basin of Sluice Pond (Lynn, Massachusetts) were compared with measurements of water quality and sediment geochemistry and with testate amoeba and tintinnid assemblages. Lakebed sediments below oxygenated waters (DO > 2 mg/L) contain diverse testate amoebae, but sparse Peridinium willei-dominated dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. Sediments collected under hypoxic conditions (DO < 2 mg/L) showed higher preservation of organic carbon and nitrogen, and these deep basin sediments are characterised by diverse dinoflagellate cyst assemblages, but sieved microfossil assemblages are typically dominated by the planktonic Codonella cratera and the pseudo-planktonic Cucurbitella tricuspis. Strong inverse relationships of cysts of Peridinium willei (R-2 = 0.81) and Difflugia oblonga tests (R-2 = 0.7) with water depth are attributed to variations in bottom water oxygen concentrations. Both ecological and taphonomic factors must be considered when reconstructing palaeoenvironments from microfossil assemblages.

AB  - The article presents the instruments for the assessment of environmental protection - the risk of nuclear medicine in the entities. Streamlining of processes in health care entities is the determinant of the concept of process management. It is based on the implementation of significant changes in the course of diagnostic and therapeutic processes, which result in their efficiency is raised (a measure of the cost and time), flexibility (the ability to process an adequate response of the body of the patient). Analyses show that the implementation of a comprehensive process approach to risk management and environmental protection can bring many tangible benefits to operators of nuclear medicine. Where the process of elimination of risk is not possible, they should be restricted, and the risk of residual control. Development of systems for environmental protection and risk assessment is never ending - is doomed to evolution. Factor causing this situation is the fact that they reflect the diagnostic and therapeutic subprocesses managing the process of providing medical services, they are also an expression of the attitude of the medical community conditioned the current state of knowledge.

AB  - The prevention of oxidative reactions in a biological medium as well as the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chronic degenerative diseases are questions that continue to be investigated. Electrochemical biosensors have shown attractive features to evaluate the oxidative stress condition at a level comparable to chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. The biosensors developed so far are based on direct analysis of specific indicators such as biomarkers of oxidative stress on the monitoring of reactive oxygen species the free radicals in cells or tissues, aiming to obtain a correlation between the index obtained from these indicators with the oxidative stress levels in cells. In this review we will provide an overview of the development of electrochemical biosensors to evaluate the content of antioxidants and reactive oxygen species in physiological systems. Some discussion regarding the analysis of antioxidant capacity at the single cell level is also presented.

AB  - The nature of the amorphous Ti species in titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) was investigated by UV Raman spectroscopy (UV Raman), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVDRS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and Hammett indicator titration methods. A new Raman feature at 700 cm(-1), which is closely related to the UVDRS band at 260-280 nm, is first assigned to a totally symmetric vibration of hexacoordinated Ti-O-Ti linkages of the amorphous Ti species. The amorphous Ti species in TS-1 can be formed easily under the synthesis conditions in the presence of Na+ or after treatment in ammonia solution. The results reveal that the amorphous Ti species is the main factor in the enhanced acidity and H2O2 decomposition ability of TS-1. A sulfosalt impregnation method has been proved effective in reducing the adverse effect of the amorphous Ti species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - INDICATORS
AB  - Monitoring progress toward sustainable development requires the identification of operational indicators that provide manageable units of information on institutional, environmental, economic and social dimensions. This paper is an attempt to develop macro sustainability indicators of selected countries in order to track sustainability in a dynamic manner. Therefore, as a first step, sustainability pillar variables for 131 countries were defined and derived for the period 2000-2007. Three different methods, i.e., standardization, min-max and cyclical techniques, were used to normalize data and finally a principal component analysis (PCA) was applied for weighting selected variables. In the last step, countries were ranked based on their principal components (PCs) and spatially aggregated sustainability was tracked in four dimensions. The paper finds that while progress was observed for the institutional, economic and social dimensions, the environmental conditions deteriorated successively over the studied period. It is concluded that when institutional, environmental and economic pillars are strongly correlated, economic development cannot solely explain environmental deterioration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Organic matter transport and retention were evaluated in 14 small streams representing a range of riparian vegetation disturbance and watershed development levels in the Puget Lowland of western Washington. To determine relative transport and retention, diamond-shaped acetate strips of similar size and density to leaves were released in riffles during low-flow conditions. Simultaneous dissolved tracer releases were used to measure hydraulic characteristics of each reach. Both reach-averaged velocity and hydraulic dispersion predicted median leaf-surrogate material travel distance (R-2 = 0.87, p < 0.001) and characterized transport and retention over longer reach lengths than in traditional organic matter release experiments. Relative organic matter transport distance increased as the pool/riffle ratio decreased, reach-averaged velocity increased, and dispersion increased. Because urban development affects hydraulic characteristics, urbanization enhances organic matter transport in small streams, reducing the retention of organic matter available for biotic processes.

AB  - The concentration of (210)pb(ex) has been measured in mosses (Hypnum cupressiforme) collected over a wide area around a coal-fired power station located in La Spezia, Central Italy, in order to evaluate the possible increase of natural radioactivity levels due to the operation of the plant. The concentration of (210)pb(ex) varies between 258 +/- 39 and 1898 +/- 385 Bq m(-2). The (210)pb(ex) distribution pattern has been analysed in relation to the structure of the moss carpet (thickness, density) and compared to that of Cs-137. The close correlation between the distribution of (210)pb and Cs-137 indicates that the patchiness of the observed distribution is mainly related to the general meteorological conditions and to the health and structure of the organisms. The operation of the power plant did not result in preferential deposition of (210)pb(ex) at particular sites in the study area. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. AU rights reserved.

AB  - Suppression of historic fire regimes in North America has altered successional stages and shifted vegetation communities, negatively impacting wildlife diversity in forests. Prescribed fire is often used to increase habitat for wildlife populations and diversity but monitoring of responses does not always capture nuanced differences in habitat that influence wildlife communities over a range of ecological conditions and processes. We matched avian point count data with extensive vegetation sampling of unburned plots and plots that burned 12-16 months prior to evaluate the effects of coarseand fine-scale habitat variables on the abundance of a suite of avian indicator species and nesting guilds. We estimated abundance conditional on detection probability based on repeated sampling over time intervals using N-mixture models and assessed support for coarseand fine-scale habitat variables using multimodel inference and AIC. Six of 10 species demonstrated different abundances on burned and unburned plots. Abundances of three species were influenced solely by coarse variables, one species by fine-scale vegetation, and five species were dependent on a mix of coarseand fine-scale variables. Even fine scale vegetation characteristics did not fully capture the ecological processes stimulated by fire and compensatory community differences including interactions among species such as competition and predator avoidance should be considered in predicting species responses to prescribed fire. Shrub nester abundance was much higher on plots that burned the year prior, but the effect sizes of other variables were small for ground, tree, and cavity nesters, even though there were strong differences in abundances of individual species within those guilds. Detection probability was most often affected by conditions during the count including start time, temperature and wind, but also burn status and observer, suggesting potential bias in findings that do not account for heterogeneity in detection probability. We suggest variable responses of individual species within nesting guilds may obscure identification of responses in the avian community and inhibit assessment of management and restoration actions. Understanding species-specific responses to fine-scale habitat variables in the context of coarse ecological typology and the associated vegetative and wildlife community will provide the greatest insight to how prescribed fire characteristics interact to produce wildlife responses, and thus enhance its use as a restoration tool.

AB  - Origins and processes of groundwater salinization and pollution in urban coastal aquifer under the influence of serious industrialization and urbanization were determined using major and trace element/ion geochemistry, microbial and environmental isotope analyses, and statistical correlation and hierarchical cluster analyses of chemical parameters. Electrical conductivities (EC) of the groundwater in the coastal aquifer ranged from 487 to 4280 mu S/cm. Average groundwater EC values measured in wet and dry seasons were 1130 +/- 420 mu S/cm and 1096 +/- 526 mu S/cm, respectively. Wells with high EC values were noticed not only near the gulf coastline (1799-2801 mu S/cm) but also at the further inland (1709-4280 mu S/cm). Statistical evaluation of the groundwater analyses showed that EC had a relatively good correlation with Cl (r=0.85-0.90, p<0.01). Cl-Br ion couple also exhibited a significant correlation with a r squared value of 0.9545, suggesting that salinity of the coastal aquifer was controlled dominantly by single source. Piper diagram showed that predominant cation and anion types in the coastal groundwater exhibited shifts generally from Ca to Na, HCO3 to Cl and to less HCO3 to SO4. A significant variation observed in hydrogeochemical facies of the coastal groundwater resulted from dissolution of calcite, dolomite and gypsum, mixing with seawater, formation water and sewage effluents, and cation-exchange processes. Evaluation of Cl/Br mass ratio along with total nitrogen and microbiological contents of the groundwater samples indicated that seawater intrusion was occurring in the coastal aquifer. However, other sources such as mixing with saline formation water (paleo-seawater) and sewage effluents also contributed groundwater salinization locally at the inland. High seawater mixing ratios (2.5-5%) were obtained from wells close to the gulf coastline, while inland wells generally exhibited low mixing ratios (mean 0.36%+/- 0.3). Fecal contamination in coastal groundwater was at notable levels. Varying redox environments (oxic/suboxic/anoxic) were observed in the coastal aquifer. Seasonal variation in the redox conditions controlled the Mn, Fe, and As enrichments in the coastal groundwater above their MCL values. This study also showed when employed with the other pollutant indicators, Cl/Br mass ratio could be used effectively to delineate the sources of contamination and salinization in coastal groundwater exhibiting low seawater mixing ratios.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effects of temperature and metal contamination (cadmium and nickel) on phospholipid fatty acid composition, antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation in fish. Yellow perch were acclimated to two different temperatures (9 degrees C and 28 degrees C) and exposed either to Cd or Ni (respectively 4 mu g/L and 600 mu g/L) for seven weeks. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase activities and glutathione concentration were measured as indicators of antioxidant capacities, while malondialdehyde concentration was used as an indicator of lipid peroxidation. Poikilotherms including fish counteract the effects of temperature on phospholipid fatty acid ordering by remodelling their composition to maintain optimal fluidity. Accordingly, in our study, the fatty acid composition of yellow perch muscle at 9 degrees C was enhanced in monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) compared to fish maintained at 28 degrees C, in agreement with the theory of homeoviscous adaptation. Using ratios of various fatty acids as surrogates for desaturase and elongase activities, our data suggests that modification of the activity of these enzymes is responsible for the thermal acclimation of phospholipid fatty acid profiles. However, this response was altered under Ni and Cd exposure: PUFA decreased (specifically n-6 PUFA) while the proportion of saturated fatty acids increased at 9 degrees C, whereas at 28 degrees C, PUFA increased to proportions exceeding those observed at 9 degrees C. Lipid peroxidation could be observed under all experimental conditions. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense systems acted cooperatively to cope with oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation, which was not affected by temperature acclimation as indicated by malondialdehyde concentration, in spite of a higher polyinsaturation in cold-acclimated fish which would be predicted to increase their vulnerability to peroxidation. However, in warm-acclimated, Ni-exposed fish, in which the highest proportion of PUFA was observed, lower concentrations of malondialdehyde were measured, suggesting an overcompensation of antioxidant mechanisms in these fish which could represent a substantial metabolic cost and explain their lower condition.

AB  - It is well known that temporal changes in bivalve body mass are strongly correlated with temporal variations in water temperature and food supply. In order to study the influence of the year-to-year variability of environmental factors on oyster growth, we coupled a biogeochemical sub-model, which simulates trophic resources of oysters (i.e. phytoplankton biomass via chlorophyll a), and an ecophysiological sub-model, which simulates growth and reproduction (i.e. gametogenesis and spawning), using mechanistic bases. The biogeochemical sub-model successfully simulated phytoplankton dynamics using river nutrient inputs and meteorological factors as forcing functions. Adequate simulation of oyster growth dynamics requires a relevant food quantifier compatible with outputs of the biogeochemical sub-model (i.e. chlorophyll a concentration). We decided to use the phytoplankton carbon concentration as quantifier for food, as it is a better estimator of the energy really available to oysters. The transformation of chlorophyll a concentration into carbon concentration using a variable chlorophyll a to carbon ratio enabled us to improve the simulation of oyster growth especially during the starvation period (i.e. autumn and winter). Once validated, the coupled model was a suitable tool to study the influence of the year-to-year variability of phytoplankton dynamics and water temperature on the gonado-somatic growth of the Pacific oyster. Four years with highly contrasted meteorological conditions (river inputs, water temperature and light) 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, were simulated. The years were split into two groups, wet years (2000 and 2001) and dry years (2002 and 2003). Significant variability of the response of oysters to environmental conditions was highlighted between the four scenarios. In the wet years, an increase in loadings of river nutrients and suspended particulate matter led to a shift in the initiation and the magnitude of the phytoplanktonic spring bloom, and consequently to a shift in oyster growth patterns. In contrast. in the dry years, an increase in water temperature-especially during summer-resulted in early spawning. Thus, the gonado-somatic growth pattern of oysters was shown to be sensitive to variations in river loadings and water temperature. In this context. the physiological status of oysters is discussed using a relevant indicator of energy needs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of irrigation on the growth of Scots pines was investigated by comparing trees growing along an open water channel with trees growing under natural conditions. We focussed on the reaction of pines to sudden changes in water availability due to the cessation of irrigation and on the subsequent adaptation of the trees to the changed site conditions. The study area was located in Valais, an inner-alpine dry valley in Switzerland. The investigations covered the responses of diameter growth to climate and irrigation. We particularly concentrated on resin duct (RD) production as a potential indicator of stress.
   Irrigation has a balancing effect on radial growth, with irrigated trees showing lower mean sensitivities, lower standard deviations, lower expressed population signal (EPS) values, and higher first-order autocorrelation for the ring-width chronologies than trees of the dry control sites. Irrigation increased the uniqueness of the single trees' radial growth, the RD production in general decreased, and the proportion of RDs in earlywood increased.
   The relationships between climate and tree-ring width, as well as RD density, were studied using response function analysis. Although radial growth and RD density are highly positively correlated, the climatic responses were very different. Whereas radial growth responds positively to moist springs and cool summers, RD density is stimulated by hot summer temperatures. The variance explained by climate derived from the regression models is higher for RD density than for tree-ring width and underlines the additional information about climate response to be gained from RDs. Irrigation reduced the response of tree growth to climate and the correlations between radial growth and summer temperature changed from negative to positive.
   The cessation of irrigation in 1983 and the resulting sudden reduction in water availability provoked a drastic breakdown of radial growth, but the trees survived. Six years later, the trees seemed to have largely recovered, but the adaptation process was not yet finished, as indicated by the failure of the growth rate to return to levels of the control trees. Although the trees survived the sudden cessation of irrigation, the additional exposure to drought may play an important role as a predisposing factor for plant disease.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to the need for tracking of physical contacts and potential exposure to disease. Traditional contact tracing can be augmented by electronic tools called "electronic contact tracing" or "exposure notification.". Some methods were built to work with smartphones; however, smartphones are not prevalent in some high-contact areas (e.g., schools and nursing homes). We present the design and initial testing of low-cost, highly privacy preserving wearable exposure notification devices. Several devices were constructed based on existing hardware and operated independently of a smartphone. The method (devices and analyses) was not able to reliably use the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) as a proxy for distance between pairs of devices; the accuracy of RSSI as a proxy for distance decreased dramatically outside of the idealized conditions. However, even an imperfect device could be useful for research on how people use and move through spaces. With some improvement, these devices could be used to understand disease spread and human or animal interaction in indoor environments.

AB  - Oral administration of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-d) has been used as an indicator for intestinal permeability in poultry research for several years. Under healthy conditions, tight junctions in the intestinal wall will not allow the 4-6kDa FITC-d to enter the bloodstream. Detection of FITC-d in serum (1-hour post-oral administration of FITC-d) has proven to be a reliable indicator of leaky gut syndrome (increased intestinal inflammation and disruption of tight junctions). Administration of supplementary phytobiotics in feed, particularly products with high beta-carotene levels or other pigments, has resulted in strong serum background fluorescence, which can render this assay unreliable. To account for this increase in background autofluorescence, the FITC-d assay procedure has been modified to accommodate these particular serum samples by including pre-administration serum collection from each treatment group to remove background fluorescence. The modified FITC-d procedure detailed will allow for analysis of intestinal permeability in pigmented serum.

AB  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is widely used as an efficient indicator of vegetation cover. Here we assess the possibility of using NDVI as an indicator of groundwater storage. We used groundwater level (GWL) obtained from in situ groundwater observation wells (n > 15,000) in India in 2005-2013. Good correlation (r > 0.6) is observed between NDVI and GWL in natural vegetation-covered areas, that is, forest lands, shrubs, and grasslands. We apply artificial neural network and support vector machine approaches to investigate the relationship between GWL and NDVI using both of the parameters as input. Artificial neural network- and support vector machine-simulated GWL matches very well with observed GWL, particularly in naturally vegetated areas. Thus, we interpret that NDVI may be used as a suitable indicator of groundwater storage conditions in certain areas where the water table is shallow and the vegetation is natural and where in situ groundwater observations are not available.

AB  - Heat transfer in materials during laser material processing serves as a key indicator to existing phases in the material, which governs the mechanical and chemical properties of the material during service. Without the knowledge of the property and behaviour of a material under service, loss of lives and values may be inevitable. This study presents the numerical modeling of the effect of laser parameters on the nature of phases present on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V alloy via heat transfer phenomenon. COMSOL 5.3a software was used to create a model of Ti-6Al-4V substrate, subjected to laser radiation during laser surface cladding. Boundary conditions were applied to the surfaces of the block samples while temperature distribution was measured with set boundary probes. Isothermal plots revealed that the material heating from the free surface was not sufficient enough to develop a large zone of phase change along the depth of the substrate. This was related to the high cooling rate of laser cladding.

AB  - The differentiation of soil fertility vertically and its territorial distribution on the slopes have a genetic origin. The main aim of the study was to establish a link between the level of effective soil fertility and its biological activity in two dimensions. The degree interaction between the cellulose decomposition activity and the yield of barley on separate layers of the southern Chernozem was established. The erosion catena demonstrates that the cellulose decomposition intensity in non-eroded and moderately eroded soils was determined by the differences in magnitude and variation soil water reserves in individual soil layers. The results showed that the microbiological activity of the soil reflecting the intensity of the transformation process of organic matter and the degree of nutrients availability in the yield is likely to act as the sensitive indicator of hydrothermal conditions. In addition, according to the research results, the effective fertility of individual soil layers both in the vertical dimension and in the topographic gradient was evident.

AB  - This paper introduces a participatory framework for Sustainability Assessment (SA) for urban Integrated Watershed Management (IWM). The framework is applied to the Lihu Lake Basin (Wuxi City), where between 2002 and 2012 an IWM program was implemented, coordinating water environmental management measures with urban planning. The framework for SA introduced in this paper is based on a Multi-Criteria-Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach integrating criteria of environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Local stakeholders were engaged in focus group discussions (FGDs) to validate and weigh criteria and attributes employed in the SA framework. Results of the model application indicate that the programme implemented in the Lihu Basin yielded positive results in enhancing environmental conditions, providing more sustainable avenues of environmental management funding, and fostering economic growth. Despite efforts put forward by local authorities, performance of social indicators was comparatively worse, due to relocation policies, increase in housing prices, and scarce public participation. Results show that decision makers pursued viability, rather than comprehensive sustainability.

AB  - Differential white blood cell counting was performed on blood from the fish species Oreochromis niloticus and was used as an in situ indicator of the species' exposure to contamination. Ten young fish were collected in an area influenced by the discharge of effluents and from a fish farm (control group). The fish were anesthetized and caudal puncture was used to collect the blood. Differential white blood cell counting was performed, as well as the counting of total leukocytes and thrombocytes (in 2000 cells). Physicochemical parameters of the water from both sites were analyzed. The water from the polluted area was found to have high conductivity and low levels of dissolved oxygen, factors that indicate poor environmental quality. Fish collected from the polluted site presented higher percentages of eosinophils and monocytes and fewer thrombocytes because of exposure to pollution and hypoxic conditions. The differential white blood cell count represents a suitable biomarker of environmental health and provides a tool for biomonitoring water quality.

Precipitation of Cu and co-precipitation of Cd in the presence of Cu were noted, being indicative of differences in nominal and actual concentrations of metals. Under these conditions, LC50-96h was determined as 3.53 mg L-1 Cu, 20.1 mg L-1 Cd and 1.36 mg L-1 ( Cu + Cd). Besides the quantitative determinations of total dissolved metals in water, considerations on Cd/Cu interactions in aquatic media were presented, allowing the assessment for metals speciation. Data revealed that alkalinity, hardness, dissolved organic carbon and formation of inorganic complexes reduce metal availabilities, mainly in relation to Cu. In spite of this, the LC50 for Cd was significantly reduced in the presence of Cu, matching environmental realistic values. Based on simulated fate of metals, hardness may impair a reduction of 18 and 2% in metal activities, respectively to Cu and Cd.

AB  - Characterizing phosphates in animal fecal and manure samples is of interest to environmental-monitoring research efforts. Acid extraction removes relatively mobile phosphates from samples, offering a better indicator of the mobility of phosphates in environment, but acidic extracts impose challenges to the solution phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (P-31 NMR) spectroscopy, which is commonly used for analyzing phosphates in environmental samples. Acid-extractable metals precipitate phosphates in the alkaline condition under which solution P-31 NMR experiment runs, blurring the spectrum for adequate analysis. We found that neutralizing acid extracts with 0.5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) plus 50 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) before freeze drying eliminated the chemical interferences otherwise observed. The resulting P-31 NMR spectra can be used to quantify acid-soluble phytate and other phosphates in animal fecal and manure samples. The improvement in detection will support efforts to investigate the mobility of phosphates in feces and manures used as land amendments.

AB  - Marine fish farms could cause environmental disturbances on the sediment due to uneaten food and fish faeces that impact the marine benthos. Polychaete assemblages are considered good indicators of environmental perturbations. The present study aimed to establish groups of polychaetes as potential indicators of fish farm pollution. This study was carried out in ten fish farms along the Spanish coast. Changes in polychaete assemblage were analyzed with meta-analysis and multivariate techniques. Abundance, richness and diversity showed significant decreases under fish farm conditions. Distribution patterns of polychaetes responded to combinations of physicochemical variables. The main ones are sulfide concentration, silt and clays percentage, and stable nitrogen isotope ratio. The results showed that some families are tolerant, Capitellidae, Dorvilleidae, Glyceridae, Nereididae, Oweniidae and Spionidae; while others are sensitive to fish farm pollution, Magelonidae, Maldanidae, Nephtyidae, Onuphidae, Paralacydoniidae, Paraonide, Sabellidae and also Cirratulidae in spite of being reported as a tolerant family.

AB  - Foliar chlorophylls are the most important pigments related to the physiological function of plants. Quantitative estimation of chlorophyll content can provide important information about relationships between plants and their environmental conditions. In this study, in order to enhance spectral resistance to noise, new spectral indices were designed using the area of the spectral curve and axis, specifically the area around the red edge (Rdaa), instead of the sum of the first derivative of the spectrum, specifically the area of red edge (Rda). Meanwhile, three reference indices were also introduced as non-sensitive bands of chlorophylls. The results showed that by dividing spectral reference, a kind of re-projection, the spectral indices can be calibrated to allow direct and reasonable comparisons of results. The sensitivity of these reference indices to chlorophylls were also evaluated in this study. The regression results show that Rdaa and its derivates are highly related to chlorophylls and resistant to noise.

AB  - Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, located in the Rio de Janeiro City, receives several types of polluted discharges. The knowledge of the sediment microfauna correlated with heavy metal and organic matter concentrations could supply important data about the conditions of the lagoon. The benthic foraminiferal assemblage presented larger diversity and more abundant samples in the lagoon entrance than in the inner area. The Ammonia tepida - Elphidium excavatum foraminiferal assemblage is characterized by dwarf, corroded and weak organisms. Agglutinated species were found only near the entrance. Low abundance values and sterility of five samples in the inner area (north/northeast) can be caused by high levels of heavy metals and organic matter. A. tepida shows negative correlation with increasing heavy metals values. PAHs and coprostanol high indexes, and the absence or low presence of microfauna in samples around the lagoon margin confirm illegal flows from gas stations and domestic sewage.

AB  - An organic-inorganic composite, poly-o-anisidine Sn(IV) phosphate, was chemically synthesized by mixing ortho-anisidine into gels of Sn( IV) phosphate with different mixing volume ratios. Studies on the effect of eluant concentration, elution behavior and separation of metal ions were carried out to understand the ion-exchange capabilities. Due to Cd(II) selective nature of composite, revealed by distribution studies, Cd( II) ion selective membrane electrode was fabricated. The analytical utility of the electrode was established by employing it as an indicator electrode in electrometric titrations having fast response time, 3-5s, and long life span of six months. Some physical parameters like self-diffusion coefficient (D(0)), activation energy (E(a)) and entropy of activation (Delta S(0)) have been evaluated under conditions favoring a particle diffusion-controlled mechanism by studying ion-exchange kinetics.

AB  - Livestock remains the world's largest user of land and is strongly related to grassland and feed-crop production. Assessments of environmental impacts of livestock farming require detailed knowledge of the presence of livestock, farming practices, and environmental conditions. The present Europe-wide livestock distribution information is generally restricted to a spatial resolution of NUTS 2 ( province level). This paper presents a modelling approach to determine the spatial distribution of livestock at the landscape level. Location factors for livestock occurrence were explored and applied to consistent and harmonized EU-wide regional statistics to produce a detailed spatial distribution of livestock numbers. Both an expert-based and an empirical approach were applied in order to disaggregate the data to grid level. The resulting livestock maps were validated. Results differ between the two downscaling approaches but also between livestock types and countries. While both the expert-based and empirical approach are equally suited to modelling herbivores, in general, the spatial distribution of monogastrics can be better modelled by applying the empirical approach.

AB  - Chemical plants, storage houses, transportation, these are some of the most potential sites for accidental release of dangerous materials into the surroundings. After releasing such gas, it will disperse in air. Air quality models predict the transport and the turbulent dispersion of gases or aerosols after they are released into the atmosphere. The Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) approach has been taken that natural account for dispersion process in urban areas.
   This paper provides a comparison of the results obtained by the FLADIS field experiments and the results of CFD modelling by Fluent 6.2. FLADIS experiments were carried out by the Riso National Laboratory. Experimental trials were done with pressure liquefied ammonia. Meteorological conditions and source strength were determined from the experimental data and simulated using the CFD approach. The initial two-phase flow of the released ammonia was also included. The liquid phase was modelled as droplets using discrete particle modelling, i.e. Euler-Lagrangian approach for continuous and discrete phases. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is now a substantial body of literature documenting the detectability of plants and animals under standard survey conditions. Despite the evidence that many flora and fauna species have detection probabilities of less than one, it is still the default assumption of most environmental impact assessment processes that if a species is present, it will be detected. Here we briefly review a number of existing studies that have estimated the survey effort necessary to detect animal species, based on what is known about their detection rates in standard surveys. We then propose a novel method, based on failure-time analysis, for quantifying the detectability of and determining appropriate survey effort for plant species during flora surveys. We provide computer code for implementing the method in the Bayesian freeware WinBUGS. Methods for estimating detectability can be used to inform minimum survey requirements and have important applications in environmental impact assessment and monitoring.

AB  - The U.S. Environmental Protections Agency's (U.S. EPA) Regional Vulnerability Assessment (ReVA) program has focused much of its research over the last five years on developing and evaluating integration methods for spatial data. An initial strategic priority was to use existing data from monitoring programs, model results, and other spatial data. Because most of these data were not collected with an intention of integrating into a regional assessment of conditions and vulnerabilities, issues exist that may preclude the use of some methods or require some sort of data preparation. Additionally, to Support Multi-criteria decision-making, methods need to be able to address a series of assessment questions that provide insights into where environmental risks are a priority. This paper provides an overview of twelve spatial integration methods that can be applied towards regional assessment, along with preliminary results as to how sensitive each method is to data issues that will likely be encountered with the use of existing data.

AB  - Seed size and shape, measured as the variance of the three main dimensions, have been proposed as good indicators for predicting seed persistence. We tested whether these variables were robust predictors of seed persistence in the soil for 58 abundant herbaceous species, primarily annuals, in grass and scrubland of central Spain. Seed persistence was estimated from data on germinable seed banks, while seed weight and shape were measured using fresh seeds collected in the study area. There was a significant tendency for species with persistent seeds to have smaller seeds than species with transient seeds. Seed shape was not, however, related to persistence and we did not find any clear seed weight/shape threshold for predicting persistence. The binary logistic model of seed bank type as a function of seed weight was significant and explained 67% of total variability. Supplementary information about dormancy, environmental conditions of habitat, predation and attack by pathogens has to be used to elaborate more accurate general predictive models of seed persistence.

AB  - We measured antlers of 484 red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) aged between 1.5 and 13.5 years, from Sierra Morena (Southeast Spain) between 1992 and 1998. We determined the effect of year of birth, season of hunting, age group and farm size on the number of tips, the length, the width and the quality of the antlers. The number of harvested animals, an indicator of population density, was included as a covariable. Highest antler quality is obtained in animals at least seven years old. The lowest quality animals were obtained during the hunting season from October 1995 to February 1996, which coincided with the end of an extended period of drought. The best trophies were harvested during the 1996-1997 season, the period of highest rainfall during the study. Thus environmental conditions have a major influence on antler size. However, animal density had a strong negative effect on certain types of farms, emphasizing the importance of population management.

AB  - Coastal sand dunes are affected by seasonal fluctuations in salinity due to seawater spray and precipitation. Salinity was found to be very high in summer soil samples and was about 15-20 times lower in the preceding rainy winter. High microbial biomass values of 234.6 and 173.1 mu gC g(-1) dry soil were found under Artemisia monosperma and Retama raetam, respectively, even at elevated salinity. The metabolic quotient for CO2, which may serve as an indicator for changes in microbial diversity or environmental stress, was unexpectedly high (58.5 and 48.8 mu g mg(-1) d(-1) under A. monosperma and R. raetam, respectively) in low-saline samples from the winter when compared to the summer (a maximal value of 20 mu g mg(-1) d(-1)), probably indicating a shift in community structure. It may be concluded that even under hostile conditions in poor sandy soils and with high salinity the presence of perennial shrubs creates favorable niches for microorganisms and affects their activity.

AB  - Probable in-situ manganese deposits larger than 1 cm in diameter buried in ODP/DSDP cores were selected for study after examining previous descriptions of the manganese deposits in site reports and the ODP data base. Most of the selected samples from 11 cores occur at or just above sedimentary hiatuses or in slowly deposited sediments and are overlain by rapidly deposited sediments of biogenic, terrigenous or volcanogenic origin. The changes in sedimentation recorded in the lithostratigraphic sections around these deposits are closely related to changes in tectonic evolution, deep water circulation or biological productivity at the sites.
   The similarity in composition and structure of the buried deposits to those of the modern manganese nodules and crusts with no evidence of post-depositional change suggest that buried manganese deposits may be used as indicators of past sedimentary conditions during which they formed. Their major components are hydrogenetic and early-diagenetic manganese minerals as well as detrital minerals. The characteristics of these manganese deposits suggests that similar processes of deposition have taken place since the Paleogene or older.

AB  - Urbanization and modernization of services in the world triggers decrement in the physical activities of citizens. The most common solution for this decrement is improving walking capacity in neighborhoods to engage the citizens in walking activity. In this research, a novel model is presented to quantify walkability based on several necessary criteria and indicators considering the physical and non-physical conditions. For this model, promising sciences, including GIS, RS, and MCDM, are utilized to compute indicators and aggregate them in the form of a spatial index in a central region of Tehran, Iran, at the neighborhood scale. For evaluating the result, the obtained walkability level is compared to the physical structure of neighborhoods, previous works, housing price along with some other socio-economic parameters, and municipal action plan in the neighborhoods. These evaluations show that the outcome of the proposed model is a robust tool for walkability planning.

AB  - Use of low-quality water for supplemental irrigation is expected to become soon a common practice in the Mediterranean area, where durum wheat is the main cultivated cereal. Breeding for salt stress tolerance may contribute to the improvement of wheat resilience to irrigation with brackish water. Various traits can be considered as indicators of salt stress tolerance, which include agronomical and physiological criteria. However, the complexity of salinity tolerance mechanisms, the G x E interaction and the lack of correlation between controlled and open field conditions causes uncertainty in the selection process. The present review highlights the main advantages and limitations of different agronomical and physiological traits used in screening for salt stress tolerance in wheat. Special focus is given to carbon and nitrogen isotope discrimination, that remains a bottleneck in breeding for salt stress tolerance. The use of different statistical tools to analyse data related to salt stress tolerance is also discussed in this review.

AB  - Microbiological quality of an indoor air is one of the indicators of proper hygienic conditions in a health care hospital. This study intends to assess the bacteriological profile of an indoor air by settle plate method. About 100 air samples were collected from various locations in the hospital by using 5% Sheep blood agar and Sabouraud dextrose agarculture plates. Frequent isolation of common aerobic bacterial flora like Staphylococcus aureus (27.72%) followed by Diptheroids (24.75%), Bacillus spp. (24.09%), Micrococcus (23.43%) were observed. Among fungal isolates Aspergillus niger (25.00%) were more prevalent followed by Zygomyces (23.07%), Fusarium spp. (21.15%), Aspergillus flavus (17.30%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (13.46%) in the hospital environment. Most of the isolates identified were a part of the normal aerobic microbial flora; however, a minimum degree of bacterial and fungal load were observed in the casualty and in the wards due to the constant patient traffic and unrestricted access to patients.

KW  - Jiamusi City
AB  - The weight parameter plays an important role in groundwater quality assessment. Importance scale weighting model (ISWM) and entropy weighting model (EWM) are the most common weighing models in conventional literatures. However, ISWM is significantly by the experts' subjective cognitions, which makes it difficult to generate a unique weight parameter and water quality index (WQI). EWM often neglects the indicator with a serious pollution condition, which makes the assessment result overoptimistic. To solve this problem, this study designs a new health risk weighting model (HRWM). For the pollutant with a higher health risk, a larger weight is assigned; and vice versa. And then, HRWM is applied into the groundwater quality evaluation of Jiamusi City as an illustration. The result shows that HRWM keeps the uniqueness of the weight parameter and the final WQI result, and avoids the overoptimistic phenomenon in assessment result. The groundwater quality of Jiamusi City is under a medium degree of threat or impairment. To further improve the groundwater quality, the environmental managers should adopt more measures to decrease the manganese in the water resources area.

AB  - Nerium oleander is a perennial shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean basin and Southeast Asia. As an ornamental plant grown in pots, it reaches heights of 1-2 m, with the appearance of a bushy shrub, with fragrant flowers, simple or double, colourful, blooming from spring until the end of autumn. With a very large adaptive potential, the species is one of the most popular in floral plants, as an indoor plant and where the climate allows, it can be grown on terraces and balconies, in hedges, alignments etc. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of treatments with various rhizogenic biostimulators on the rooting potential of different types of Nerium oleander cuttings in greenhouse conditions. The experiment was performed in the HORTINVEST greenhouses of the USAMV Bucharest and there were determined the rooting percentage, the development of the root system and the aerial part, as well as some physiological indicators: photosynthesis, transpiration and stomatal conductance.

AB  - This work aims to evaluate the degree of sediment contamination and the response of Testate amoebae populations through a sediment core taken from the Salto Grande Reservoir (RSG), situated in Americana, in Sao Paulo State (SP), Brazil. It is based on the analysis of the trace elements geochemistry (by ICP-OES) and Testate amoebae data (by stereomicroscopic morphometric analysis). The indices of homogeneity and richness (Simpson 1-D and Margalef) were calculated. Sediment contamination was evaluated according to VGQS (TEL and PEL). The results evidenced that the sediments of Facies 3 are highly contaminated since the beginning of RSG filling. Contamination caused significant decline of Testate amoebae populations dimension and diversity. In sedimentary facies with lower concentrations of trace elements diversity and size of Testate amoebae populations are higher and are composed of different species. The results of this work indicate that Testate amoebae populations showed differentiated responses to different environmental conditions. So, these amoeboid protists can be considered good indicators of pollution caused by trace elements in fresh water aquatic environments.

AB  - Yemen is the least advanced country among Middle Eastern countries in sewage reuse and safety control. The current sewage effluent quality in Yemen is generally poor as none of the existing sewage treatment plants produces effluents that comply with the effluent quality regulations. There is no plan to build tertiary treatment systems. However, the oxidation and stabilization ponds are considered most appropriate for the warm climate conditions in the country. Sewage effluents and biosolids generated from these ponds are used extensively for agricultural purposes. This review discusses the potential use of solar disinfection (SODIS) and lime treatment for the reduction of pathogens in sewage effluents and biosolids before reuse. SODIS and lime treatment are natural processes, simple, easily implemented, produce non-toxic by-products and are low cost. The merits of these processes are enormous, and they are suitable for application in developing countries such as Yemen.

AB  - Drawing from the lessons learnt from the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, the assessment of subsurface environmental hazard around nuclear power plants has emerged as a critical task. Consequently, aiming to better understand the possible environmental impact of radiation leaks into the groundwater, a prescreening programme was initiated in 2011 by the Taiwanese government. As part of this programme, this study conducted various borehole prospecting techniques to identify in situ hydrogeological characteristics at Chin-Shan Nuclear Power Plant. Borehole electrical log, sonic log and temperature/conductivity log were conducted to explain the regional lithologic conditions and permeability of the formation. In conjunction with this, the interwell tracer and pumping test was carried out to simultaneously determine the hydraulic parameters. In our opinion, the implementation of such in situ end-to-end investigations is essential in interpreting in situ fluid and solute transport dynamics prior to programming any numerical scheme for early warning, vulnerability assessment and regular monitoring of a nuclear power plant site.

AB  - The article discusses an improvement of a previously developed method for assessment of ion leakage from plant tissues as a gauge of membrane and cell wall performance under stressful environment. It employs conductometric measurements of the ion efflux from leaves and their quantitative interpretation by a theoretical model based on the laws of diffusion. Experimental data are readily fit with the model and results are in accordance with relative water content of dehydrated barley (Hordeum vulgare) seedlings of two distinct cultivars. Some new parameters obtained from fitting are proposed as reliable indicators of the leaf status. They appear to be helpful in further distinguishing the behavior of two separate cellular structures with respect to their electrolyte permeability. It is concluded that the established method based on the kinetics of ion leakage is adequate for evaluation of contrasting genotypes under normal and stress conditions. Furthermore, it could be used as a simple and powerful tool for routine analysis and screening for drought tolerance in crops.

AB  - This study was designed as the first to assess the trace metal (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn) in coral skeleton in relation to metal availabilities and sampling locations in Sabah. The study also aims to determine the differential abilities of Scleractinian coral species as a bioindicator of environmental conditions. Skeletons of Scleractinian coral (Hydnophora microconos, Favia speciosa and Porites lobata) showed concentrations of Fe, Mn and Ni relatively higher than Cd and Zn in the skeletons. Statistical analyses outputs showed significant relationships between trace metal concentrations in coral species and those in seawater and sediment. The highest bioaccumulation factors among three Scleractinian coral species investigated was for Zn followed by Mn, Ni, Fe, Cd and Cu can provide a sign about pollution levels. However, metal tolerance, coral structure and morphology as well as multispecies monitoring are factors that need to be a focus in future studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Maxillary and frontal sinusitis, cribra orbitalia and linear enamel hypoplasia were recorded as indicators of nutritional and environmentally related stress in an Early Iron Age (0260 AD) population from Sweden. The material comprised the skeletal remains of 99 adults and 45 subadults (aged 20 years and under). Maxillary sinusitis and cribra orbitalia were recorded in the majority of subadults and adults. In contrast, linear enamel hypoplasia was uncommon and occurred mainly in the subadults. In seven cases (12.7%) there was a clear co-occurrence of periapical lesions and maxillary sinusitis. A significant co-occurrence of maxillary sinusitis and frontal sinusitis was found in the adults. The least common combination in sex-determined adults was cribra orbitalia and enamel hypoplasia, only 7.7% exhibiting both lesions. The significantly higher incidence of this combination among subadults suggests an association with life-threatening conditions. Overall, the results showed that the Early Iron Age community studied suffered foremost from upper respiratory diseases. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Systematic research has shown that the state of librarian and archival collections depends on the quality of storage conditions. Therefore, it was interesting to learn about the long-term effect of the indoor air pollution on the collection of the National Library in Warsaw (Poland). Information about deposition of inorganic pollutants on paper was collected for indicators, which had been stored for 12 years (1990-2002) in the selected storage rooms of the Krasraski Palace (Warsaw, Poland). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to study the change of the indicator's elemental composition after the long-term exposition to the librarian indoor environment; all indicators were examined with respect to the possible deposition of metals. Bulk concentration of selected elements in the paper indicators were determined by ICP-MS after microwave digestion of the samples, whereas LA-ICP-MS was used to evaluate deposition of selected elements at the surface and possible migration into sub-surface domains of paper indicators.

AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) concentrations have increased over the years, increasing P losses to surface waters. Phosphorus saturation ratios (PSR), used as environmental soil tests, have different relationships with conventional water-soluble-P (WSP) determinations for dairy and poultry-manure-amended soils. Objective was to develop a WSP procedure to characterize P leaching from manure-amended soils. Soil samples were collected from dairy and poultry sites. WSP was determined using 1:10 and 5:1 soil-water ratios. Soils in columns were leached using unsaturated flow. Results showed that relationships between PSR and WSP 5:1 were consistent for all soils. The 5:1 ratio, closer to field moisture conditions, could be a good indicator of P leaching. There was good correlation between the WSP 1:10, 5:1, and column leachate, and a paired t test showed no difference between the last two. Thus, a single 5:1 extraction could be as useful in P leaching assessments as laborious column studies.

AB  - Optical imaging of reporter molecules such as firefly luciferase has become a popular method of tracking and visualizing cells in living animals. Many biological processes involve ubiquitin ligases, which target specific proteins for destruction under specific sets of conditions. Importantly, the motifs recognized by different ubiquitin ligases are often modular and can be used to target foreign proteins for destruction in cis. We recently fused the Cdk inhibitor p27, which is polyubiquitylated by a Skp2-containing ubiquitin ligase if phosphorylated by cdk2 to firefly luciferase. The resulting fusion protein, p27-Luc, was induced by cdk2 inhibitors in living cells grown in culture or in nude mice. This article describes protocols for validation of p27-Luc in cell culture using siRNA against cdk2 (or its partner cyclin A) and for imaging cells producing p27-Luc grown in transparent hollow fibers after treatment with cdk2 inhibitory drugs in vivo. These approaches should be generalizable to other ubiquitin-ligase substrate pairs.

AB  - In order to achieve improved sustainability, local authorities need to use tools that adequately describe and synthesize environmental information. This article illustrates a methodological approach that organizes a wide suite of environmental indicators into few aggregated indices, making use of correlation, principal component analysis, and fuzzy sets. Furthermore, a weighting system, which includes stakeholders' priorities and ambitions, is applied. As a case study, the described methodology is applied to the Reggio Emilia Province in Italy, by considering environmental information from 45 municipalities. Principal component analysis is used to condense an initial set of 19 indicators into 6 fundamental dimensions that highlight patterns of environmental conditions at the provincial scale. These dimensions are further aggregated in two indices of environmental performance through fuzzy sets. The simple form of these indices makes them particularly suitable for public communication, as they condensate a wide set of heterogeneous indicators. The main outcomes of the analysis and the potential applications of the method are discussed.

AB  - Millions of tons of hazardous spent sulfuric acid and lime mud from water treatment facilities are produced per year. A green approach for the synthetic gypsum and anhydrite derived from such industrial wastes was proposed. It was found that direct structural controlled synthesis of anhydrite can be performed at usual conditions for synthesis of gypsum: 55 degrees C and atmospheric pressure. High-quality gypsum can be obtained at room temperature. The results obtained were confirmed by XRD, SEM, TEM, DTA, thermochemical and thermodynamics calculations. It was shown by a number of indicators that such approach is advantageous from technological, environmental and economic point of view. The filtrate formed during the synthesis contains sulfur, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium and can be used as a complex fertilizer. The results of bioindication when growing oil radish showed a double increase in the length of the main root when using a neutralized filtrate.

AB  - Freshwater biodiversity loss exceeds that in terrestrial systems; fishes are a predominant indicator of this catastrophe. Current worldwide estimates of freshwater fish species threatened with extinction are about 30%. We discuss why standard monitoring of the status of most fishes is inadequate to keep up with declines. Rapid population declines and shrinking freshwater fish distributions result in shifting baselines that make it challenging to evaluate conservation status reliably and promptly and effectively address further decreases. We present the California Method for Status Evaluation of Fishes as an alternative to existing methods for assessing the regional status of freshwater fishes. This method uses local expertise to score metrics and generates a fish status rating to inform short-term management decisions. This approach applies to Distinct Population Segments, subspecies, species, and entire regional fish faunas and is adaptable to local, changing environmental conditions. Using this method, we update the freshwater status scores for 131 native California fish species, a fauna in rapid decline.

AB  - The reality of climate change is accepted by the vast majority of the scientific community (IPCC, 2014). Among human activities, agriculture - especially viticulture - is highly dependent on climatic conditions during the growing season. This paper aims to address a complex study on the evolution / trend of the main annual climate indicators and during the vegetation period (air temperature, precipitation, insolation, air hygroscopicity) and climate indicators with synthetic character (Ihr, CH, Ibcv, IAOe) in the viticultural area of Odobesti vineyard. The climatic data analyzed in this study were recorded at the weather station of R.S.V.O. Odobesti, in the period 1946-2020, during 75 years. The analysis of the recorded data highlighted clear trends in the evolution of climatic factors in the Odobesti wine ecosystem, which certifies the reality of phenomena specific to climate change, with a direct impact on the vegetative and productive potential of vineyards. There is an increase in the annual and average values of the analyzed climatic indicators and an increasing frequency of extreme climatic phenomena.

AB  - The energy consumption of conventional HVAC systems in cold climates is strongly influenced by the ventilation thermal loads required to keep adequate levels of indoor air quality. The improvement of the energy efficiency of such systems may be achieved using heat recovery systems consisting of heat exchangers used to heat cold outdoor air using as heat source hot discharge air. Today, heat recovery systems are mostly made of metallic materials, namely aluminium alloys. The present paper assesses the technical viability of an alternative concept using polymeric materials. A set of functional requirements have been defined taking into account the operating conditions of the heat recovery system in order to select a polymer that is considered an alternative to the current metals. Polystyrene was the polymer selected. It is also reported a cradle to grave life cycle assessment for polystyrene and aluminium establishing a comparative analysis of environmental impact between both. The indicators considered are: emission of greenhouse gases and energy consumed. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We recently hypothesized that a mixture of low-dosed dioxin, polychlorobiphenyl, phthalate and bisphenol may induce estrogeno-mimetic activities in a model of lifelong-exposed female mice. Herein, we evaluated the impact of this mixture in estrogen deficiency conditions. Based on the protective effects of estrogens against metabolic disorders, we reasoned that exposure to pollutants should attenuate the deleterious metabolic effects induced by ovariectomy. In line with the hypothesis, exposure to pollutants was found to reduce the impact of ovariectomy on glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, to enhance the expression levels of the hepatic estrogen receptor a and to attenuate the ovariectomy-induced enhancement of the chemokine MCP-1/CCL2 considered as an indicator of estrogen signalling. Because of the very low, doses of pollutants used in mixture, these findings may have strong implications in terms of understanding the potential role of environmental contaminants in the development of metabolic diseases, specifically in females during menopausal transition.

AB  - How can the physical environment, especially light, facilitate conflict resolution? Previous research has led to no clear answers about optimal lighting conditions in conflict situations and, until now, potential moderators and mediators have been scarcely investigated. Building on research on light-induced cooperativeness, we expected that self-oriented individuals would be influenced by the lighting in social situations such as conflict resolution. In self-oriented individuals, dim warm light should promote interdependent self-construal and, in turn, lead to a preference for collaborative conflict resolution strategies. Two studies confirmed our assumptions, with social dominance orientation and trait interdependent self-construal serving as indicators of individuals' social orientation. Overall, these results provide an explanation for inconsistent previous findings and contribute to the understanding of light-induced changes in social behavior. Limitations as well as practical implications for lighting design in social spaces are discussed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pollen viability is an important component of reproductive success, with inviable pollen causing failure of reproduction. Pollen grains have evolved mechanisms to avoid negative impacts of adverse environmental conditions on viability, including the ability to sustain ionizing radiation and repair DNA. We assessed the viability of 109,000 pollen grains representing 675 pollen samples from 111 species of plants in Chernobyl across radiation gradients that spanned three orders of magnitude. We found a statistically significant but small and negative main effect of radiation on pollen viability rates across species (Pearson's r = 0.20). Ploidy level and the number of nucleate cells (two vs. three) were the only variables that influenced the strength of the effect of radiation on pollen viability, as reflected by significant interactions between these two variables and background radiation, while there were no significant effects of genome size, pollen aperture type, life cycle duration, or pollination agent on the strength of the effect of radiation on pollen viability.

AB  - Lake Nussbaumersee, located SW of Lake Constance (Switzerland/Germany), was studied at high temporal resolution for non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) within a calcareous gyttja sediment core from the deepest part of the lake. At the Nussbaumersee lakeshore, three pile-dwelling settlements have been excavated and dendrochronologically dated (to the Neolithic, 3840-3695 BC; late Early Bronze Age, 1580-1538 BC; and Late Bronze Age, 850-780 BC). The NPP study revealed three peaks of cyanobacteria, likely related to three settlement phases causing phosphate eutrophication of the lake water. The fast decline in cyanobacteria and reduction in green algae blooms after the abandonment of the Neolithic village and the quick recovery of the lake water back to oligotrophic conditions indicate a high prehistoric resilience of the lake ecosystem. After the second eutrophication phase starting around 2500 BC, the density of NPP eutrophication indicators remained at much higher levels, probably showing a loss of resilience of the lake ecosystem due to repeated human disturbance.

AB  - The effect of adding various rice straw composts on the rhizosphere soil microorganisms, some physicochemical properties, plant growth and nutrient uptake as well as plant parasitic root-knot nematode was evaluated. All the five types of compost showed a high fertilizer value when applied at the rate of 5% (w/w) as indicated by ameliorating the soil microbial population, chemical properties, plant growth response and subsequently the productivity of sandy soil comparing to the mineral fertilizer. Increasing compost application rate resulted in parallel significant enhancement. Addition of composts at 5% in mishmash with half dose of mineral fertilizer significantly improved all the tested criteria. Composts at rates of 5, 7.5% resulted in reducing root-knot nematode population by 79, 84%, respectively and actualized prodigious depletion in egg production. The most prominent composts which surpassed all treatments including the mineral fertilizer were those contained vinasse.

AB  - Twenty wheat varieties were analyzed to assess the contribution of 40-year breeding process to the advancement of wheat technological quality. A trial using a randomized block design with three replications was carried out during five growing seasons (2001-2005) that varied in temperature and rainfall conditions. Changes of quality were analyzed in the varieties from different breeding periods using linear regression analysis. Changes of quality indicators were expressed by regression coefficients. The studied varieties were released at 3-4-year intervals. The annual changes in genetic potentials were as follows: protein content - -0.03%, wet gluten - -0.14%, farinograph absorption -0.04%, dough energy - 1.53 cm(2), loaf volume 2.94 ml, and baking score - 0.07. The decreases in the protein and wet gluten contents were compensated for by an improvement in protein quality. The increase in gluten structure stability and appropriate combinations of high molecular weight glutenin subunits have contributed to the improvement of other quality indicators.

AB  - In this article, I draw lessons from two quasi-natural experiments (the transition process in former Communist countries and the rapid globalization of food chains) on the optimality of farms and agricultural structures more generally. I argue that (a) the farm structures that have emerged from the transition process are much more diverse than expected ex ante; (b) this diversity is to an important extent determined by economic mechanisms which are influenced by initial conditions and reform policies; (c) non-traditional farm structures have played an important role during transition because they were optimal to address the specific institutional and structural constraints imposed by the transition process; (d) there is more diversity than often argued in the farms that are integrated in global food chains; (e) endogenous institutional (contracting) innovations in food chains may lock existing farm structures in a long-run institutional framework; and (f) indicators based on farm structures are not a good measure of welfare effects of the globalization of food chains.

AB  - Most legumes establish mutualistic symbiotic relationships with atmospheric nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia), giving origin to nodules. Nodules exhibit natural or induced aging which coincides with the drop in nitrogenase activity at the flowering period or at the pod filling stage. In this research, the onset of nodule senescence (NS) was evaluated under greenhouse conditions in five common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars of two growth habits, determined (Type 1) and indeterminate (Type III), inoculated with Rhizobium etli CE-3. Weekly destructive samplings were taken to determine nitrogen fixation by the acetylene reduction assay, the number and fresh weight of nodules, as well as root and above ground biomass dry weight. It was found that NS in bean appears to be independent of host plant phenological stage (flowering or pod filling), the longer period the symbiotic system is fixing nitrogen the greater yield is obtained, and that the nodules number and fresh weight are reliable indicators of the nitrogen fixation capacity.

AB  - Peracarids (Crustacea: Peracarida) are an important component of soft-sediment faunas and are considered good indicators of quality of water and sediments. Nevertheless, little is known about diversity of peracarid crustaceans on the shallow subtidal sediments of Playa America, a sandy beach in the Ensenada de Baiona (Galicia, NW Spain). Therefore, the peracarid fauna of its shallow subtidal zone was studied in a fine-sand site at 4-m depth from February 1996 to February 1997. Monthly sampling yielded a total of 4753 individuals belonging to 60 species. Amphipods were dominant in number of individuals and species followed by cumaceans. The assemblage showed a stable composition in species through the year and was numerically dominated by a few species, namely the amphipods Siphonoecetes kroyeranus and Microprotopus maculatus and the cumacean Pseudocuma longicorne. These species showed large monthly fluctuations in abundance, with maximal values between summer and autumn.

AB  - The aim of our work between 2005 and 2007 was to obtain and to test various microbial bio-products with bio-stimulation / bio-fertilization activity, in order to implement them in the agricultural technologies. Bacterial biomass obtained from Bacillus subtilis strains, Azotobacter chroococcum strains and Rhizobium phaseoli strains as well as fungus biomass from Trichoderma SPA strains were conditioned and applied to the bean crop on red preluvosol soil.
   The characterization of these bio-products wouldn't be complete without the analysis of the influence of them on the biological activity of the soil, evaluated through the modular indicators (IPAV% and IPAE %) and synthetic indicators (ISB %) of the soil fertility.
   The bio-products which emphasize the best soil stimulation activity were: Rhizobium phaseoli and the mix Bacillus sp. 1 + Bacillus sp. 2 + Trichoderma sp. Thus, the application of the bio-products increased the biological activity of the red preluvosol soil, using ISB% indicator, with 8, 6% -34,98%.

AB  - This paper gives a modem circumscription of Tropical/Subtropical diatoms regarding their relationship with sea-surface temperatures (SST) and sea ice cover. Diatoms from 228 core-top sediment samples collected from the Southern Ocean were studied to determine the geographic distribution of eight major diatom species/taxa preserved in surface sediments generally located north of the Subantarctic Front. The comparison of the relative contribution of diatom species with modem February SST and sea-ice cover reveals species-specific sedimentary distributions regulated both by water temperatures and sea ice conditions. Although selective preservation might have played some role, their presence in surface and downcore sediments from the Southern Ocean are reliable indicators of high SST and poleward transport of waters from the Tropical/Subtropical Atlantic. Our work supports the use of diatom remains to reconstruct past variations of these environmental parameters via qualitative and transfer function approaches. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Stable oxygen and carbon isotope data from a lacustrine sequence at Graenge, southeast Denmark, revealed distinct environmental changes related to Late Weichselian climatic development in the region. Comparison of isotopic records obtained from sedimentary carbonates and freshwater molluscs enabled reconstruction of changes in the lacustrine environment. The degree of thermal and chemical stratification of the lake was evaluated and supported by pollen data from an earlier study of the site. During the Allerod interstadial, dimictic and stagnant conditions characterized the lake, whereas the stratification was disturbed during the Younger Dryas stadial probably as a result of deforestation and increased wind impact. The origin of sedimentary carbonates was examined by mineralogic and morphologic studies. A considerable input of clastics and detrital carbonates, associated with pronounced enrichment of O-18 and C-13, was recorded in the Younger Dryas sediments indicating soil degradation and increased erosion. A climatic warming preceding the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary is clearly reflected in the different stable isotope records and in the lithostratigraphy.

AB  - In monogamous species the amount and quality of male parental care may be essential for females since fitness depends on number and quality of offspring. Degree of male ornamentation may be used by females as an indicator of paternal effort and thus may be an important factor in mate choice situations. This was tested by observing feeding rates of yellowhammers, a species showing considerable colour variation. Male and female feeding rates were inter-correlated and were both negatively correlated with male coloration. Relative male feeding rate was not correlated with male colour. In spite of a low feeding rate by more highly coloured older males, no effect was found on nestling condition, indicating compensation by high quality food or bigger load per nest visit. Nevertheless, coloration was positively related to the number of fledged young for old males and so may indicate parental quality. These results suggest that older and generally more colourful males may be more experienced and of higher quality and so may be preferred by females.

AB  - Hyaluronan (HA) is an essential carbohydrate in vertebrates that is a potentially robust bioindicator due to its critical roles in diverse physiological functions in health and disease. The intricate size-dependent function that exists for HA and its low abundance in most biological fluids have highlighted the need for sensitive technologies to provide accurate and quantitative assessments of polysaccharide molecular weight and concentration. We have demonstrated that solid state (SS-) nanopore technology can be exploited for this purpose, given its molecular sensitivity and analytical capacity, but there remains a need to further understand the impacts of experimental variables on the SS-nanopore signal for optimal interpretation of results. Here, we use model quasi-monodisperse HA polymers to determine the dependence of HA signal characteristics on a range of SS-nanopore measurement conditions, including applied voltage, pore diameter, and ionic buffer asymmetry. Our results identify important factors for improving the signal-to-noise ratio, resolution, and sensitivity of HA analysis with SS-nanopores.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment. They are essential bioindicators for coastal and oceanic environment variations. It is imperative to study the thanatocoenosis of benthic foraminifera since they reflect environmental conditions. This study presents the structure, distribution, abundance, and taphonomy features of benthic foraminifera located along the San Luis Gonzaga Bay subtidal zone in the northwestern part of the Gulf of California, Me ' xico. We conducted four survey campaigns from 2018 to 2019 to obtain superficial sediment samples. At least 300 individuals were collected from each sample to be identified according to their taxonomy. Our results show that the genera Cribroelphidium, Nonionella, Bulimina, and Bucella were the most abundant specimens, representing 66% of the total sampling. Agglutinated forms were represented by three genera (less than 1% of the whole data). We expect that the variation in taphonomy community structures of benthic foraminifera in the study area may provide a baseline reference for future studies assessing potential impacts on tourist developments.

AB  - Morphological abnormalities in crustaceans have been registered and several are attributed to pollution and others anthropogenic activities. This study reports for the first time a temporal record of the amount and variety of morphological abnormalities in Acartia lilljeborgii, in an impacted neotropical estuary. The specimens were obtained from Suape port area, Northeast Brazil, between May 2009 and September 2010 using a 300 mu m plankton net. Seven types of abnormalities were observed in one of the terminal spines of the prosome, but no temporal variation of abnormalities was found in our study. The deformities were registered in 85.7% of samples and they were found in up to 10% of the individuals (3.2 +/- 2.9%). The proportion of females with abnormalities was greater than for males, in opposite to most previous reports. Due to its high distribution and abundance in part of the neotropical Atlantic coastal area, A. lilljeborgii has the potential to be used as a bioindicator of environmental conditions, although the reasons of the abnormality occurrences should be accurately investigated.

AB  - Ferromanganese nodules are important pedogenic indicators in soil. They are usually characterized by clearly expressed ring structures. Although these features are believed to be significant environmental fingerprints, the reasons for their formation still await interpretation. Here, we interpreted these fingerprints by the synergistic use of noninvasive synchrotron-radiation based techniques and advanced analytical methods. The results revealed that the soil nodules were formed due to the filling of the pore networks of the soil matrix that was mediated by both abiotic and biotic factors during alternative soil wetting-drying cycles. The ring structures are therefore the memories of the soil redox history. The variations in elemental compositions of the ring structures indicates the soil moisture conditions at the time of formation. Their porosity reflects the rate of change in soil redox potential and the soil redox potential is mainly affected by precipitation.

AB  - The modem distribution of the western Eurasian sub-boreal butterfly species Coenonympha leander (Esper, 1784) was studied in the Urals region, with the northeastern range limits specified at 56 degrees N and 65 degrees E. There are isolated local C. leander populations in the forested steppe, while in the steppe zone the species is distributed fairly uniformly. In the Urals steppes, the species is tolerant to moderate anthropogenic transformations of natural communities, being not too rare. Nor can it serve as an indicator species like in other parts of the range. The geographic variations of the wing length, as well as the diameters and frequency of wing pattern eyespots are analyzed. The greatest morphological peculiarities are distinguished in the marginal outpost populations, especially the northernmost population from Nizhneye Tukbaevo, Bashkortostan, which lives in the unique conditions of the azonal Mesyagutovo forested steppe and tends to form a cline from north to south: the size of the wings is decreased, while the diameter of the eyespots and the frequency of their occurrence are increased.

AB  - Microalgal biofuels and biomass have ecofriendly advantages as feedstocks. Improved understanding and utilization of microalgae require large-scale analysis of the morphological and metabolic heterogeneity within populations. Here, with Euglena gracilis as a model microalgal species, we evaluate how fluorescence- and brightfield-derived-image-based descriptors vary during environmental stress at the single-cell level. This is achieved with a new multiparameter fluorescence-imaging cytometric technique that allows the assaying of thousands of cells per experiment. We track morphological changes, including the intensity and distribution of intracellular lipid droplets, and pigment autofluorescence. The combined fluorescence-morphological analysis identifies new metrics not accessible with traditional flow cytometry, including the lipid-to-cell-area ratio (LCAR), which shows promise as an indicator of oil productivity per biomass. Single-cell metrics of lipid productivity were highly correlated (R-2 > 0.90, p < 0.005) with bulk oil extraction. Such chemomorphological atlases of algal species can help optimize growth conditions and selection approaches for large-scale biomass production.

AB  - The complex dynamics of operational wind turbine (WT) structures challenges the applicability of existing structural health monitoring (SHM) strategies for condition assessment. At the center of Europe's renewable energy strategic planning, WT systems call for implementation of strategies that may describe the WT behavior in its complete operational spectrum. The framework proposed in this paper relies on the symbiotic treatment of acting environmental/operational variables and the monitored vibration response of the structure. The approach aims at accurate simulation of the temporal variability characterizing the WT dynamics, and subsequently at the tracking of the evolution of this variability in a longer-term horizon. The bi-component analysis tool is applied on long-term data, collected as part of continuous monitoring campaigns on two actual operating WT structures located in different sites in Germany. The obtained data-driven structural models verify the potential of the proposed strategy for development of an automated SHM diagnostic tool.

AB  - This study aimed to determine and spatialize the soil quality index (SQI), in relation to chemical and physical attributes, and evaluate its use in the payment for environmental services in the Sub-Basin of Posses, Extrema-MG, Brazil, which represents the Atlantic Forest Biome. SQI values were influenced by both the replacement of native forests by stands of eucalyptus and by pastures and annual crops, reflecting in the reduction of soil quality in the sampled layer in the evaluated systems. The spatialization of SQI showed values ranging from 0.40 to 0.80, with some specific areas with high values and others with values above 1.00 (native forest). The reforestation with eucalyptus conditioned most of the soils with low chemical and physical deterioration, due to accumulation of litter. The lowest SQI values are associated with pastures. SQI adjusted to the exponential model, which allowed the use of ordinary Kriging. The SQI has a great potential of use in the payment to farmers who provide services of soil and water conservation.

AB  - Shallow water bays located in the western Arabian Gulf experience harsh environmental conditions. Some of these bays, including Manifa-Tanajib Bay System (MTBS), were also exposed to the 1991 oil pollution event. This study investigates the status of the macrobenthos in MTBS during 2006. This bay system is characterized by very shallow inner bays with elevated salinity and temperature compared to the rest of the bay area. As a result mainly of the hyper salinity, the inner bay communities are distinct from the outer bay communities. Overall, fairly high species richness with several rare species was observed. High Shannon-Wiener diversity values and ABC plots indicated the healthy status of the polychaete communities, while BOPA index indicated slightly polluted status in 20% of the stations. The oil sensitive amphipods were not completely re-colonized in 20% of the stations, even after 15 years of recovery from the 1991 oil spill. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spilled oil can interact with suspended particles in marine environments and form oil-mineral aggregates (OMAs). Some OMAs with densities higher than seawater density can settle to the seedbed to pose potential risks to benthic organisms. To understand the transport and fate of oil associated with OMAs and evaluate their potential risks, an integrated hydrodynamic and fate/transport model has been used in a hypothetical case study of 1,000 tonnes of South Louisiana oil spilled in the Bristol Channel. Several scenarios have been simulated under different wave and current conditions. By using OMA properties derived from laboratory measurements reported in literature, it has been found that the risk to the benthos is unlikely for the two hypothetical cases with strong currents, but it is likely for the wave only (weak current) case. The effects of other factors such as OMA properties and sediment concentration were also examined in terms of their effects on the transport process and risks.

AB  - Across individuals, risk for poor health varies inversely with socioeconomic position (SEP). The pathways by which SEP affects health have been viewed from many epidemiological perspectives. Central to these perspectives is the notion that socioeconomic health disparities arise from an interplay between nested, recursive, and cumulative environmental, social, familial, psychological, behavioral, and physiological processes that unfold over the life span. Epidemiological perspectives on socioeconomic health disparities, however, have not yet formally integrated emerging findings from neuropharmacological, molecular genetic, and neuroimaging studies demonstrating that indicators of SEP relate to patterns of brain neurotransmission, brain morphology, and brain functionality implicated in the etiology of chronic medical conditions and psychological disorders. Here, we survey these emerging findings and consider how future neurobiological studies in this area can enhance our understanding of the pathways by which different dimensions of SEP become embodied by the brain to influence health throughout life.

AB  - Ozone sensitivity of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) has been thoroughly investigated since early 1990's in Finland. in our long-term open-field experiments the annual percentage reduction in basal diameter and stem volume increment were the best non-destructive growth indicators for ozone impact when plotted against AOTX. Remarkable differences in defence strategies, stomatal conductance, and defence compounds (phenolics), clearly indicate that external exposure indices are ineffective for accurate risk assessment for birch. For flux-based approaches, site-specific values for g(max) and g(dark) are necessary, and determinants for cletoxification capacity, ageing of leaves, and cumulative ozone impact would be needed for further model development. increasing CO2 seems to counteract negative ozone responses in birch, whereas exposure to springtime frost may seriously exacerbate ozone damage in northern conditions. Therefore, we need to proceed towards incorporating the most important climate change factors in any attempts for ozone risk assessment.

AB  - This paper examines bacterial levels and their causes in two Houston bayous (Texas). Buffalo and Whiteoak bayous are two of the most contaminated water bodies in Texas for indicator bacteria, based on the frequency and magnitude of contact recreation water quality exceedances. Examination of historical data indicates frequent exceedances, although some improvement has been made since the 1970s.
   Statistical analyses showed some correlation between in-stream fecal coliform concentrations and rainfall and with land use. Differences in fecal coliform concentrations were found between high- and low-flow conditions in Whiteoak Bayou, while reservoir releases confounded this relationship in Buffalo Bayou. Wastewater treatment plant effluent was found to make up two-thirds to three-fourths of the median flow in both bayous. Effluent sampling was conducted at 72 of the approximately 140 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the watersheds, providing evidence that WWTP effluent could act to maintain low-flow concentrations of fecal coliform in the bayous.

AB  - A single round household survey was conducted between October 1997 and May 1998. Information was collected on 1545 Maasai households in Kenya and Tanzania using a standardized questionnaire. These data represent the first large-scale, cross-border comparable survey of socioeconomic indicators for the Maasai. The structure of the study is similar to that of a natural experiment: one ethnic group living in two very different nation-states. The survey results describe a current "snapshot" of Maasai livelihoods. Living arrangements are described at both the household (olmarei) and multihousehold (enkang) level, together with changes in housing type. The roles of cultivation, transhumant migration, and employment are described, including a consideration of the prevalence of murranism (warriorhood). The implications of rising levels of sedentarization and cash crop production for Maasai economic diversification are explored. Participation by Maasai in the tourism industry is extremely low despite the proximity of Maasai to major international tourist destinations in East Africa. Levels of formal education show a marked sex bias in completed primary school education in both countries, with far fewer women than men having attended school.

TI  - A simplified model of urban morphology: application to an analysis of the environmental performance of cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
LA  - English
AB  - The evidence for the influence of urban configuration on outdoor climate conditions, on the energy balance of buildings, and on diffusion of pollutants is quite conclusive. But the exact characterization of this complex link remains critical, especially because of the extreme morphological heterogeneity at a fine granularity level: the building and its close environment. In this approach I try to cope with this difficulty, by working at the district or city scale, by assimilating the urban fabric into a porous medium with a rigid solid skeleton, and by proposing a simple spatial model based on a set of original morphological indicators of environmental performance: density, rugosity, porosity, sinuosity, occlusivity, compacity, contiguity, solar admittance, and mineralization. This system of indicators has been embedded in a shell of development of GIS and applied to various urban fabrics. The possible applications of this model are diverse: simplified analysis of outdoor microclimate tendencies, sustained environmental evaluation of a neighborhood, interdistrict or intercity comparisons, or modelling of the climate effect on future urban amenities.

AB  - Many low-elevation, coral reef-lined, tropical coasts are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, sea level rise, and wave-induced flooding. The considerable morphological diversity of these coasts and the variability of the hydrodynamic forcing that they are exposed to make predicting wave-induced flooding a challenge. A process-based wave-resolving hydrodynamic model (XBeach Non-Hydrostatic, "XBNH") was used to create a large synthetic database for use in a "Bayesian Estimator for Wave Attack in Reef Environments (BEWARE), relating incident hydrodynamics and coral reef geomorphology to coastal flooding hazards on reef-lined coasts. Building on previous work, BEWARE improves system understanding of reef hydrodynamics by examining the intrinsic reef and extrinsic forcing factors controlling runup and flooding on reef-lined coasts. The Bayesian estimator has high predictive skill for the XBNH model outputs that are flooding indicators, and was validated for a number of available field cases. It was found that, in order to accurately predict flooding hazards, water depth over the reef flat, incident wave conditions, and reef flat width are the most essential factors, whereas other factors such as beach slope and bed friction due to the presence or absence of corals are less important. BEWARE is a potentially powerful tool for use in early warning systems or risk assessment studies, and can be used to make projections about how wave-induced flooding on coral reef-lined coasts may change due to climate change.
   Plain Language Summary Low-lying tropical coasts fronted by coral reefs are threatened by the effects of climate change, sea level rise, and flooding caused by waves. However, the reefs on these coasts differ widely in their shape, size, and physical characteristics; the wave and water level conditions affecting these coastlines also vary in space and time. These factors make it difficult to predict flooding caused by waves along coral reef-lined coasts. We created a system ("BEWARE") that estimates how different wave, water level, and reef combinations can lead to flooding. This tool tells us what information is needed to make good predictions of flooding. We found that information on water levels and waves is most important, followed by the width of the reef. BEWARE can be used to make short-term predictions of flooding in early warning systems, or long-term predictions of how climate change will affect flooding caused by waves on coral reef-lined coasts.

AB  - 1. Seasonal carry-over effects may be important structuring components of avian life-history cycles. However, little is known on physiological transitions between stages and on phenotypic compromises that may be made at such time to improve fitness.
   2. We studied postmigratory body remodelling in red knots (Calidris canutus islandica) arriving on the Arctic breeding grounds. Our objectives were to determine the effects of body reconstruction and preparation for breeding on maintenance energy costs and to determine whether weather conditions can force compromises between functions required for postmigration recovery of body composition, thermoregulation and breeding.
   3. During two consecutive springs at the northernmost land on Earth (Alert, Ellesmere Island, Canada, 82 degrees 30' N), we monitored changes in knots post- arrival body stores. Using ultrasonography, we also tracked changes in gizzard size, an indicator of gut size, and pectoral muscle thickness, not only an endogenous protein source but also a thermogenic organ. We measured basal metabolic rate (BMR) throughout reconstruction and compared it with BMR of nonbreeding red knots wintering in the Dutch Wadden Sea.
   4. Arriving knots faced temperatures up to 13 degrees C lower than during midwinter. Birds arrived with large body stores and pectoral muscles, which declined in size while they grew their gizzard and prepared for breeding. BMR at arrival was indistinguishable from winter BMR and increased linearly throughout reconstruction. BMR increased up to 69% faster in females than males, likely due to the development of their reproductive organs.
   5. Birds had lower body stores but larger muscles in the colder year, and muscle loss was correlated with the warming of spring temperatures. Therefore, muscles would not only serve as a nutrient source, but their thermogenic function could also provide the flexibility to cope with high thermostatic costs in the spring. However, retaining muscles for shivering may limit protein recirculation and delay the onset of breeding.
   6. Postmigratory recovery therefore involves significant energy costs and arriving birds likely have to make physiological compromises, depending on spring conditions, which may impact on fitness. Although this period is clearly critical in the life cycle of red knots, it is one of the least understood life- history stages in Arctic- breeding shorebirds.

AB  - Riparian invertebrate communities are species rich, but variability in sampling methods hampers assessment of their distributions and inference of the quality of their habitats. To reduce this variability, a standardized, multi-method survey protocol was recently developed. Here, riparian beetle community surveys conducted before and after the protocol's introduction were used to evaluate its effectiveness in characterizing communities and in limiting variability among surveys. Use of the standardized protocol reduced variability in sampling effort, and this had a limited effect on estimates of taxonomic richness. Surveys using the protocol captured significantly more species than surveys done before its introduction, evidencing the benefits of standardized multi-method survey protocols. Our study highlights that standardized multi-method survey protocols may enable identification and prioritization of sites requiring management to improve habitat quality. As such, we recommend the integration of such protocols into monitoring programmes, to enhance protection of biodiverse invertebrate communities in vulnerable riparian habitats.

AB  - Genetically identical plants growing in the same conditions can display heterogeneous phenotypes. Here we use Arabidopsis seed germination time as a model system to examine phenotypic variability and its underlying mechanisms. We show extensive variation in seed germination time variability between Arabidopsis accessions and use a multiparent recombinant inbred population to identify two genetic loci involved in this trait. Both loci include genes implicated in modulating abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity. Mutually antagonistic regulation between ABA, which represses germination, and gibberellic acid (GA), which promotes germination, underlies the decision to germinate and can act as a bistable switch. A simple stochastic model of the ABA-GA network shows that modulating ABA sensitivity can generate the range of germination time distributions we observe experimentally. We validate the model by testing its predictions on the effects of exogenous hormone addition. Our work provides a foundation for understanding the mechanism and functional role of phenotypic variability in germination time.

AB  - The study tries to discover the impact of financial and social indicators' growth towards environmental considerations to understand the drivers of economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions change in G7 countries. The DEA-like composite index has been used to examine the tradeoff between financial and social indicator matters in environmental consideration by using a multi-objective goal programming approach. The data from 2008 to 2018 is collected from G-7 countries. The results from the DEA-like composite index reveals that there is a mixed condition of environmental sustainability in G-7 countries where the USA is performing better and Japan is performing worse among the set of other countries. The further result shows that the energy and fiscal indicators help to decrease the dangerous gas emissions. Divergent to that, the human and financial index positively contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Fostering sustainable development is essential to successfully reduce emissions, meet established objectives, and ensure steady development. The study provides valuable information for policymakers.

AB  - The work is devoted to the search and investigation of the properties of the effective environmentally friendly phytoremediation activators. An integrated approach was used to evaluate the effect of the compositions of thiosulfonates with rhamnolipid biosurfactant on remediation plants. The biochemical and biophysical analysis of the rapeseed and ryegrass plants grown in the oil polluted soil - photosynthetic pigments, indicators of oxidative reactions and electrical impedance characteristics were determined. When applied via pre-sowing seed treatment, the thiosulfonate-biosurfactant compositions have contributed to the reduction of the indicators of oxidative reactions in plants (malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide content) and to the increase of photosynthetic pigments content. The electrical impedance characteristics of the plants were consistent with the data of the biochemical parameters. The composition of alylthiosulfanilate with rhamnolipid biocomplex was the most effective preparation. The results testify to the effectiveness of the thiosulfonate-biosurfactant compositions for the improvement of the adaptive capability of plants to adverse conditions and prospects of their application as environmentally friendly means for soil phytoremediation.

AB  - Dogs and cats are often abused within households. Despite this, little research has been developed to know the factors associated with this crime. The objective of this study was to identify the associated factors of companion animal neglect in the family environment. We followed up the records of animal abuse investigations of the Protection Animal Division of the city of Pinhais, Brazil. Socioeconomic factors about the owners and four types of indicators: nutritional, comfort, health and behavioral were considered. A binomial logistic regression model was fitted with the purpose of predicting the presence of animal neglect based on predictor variables. The number of animals in the household, disadvantageous economic conditions, the presence of disabled people and a low educational level of the owners were identified as associated factors of animal neglect. Understanding the factors related to the occurrence of animal neglect is fundamental for the development of multidisciplinary preventive strategies to reduce the occurrence of this crime.

AB  - Inhibition of anaerobic digestion (AD) due to perturbation caused by substrate composition and/or operating conditions can significantly reduce performance. Such perturbations could be limited by elucidating microbial community response to inhibitors and devising strategies to increase community resilience. To this end, advanced molecular methods are increasingly being applied to study the AD microbiome, a diverse community of microbial populations with complex interactions. This literature review of AD inhibition studies indicates that inhibitory concentrations are highly variable, likely stemming from differences in community structure or activity profile and previous exposure to inhibitors. More recent molecular methods such as 'omics' tools, substrate mapping, and real-time sequencing are helping to unravel the complexity of AD inhibition by elucidating physiological and ecological significance of key microbial populations. The AD community must strive towards developing predictive abilities to avoid system failure (e.g., real-time tracking of an indicator species) to improve resilience of AD systems.

AB  - The CaO solid derived from natural quail eggshell was calcined and employed as catalyst to produce biodiesel via transesterification of sunflower oil. The natural quail eggshell was calcined at 900 degrees C for 3 h, in order to modify the calcium carbonate present in its structure in CaO, the activity phase of the catalyst. Both precursor and catalyst were characterized using Hammett indicators method, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG), CO2 temperatureprogrammed desorption (CO2-TPD), X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption at -196 degrees C, and distribution particle size. The maximum biodiesel production was of 99.00 +/- 0.02 wt.% obtained in the following transesterification reaction conditions:X-MR (sunflower oil/methanol molar ratio of 1 : 10.5 mol : mol),X-CAT (catalyst loading of 2 wt.%),X-TIME (reaction time of 2 h), stirring rate of 1000 rpm, and temperature of 60 degrees C.

AB  - Plant species exert differential effects on soil mineralogical and micromorphological characteristics. The effect of red pine and oak tree roots on the mineralogical and micromorphological characteristics of rhizosphere soils in two sampling sites in the Goksu catchment was studied. The climate, topography, and bedrock conditions were kept consistent, whereas the plant factor was kept as the only variable in each site. Rhizosphere soils under the canopies of 100 years old and naturally occurring trees were compared via macromorphology, submicroscopy, mineralogy, and physical and chemical properties. The soils of red pine ( RP 1 and RP 2 profiles) were determined to have higher porosity when compared to the soils of the oak tree profiles (Ok(1), Ok(2)). However, the higher amounts of welded/cemented aggregates in the Ok(1) and Ok(2) profiles were probable indicators of maturity and probable stability of the aggregates/MSUs. The dominant clay mineral in sampling site 1 was kaolinite, whereas it was smectite in sampling site 2.

AB  - Mining cities are of vital importance to the global development, but they are facing great challenges to achieve sustainability goals. Understanding the characteristics and patterns of the environmental, economic; and social conditions of mining cities is critical to promoting their sustainability. After developing an Indicator System for Mining City Sustainability, we collected data from 110 prefecture-level cities and analyzed environmental, economic, and social characteristics of these mining cities using a data-mining method - Association rule mining. Our analysis revealed some novel, implicit, and previously unknown characteristics and patterns of mining city sustainability in China. We found that education investment, economic development, and some aspects of society were substantially unbalanced in most Chinese mining cities. Most coal-mining cites had a larger proportion of mining population, and usually faced severe challenges in reducing industrial dust emission. The unsustainable characteristics of Chinese mining cities exhibited distinctive regional patterns and should be considered explicitly in policy making to promote the sustainability of these urban areas.

AB  - Developing 'Internal Rating Systems' (IRB) for corporate risk management requires building risk (PD) models geared to the specific characteristics of corporate sub-populations (eg small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), private companies, listed companies, sector specific models), tuned to changes in the macro environment, and, of course, tailored to the available data. Tracking the risk of 'newly incorporated companies' provides a particular challenge since there is very limited publically available data in the time period from incorporation date until the submission of the first accounts. Yet a large number of these companies fail (via bankruptcy). We employ a substantial database to estimate discrete time hazard models (DHM) over the period 2000-2008 (4 427 896 firm-year observations and 34 903 incidences of insolvency), inclusive of macro and regional economic conditions, that capture early indicators of financial stress and measure aspects of the characteristics of board of directors in order to assess the utility of this type of non-financial information in failure prediction models.

AB  - The introduction of the tissue-based definition of transient ischemic attack (TIA), according to which TIA may be diagnosed only in the absence of an infarction on brain neuroimaging, prompts reflections about similarities and differences between TIA and angina. Both share transitory symptoms in the absence of tissue damage, whereas stroke and myocardial infarction are associated with tissue necrosis. Apart from this, TIA and angina are widely different with respect to pathophysiology, natural history, prognosis, and response to specific medical treatments. In general terms, it could be argued that TIA differs from angina as the brain differs from the heart in structure, physiology, metabolism, and performance. Most importantly, in TIA and angina, the reversible nature of symptoms cannot be assumed as a favorable prognostic indicator. In fact, reversibility of stable angina denotes a low-risk condition, whereas in TIA and unstable angina reversibility may suggest plaque instability and relevant risk of ischemic recurrences.

AB  - Early-life stages of fathead minnows were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of aqueous and dietary nickel and thallium and metal accumulation was monitored from the embryo until the larvae reached 21 days after hatching. During and after metal exposure, 6 toxicity endpoints were measured: time to hatch, embryo survival rate, routine metabolic rate and the activity of key enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK), cytochrome C oxidase (CCO)). Although both Ni and Tl bioaccumulation were significant in embryos and non-feeding larvae, water was the major source of Ni and Tl in feeding larvae. Exposure to aqueous Ni decreased time to hatch and increased aerobic and biosynthetic capacities (as indicated by a higher activity of CCO and NDPK, respectively), suggesting that aqueous Ni exposure stimulates metabolism in early-life stages of fathead minnows.

AB  - In this paper, wave propagation is studied in degraded composite beam due to moisture absorption. The obtained wave responses are then used for diagnosis of the degraded zone. Moisture absorption causes an irreversible hygrothermal deterioration of the material. The change in temperature and moisture absorption changes the mechanical properties. Thus this affects the structure in dimensional stability as well as material degradation due to reduction in mechanical properties. Here, the composite beam is modeled as Timoshenko beam using wavelet based spectral finite element (WSFE) method. The WSFE technique is especially tailored for simulation of wave propagation. It involves Daubechies scaling function approximation in time and spectral finite element approach. The simulated wave responses are then used as surrogate experimental results to predict degradation using a measure called damage force indicator (DFI). Numerical experiments are presented for moisture absorbed composite beam due to modulated sinusoidal excitation. The responses are studied for different environmental conditions in term of relative humidity and at a temperature.

AB  - An attempt has been made to study the physiological and biochemical responses and to evaluate the bioaccumulation potential of moss Sphagnum to environmental lead. Supply of 0.1 to 100 mM lead acetate caused a loss in chlorophyll and nitrogen content of moss and in nitrate reductase activity in the moss, although the peroxidase activity was increased. Partial recovery in the above parameters was recorded upon simultaneous treatment with glutathione. Results also indicate that treatment with glutathione increased the bioaccumulation potential by lowering the lead toxicity, which could be the result of induction of metal binding capabilities of cells as the heavy metal also induced the synthesis of phytochelatins. The moss accumulated a significant amounts of Pb under both experimental and field conditions. The heavy metal accumulated by moss was positively correlated to the soil metal content. The experiments demonstrate that Sphagnum is able to accumulate and tolerate higher amounts of Pb and therefore, it can be used as a bioindicator and phytoremediator of lead contaminated environment.

KW  - SWEDEN
AB  - The large lakes of Sweden, Malaren, Hjalmaren, Vattern and Vanern, have been subjected to water-quality monitoring for almost four decades. Physicochemical variables, plankton and benthic invertebrates have been regularly assessed. Hydrological and sediment conditions, macrophytes, fish, primary production, bacteria and attached algae have been periodically investigated. The human impact, including industrial activities, was reflected in excessive amounts of organic matter, nutrients, metals and persistent organic compounds. From the late 1960s all municipal sewage works in the catchments of the lakes were upgraded to the highest technical standard, including chemical precipitation of phosphorus, and phosphorus discharge from the sewage works was thereby reduced by 90-95%. In addition, industries were obliged to restrict discharge of harmful substances. The reactions of the lakes to the remedial measures are discussed as well as the value of various indicators. The studies were instrumental in designing a national lake monitoring program. Additionally, results from large lake monitoring have contributed to the establishment of national water-quality criteria including, physical, chemical, and biological indicators.

LA  - German
AB  - Under laboratory conditions 8 soils from agricultural areas were investigated to improve applicability of dehydrogenase activity (DHA) measurements. The recovery - and also the availability to microorganisms - of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) which is commonly used as an indicator within measurements of DHA was very poor after addition to clay or to clay soil. The recovery of TTC from soil, however, varied between 50 % and 75 % after organic amendments of lucerne meal or horn meal. In its - commonly by microorganisms - reduced form triphenyl formazan the indicator was nearly not adsorbed. In all soils the DHA activity specificly depended on the applied TTC concentration and it was influenced by the content of clay and organic matter and, sometimes, by the soil pH. This led to soil-specific optimal TTC concentrations. The amendment of clay always reduced soil-borne DHA activity, but sometimes only a dilution effect occurred. Horn meal induced only a slight stimulation at the beginning whereas lucerne meal was strongly effective during several weeks. These effects should be mentioned if the DHA activity is included in soil biological and exotoxicological investigations.

AB  - The change of several biological and physiological indicators was studied in mature leaves of muskmelon plants (Cucumis melo L. cv. Galia) during the biological cycle. Plants were grown under greenhouse conditions, using differential fertilization with N, P, and K, and irrigation with brackish water. We measured total and soluble Fe and Mn, total and soluble Fe index, endogenous and Fe- and Mn-inflitrated catalase and peroxidase and aconitase activities in leaves in an attempt to trace possible Fe deficiencies. The Fe-Index is defined as follows: Fe Index = [(1OP + K) 50]/Fe, where: P and K as % d.w. and Fe as mug/g d.w.
   The physiological indicators (Fe Index) was markedly raised at the beginning of the biological cycle, indicating that foliar samples contained high concentrations of P and K, which may have induced Fe deficiency. The Fe Index decreased steadily during the biological cycle, indicating that fertilizer was applied correctly.
   Comparisons of endogenous and Fe- and Mn-infiltrated enzymatic activities revealed Fe deficiency during senescence. Catalase and peroxidase activity increased at the end of the biological cycle.

AB  - Purpose. The work is aimed at continuing the started in the previous papers investigations of structure of the Azov Sea salinity field based on the oceanographic survey data collected since 2000. Interest in studying this parameter is conditioned by its anomalous increase after 2006.
   Methods and Results. The data of 49 seasonal oceanographic surveys carried out in the Sea of Azov by the Azov-Black Sea Branch of "VNIRO" ("AzNIIRKH" ) from 2001 to 2016 permitted to calculate the following: the radii in the concentration region of the field spatial correlation function in the meridional and zonal directions for the surface and bottom layers (the characteristic of the field homogeneity); the ratio between these radii; the sea-average values of salinity field for the surface and bottom layers. The time graphical and the paired correlation analyses of the calculated indicators' series were done. The average values of the meridional and zonal radii of the concentration region of the spatial correlation function (42.5 and 47.1 km) testify presence of two relatively isolated zones in the sea related to the water circulation. These zones are formed under the conditions of the eastern winds dominating in the region. The average values of the above-mentioned radii the near-bottom sea layer were approximately equal, whereas in the surface layer, the average zonal radii exceeded the meridional ones. In spring and summer, the meridional radius in the bottom layer surpassed the zonal one. Long-term variability shows that in the surface layer, the meridional radius values tend to increase, and in the bottom layer, the zonal radius ones - to decrease. These trends demonstrate a change in the nature of water exchange in the sea, namely from predominance of the zonal transport to that of the meridional one.
   Conclusions. Since 2006, the changes in the structure of the Azov Sea water salinity field (trends towards decrease of the zonal radii and increase of the meridional ones in the concentration region of the field spatial correlation function) resulted from decrease in the river water inflow and increase of water exchange with the Kerch Strait, and were accompanied by growth of average salinity. Water exchange with the Kerch Strait in the bottom layer was the most active in spring and summer. The anticipatory shift of the field structural characteristics by 1 and 2 years relative to its average values makes it possible to forecast them with a two-year advance time.

AB  - Marine anaerobic oxidation of ammonium (anammox) plays a central role in the nitrogen cycle of modern Oxygen Deficient Zones (ODZs). The newly developed bacteriohopanetetrol stereoisomer (BHT-x) biomarker for anammox, which is largely unaffected by early diagenesis, allows for the reconstruction of the presence and dynamics of past ODZs from the sedimentary record of continental margins. In this study, we investigate the development and dynamics of the ODZ in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) between 60 and 15 cal ka BP using records of redox sensitive trace metals (TM) and the BHT -x anammox biomarker from IODP Site U1419 (similar to 700 m water depth). The biomarker record indicates that the ODZ in the GOA was in concert with global climate fluctuations in the late Pleistocene. Anammox was more pronounced during warmer periods and diminished during cooler periods, as indicated by correlation with the delta O-18 signal obtained by the North Greenland Ice core Project (NGRIP). Trace metal enrichments, however, do not match the trend in BHT -x. Systematic metal enrichments in intervals where biomarkers point to more intense water column deoxygenation are not observed. We suggest that this proxy discrepancy was caused by environmental factors, other than water column redox conditions, with opposing effects on the TM and biomarker records. Two of the most widely used redox indicators, Mo and U, are not significantly enriched throughout the sediment record at Site U1419. Site U1419 experienced some of the highest sedimentation rates (100-1000 cm ka(-1)) ever reported for late Pleistocene continental margin sediments, leading to a continuous and rapid upward migration of the sediment-water interface. We suggest that despite water column and seafloor oxygen depletion, significant sedimentary enrichments of these redox sensitive trace metals were prevented by a limited time for their diffusion across the sediment-water interface and subsequent enrichment as authigenic phases. Thus, depositional conditions were ideal for biomarker preservation but prevented significant authigenic trace metal accumulations. Similar discrepancies between organic and inorganic redox proxies could exist in other high sedimentation rate environments, potentially putting constraints on paleo-redox interpretations in such settings if they are based on trace metal enrichments alone.

These differences are attributed to relative positions to the location of the syn-rift dysoxia and amounts of the carbon flux during active paleoproductivity time. In the present study, an extensive analysis of the syn-rift dysoxia and paleoproductivity during the Miocene is conducted in Burdigalian Rudeis Formation in Ramadan-1 well to determine their influence on the accumulation of organic carbon. The analysis depends on the statistical investigation of the benthic foraminiferal assemblages. The foraminiferal assemblages are discriminated into two biofacies in R-mode (suboxic and dysoxic) and three biotopes in Q-mode (suboxic (S), dysoxic DA and DB sample groups). The sediments are divided into three stratigraphic sequences. Five oxygen minimum zones are determined at the extreme oxygen depletion intervals and they are defined by suboxic (S) and dysoxic (DA) sample groups in descendent order of oxygen depletion intensity and mostly coincide with the high sea levels. The distribution of the organic matter showed large enrichment with partial fluorescence amorphous organic matter indicating kerogen type II in the three biotopes as clarified from palynofacies analysis. The organic carbon enrichment from the studied samples ranged from fair to very good (0.51 and 2.38 wt%) and the relatively larger enrichments are found to be correlated with dysoxic sample group (DA) of intermediate oxygen depletion. The pyrolysis gas chromatography (PGC) specifies the algal rich Type I kerogen that deposited in oxygen depleted marine environment. The mathematical calculation of the paleoproductivity (oligotrophic to eutrophic range 106-352 gCM(-2) yr(-1)), carbon flux (13.77 and 36.19 gCm(-2) yr(-1)) indicates that higher levels of organic productivity are correlated with dysoxic sample group (DA). The larger organic carbon values are found in the Rudeis Formation when the dysoxic conditions from the deeper topographic lows extend to the higher tectonic position of Ramadan-1 well during the sea level rise that furthermore enhances the paleoproductivity.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an investigation on the relationship between urban block typology, solar energy harvesting potential and building energy use efficiency in the context of the tropical high-density city Singapore. Thirty generic urban block cases in six typologies that represent a diverse range of urban forms were examined through simulation-based studies under the same planning conditions and simulation assumptions so as to rule out the impact of non-design related factors. Several key planning and geometric parameters which capture the formal characteristics of the urban blocks were examined as independent variables, and the dependent variables include the performance indicators on solar energy harvesting potential and building net energy use intensity that capture the dual benefits of photovoltaic (PV) systems in reducing building cooling loads and offsetting local plug loads with electricity generated on site. The results indicate that, under the same planning conditions and design premises, differences in urban block typology could lead to up to 200% increase in solar energy harvesting potential and electricity generated from rooftop PV, twelve times higher rate of reduction in building cooling loads, tow times higher rate of reduction in net purchased electricity, and 25% lower building net energy use intensity. The courtyard and hybrid urban block typologies consistently outperform the other typologies, especially the commonly implemented tower and slab blocks, and they benefit the most from PV deployment in the tropics. The comparison between an existing residential precinct and a hypothetical alternative hybrid urban block further demonstrated the significant impact of urban design on efficiency of PV electricity generation and building energy use efficiency. In addition to the significant economic benefit in reduction in utility cost and environmental implication in terms of equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions on urban scale, this study highlights the crucial role that urban design plays in terms of maximising on-site renewable energy production such as solar energy. The significant planning and geometric parameters in relation to the performance indicators provide insight as reference for establishing solar energy friendly urban planning and architectural design guidelines. The methodology and technical workflow as developed can support reliable and efficient feasibility studies, especially in the early stage of urban planning and architectural design. Integrated with other performance evaluations, they can facilitate decision-making on implementation of renewable energy integrated green building technologies and passive design strategies.

AB  - Introduction. Cereal raw materials are an important basis for the food industry. The research was carried out on the possibility of using a whole biologically activated grain of cereals to create functional food products.
   Materials and methods. Compoundings of grain mixes of flakes and ready-made products on their basis is investigated. Protein was determined by Biuret method, starch content by polarimetric method. Fat was determined by the method of exhaustive extraction with chemically pure hexane. Vitamin E and substances with P-vitamin activity are determined colorimetrically. Vitamin C was carried out using a titrimetric method. The microbiological indices of the studied samples were determined by sowing them surface on agarized nutrient media.
   Results and discussion. The influence of temperature regime and duration of cold conditioning of grain on its biological value is determined. With change of temperature regime to 12-18 degrees C and the duration of conditioning of 24-30 h, the content in the grain of all water-soluble vitamins increases by 2-2,5 times, the amount of tocopherol grows by 5-7 times, the amount of substances with P-vitamin activity increases in 2,5 times.
   The dependence of basic physical and technological parameters of grain flakes and organoleptic properties of finished products from their component composition is investigated. Increase in a mass fraction of oats to 50% leads to increased viscosity of porridge, due to an increase in the content of hemicellulose, decreases crumbility. Increasing the mass fraction of wheat grain to 35% leads to a more rigid structure of porridge, which is explained by the higher density of shell parts of wheat grain, compared with other components.
   The degree of maintenance of the daily needs of the adult population in the macronutrients, at the expense of consumption of 100 grams of flakes, is: proteins - 18-22%, fats - 5-7%, carbohydrates 13-16%, food fibers - 13,5%.
   Taking into account the daily requirement of adult population in vitamins, 100 g of flakes mix allows you to meet the need for vitamin E by 67-76%; P by 17,4%.
   The total number of colony-forming units of mesophilic aerobic and facultative-anaerobic microorganisms in fresh samples of mixes of flakes and after their storage does not exceed 2.10(3) per g product, mold mushrooms and pathogenic microorganisms are absent.
   Conclusions. Biologically activated grain of cereal cultures of wheat, bare grain oats and triticale is a source of valuable nutrients, for creation of mixes of flakes of functional purpose.

AB  - Coordinated relationships between socioeconomic development and water utilization, as well as environmental protection measures, are crucial for achieving sustainable water resource exploitation (WRE) under changing environmental conditions. Moreover, a balanced condition of regional WRE is essential to guaranteeing the water security of the entire nation. In this study, an evaluation model of the coordination degree (CD) of WRE is built based on 10 selected indicators and is then applied to 31 provincial zones in China during the period 2004-2014. The cluster analysis method is introduced to classify the relative rank (RK) of the CD at the provincial scale in the pre-(2004-2010) and post-(2011-2014) phases; these phases are divided by the first year of the implementation of the "Three Red Lines Policy" in China (2011), and the spatial differences of the CD of the entire nation were decomposed. The results showed the following. 1) The CD of WRE increases significantly in 26 provincial zones after the implementation of the "Three Red Lines Policy", and the average CD of WRE for 28 provincial zones during the post-phase was greater than that during the pre-phase. 2) Provincial zones with the RK of coordinated development model (CDM) are mainly located in southern and southwestern China. Provincial zones with the RK of the uncoordinated development model (UDM) were mainly found in northern inland China. Eight provincial zones with dense populations and intensive water use, but with only scarce per capita water resources, have the RK of the severely uncoordinated development model (SUDM). 3) The spatial differences in CD diminished in the post-phase, and the differences in CD at the inter-regional scale accounted for a predominant proportion of the difference in CD at the national scale. In addition to improving the coordination status of WRE, the implementation of the "Three Red Lines Policy" also decreased the disparity among the CD of WRE, and this policy continued to be effectively implemented and followed to make a lasting difference. Cross-regional cooperation and coordinated relationships between socioeconomic development and water resource protection are needed to achieve a more coordinated and balanced WRE for long-term development. The results of this study have scientific and practical implications for sustainable WRE and water security in rapidly developing countries such as China. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reports on extremely thick and massive duricrusts in soils of two basins in the Alentejo (southern Portugal). Since different types of duricrusts (calcretes, silcretes and palycretes) have been reported from other regions in the Mediterranean, the purpose of this study was to identify the cementing agents in the duricrusts and to compare their composition in the two basins. Moreover, the study aimed at identifying the processes involved in duricrust formation, and especially the role of topography and lateral water and element transport in the landscape, and drawing conclusions about environmental conditions and time of duricrust formation.
   After studying an extensive number of road cuts in the field and mapping soil patterns in parts of the two basins by manual augering, ten pedons were selected for detailed description and sampling. Thin sections were analysed under a petrographic microscope, focusing on the micromorphology and optical properties of the cementing materials. Selected samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to reconfirm the optical identification. The laboratory analyses included pH, carbonate contents, and X-ray diffraction analysis.
   The duricrusts in the eastern Sado basin are indurated by silica. Combination of XRD and thin section analysis allowed to identify opal-CT as a major component, while opal-A is present to a lesser extent, and chalcedony is very rare. The cementing materials of the duricrusts in the Oriola basin are palygorskite and calcite, which may occur alone or in combination within a soil profile.
   The thick duricrusts formed in the basins through precipitation of calcite, palygorskite and silica from lateral water flows, which ran from the Serra de Portel into the basins, during short moist seasons in a generally warm, semi-arid climate with strong evapotranspiration. Lithology of the upper catchment areas (element sources) and topography control the spatial distribution of the different duricrusts. Their formation took place mainly during the Pliocene. Palygorskite transformation to smectite in the upper parts of the palycretes indicates that palygorskite is unstable in the present (more humid, typical Mediterranean) climate. This study demonstrates the potential role of lateral water and element transport in landscapes that need to be considered in pedological studies and concepts, and the use of mineral indicators of past climates such as palygorskite and the ageing stage of silica precipitations as tools for reconstructing environmental conditions and possible time of duricrust formation.

AB  - Stomatal behavior is a central topic of plant ecophysiological research under global environmental change. However, the physiological mechanism controlling the response of stomata to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) or relative humidity (RH) has been inadequately understood till now. In this study, responses of stomatal conductance (g(s)) to VPD in two species of trees (Fraxinus chinensis Roxb., Populus alba L. var. pyramidalis Bge.) in three different climate zones (Jinan with typical warm humid/semi-humid climate, Urumqi with temperate continental arid climate and Turpan with extreme arid desert climate) were measured. Levels of two phytohormones (abscisic acid, ABA; indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) in the leaves of the two tree species at these three sites were also measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that the responses of gs to an increasing VPD in these two tree species at the three sites had peak curves which could be fitted with a Log Normal Model (g (s)=a center dot exp(-0.5(ln(D/c)/b)(2)). The VPD/RH values corresponding to the maximum g(s) can be calculated using the fitting models for the two tree species in the three sites. We found that the calculated g(s-max)-VPD correlated negatively with relative air humidity in the three sites during the plant growth period (April to October 2010), which showed the values of g(s-max)-VPD were related to the climate conditions. The prevailing empirical stomatal model (Leuning model) and optimal stomatal behavior model could not properly simulate our measured data. The water use efficiency in the two tree species did not show obvious differences under three very different climatic conditions, but the highest g(s), photosynthetic and transpiration rates occurred in P. alba var. of Turpan. The sensitivity in response of g(s) to VPD in leaves of the two trees showed positive correlations with the concentration of ABA, which implied that ABA level could be used as an indicator of the sensitivity of stomatal response to VPD. Our results confirmed that the prediction of the response of g(s) to VPD might be incomplete in the two current popular models. Therefore, an improved g(s) model which is able to integrate the results is needed. Also, the stomatal response mechanism of single peak curves of g(s) to VPD should be considered.

AB  - Veal calves raised under intensive conditions may express non-nutritive oral behaviors. When expressed in an abnormal way, these behaviors can be a sign of mental suffering and reduced welfare due to a mismatch between environmental or management features and the animal's needs. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of non-nutritive oral behaviors in a large sample of veal farms in Europe and to determine the potential influencing factors present at farm level. Data were collected on 157 commercial veal farms in the 3 main veal-producing countries in Europe (the Netherlands, France, and Italy). Observations of 3 non-nutritive oral behaviors (manipulating substrates, tongue rolling, and manipulating a penmate) were performed when calves were aged 14 wk, and the prevalence of these behaviors was calculated. Information on management practices and characteristics of the building and equipment were collected on all farms to assess potential influencing factors for each of the 3 behaviors. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate the effect of each individual factor within a generalized linear model. The mean percentage of calves per farm performing manipulating substrates was 11.0 +/- 0.46%, performing tongue rolling 2.8 +/- 0.18%, and manipulating a penmate 2.7 +/- 0.09%, with a high range between farms. Allowing more space for calves than the legal minimum requirement of 1.8 m(2)/ calf and housing them in groups of >10 calves/pen reduced the incidences of manipulating substrates and tongue rolling. Incidence of manipulating substrates was lower for calves fed maize silage compared with calves fed cereal grain, pellets, or muesli. A higher risk of tongue rolling was found when baby-boxes (i.e., single housing during the first 5 to 8 wk) were not used. Risk of calves manipulating a penmate was higher for calves of milk- or meat-type breeds compared with dual-purpose breeds and for calves fed with 280 to 380 kg compared with those fed >380 kg of milk powder in total for the fattening period. The study allowed assessment of multiple factors across farms that showed variety in terms of conditions and level of non-nutritive oral behaviors. Identification of the factors influencing non-nutritive oral behavior is helpful to define potential actions that could be taken on farms to improve the welfare of calves and reduce the prevalence of these behaviors.

AB  - n-Alkanes are biosynthesized from very long-chain fatty acid wax precursors and its distribution grants the most useful taxonomic contribution for plant species. In current study, five species from three genera of Moraceae family were sampled separately from three areas (Mountain Jin-yun, Mountain Jin-fo and Bei-bei) in Chongqing, China, namely, Broussonetia papyrifera, Broussonetia kazinoki, Ficus virens, Ficus tikoua, and Humulus scandens. The amounts of n-alkanes in epicuticular wax enabled discrimination among areas, varying from 4.9 mu g cm(-2) to 16.9 mu g cm(-2) in Mountain Jin-yun, 6.9 mu g cm(-2) to 20.5 mu g cm(-2) in Bei-bei, and 4.7 mu g cm(-2) to 61.7 mu g cm(-2) in Mountain Jin-fo, respectively. Among the five species, the amount of n-alkanes was the highest in B. papyrifera and the lowest in E tikoua for all areas, showing high species variation. The most abundant n-alkanes in all investigated species were two odd-numbered n-alkanes, i.e., C-29 and C-31. The epicuticular waxes of H. scandens from Bei-bei had a higher relative abundance of C-29 than other species from Mountain Jin-yun and Mountain Jin-fo. The chain length of n-alkanes from Bei-bei was longer than that from other areas. The even/odd predominance (EOP) or odd/even predominance (OEP) occurred in short-chain n-alkanes of plant epicuticular wax might be correlated with their growing environments. All Carbon Preference Index (CPIs) and Average Chain Length (ACLs) from Bei-bei were lower than those from other sampling areas, mainly attributing to the higher numbers of short- and mid-chain n-alkanes in plants from Bei-bei. Cluster analysis revealed that H. scandens from Bei-bei and E virens from Mountain Jin-yun were different from other species. Based on these findings, it seems that environmental conditions contribute to the complex patterns and variation of n-alkanes and different plant species had different responses to environment changes. The distribution of n-alkanes could be a good indicator to distinguish plant species under different growing conditions before other obvious morphological changes could be observed.

AB  - The reliability of paleoclimatic inferences from lake-sediment records rests on the understanding of how various sediment indicators respond to environmental changes. Despite the recent proliferation of paleoclimatic records, only a limited number of studies have rigorously evaluated potential indicators by comparing lake-sediment records with instrumental weather data. We analyzed annually laminated sediments of the past 100 years from a lake in north-central Minnesota for a suite of variables commonly used for climatic reconstructions. Results were compared with time series of climatic or climate-derived variables, as well as with indices of climate modes thought to influence the regional climate of the midwestern United States. The oxygen-isotopic composition of calcite (delta O-18(c)) shows trends similar to those of effective moisture (as measured by precipitation [P] minus actual evapotranspiration [AET], P-AET, and the Palmer Drought Severity Index [PDSI]), with high delta O-18(c) values generally corresponding to low P-AET and low PDSI. delta O-18(c) also exhibits striking correspondence with the index of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) but it lags behind PDO by 3 years. Elevated delta O-18(c) values during the warm PDO phase probably reflect warm and dry climatic conditions in the midwestern US, especially during winter months. The carbon-isotopic composition of calcite (delta C-13(c)) shows some similarity with delta O-18(c) but also displays stratigraphic patterns resembling those of lake-productivity indicators, including biogenic silica, inverse of inorganic carbon, ratio of organic carbon to nitrogen, and to a lesser extent, organic carbon. delta C-13(c) is correlated with mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and the index of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), probably because elevated MAAT stimulates the rate of algal carbon uptake, lengthens growing season, and/or enhances CO2 degassing. Varves are typically thicker during periods of lower delta O-18(c) and higher P-AET (or PDSI) values, because wet climatic conditions probably increase nutrient availability and lake productivity. Gray-scale intensity does not co-vary with any of the above climatic variables or climate-mode indices. These results demonstrate the utility of lake-sediment analyses for reconstructing temperature, drought, and large-scale climatic modes at Steel Lake. However, application to down-core reconstructions may be compromised by a number of factors, including the site specificity and non-stationarity of such relationships.

AB  - This article studies how the choice of the mechanism of governance affects online ratings of hotels, empirically exploring the conditions under which various governance mechanisms improve (or damage) them. We emphasize that no governance mode is universally superior. However, when the mechanism of governance fits hotel characteristics, online ratings improve. We argue that such characteristics (i.e., hotel category, size, and age) determine the severity of agency problems (e.g., managerial shirking and free-riding) and the performance of governance choice. We test several organizational fit hypotheses on a data set of 2,328 hotels operating in Spain. Our results support the fit argument, because they show the superiority of franchise and management contracts (i.e., hybrids) for enhancing online ratings, as opposed to vertical integration, when category rises and size increases. Furthermore, we find evidence that maintenance does not appear to be a major problem in leasing. JEL CLASSIFICATION: D23; L25; L83

AB  - Investment attractiveness is an essential element of intensifying investment processes. The high level of investment attractiveness provides a stable inflow of investments into the country, additional revenues to the state budget, a better social environment in the country.
   As a proposed innovative transformation technology, tools for digitalization of public administration are described, aimed at improving the quality of services provided, harmonizing relationships between public administration entities, and optimizing and redistributing powers from state to municipal authorities.
   The article's primary goal is to develop a toolkit for assessing the investment attractiveness of an enterprise in the context of development.
   The authors studied the theoretical basis, analyzed the current state of investment activity in Ukraine. Based on the analysis, a methodology for the integral assessment of the investment attractiveness of an enterprise was proposed. The proposed method has the following advantages: an integrated approach, coverage of a large set of indicators and coefficients, accurate mathematical calculation of the indicator, which serves as a criterion for assessing investment attractiveness, allows you to consider the dynamics of indicators over several years.

AB  - In the last few years, large efforts have been made to develop new methods to optimize stress detection in crop fields. Thus, plant phenotyping based on imaging techniques has become an essential tool in agriculture. In particular, leaf temperature is a valuable indicator of the physiological status of plants, responding to both biotic and abiotic stressors. Often combined with other imaging sensors and data-mining techniques, thermography is crucial in the implementation of a more automatized, precise and sustainable agriculture. However, thermal data need some corrections related to the environmental and measuring conditions in order to achieve a correct interpretation of the data. This review focuses on the state of the art of thermography applied to the detection of biotic stress. The work will also revise the most important abiotic stress factors affecting the measurements as well as practical issues that need to be considered in order to implement this technique, particularly at the field scale.

AB  - In this study, to better our understanding of the current state of conservation of Cardisoma guanhumi and its habitats, we evaluated the potential spatio-temporal genomic damage of this species across five estuaries in Brazil. The experiment was performed over two consecutive years, and the sampling was performed in the winter and summer seasons. Two genetic tests - micronucleus test and comet assay - were used to quantify the DNA damage. Unlike in the summers and in the winter of 2013, in the winter of 2012 a significant increase was noted in the frequency of micronucleated cells and genomic damage index. The occurrence of genomic damage coincided with the arrival of the harsh winter of 2012 as the water sourced from the coastal rivers significantly affected the estuarine species under study. Our results confirmed that this species was resilient to the atypical climatic conditions, which facilitated the generation of excessive waste.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between the business environment, economic growth, urbanization, female labor force participation, and child mortality in African countries. Our method is to estimate the dependent variables, that is, growth and development factors, regressed on various groups of independent variables, that is, business development indicators. Our results show that the business environment has an impact on these economic and social variables. Specifically, stronger economic growth is associated with improvements in the environment for starting a business. Female labor force participation improves under conditions of better contract enforcement. Decreased child mortality is likewise associated with improvements in ease of starting a business, access to permits, and contract enforcement. The rate of urbanization shows weaker correlation with business environment variables suggesting that it is driven by other broader factors. We posit policy implications based on the reported correlations and associations, tying social equity and economic benefits to strengthened business environment variables.

AB  - The number of decisions permitting the removal of trees in cities is increasing every year, which suggests long-term negligence, or rather insufficient funds for proper management of urban forests. Lack of appropriate tools causes difficulties in the decision-making process. This problem is especially important in a situation of increased pressure exerted by residents to remove trees, mainly due to the safety reasons. An essential element in maintaining the proper tree management in a city is to improve management systems by applying comprehensive methods and tools. For this reason, many methods are used to support the inventory and identification of dangerous trees. The presented research is a response to the need for unification of management systems based on the most effective and proven methods of defining the resource, health and static condition, value, assessment of tree life expectancy or tree damage. Such a multilateral approach can improve the safety and management of urban forests. The results of the presented analyses led to the formulation of objective guidelines for the urban tree management standards.

AB  - Environmental managers often use indicator taxa to monitor full biodiversity and hidden environmental factors. For identifying practical indicators from assemblage data collected in the field, it is crucial to remove irrelevant variation, which unfortunately is not a common practice. We demonstrate, based on field data from Estonian forests, (i) how an attractive indicator group of macrofungi, perennial polypores, loses its apparent indicator value when variation in study effort and conspicuous environmental factors have been reduced; (ii) that simply including survey effort variation is sufficient to create significant covariation between species richness of taxon groups, which has often been taken as a justification for indicator assignment. These results imply that standardizing study effort should become a requirement for any field study that reports indicator taxa based on covariance patterns. We encourage researchers to be explicit and critical about the practical value of indicator taxa when compared with direct measurement of habitat conditions.

AB  - Domestic felines share the domestic environment with humans and have conditions that make them especially sensitive to genotoxic compounds, they are good candidates to be used as bioindicators in the biomonitoring of domestic environments. The objective of the study was to apply the micronucleus test in erythrocytes of domestic cats (Fells domesticus), and to evaluate them by Giemsa and fluorescent acridine orange (OA) stains carried out sequentially to identify the most suitable for this species. The micronucleus test was applied in peripheral blood erythrocytes of adult domestic cats, with and without signs of disease (total = 24). The frequencies of micronuclei detected with OA were 2 to 10-fold higher than those recorded with Giemsa (p<0.0001), without differences by age factor or health status. It is hypothesized that OA staining allowed the detection of micronuclei of smaller size than the Giemsa analysis. The observed frequency of micronuclei proposes the use of the domestic cat to perform biomonitoring on the effect of environmental genotoxics.

AB  - Metrics of water scarcity and stress have evolved over the last three decades from simple threshold indicators to holistic measures characterising human environments and freshwater sustainability. Metrics commonly estimate renewable freshwater resources using mean annual river runoff, which masks hydrological variability, and quantify subjectively socio-economic conditions characterising adaptive capacity. There is a marked absence of research evaluating whether these metrics of water scarcity are meaningful. We argue that measurement of water scarcity (1) be redefined physically in terms of the freshwater storage required to address imbalances in intra- and inter-annual fluxes of freshwater supply and demand; (2) abandons subjective quantifications of human environments and (3) be used to inform participatory decision-making processes that explore a wide range of options for addressing freshwater storage requirements beyond dams that include use of renewable groundwater, soil water and trading in virtual water. Further, we outline a conceptual framework redefining water scarcity in terms of freshwater storage.

AB  - This paper studies the heat transfer from warm water of constant temperature to human feet analytically and experimentally. This thermal process is represented by a simplified mathematical model: the foot is simplified, on the one hand, as a three-layer structure of skin, fat, and a core zone; Pennes bioheat equation is used, on the other, to describe the thermal process in the fat layer of the foot. An analytical solution is derived for the temperature distribution by applying the method of Laplace transform. A set of experiments were carried out in a climate chamber conditioned by a panel cooling system. Temperature response of feet and subjective thermal sensation were measured and collected. One of the principal findings from the preliminary theoretical and experimental studies is that the heat flux transferred from water to foot can probably serve as an indicator of the explanation of subjective thermal sensation.

AB  - Widespread iron oxide precipitation from groundwater in fine-grained red beds displays various patterns, including nodulation, banding and scallops and fingers. Hematite nodules have been reported also from the Meridiani Planum site on Mars and interpreted as evidence for the ancient presence of water on the red planet. Here we show that such patterns can autonomously emerge from a previously unrecognized Ostwald ripening mechanism and they capture rich information regarding ancient chemical and hydrologic environments. A linear instability analysis of the reaction-transport equations suggests that a pattern transition from nodules to bands may result from a symmetry breaking of mineral dissolution and precipitation triggered by groundwater advection. Round nodules tend to develop under nearly stagnant hydrologic conditions, while repetitive bands form in the presence of persistent water flows. Since water circulation is a prerequisite for a sustainable subsurface life, a Martian site with iron oxide precipitation bands, if one were found, may offer a better chance for detecting extraterrestrial biosignatures on Mars than would sites with nodules.

AB  - Aggregation raises attention in Nanotoxicology due to its methodological implications. Aggregation is a physical symptom of a more general physicochemical condition of colloidal particles, namely, colloidal stability. Colloidal stability is a global indicator of the tendency of a system to reduce its net surface energy, which may be achieved by homo-aggregation or hetero-aggregation, including location at bio-interfaces. However, the role of colloidal stability as a driver of ENM bioactivity has received little consideration thus far. In the present work, which focuses on the toxicity of nanoscaled Fe nanoparticles (nZVI) towards a model microalga, we demonstrate that colloidal stability is a fundamental driver of ENM bioactivity, comprehensively accounting for otherwise inexplicable differential biological effects. The present work throws light on basic aspects of Nanotoxicology, and reveals a key factor which may reconcile contradictory results on the influence of aggregation in bioactivity of ENMs.

KW  - ABUNDANCE

AB  - This is the first study of species composition of holoplanktonic molluscs of the Pacific coast of southern Mexico, focusing mainly on the Gulf of Tehuantepec. From two oceanographic surveys during summer 2007 and 2010, 40 zooplankton samples were obtained. A total of 40 species contained within 17 genera and 8 families was found. The results show 15 range extensions, including Atlanta californiensis and Carinaria japonica which were previously considered as endemic to the Transition Zone waters of the California Current, and Limacina helicina which was thought to only inhabit polar and subpolar waters. Atlanta gibbosa and Creseis chierchiae f. constricta are two new records for the American Pacific. The use of holoplanktonic molluscs as indicators of water masses is a common practice; however, these reported range extensions limit the validity of their use as indicators, at least within the environmental parameters established in previous studies. Although the 40 species found represent only 43% of the species recorded for the Pacific Ocean, it is noted that this species richness only represents summer conditions and an increase could be expected if sampling was extended to winter.

AB  - The paper deals with a frequent and known problem of suffusion type of sinkhole formation in soil, due to water level oscillations above karstified bedrock. The authors measured groundwater pressure oscillations caused by pumping groundwater from the excavated tunnel to determine the reliable indicators for prediction of sudden soil collapse based on risk assessment. The statistical analysis was performed to determine suspicious values, which reliably predict the soil collapse. The results of analysis of monitored values indicate very good time correlation coefficients with the failures. The work comprises the following main parts: (1) survey of the geologic environment; (2) monitoring of hydrodynamic conditions; and (3) acquisition of a forecasting criterion based on the statistical analysis of anomalous monitoring data. From this research, it might be concluded that the appearance time of sinkholes and the abnormal values were strongly linearly dependent with a correlation coefficient of over 99 %. This conclusion will be a contribution to estimate the risk of karst collapse in a similar environment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine how different phosphite and phosphate rates applied together affect the growth and morphology parameters in cucumber plants as well as to characterize the nutritional and physiological state of phosphorus (P). Different foliar application rates of phosphite were applied to analyze subsequent biomass production, the relative growth rate, morphological parameters, P bioindicators, P forms, and P-use efficiency. The data suggest that the application of phosphite as a P fertilizer at a rate of 0.5 mM would be an appropriate and effective strategy under suboptimal conditions of phosphate in the growth medium, represented by 0.5 mM in our work, as it improved the growth parameters, number of flowers, leaf area, nutritional state of P, incorporation of P in structural organs, and P-use efficiency by the plant. The results indicate that the validity of the foliar use of phosphite as a P fertilizer in cucumber plants was subject to phosphate availability in the culture medium.

AB  - In this study we investigate the empirical relationship between the size of the informal sector (as percentage of official GDP), carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in Turkey by using annual data from 1950 to 2009 and conducting a time-series analysis using cointegration techniques. This analysis is crucial as pollution emissions may lead to unfavorable weather conditions and potentially cause environmental impacts that may adversely affect the global economy. The empirical analysis shows evidence towards the existence of an inverted-U relationship between relative informal sector size and environmental pollution indicators in the long-run. That is small and large sizes of the shadow economy are associated with little environmental pollution and medium levels of the size of the shadow economy are associated with higher levels of environmental pollution. Moreover, using multivariate cointegration techniques, we suggest and test an economic mechanism to account for this observation. This also helps us to prescribe various policy recommendations regarding pollution and energy use.

AB  - Although the content of elements in coffee is only about 5 % (m/m), it seems to be a good indicator of the coffee authenticity. Apparently, it can bring the useful information about individual elemental patterns that are distinctive to the origin of growing soils for coffee plants in addition to cultivation and environmental conditions used. The elemental analysis of coffee by means of instrumental measurement methods may have other uses. It can be used to prove the high quality and safety of raw coffee beans, various coffee byproducts, and the final coffee product in the market. Commonly, different atomic absorption and emission spectrometry and instrumental neutron activation analysis methods are used to determine concentrations of various elements in green, roasted, and ground or instant coffees and coffee infusions, but these samples have to be suitably prepared prior to the analysis.

AB  - Altered levels of thiols in biological fluids are considered to be an important indicator for several diseases. In this article, 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-bromomethyl-difluoroboradiaza-s-indacene is proposed as a fluorescent derivatization reagent for the determination of thiols including glutathione, cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, and homocysteine by HPLC. Under the optimized derivatization and separation conditions, a baseline separation of all the four derivatives has been achieved using isocratic elution on an RP C-8 column within 26 min. With fluorescence detection at 505 and 525 nm for the excitation and emission, respectively, the LODs (S/N = 3) are from 0.2 nM (glutathione) to 0.8 nM (cysteine). The feasibility of this method in real samples has been evaluated by the determination of thiols in human plasma from the healthy persons and hypertensive patients with recoveries of 92-105.3%.

AB  - Freshwater sponge spicules were analyzed as a paleoenvironmental proxy indicator in five cores of ponds and alluvial fan sediments in the Upper Parana River's left bank, near Querencia do Norte town, northwestern of State of Parana, southern Brazil. Two optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates were obtained from sediments of ponds and one radiocarbon (C-14) date was obtained from the alluvial fan. Microscopic analysis of spicules preserved in the sediments allowed a determination of freshwater sponge species. The species assemblage provides evidence for dominantly dry conditions in the Upper Parana River during the Late Pleistocene. A wetter climate phase was recognized at C-14 7,540 yrs BP, with alluvial fan formation commencing at the transition of the dry Pleistocene climate to the Early Holocene wet climate. 'This wet interval was characterized by a sponge assemblage marked by the presence of the Neotropical families and typically associated with lotic environments. Sponge spicules analysis from pond sediments reject the possibility that lotic environments contributed to pond genesis and evolution.

AB  - Near-surface air temperature (NSAT) directly reflects the thermal conditions above the ground and has been considered as a relevant indicator of resident health in urban regions. The rapid retrieval of NSAT data is necessary to assess urban environments. In this paper, a method of NSAT retrieval is developed that employs Landsat Thematic Mapper images using an Energy Balance Bowen Ratio model. This model is established based on the energy balance over land and the Bowen ratio. The degree of retrieval error obtained when using this model is determined on the basis of a comparison with the observed values obtained from weather stations; the mean error is approximately 2.21 A degrees C. Moreover, the spatial relationship between NSAT and urban wetlands is analyzed using Geographical Information System technology. The results show that wetlands have an obvious influence on atmospheric temperature and that this influence decreases as the distance from the wetland increases. When that distance is less than 300 m, its influence on the NSAT is significant.

AB  - In recent years, geographic information systems (GIS) have become a powerful tool for mapping and assessing the provision of ecosystem services within a landscape. GIS can help land managers and conservationists visualize spatial and temporal patterns and changes in ecosystem services and estimate the potential impact from projected changes in land use or management or climatic conditions on the provision of these services. The end-goal of ecosystem service assessment is usually to estimate marginal values of ecosystem services to inform decisions where trade-offs in ecosystem service provision will affect human well-being. Because our ability to estimate the provision of ecosystem services underlies our ability to estimate their societal values, the theoretical bases of GIS approaches and models for assessing ecosystem services need to be well understood before they are employed for decision-making purposes. This paper reviews GIS approaches and software developed for the assessment of ecosystem services and highlights their strengths and weaknesses in the context of different end uses.

AB  - Contamination of public water ways with sewage represents a serious environmental and health risk. We monitored pollution of the river Thames by enumerating the indicator organism Escherichia coli. Samples were taken from a site in central London near Waterloo Bridge in different seasons. E.?coli were quantified using a membrane filtration method, and correlated with the tidal variations of the river and meteorological data on rainfall and temperature. More frequent and severe incidents of pollution occurred in the autumn. Heavy rainfall resulted in sharp peaks of E.?coli contamination that implies a potential increase of numbers of pathogenic micro-organisms. Sixty percent of all samples were found to be in excess of the accepted upper limit of pollution set by European Union (EU) legislation for bathing water. This study demonstrated that frequent sewage pollution of the Thames results in high numbers of E.?coli and incidents of detectable levels of pathogenic bacteria demonstrating the need for regular monitoring of bacterial pollution.

AB  - Recent interest in use of satellite remote sensing for environmental compliance and remediation assessment has been heightened by growing policy requirements and the need to provide more rapid and efficient monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. However, remote sensing solutions are attractive only to the extent that they can deliver environmentally relevant information in a meaningful and time-sensitive manner. Unfortunately, the extent to which satellite-based remote sensing satisfies the demands for compliance and remediation assessment under the conditions of an actual environmental accident or calamity has not been well documented. In this study a remote sensing solution to the problem of site remediation and environmental compliance assessment was introduced based on the use of the RDX anomaly detection algorithm and vegetation indices developed from the Tasseled Cap Transform. Results of this analysis illustrate how the use of standard vegetation transforms, integrated into an anomaly detection strategy, enable the time-sequenced tracking of site remediation progress. Based on these results credible evidence can be produced to support compliance evaluation and remediation assessment following major environmental disasters.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition results in accumulation of N-rich organic matter in urban forests. Partial removal of vegetation and humus layer (REMOVAL treatment) was used to reduce N content of soil and to improve the establishment and performance of planted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings in urban boreal forest sites. Corresponding rural sites of a similar forest type with background N deposition were used as a reference. The REMOVAL treatment increased shoot and root biomass of the seedlings, but did not affect fungal biomass in the roots. The treatment decreased peroxidase activity, an indicator of physiological stress, in roots, which suggests an overall improvement of soil conditions. Present results thus imply amelioration of stress in Scots pine roots in urban soil environment by partial removal of vegetation and the humus layer. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - High-resolution records of organic and inorganic geochemical proxies document environmental changes during Oceanic Anoxic Event 1b for the Albian upwelling system at DSDP Site 545 Mazagan Plateau off NW Africa. Sea surface temperature estimates based on TEX86 analyses show an abrupt rise by similar to 3 degrees C concurrent with a more than 2-fold increase in accumulation rates for organic carbon and siliciclastic sediment components. Geochemical grain-size indicators (Si/Al and Zr/Al) indicate the influx of overall finer grained sediment during the event. Our data suggest that the warming phase associated with OAE 1b resulted in an attenuation of the NE trade wind system and a weakening of local upwelling conditions. Higher amounts of precipitation over NW Africa and an associated higher continental run off may have supplied nutrients to the eastern North Atlantic and fostered the production of organic matter and black shale deposition.

AB  - Background For veterinary management of non-human primates in captivity, and conservation of wild-living primates, management of their health risks is necessary. Incidences of pathogenic bacteria in the fecal specimens are considered as one of the useful indicators for non-invasive health monitoring.
   Methods We carried out the detection of Clostridium perfringens in feces from captive and wild chimpanzees by the rapid polymerase chain reaction method.
   Results The bacterium was detected in most fecal specimens (80%) in captive chimpanzees. Contrarily, the detection rate in the wild chimpanzees was low, with 23% (n = 12) of 53 fecal samples from the Bossou group, Guinea, and 1.2% (1/81) in the Mahale group, Tanzania.
   Conclusions These results show that the intestinal microflora differs between Pan populations under various living conditions, being influenced by their diet and environment.

TI  - Creation of visible artificial optical emissions in the aurora by high-power radio waves
T2  - NATURE
LA  - English
AB  - Generation of artificial light in the sky by means of high-power radio waves interacting with the ionospheric plasma has been envisaged since the early days of radio exploration of the upper atmosphere, with proposed applications ranging from regional night-time street lighting to atmospheric measurements(1). Weak optical emissions have been produced for decades in such ionospheric 'heating' experiments, where they serve as key indicators of electron acceleration, thermal heating, and other effects of incompletely understood wave - particle interactions in the plasma under conditions difficult to replicate in the laboratory(2). The extremely low intensities produced previously have, however, required sensitive instrumentation for detection, preventing applications beyond scientific research. Here we report observations of radio-induced optical emissions bright enough to be seen by the naked eye, and produced not in the quiet midlatitude ionosphere, but in the midst of a pulsating natural aurora. This may open the door to visual applications of ionospheric heating technology or provide a way to probe the dynamics of the natural aurora and magnetosphere.

AB  - - Sexual dimorphism, growth and maturation patterns of Testudo g. graeca in the Central Jbilets, Morocco. - Sexual size dimorphism and the growth and maturation patterns were studied in the Mediterranean Spur-thighed Tortoise (Testudo g. graeca), in the central Jbilets mountains (western Morocco). The number and width of scute growth annuli were respectively used as indicators of age at sexual maturity and of juvenile growth rates. Males reach their sexual maturity earlier than females but juvenile growth rates do not differ between sexes. Thence, when reaching sexual maturity males are smaller than females. However, important age and size inter-individual variations were observed at maturity. In both sexes, precocious individuals show high juvenile growth rates but reach a smaller body size at maturity than late individuals. Therefore, sexual maturity depends on juvenile growth rates. The important individual variations in age and size at maturity could reflect the plasticity of individual growth and maturation in response to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - High-molecular-weight dissolved organic matter (HMW-DOM, > 1,000 Daltons) is actively involved in the global biogeochemical cycling of many elements, but its carbon sources and detailed formation pathways are still not well understood. In this study, we measured bulk stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios, lipid composition, and compound-specific carbon isotopic ratios of HMW-DOM samples collected from four U.S. estuaries (Boston Harbor/Massachusetts Bay, Delaware/Chesapeake Bay, San Diego Bay, and San Francisco Bay). Analytical results show (1) a fraction of HMW-DOM (lipid associated) in estuarine and coastal waters is derived from bacteria and phytoplankton; (2) this fraction of HMW-DOM is formed by various release processes of bacterial membrane components and bacterial reworking of phytoplankton-derived material; (3) this fraction of HMW-DOM is generally present in all samples from different coastal systems despite variable organic matter inputs and environmental conditions, suggesting an important bacterial role in HMW-DOM formation.

AB  - Direct belowground nitrogen (N) transfer has often been reported where plants with contrasting nutrients acquisition strategies (N-2-fixing and non-fixing) co-occur, and there is still a gap in the knowledge of the extent of this transfer in the top soil under the field conditions. However, assessment under field conditions is challenging. We hypothesized a practical application of the analysis of natural abundance of delta N-15 supplemented with an isotopic mixing model 'IsoSource' to understand the relative direct contribution of N-2-fixing Alnus acuminata to wheat intercrop (non-fixing) N isotopic signatures. A field experiment was conducted in an andic soil of high lands in northern Rwanda to quantitatively determine the proportional contribution of nitrogen by Alnus acuminata to wheat vegetative tissue isotope signatures at different distances from the trees (1 m, 3 m, 5 m, and 7 m). The study involved the measurements and analyses of natural abundance of stable isotopes delta N-15 and isotopic mixing modeling by IsoSource. Leaf samples were collected from twigs of 10 years old Alnus acuminata grown on the terrace-risers, along with soil samples (0-20 cm) and wheat flag leaf samples across terrace at 1 m, 3 m, 5 m, and 7 m from trees for isotopic measurement. The chlorophyll content index of wheat flag leaf at the four points across terrace was estimated by means of SPAD meter 502. The delta N-15 proportional contribution by Alnus acuminata to wheat was obtained through IsoSource analysis. We noted a significant (p < 0 center dot 01) gradient in depletion of wheat delta N-15 signatures moving further away from the tree line of Alnus acuminata. The wheat at 1 m from the trees exhibited the delta N-15 values closer to that of the tree, while at 7 m, the crop delta N-15 signature was significantly different from that of the tree. An isotopic mixing model 'IsoSource' indicated that the tree N may have provided 33 center dot 6 +/- 4 center dot 3 % of the wheat intercrop N at 1 m distance from the trees. Therefore, this study shows that the understanding of field-based crop N and nutrient transfer in agroforestry may be enhanced by analysis of the physiological basis of stable isotopes signatures.

AB  - Accurate nitrogen (N) diagnosis early in the growing season across diverse soil, weather, and management conditions is challenging. Strategies using multi-source data are hypothesized to perform significantly better than approaches using crop sensing information alone. The objective of this study was to evaluate, across diverse environments, the potential for integrating genetic (e.g., comparative relative maturity and growing degree units to key developmental growth stages), environmental (e.g., soil and weather), and management (e.g., seeding rate, irrigation, previous crop, and preplant N rate) information with active canopy sensor data for improved corn N nutrition index (NNI) prediction using machine learning methods. Thirteen site-year corn (Zea mays L.) N rate experiments involving eight N treatments conducted in four US Midwest states in 2015 and 2016 were used for this study. A proximal RapidSCAN CS-45 active canopy sensor was used to collect corn canopy reflectance data around the V9 developmental growth stage. The utility of vegetation indices and ancillary data for predicting corn aboveground biomass, plant N concentration, plant N uptake, and NNI was evaluated using singular variable regression and machine learning methods. The results indicated that when the genetic, environmental, and management data were used together with the active canopy sensor data, corn N status indicators could be more reliably predicted either using support vector regression (R-2 = 0.74-0.90 for prediction) or random forest regression models (R-2 = 0.84-0.93 for prediction), as compared with using the best-performing single vegetation index or using a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference red edge (NDRE) together (R-2 < 0.30). The N diagnostic accuracy based on the NNI was 87% using the data fusion approach with random forest regression (kappa statistic = 0.75), which was better than the result of a support vector regression model using the same inputs. The NDRE index was consistently ranked as the most important variable for predicting all the four corn N status indicators, followed by the preplant N rate. It is concluded that incorporating genetic, environmental, and management information with canopy sensing data can significantly improve in-season corn N status prediction and diagnosis across diverse soil and weather conditions.

AB  - Background: People hold a wide variety of beliefs concerning the causes of illness. Such beliefs vary across cultures and, among immigrants, may be influenced by many factors, including level of acculturation, gender, level of education, and experience of illness and treatment. This study examines illness causal beliefs in Turkish-immigrants in Australia.
   Methods: Causal beliefs about somatic and mental illness were examined in a sample of 444 members of the Turkish population of Melbourne. The socio-demographic characteristics of the sample were broadly similar to those of the Melbourne Turkish community. Five issues were examined: the structure of causal beliefs; the relative frequency of natural, supernatural and metaphysical beliefs; ascription of somatic, mental, or both somatic and mental conditions to the various causes; the correlations of belief types with socio-demographic, modernizing and acculturation variables; and the relationship between causal beliefs and current illness.
   Results: Principal components analysis revealed two broad factors, accounting for 58 percent of the variation in scores on illness belief scales, distinctly interpretable as natural and supernatural beliefs. Second, beliefs in natural causes were more frequent than beliefs in supernatural causes. Third, some causal beliefs were commonly linked to both somatic and mental conditions while others were regarded as more specific to either somatic or mental disorders. Last, there was a range of correlations between endorsement of belief types and factors defining heterogeneity within the community, including with demographic factors, indicators of modernizing and acculturative processes, and the current presence of illness.
   Conclusion: Results supported the classification of causal beliefs proposed by Murdock, Wilson & Frederick, with a division into natural and supernatural causes. While belief in natural causes is more common, belief in supernatural causes persists despite modernizing and acculturative influences. Different types of causal beliefs are held in relation to somatic or mental illness, and a variety of apparently logically incompatible beliefs may be concurrently held. Illness causal beliefs are dynamic and are related to demographic, modernizing, and acculturative factors, and to the current presence of illness. Any assumption of uniformity of illness causal beliefs within a community, even one that is relatively culturally homogeneous, is likely to be misleading. A better understanding of the diversity, and determinants, of illness causal beliefs can be of value in improving our understanding of illness experience, the clinical process, and in developing more effective health services and population health strategies.

AB  - In order to explore the changes that autonomous vehicles on the road would bring to the current traffic and make full use of the intelligent features of autonomous vehicles, the article defines a self-balancing system of autonomous vehicles. Based on queuing theory and stochastic process, the self-balancing system model with self-balancing characteristics is established to balance the utilization rate of autonomous vehicles under the conditions of ensuring demand and avoiding an uneven distribution of vehicle resources in the road network. The performance indicators of the system are calculated by the MVA (Mean Value Analysis) method. The analysis results show that the self-balancing process could reduce the average waiting time of customers significantly in the system, alleviate the service pressure while ensuring travel demand, fundamentally solve the phenomenon of concentrated idleness after the use of vehicles in the current traffic, maximize the use of the mobile vehicles in the system, and realize the self-balancing of the traffic network while reducing environmental pollution and saving energy.

AB  - The conveyor transport inevitably generates a large amount of dust during the coal mining process, which severely threatens the heath of miners and causes waste of resources. Therefore, a central topic of the coal mine occupational safety research concerns the control of dust associated with conveyor transport. This process prepares an environmentally-friendly wetting cementing agent suitable for controlling dust generated by conveyor transport. Subsequently, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy are employed to analyze the microscopic reaction and structure of the product; besides, single factor tests are carried out to determine the optimal synthesis condition based on choosing the anti-bending strength of the hardened film derived from the product as the performance indicator; by thoroughly studying the characteristics of the prepared product, the present research concludes that the newly developed cementing agent can deliver decent dust suppression effect.

AB  - Aquatic insects having a high diversity are good biotic indicators for freshwater quality. Their larvae living in freshwater are sensitive to pesticides, and its impacts has been examined not only through laboratory toxicity studies using water and sediment exposure but also through higher-tier micro-/mesocosm studies and field monitoring. Many sophisticated statistical methods have been applied to assess the impacts of pesticides at levels from species to community, but their body burden has been studied much less, especially in relation to toxicity. We review the uptake, metabolism with relevant detoxifying enzymes, and depuration of pesticides in aquatic insect larvae, which determine their body burden and help to understand the toxicity profiles specific to each chemical class. We also discuss experimental conditions, environmental factors, and species sensitivity in relation to the bioconcentration/-accumulation and toxicity of pesticides.

AB  - Urban climate modifications like the urban heat island (UHI) have been extensively investigated in temperate regions. In contrast, the understanding of how urbanization relates to climate in hot, hyperarid environments is still extremely limited, despite the growing socioeconomic relevance of arid lands and their fast urbanization rate. We explore here the relationship between land cover and temperature regime in hot desert cities (HDCs) based on estimates of land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, and impervious surface areas inferred from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat satellite products. Our analysis shows that HDCs display common climatic patterns, with downtown areas on average cooler than suburbs during the daytime (urban cool island) and warmer at night (classical UHI). The observed diurnal cool island effect can be largely explained by relative vegetation abundance, percentage of bare soil, and local climatic conditions and calls for a more in deep investigation of the physical processes regulating boundary layer dynamics in arid regions.

AB  - Topsoil organic carbon (TOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are fundamental in the carbon cycle influencing soil functions and attributes. Many factors have effects on soil carbon content such as climate, parent material, land topography and the human action including agriculture, which sometimes caused a severe loss in soil carbon content. This has resulted in a significant differentiation in TOC or SOC at the continental scale due to the different territorial and socioeconomic conditions. The present study proposes an exploratory data analysis assessing the relationship between the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon and selected socioeconomic attributes at the local scale in Italy with the aim to provide differentiated responses for a more sustainable use of land. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis contributed to understand the effectiveness of local communities responses for an adequate comprehension of the role of soil as carbon sink.

AB  - The analytical steady-state statistical sputtering model (SS-SSM) is utilized to interpret molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of depth profiling of Ag solids with keV cluster beams of C-60 and Au-3 under different incident energy and angle conditions. Specifically, the results of the MD simulations provide the input to the SS-SSM and the result is a depth profile of a delta layer. It has been found that the rms roughness of each system correlates with the total displacement yield, a new quantity introduced in this study that follows naturally from the SS-SSM. The results indicate that the best depth profiles occur when the displacement yield is low and the sputtering yield is high. Moreover, it is determined that the expected value of the delta layer position as calculated from a depth profile rather than the peak position in the depth profile is the best indicator of the actual delta layer position.

AB  - For the most typical two-layer wetland with free-water-surface-effect, analytically explored in this paper is the environmental dispersion in terms of the longitudinal evolution of the depth-averaged concentration. Taylor's classical analysis for soluble matter dispersion in a single phase fluid flow is rigorously generalized for the two-layer case of a wetland flow to develop the dispersion model. The velocity profile of the fully developed flow through the wetland is derived, with that for the single-layer wetland flow included as a special case. Aris's method of concentration moments is applied to determine the dispersivity with an asymptotic time variation. For typical contaminant constituents of chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus, total nitrogen and heavy metal, the process of dispersion is shown characteristic of a hierarchical structure in the critical length and duration of the contaminant cloud.

AB  - Cable modal parameters (natural frequencies and damping ratios) that represent the cable inherent dynamic characteristics play an important role in the construction, vibration control, condition assessment, and long-term health monitoring of cable-supported structures. The existing options to identify cable modal parameters through vibration measurements are somewhat limited. For this purpose, a cable dynamic stiffness based method is presented to effectively identify the cable modal parameters. In the first part of this two-part paper, the cable dynamic stiffness is analytically discussed for a viscously damped, uniform, inclined sagging cable supported at the lower end and subjected to a harmonically varying arbitrary angle displacement excitation in an arbitrary angle at the upper end when the cable is assumed to have a parabolic profile at its position of static equilibrium. Special attention is paid to the physical meaning and significance of every part of the frequency-dependent closed-form cable dynamic stiffness. Comprehensive numerical analyses have been carried out and a simplified cable dynamic stiffness is proposed for the purpose of identifying the cable modal parameters with a good accuracy over a wide range of frequencies.

AB  - The public sector has been a prominent actor in the urban housing sector in the State of West Bengal for the past three decades. Reform measures introduced since 1990 have led to a shift in the mode of public housing delivery from direct provision to providing housing in the market model. The concept of private-sector participation in construction and finance has emerged as a natural response to meet the colossal demand for housing within government's dwindling budgetary capacity and a need for a catalyst to boost macroeconomic conditions. Paradoxically, the public-sector agencies are leading the reform initiatives by assuming the role of a real estate developer. The paper reviews the housing output in Kolkata in the pre- and postreform eras in terms of housing quantity, quality, price and affordability. It is argued that new reforms have been successful in stimulating the overall housing market, but more targeted programmes are needed to improve the supply, quality and affordability for low-income families in the city.

AB  - Late Pleistocene climatically induced environmental changes are reconstructed by applying a multidisciplinary approach on floodplain sediments of small- to medium-sized catchments in central Germany. Radiocarbon dating, pollen analysis and the presence of an accurately dated tephra layer allow the establishment of a reliable chronology. The beginning of the Younger Dryas is marked by a change in fluvial activity that lasts for several hundred years. During this period gravels and sands were deposited by a braided river system. Fluvial systems at this time were predominantly controlled by the climatic conditions of the surrounding uplands, where the climatic deterioration led to a lowering of the forest limit and enhanced periglacial slope processes. An open pine forest prevailed in the basin areas and no evidence of slope wash and solifluction was found. The second part of the Younger Dryas is characterised by a meandering fluvial system and the deposition of overbank fines. The rapid transition From Younger Dryas to Preboreal coincides with an increase in organic deposition, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses of alkylbiphenyls and alkyldiphenylmethanes have been performed on a series of crude oils reservoired in the Gippsland Basin (Australia), as well as in some marine coastal sediments contaminated with a condensate. Changes in the isomeric distribution of the alkylbiphenyls and alkyldiphenylmethanes with increasing biodegradation were investigated. The relative abundance and distributions of the isomers were found to change significantly with increasing biodegradation. Isomers with the 4-substituent(s) generally increase in abundance relative to isomers that lack this feature. Thus, alkylbiphenyl and alkyldiphenylmethane isomeric distributions are useful indicators of the extent of petroleum biodegradation in reservoirs and surface sediments. It is suggested that geosynthetic processes and/or relative susceptibilities of certain isomers to microbial attack can account for changes in the isomeric distribution of these components with increasing biodegradation. Significant differences in the relative abundances of the methylbiphenyls are apparent and are probably due to variations in the conditions that the petroleum had been subjected to in the two contrasting environments.

AB  - The construction of a new section of the M-40 ring road will give rise to a redistribution of traffic in the city of Madrid and its outskirts. The use of a geographical information system (GIS) has provided a suitable instrument for assessing and locating traffic effects before and after the new infrastructure enters service. Traffic information was used as basic input data for drawing up a pollution map, taking a standard day with unchanging weather conditions. The model chosen used several parameters to compute the concentrations of pollutants at ground level. Finally, the pollution map was cross-referenced with the standard maps in order to locate and quantify the population affected by the different pollution levels and the wildlife and historic and/or archaeological features at risk. The assessment was made before and after construction of the new road. The utilization of GIS methodology allowed the environmental changes to be automatically located with the use of a personal computer. This proved to be an effective tool for carrying out environmental impact assessments.

AB  - 1. A new technique was developed to extract soluble proteins from the intracellular dinoflagellate symbionts (zooxanthellae) of cnidarians, suitable for analysis by denaturing gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
   2. Using this technique, a highly abundant 33 kDa protein has been detected from the zooxanthellae of both a temperate sea anemone (Anemonia viridis) and three tropical corals (Goniopora djiboutiensis, G. pandoraensis and G. stokesi).
   3. Relative abundance of the protein varies with thermal shock, season, habitat from which the specimens were collected and laboratory holding conditions.
   4. Amino acid sequence analyses and searches of current CD-ROM databases failed to find a significant match for a 31 residue amino-terminus sequence or an 8 residue internal sequence, but showed a partial (9 residue) homology with the vertebrate ''high-mobility group'' (HMG) nuclear proteins which are involved with DNA binding and unwinding during replication. We are currently seeking funds to further investigate this apparently novel protein, with a view to assessing its potential role as an indicator of environmental stress in cnidarian zooxanthellae.

AB  - The search for new investment evaluation techniques is justified by the increasing gap between the current scenario and the technological and environmental conditions where the 'traditional' techniques have been developed.  This is particularly true for 'embryonic technologies'-those technologies so innovative that the actual number of their operative applications is still negligible.  It is important to evaluate the relevance of the technology since its embryonic stage springs from the need to assess its impact over society as a whole.
   A survey of economic literature underlines that neither traditional nor innovative techniques are able properly to evaluate embryonic technologies:  beyond the need for historic data, they barely stress the role played by linkages between the expected benefits and the economic participants involved in determining the success of the technology.  An evaluation model is thus developed which focuses on those elements.  The way to build a set of indicators useful for assessing the potential of embryonic technology and monitoring its evolution is also depicted.  An example related to an embryonic technology (advanced robotics) is discussed.

AB  - Tillage is a primary agricultural task that causes progressive soil movement and, consequently, severe erosion in sloping farmland, with a high impact on crop productivity, soil quality and landscape features. Governments and public administrations acknowledge the need to control tillage operations for a better soil conservation in vulnerable areas, recommending the practice of contour farming. Despite this importance, there is currently no mechanism for the effective and large-scale monitoring of tillage patterns at the field or regional scale. Accordingly, this research combined aerial images taken with unmanned aerial vehicles and object-based image analysis (OBIA) to develop an innovative OBIA4tillage procedure with three main objectives: (i) analysing plowed agricultural fields, identifying and mapping the tillage marks, and automatically computing the main direction of the tillage furrows, (ii) validating the procedure quality in different scenarios by evaluating the accuracy of the results as affected by the sensor used (visible-light vs. multispectral), background soil hue, and ground vegetation density; and (iii) mapping contour farming and non-contour farming areas as indicators of potential low and high soil erosion risk, respectively. Twenty olive parcels from two different locations with a wide range of tree sizes, soil hue, parcel shapes and land slopes were selected as model systems to develop and validate the procedure. The OBIA4tillage procedure produced tillage maps with very high accuracy for both RGB and multispectral images (R-2 of 0.99 and 0.93, respectively), as obtained from the linear equation between estimated and groundtruth values. The results were similar in clear and dark soils (R-2 of 0.96 in both cases), although there were notable differences between areas of dense ground vegetation or bare soil (R-2 of 0.99 in both cases) and areas of medium vegetation cover (R-2 of 0.81). The application of contour farming in the study region was moderate at location 1 (42.35% of the study area) but more widespread at location 2 (72.60% of the study area), which revealed the uneven involvement of the local farmers in the challenge of controlling soil erosion risks. The valuable information in the OBIA4tillage outputs can also be used to study tillage events at various spatial and temporal scales, feed soil erosion models and promote good agricultural and environmental conditions measures implemented at the parcel scale.

AB  - It is established that maritime infrastructure is an important component of the economy of Ukraine, the effective functioning of which is a necessary factor of the determination of Ukraine as a maritime state, the sustainable development of its transport and road complex. It is proved that the efficiency of ports is of utmost importance for the economy of Ukraine, as more than 60% of the Ukrainian products are exported by sea. A more detailed analysis of the efficiency of the seaports is important not only from the commercial point of view of Ukraine as a whole and one particular seaport, but also from the point of view of economic policy in the port industry. It is proved that there is an urgent need to introduce effective and timely reforms of the maritime economy, based on the identification of a complex of factors influencing the processes of strategic development of seaports of Ukraine and aimed at improving the system of management of state-owned enterprises, taking into account world experience, upswinging state regulation of port business, improving the competitiveness of the port business, upgrading the role of maritime transport in using the potential of international transport corridors. The variants of the efficiency criterion of the seaport have been developed, allowing to evaluate the activity of the port in different conditions and to compare the activity of different ports with each other. The efficiency of the criteria is checked, their interrelation is shown and recommendations for their calculation are given. With the help of the offered criteria work efficiency of the Ukrainian and foreign ports is compared, ways of development of the Ukrainian ports are specified. An analysis of the publications and studies carried out on the topic of evaluating port performance shows that most researchers pay attention to economic evaluation criteria. Technical criteria for the port's operational efficiency are considered less frequently and in many cases are not adapted for integral assessment due to the lack of sufficient information. The main aim of the article is to compare the performance of the Ukrainian and foreign ports. Research objectives: to develop objective in-kind performance indicators for ports, allowing them to evaluate port activities in different conditions and compare the activities of different ports with each other; to check the operability of port performance indicators; to compare the performance of Ukrainian and foreign ports with each other using the proposed natural indicators.

AB  - The relevance of the work is caused by preservation of the existing building, which is in the zone of influence of new construction. After identification of engineering-geological processes affecting adversely the conditions of operation of the facility, and determination of parameters on which the development of such processes depend, there is a need to assess the level of risk. Recently, the correlation and regression analysis of data regime observations, based on the probability-statistical group of methods - naturally random nature of the development of processes in time and space, is the most frequently used one.
   The main aim of the research is the statistical analysis of the characteristics of building deformation values under the influence of new construction, finding and description of the relationship between sedimentary marks and deformation signs located on the buildings, evaluation of operation mode of elementary natural and technical systems in complex engineering-geological conditions, analysis of accumulated engineering-geological information on the object, including the results of pre-construction surveys.
   Methods: analysis of regime observations with the help of autocorrelation function, comparison of the results with the data of natural long-term observations, representation of the object of study in the form of a complex system consisting of a set of elements between which there are relations and interactions, establishment of a set of dangers, allocation of risk zones for a certain object in the form of possible losses in time, assessment of the vulnerability of affected objects from each of the identified processes, the forecast of the development of technopriodic hazards in space, deformation shooting.
   Results. One of the most important components of ensuring reliable and safe operation of any facility is a monitoring system. On the basis of the data obtained during the implementation of lithomonitoring, the system state is monitored by comparing the values of the observed indicators with the standard system of criteria; the management solutions are developed to optimize its operation. Analysis of all the collected materials, as well as the results of diagnostics of the lithotechnical system at the current time, allows identifying the paragenesis of engineering-geological processes that determine the possibility of developing extreme situations that pose a threat to the safe operation of the facility. It is advisable to build maps of the differences that reflect changes in the properties of the interaction of the technical object and the geological body and determine the direction of further development of the state of the system.

AB  - Peat and gyttja (organic lake sediment) are important indicators for past environmental conditions; they form in areas where the supply of clastic sediment is insufficient to fill the accommodation space. Previous studies of delta sediments, however, have focused mainly on clastic deposits, whereas organics have received only minimal attention. Identification of organic facies can be of value for understanding delta formation as it provides insight into, for example, palaeoenvironmental conditions and compaction susceptibility of these layers. Currently, however, field characteristics of organics are not well-documented for the full range of facies present in delta plains. In this study, a field method a classification key for identifying organic facies in delta plains was developed based on concisely described organic facies in selected cores from the Rhine-Meuse delta, The Netherlands. This method was tested on archived borehole descriptions of the diachronous basal peat layer in the distal Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta; this was done by means of a semi-automated procedure to select and classify samples from a database. The resulting data set was used for mapping organic facies in the basal peat layer by means of indicator kriging and inverse distance weighting. The resulting facies distribution map shows consistent and geologically meaningful patterns, which were interpreted in terms of hydrological regimes. The formation of the basal peat layer, which marks the onset of Holocene aggradation, has been controlled by marine-dominated, fluvial-dominated and seepage-dominated environments. Before 9000 cal yr bp, marine processes influenced the initial stage of organic accumulation in the western part of The Netherlands. After 9000 cal yr bp, on the flanks of topographical higher regions, seepage-dominated mesotrophic organic facies characterized the onset of accumulation. Simultaneously, nutrient-rich organic facies could develop in the Rhine-Meuse valley: gyttja formed in the sediment-limited Meuse realm, whereas reed peat accumulated in the Rhine realm, indicating lower water depths and thus a higher elevated surface level. It is concluded that the classification key for identifying organic facies is a strong tool to better recognize peat and gyttja types on the basis of macroscopic field characteristics. Application of the key on archived boreholes also proved to be feasible. Identification of organic facies and determination of their spatial distribution at delta scale, as is shown in this study, contributes to understanding delta evolution.

AB  - In this study, n-alkanes, isoprenoids and n-alkyl-ketones were detected in lacustrine sediments in the Maogou section of the Linxia Basin, NE Tibetan Plateau, NW China. The distribution characteristics of these compounds correspond to arid climate change in inland Asia from the upper Oligocene to the Pliocene. The characteristic bimodal distribution of n-alkanes, which was observed in the investigated samples, is centered on n-C-17-n-C-20 and has maximum values at n-C-18 in all samples; n-C-27-n-C-31 has maximum values at n-C-29 in some of the samples. The front mode shows a weak even carbon number predominance of short-chain n-alkanes (CPI17-21 0.55-0.89); in contrast, the back mode has a strong odd carbon number predominance of long-chain n-alkanes (CPI25-31, 1.41-2.42). Changes in the nC(27)/nC(31) ratio (woody plants/grassy plants) along the entire section corresponded to three climate stages: an arid to humid climate stage from similar to 22.5 to 18.4 Ma; 6.25 to 5.5 Ma; and two major humid stages at similar to 18.4 Ma and similar to 5.5 Ma. A warm-humid climate was identified for the similar to 10 Ma to similar to 9 Ma period, which turned to an arid-cold climate from similar to 8 Ma to similar to 7.5 Ma, by assessing changes in the (n-C-17-n-C-21)/(n-C-27-n-C-31) ratios. Warm-humid conditions gradually increased from similar to 7.5 Ma to similar to 5.5 Ma, as has been confirmed by multiple geochemical climate indicators. A distinctive climate change toward arid-cold conditions at similar to 8 Ma corresponded to a striking increase in the high-carbon-numbered n-alkanes and a rapid decrease in the (n-C-17-n-C-21)/(n-C-27-n-C-31) and n-C-27/n-C-31 ratios of n-alkanes, which suggests a large input of higher plants. Our observation from the biomarker analysis is in agreement with previous reports that used palynofloras to determine that climate change in the investigated region responded to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau at similar to 8 Ma.

AB  - Fungicides are the last line of defence in the armoury of an integrated disease management (IDM) approach. They do not create yield, but protect an inherent yield potential that the grower may realize in the absence of disease. In the field, securing effective disease control from fungicide applications is dependent upon the disease pressure and the effectiveness of the fungicide to control that disease. Globally, the same fungicide active ingredients are used against a similar range of fungal pathogens. However, in the presence of the pathogen, the level of economic response to fungicide applications is primarily driven by the prevailing environmental conditions and their interactions with crop development and the pathogen. Fungicides are canopy management tools that influence the size and duration of the green leaf area (GLA) of the crop. The total number of fungicide applications links to the length of the growing season and the disease risk in that period. For example, the top three leaves of a wheat crop canopy might warrant protection for approximately 120 days in an irrigated wheat crop on the Canterbury Plains of New Zealand, but only 60 days in the dry land wheat crops of the Victorian Mallee in Australia. Combining our knowledge of fungicide effect on the crop canopy with soil water and nutrient availability enables better matching of fungicide product, dose and timing to a specific disease risk. It also enables better use of crop physiology models, such as APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems Simulator), to assist with in-crop fungicide decisions. This paper reviews the role of fungicides, principally the triazoles (FRAC Group 3), strobilurins (Group 11) and SDHI's succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (Group 7), in cereal disease management. It explains (i) why applying foliar fungicide by plant development stage (as well as disease threshold) confers advantages when fungicide mode of action and on-farm logistics are taken into consideration; (ii) gives examples of how fungicide management strategies are adjusted in Australia and New Zealand to take account of environmental conditions; and (iii) explains the importance of green leaf retention (GLR) in the realization of an economic response from fungicides. ResumeLes fongicides constituent l'ultime ligne de defense dans l'arsenal d'une approche de gestion des maladies par lutte integree. Ils n'accroissent pas le rendement, mais protegent le rendement possible qu'un producteur pourrait obtenir en l'absence de maladies. Au champ, la lutte efficace contre les maladies decoulant de l'application de fongicides depend de la pression exercee par la maladie et de l'efficacite du fongicide a lutter contre cette maladie. Globalement, les memes ingredients actifs d'un fongicide sont utilises contre une gamme d'agents pathogenes fongiques similaires. Toutefois, en presence d'un agent pathogene, le niveau de reponse economique aux applications de fongicide est avant tout conditionne par les conditions courantes du milieu et leurs interactions avec le developpement vegetatif et l'agent pathogene. Les fongicides sont des outils de gestion du couvert vegetal qui influencent la taille et la duree de la surface foliaire verte de la culture. Le nombre total d'applications de fongicide est lie a la longueur de la saison de croissance et au risque d'incidence de la maladie durant cette periode.
   Par exemple, les trois feuilles superieures du ble, en tant que couvert vegetal, peuvent offrir une protection pendant environ 120 jours dans un champ irrigue dans les plaines de Canterbury en Nouvelle-Zelande, mais seulement 60 sur les terres arides du Mallee australien de la region de Victoria. La combinaison de nos connaissances sur les effets des fongicides sur le couvert vegetal de la culture a l'eau du sol et a la disponibilite des nutriments permet de mieux cibler le produit ainsi que la quantite a utiliser et de synchroniser son application en fonction du risque possible d'une maladie particuliere. Cela permet egalement une meilleure utilisation des modeles physiologiques des cultures comme APSIM (Agricultural Production System Simulator) afin d'aider dans le choix du fongicide pour la premiere application de postlevee. Cet article passe en revue le role des fongicides, principalement des triazoles (FRAC Groupe 3), des strobilurines (Groupe 11) et des inhibiteurs de la succinate deshydrogenase (Groupe 7) dans la gestion des maladies des cereales. Il explique pourquoi l'application d'un fongicide foliaire en fonction des stades de developpement de la plante (et du seuil de la maladie) offre des avantages quand le mode d'action du fongicide et la logistique associee a la ferme sont pris en consideration; il donne des exemples de l'adaptation des strategies de gestion des fongicides utilisees en Australie et en Nouvelle-Zelande visant a prendre en compte les conditions de milieu; et il explique l'importance de la retention de la surface foliaire verte afin d'obtenir une reponse economique a l'utilisation des fongicides.

AB  - There is increasing concern about Norwegian salmon farming and the possible environmental impacts from sea lice, escaped fish and release of toxic chemicals and organic emissions to the coastal waters. Closed containment systems (CCS) have the potential to eliminate the problems with sea lice and to reduce escapes and emissions. When closing the cages, water volumes and velocity are regulated and the identification of optimal current velocities for growth and fish welfare from sea transfer to harvest size becomes necessary. This study describes two trials with LOW (0.10-0.27 BL/s) and MODERATE (0.36-0.63 BL/s) water velocity on performance of post-smolt Atlantic salmon in CCS. In trial 1 (168 days, 10.9 degrees C, fish size: 884-3007 g and 41.5-59.0 cm), round weight increased with 219 g (p = .012) and condition factor with 0.11 (p = .016) in the MODERATE group compared with LOW group. The MODERATE group obtained specific growth rate (SGR) of 0.76 and thermal growth coefficient (TGC) of 2.75, compared to 0.72 and 2.56 in the LOW group. MODERATE water velocity was also associated with higher relative heart size (RHS) (p = .016), higher liver index (HSI) (p = .005), increased fillet yield (p <= .001) and lower levels of cathepsin activity in muscle tissue. In trial 2 (46 days, 7.1 degrees C, fish size: 327-482 g and 29.9-33.7 cm), round weight increased with 52 g (p = .019) and condition factor with 0.05 (p = .009) in the MODERATE group compared with LOW group. The MODERATE group obtained SGR of 0.77 and TGC of 2.68, compared to SGR of 0.60 and TGC of 2.02 in the LOW group. No significant difference was observed in white muscle cell hyperplasia, measured as the proportion of small (< 20 mu m diameter) muscle fibres (p = .145). Both trials showed only minor differences in slaughter yield, fillet quality (protein, fat, water) and mortality. The present study shows that moderate water velocity (0.36-0.63 BL/s) is favourable for growth rates for Atlantic salmon during the entire on-growing period in CCS. Effects on a broader range of metabolic variables and welfare indicators were also documented.

AB  - Purpose. Determining the possible level of air dustiness during the bucket hoisting of uranium ores along the shaft "Holovnyi" of the mine "Novokostiantynivska", SE "VostGOK".
   Methods. To determine the level of air dustiness, a physical modelling of this process under laboratory conditions was used. Physical modelling of the dust formation process has been performed on a laboratory bench, which consisted of an AT-2K-250/500 wind tunnel with non-return-flow and a closed working section, as well as an aspirator with a drive and hoses for sampling and filtration of air. The granulometric composition has been determined for modelling: the parameters of large-sized fractions-by the linear method (i.e., measurements of the geometric dimensions of the separate pieces and their weighting), and the composition of fine-sized fractions (-15 + 0 mm) by sieve analysis and weighing.
   Findings. The granulometric composition of the rock mass has been determined, which is planned to get out by a bucket hoisting method along the shaft "Holovnyi", and the dust formation process has been modelled on a laboratory bench. It has been set that the level of air dustiness during the rock mass hoisting will be significantly influenced by its humidity or the additional binding of ore fines in the upper layer if to treat the surface with acting agents. Moreover, it is influenced by the uniformity of these fines distribution within the bucket volume, which, in turn, will depend on the way of its loading. It is recommended to use the vibrating feeder for loading the bucket. Thus, the sufficient natural moisture of the rock mass (more than 4%) will ensure the level of dust content of the emitted air below the normative indicators.
   Originality. It has been determined that the dust content in the air depends on the moisture of the rock mass and the presence of moisture in the ore to more than 4% reduces the level of dust in the air to 0.4-0.45 mg/m(3), which is 0.67-0.75 of the existing safe dust concentration for such conditions.
   Practical implications. The result obtained confirms the possibility of using the bucket hoisting method along the shaft "Holovnyi" to the daylight surface of uranium ores mined at the mine "Novokostiantynivska" (provided that the proposed recommendations will be observed) without exceeding the existing safe dust concentration of air supplied to the mine.

AB  - The light-use efficiency CLUE) model of photosynthesis is widely used to estimate ecosystem photosynthesis and net primary production from remote sensing measurements. The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(APAR)) is a dominant term in this model, and it is fundamentally important for model calculations of ecosystem productivity across large areas. The LUE term is sometimes considered a constant, but may be best represented as a variable scalar under stress conditions. The main objective of this study was to better understand factors influencing f(APAR), its relationship with seasonal variation in canopy greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)), and the consequences of potential seasonal changes in the NDVI-f(APAR) relationship for LUE model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis in a semi-arid grassland. We used two approaches to determine f(APAR), (i) direct incoming and outgoing radiation measurements above and below the canopy, and (ii) an inversion approach based on incident photosynthetically active radiation and the light response curve of net ecosystem productivity measured by eddy covariance at low light levels. The two approaches resulted in f(APAR) values that were very strongly correlated during the initial development of the canopy until peak leaf area index (LAI) was reached. During this time, a strong linear relationship also occurred between f(APAR) and NDVI calculated from spectral reflectance measurements of the grassland canopy. After peak LAI, there was hysteresis in the NDVI-f(APAR) relationship, and the two f(APAR) estimates diverged. Light-use efficiency model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis made using f(APAR) values were strongly correlated with chamber CO2 exchange measurements during the initial development of the canopy leaf area. After peak LAI, a stress function, based on either soil moisture or vapour pressure deficit (VPD) measurements, was necessary to reduce quantum yield and model calculations of ecosystem photosynthesis during periods of relatively low soil moisture and higher VPD later in the growing season. Both stress functions were similarly effective in improving the correlation between modeled and measured ecosystem photosynthesis values, and indicated reduced LUE under late season conditions. Modulating LUE based on the Photochemical Reflectance Index or the Water Band Index (both proposed as possible indicators of LUE) was not effective to improve the correlation between modeled and measured ecosystem photosynthesis values in this ecosystem.

AB  - A longitudinal study was conducted in Southeast Uganda for 14 months on 640 Zebu cattle kept under natural tick challenge, with a view to identifying clinical features for prediction of seroconversion to Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina and Theileria parva infections. Physical examination, condition scoring and tick counts were undertaken on all cattle every 4 weeks. In addition, 5300 sera were collected and analysed for antibodies against A. marginale, B. bigemina and T parva infections using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The major clinical features compiled included weight loss, fever (rectal temperature), anaemia (packed cell volume), pallor of mucous membranes, lymph node enlargement, staring coat, diarrhoea and lacrymation. The risk factors included tick challenge at village level, sex, age, Rhipicephalus spp. density and Boophilus spp. density on individual animals. Using a binary logistic regression model, the clinical features and risk factors were analysed. The results suggest that increasing rectal temperature was associated with increased probability for seroconversion to A. marginale, while high level of Rhipicephalus spp. density and increasing packed cell volume (PCV) were significantly associated with reduced probability of seroconversion. Although statistically significant, none of the factors had large effects, with odds ratios (OR) of 0.87, 1.15 and 0.98 for Rhipicephalus spp. density, rectal temperature and PCV, respectively. For B. bigemina infection, a high level of Boophilus spp. density, anaemia and staring coat were significantly associated with increased probability of seroconversion (OR 1.50, 1.78, 1.37, respectively). Presence of lacrymation and old age were associated with reduced probability of seroconversion (OR 0.52, 0.86 respectively). For T parva infection, lymph node enlargement (OR 1.30) was associated with increased probability of seroconversion, while high Rhipicephalus spp. density and increasing packed cell volume (PCV) were associated with reduced probability of seroconversion (OR 0.68 and 0.98, respectively). In conclusion, presence and intensity of the respective tick vectors for tick-borne diseases, age and clinical features such as anaemia, fever, staring coat, lymph node enlargement and lacrymation are indicators for seroconversion to A. marginale, B. bigemina and T parva infections in cattle. These indicators for seroconversion could be exploited in the development of decision support tools for clinical diagnosis of tick-borne diseases. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Palynological analyses of 60 surface sediment samples from estuarine environments near Vancouver Island, including the Georgia Strait (GS), the Effingham (EFF) and the Seymour-Belize (SB) Inlets were performed in order to document the distribution of dinoflagellate cyst assemblages and their relationship to hydrographic conditions, productivity and nutrient concentrations. We tested transfer functions using the analogue method, and suggest that dinoflagellate cyst assemblages can be used to reconstruct primary productivity, temperature and salinity. The EFF and SB Inlets are characterized by a dominance of autotrophic taxa, particularly Operculodinium centrocarpum, whereas the Protoperidinoid and gymnodinial heterotrophic taxa such as Quinquecuspis concreta and Brigantedinium spp. dominate the assemblages of the GS. Multivariate analysis shows that this distribution is closely linked to primary productivity, sea-surface temperature (SST) and spring silica concentration. The abundance of autotrophic taxa in the EFF and SB Inlets is associated with high primary productivity and low summer SST, indicating summer upwelling of coastal British Columbia, whereas the heterotrophic taxa that characterizes the GS assemblages are related to low productivity, high summer SST and high silica concentration during spring. Multivariate analysis shows that the most important environmental parameters related to dinocyst distribution in the restricted embayment of the GS, are distance to the shore, distance to Vancouver Harbor, spring sea surface salinity (SSS), spring phosphate concentration and spring productivity. The autotrophic taxa are generally more common in coastal and shallow waters, but Spiniferites ramosus and Pentapharsodinium dalei show an opposite correlation to spring productivity and salinity. P dalei is particularly abundant around Vancouver Harbor, near highly urbanized shores and within the Fraser River plume, where salinity is low and spring productivity and continental runoff are high. S. ramosus shows its highest abundance on the western coast of GS. Protoperidinioid and gymnodinial cysts characterize distal zones within the central and southern GS that are associated with a mixture of brackish waters coming from the Fraser River and deep upwelling waters entering the GS via Juan de Fuca Strait. The relationship between dinoflagellate cyst assemblages and primary productivity in these estuarine systems differs from that in oceanic and outer neritic zones, where the abundance of heterotrophic taxa is commonly associated with upwelling and high productivity.

AB  - Modifications of the hydrology of the Florida Everglades began in the 1880s. Impacts due to changes in the hydrological regime, as well as nutrient enrichment are clear in the northern Everglades. Although these changes were more subtle in the southern Everglades, altered hydroperiods and plant communities are targeted for restoration. Identification of restoration goals requires knowledge of past conditions, but detailed vegetation surveys prior to the pre-drainage era are lacking. Palynological studies can help fill this void. Interpretations based upon pollen and plant spores alone are limited by low pollen production of the dominant marsh species and low plant diversity in the ecosystem.
   In some regions the occurrence of other microfossils present in palynological preparations has been used to help interpret hydrological regimes and nutrient status and here we explore that potential for paleoecological records from the Everglades. In this study we report the distribution of various microfossils found within pollen zones identified in sediments cored from three tree islands in Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park. Using published modem pollen analogues we classified paleovegetation zones as slough, sawgrass marsh, tree island or tree island edge and documented the abundances of microfossils of algae, fungi, cyanobacteria and testate amoebae. Tree island zones, indicative of relatively short hydroperiods, were characterized by highest abundances of fungal material, testate amoebae and the base of the deposits, by the cyanobacterium, Gloeotrichia. Much of the fungal material appears to be associated with plant roots, and the mycorrhizal Glomus is locally abundant. The taxonomic affinity of the testate amoebae has not been determined, but some were arcellaceous forms that included charcoal particles in their tests. Gloeotrichia also is found in marsh and slough deposits. Its occurrence in the latter probably signals minimal water depth. Botryococcus and Zynemataceae zygospores are found in all deposits, but are less abundant in the tree island deposits. Both groups are probably part of the periphyton flora, but Botryococcus has not been recorded in phycological studies of the Everglades. Observation of these algae in the seasonally dry Everglades is consistent with other studies where they have been reported to represent shallow, slow moving waters, but inconsistent with the assumptions of meso- or cutrophic conditions commonly made in other studies. Our observation of the alga Botryoccocus and the meroplanktonic cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia in the historically oligotrophic Everglades challenges their status as indicators of nutrient enrichment.

AB  - Black Sea anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) undertake extensive overwintering migrations every fall from nursery grounds to warmer overwintering areas located on the south-eastern coast of the Black Sea. During migration and particularly upon arrival at the Anatolian coast, they support an important fishery and valuable source of income for the regional community. Black Sea anchovy have undergone significant stock fluctuations partly related to climatic conditions, for example, migrating anchovy schools arrived late or failed to arrive at the Anatolian coast when fall temperatures increased. It is therefore of importance to understand the conditions required for successful overwintering migration and explore different migration routes. This study invokes a Lagrangian modeling approach applied to satellite derived circulation and temperature data as a first attempt to model anchovy migration dynamics in the Black Sea. This modeling approach takes the influence of the physical environment into account, while the quality of overwintering grounds, adaptive, schooling, and homing behavior is neglected. The model is used to investigate the possible influence of interannual and seasonal variability of temperature and surface currents, as well as the influence of migration behavior on the success of anchovy overwintering migration for both the Black Sea and Azov Sea anchovy. The results of the present work show the possibility that overwintering anchovy fished along the Turkish Eastern Anatolian coast may not exclusively originate from the northwestern shelf, but mainly from the eastern Black Sea basin. Migration pathways are identified for both Black Sea and Azov Sea anchovy, which are of importance for the national fisheries efforts of riparian countries. The modeling results are in agreement with general patterns of anchovy migration given in the literature indicating that the physical environment may be a major factor in shaping general migration patterns. Simulation results are used to hypothesize about alternatives to previously determined migration routes and provide potential reasons that explain the inability of the Bulgarian anchovy fishery to recover. Results show that the intensity and timing of autumnal cooling, coupled with current strength, can be of significant importance in determining annual and seasonal variability of migration success. Considering the need for fisheries management to account for the variability in fishable overwintering anchovy stocks a modeling approach as developed in the current study may provide such a tool.

AB  - P>The Black Sea chemocline represents the largest extant habitat of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria and harbours a monospecific population of Chlorobium phylotype BS-1. High-sensitivity measurements of underwater irradiance and sulfide revealed that the optical properties of the overlying water column were similar across the Black Sea basin, whereas the vertical profiles of sulfide varied strongly between sampling sites and caused a dome-shaped three-dimensional distribution of the green sulfur bacteria. In the centres of the western and eastern basins the population of BS-1 reached upward to depths of 80 and 95 m, respectively, but were detected only at 145 m depth close to the shelf. Using highly concentrated chemocline samples from the centres of the western and eastern basins, the cells were found to be capable of anoxygenic photosynthesis under in situ light conditions and exhibited a photosynthesis-irradiance curve similar to low-light-adapted laboratory cultures of Chlorobium BS-1. Application of a highly specific RT-qPCR method which targets the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rrn operon of BS-1 demonstrated that only cells at the central station are physiologically active in contrast to those at the Black Sea periphery. Based on the detection of ITS-DNA sequences in the flocculent surface layer of deep-sea sediments across the Black Sea, the population of BS-1 has occupied the major part of the basin for the last decade. The continued presence of intact but non-growing BS-1 cells at the periphery of the Black Sea indicates that the cells can survive long-distant transport and exhibit unusually low maintenance energy requirements. According to laboratory measurements, Chlorobium BS-1 has a maintenance energy requirement of similar to 1.6-4.9 center dot 10-15 kJ cell-1 day-1 which is the lowest value determined for any bacterial culture so far. Chlorobium BS-1 thus is particularly well adapted to survival under the extreme low-light conditions of the Black Sea, and can be used as a laboratory model to elucidate general cellular mechanisms of long-term starvation survival. Because of its adaptation to extreme low-light marine environments, Chlorobium BS-1 also represents a suitable indicator for palaeoceanography studies of deep photic zone anoxia in ancient oceans.

AB  - Aim To test predictions of different large-scale biodiversity hypotheses by analysing species richness patterns of vascular plants in the Austrian Alps.
   Location The Austrian part of the Alps (c. 53,500 km(2)).
   Methods Within the floristic inventory of Central Europe the Austrian part of the Alps were systematically mapped for vascular plants. Data collection was based on a rectangular grid of 5 x 3 arc minutes (34-35 km(2)). Emerging species richness patterns were correlated with several environmental factors using generalized linear models. Primary environmental variables like temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration were used to test climate-related hypotheses of species richness. Additionally, spatial and temporal variations in climatic conditions were considered. Bedrock geology, particularly the amount of calcareous substrates, the proximity to rivers and lakes and secondary variables like topographic, edaphic and land-use heterogeneity were used as additional predictors. Model results were evaluated by correlating modelled and observed species numbers.
   Result Our final multiple regression model explains c. 50% of the variance in species richness patterns. Model evaluation results in a correlation coefficient of 0.64 between modelled and observed species numbers in an independent test data set. Climatic variables like temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) proved to be by far the most important predictors. In general, variables indicating climatic favourableness like the maxima of temperature and PET performed better than those indicating stress, like the respective minima. Bedrock mineralogy, especially the amount of calcareous substrate, had some additional explanatory power but was less influential than suggested by comparable studies. The amount of precipitation does not have any effect on species richness regionally. Among the descriptors of heterogeneity, edaphic and land-use heterogeneity are more closely correlated with species numbers than topographic heterogeneity.
   Main conclusions The results support energy-driven processes as primary determinants of vascular plant species richness in temperate mountains. Stressful conditions obviously decrease species numbers, but presence of favourable habitats has higher predictive power in the context of species richness modelling. The importance of precipitation for driving global species diversity patterns is not necessarily reflected regionally. Annual range of temperature, an indicator of short-term climatic stability, proved to be of minor importance for the determination of regional species richness patterns. In general, our study suggests environmental heterogeneity to be of rather low predictive value for species richness patterns regionally. However, it may gain importance at more local scales.

AB  - The relevance of research. The effectiveness of the implementation of strategic plans is the most important condition for the implementation of strategic planning systems, particularly at the level of the territory, as the closest to the population. This determines the relevance of improving the quality and efficiency of strategic management and development of territories, where great importance is attached to small and medium-sized businesses in the strategic planning system, which is not just a separate area of development of the regional economy, taking into account sectoral and territorial factors, but also a tool for reforming the entire socio-economical system, an important factor in the stabilization and development of the social sphere, services, improving the quality of life of the population. Purpose of the study. In the conditions of modern realities, effective development of territories is impossible without the use of tools for innovative modernization. At the same time, it is advisable to develop strategic directions for the development of the territory on the basis of their classification according to the level of development of innovative potential. The article generalizes the system of indicators characterizing the multidirectional development of territories based on the materials of the Karaganda region. The object of the research is the regional economic environment influencing the development of the territory of the Karaganda region. The subject of the research is indicators that reflect the interests of the main participants in regional strategic development. Research methodology and methods. The research methodology is a set of methods, mechanisms, principles, measures to improve the efficiency of the development of single-industry towns of strategic importance. The methodological basis of the study was the dialectical method of analyzing economic processes and a systematic approach. To solve the set tasks, the work used general scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, the unity of historical and logical, inductive and deductive, abstraction, a graphical method for presenting the results.

AB  - Dedolomitization converts a dolomite into a calcite, and conventionally is interpreted to form in an eogenetic or telogenetic diagenetic environment where meteoric water dissolves evaporites to supply excess calcium. Hydrologic connectivity between a dolostone and the surface water may then lead to a dedolomitized interval, often times being a diagnostic indicator for an erosional unconformity, subaerial exposure, and/or karst. In contrast to the classic models, we present a case study for pervasive burial dedolomitization, unrelated to meteoric fluids. Dedolomitization of the Zechstein-2-Carbonate (Ca2) gas reservoir in NW Germany is strongly altering reservoir quality on a regional scale. The Ca2 shows a textbook correlation between reservoir quality and mineralogy. Petrographic analyses show that approximately 80% of all observed calcite reveal a dedolomite microtexture, causing a reduction of average matrix porosity by 5 to 10% compared to the dolomite. Dedolomite follows initial layering and abundantly forms massive concretions, which are surrounded by compaction-related curvature of the depositional layering in the dolomite host rock. Such an early burial timing is supported by a slight burial-related shift of similar to 3 parts per thousand delta O-18 and similar to 1 parts per thousand delta C-13 towards lighter values in the dedolomites compared to dolomite. An exceptionally large amount of calcium-rich fluids must have been mobilized to account for > 50% of the Ca2 rock volume to be dedolomitized. However, core fabrics related to meteoric diagenesis, such as karst fabrics or typical fresh water stable isotope signatures have been observed neither in the Ca2 nor in over- and underlying anhydrite beds. Instead, excess calcium likely comes from gypsum-to-anhydrite conversion and pressure solution within over- and underlying anhydrites. An influx of strontium-rich waters from the anhydrite beds is indicated by up to 5 times higher strontium contents measured in dedolomite fabrics compared to their dolomite host rock. Homogenization temperatures between 51 and 56 degrees C measured in some early fluid inclusions in dedolomite textures further exclude a pristine meteoric water input and suggest fluid entrapment in a burial depth range of 900 to 1400 m. Comparing these results with literature data furthermore indicates that mesogenetic dedolomite is either volumetrically underestimated in other carbonate-evaporite settings or formed under unique diagenetic conditions across the Southern Permian Basin during Zechstein times.

AB  - The delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of fossil brachiopod shells have been widely used as paleoenvironmental proxies. In this study, we investigated intrashell and intraspecific variations in the isotopic and minor element concentrations of well-preserved shells of the brachiopod Kikaithyris hanzawai (Yabe) from the last glacial period (similar to 20 ka [Last Glacial Maximum; LGM] and similar to 70 ka [Marine Isotope Stage 4; MIS4]), collected in the Central Ryukyus, and used these data to estimate the paleoceano-graphic conditions (seawater temperature, concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC], and delta C-13 value of DIC [delta(CDIC)-C-13]). The delta C-13 and delta(18) O profiles along the maximum growth axis, obtained from the inner shell surface, show three distinct intervals, corresponding to changes in shell morphology. These results suggest that the bulk isotopic compositions of brachiopods with complex shell morphologies are unsuitable for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Nevertheless, there exists a specific shell portion with relatively small intrashell and intraspecific variations. The past seawater temperatures derived from the delta(18O) values of this portion are consistent with the alkenone-and planktic foraminiferal Mg/Ca-based past seawater temperatures reported in previous studies. The past delta(CDIC)-C-13 values estimated from the delta C-13 values of the specific shell portion are within the range of the past delta C-13 DIC values calculated from known atmospheric and oceanographic parameters. The past DIC concentrations reconstructed from the brachiopod-based delta(CDIC)-C-13 values are lower than the present concentrations in the East China Sea, which can be explained by low partial pressure of CO2 during the last glacial period. These results indicate that the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values obtained from K. hanzawai shells are potential paleoenvironmental indicators. The intrashell and intraspecific variations in the K. hanzawai shells are different for each minor element. Some anomalously high Mn and Fe concentrations in the shells are probably caused by metabolic factor(s), not by meteoric diagenesis. This suggests that the minor element concentrations are useful but not perfect for distinguishing diagenetically altered and unaltered portions of the shells of K. hanzawai in the studied succession.

AB  - An analysis of the sea ice proxy IP25 and the open water phytoplankton indicator brassicasterol has been carried out for 93 surface sediments collected from the Barents Sea and some additional data from previous studies have been included to augment the analysis further. Consistent with a specific and selective sea ice diatom origin for IP25, this biomarker was identified in virtually all sediments from seasonally ice-covered locations, but was absent from the majority of sites beyond the maximum sea ice extent (MSIE) for the period 1983-2002. In contrast, brassicasterol was detected in virtually all sediments from the region and concentrations were not at all associated with the MSIE. Instead, more localised regions of brassicasterol concentrations were identified and these likely reflect different influences on production and deposition. When the IP25 and brassicasterol concentrations were combined together in the form of the previously proposed PBIP25 index, the aforementioned association between IP25 occurrence and the MSIE was clarified further and, in addition, provided more detailed descriptions of sea ice cover. In particular, PBIP25 data indicated seasonal sea ice or marginal ice zone conditions for the region of the Barents Sea within the MSIE according to previously defined PBIP25 ranges. We also amalgamated the biomarker data from the current study with those derived previously by Muller et al. (2011) and compared these larger datasets with satellite-derived mean spring sea ice concentrations. Significantly, although the correlation between the combined IP25 concentration dataset with the satellite data was very similar to that reported previously by Willer et al. (2011), the corresponding correlation using the PBIP25 values was poorer with the larger dataset and some possible reasons for this are discussed. Finally, in a small number of cases, IP25 was identified in sediments somewhat distal from the MSIE, and it is hypothesised that the occurrence of IP25 in these sediments results from allochthonous input following sediment advection between shelf and trough environments. This is the first reported example that provides evidence for the allochthonous input of IP25 into marine sediments and it is recommended that this should be considered carefully when carrying out palaeo sea ice reconstructions based on the occurrence of this biomarker in the future.

AB  - Drought is the most important limitation to sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) production in the UK and other areas dependent on usually insufficient summer rainfall. As increased irrigation is not a viable answer to the problem, an economically and environmentally desirable solution is new varieties with decreased sensitivity to water deficits. However, there is little genotypic information on drought tolerance in sugar beet, and breeders are not equipped to make these selections. The objectives of this study were to asses, the degree of genotypic diversity for drought-related morpho-physiological traits and to measure the strength of association between these traits and indicators of crop performance. 46 sugar beet genotypes with diverse, genetic backarounds were tested in three field experiments from 1999 to 2001. Drought was imposed by covering plots with fame polythene tunnels, allowing the crop to grow solely on stored soil moisture. Agronomic characters and drought tolerance indices are described in a companion paper [Ober et al., Assessing the genetic resources to improve drought tolerance in sugar beet. Agronomic traits of diverse genotypes under droughted and irrigated conditions. Field Crops Res., in press]. In this report, we show that there were significant genotypic differences for stomatal conductance, succulence index. specific leaf weight, and osmotic adjustment, but not for photosynthetic rate, relative water content or total water use. Patterns of water use within the soil profile differed between genotypes some extracted more water from deep soil layers. The maintenance of green foliage cover during drought was positively correlated with drought tolerance index, which was negatively correlated with succulence index and scores for wilting and leaf senescence. Droughted sugar yield was positively correlated with soil water extraction and negatively correlated with relative leaf expansion rate measured in late summer. Under irrigated conditions, there was high positive correlation between transpiration rate and sugar yield. Genotype x trait biplots showed superior genotypes with relatively greater expression of combinations of favourable traits, The results suggest that succulence index and wilting score could be used to cull inferior plants in early stages of breeding programs, and green foliage cover and patterns of water use could help identify superior genotypes in elite germplasm. These data should enable tools to be developed for indirect selection of,genotypes suited to drought-prone environments. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cattle breeding programs that strive to reduce the animal-level incidence of lameness are often hindered by the availability of informative phenotypes. As a result, indicator traits of lameness (i.e., hoof health and morphological conformation scores) can be used to improve the accuracy of selection and subsequent genetic gain. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to estimate the variance components for hoof health traits using various phenotypes collected from a representative sample of Irish dairy cows. Also of interest to the present study was the genetic relationship between both hoof health traits and conformation traits with producer-scored lameness. Producer-recorded lameness events and linear conformation scores from 307,657 and 117,859 Irish dairy cows, respectively, were used. Data on hoof health (i.e., overgrown sole, white line disease, and sole hemorrhage), mobility scores, and body condition scores were also available from a research study on up to 11,282 Irish commercial dairy cows. Linear mixed models were used to quantify variance components for each trait and to estimate genetic correlations among traits. The estimated genetic parameters for hoof health traits in the present study were greater (i.e., heritability range: 0.005 to 0.27) than previously reported in dairy cows. With the exception of analyses that considered hoof health traits in repeatability models, little difference in estimated variance components existed among the various hoof-health phenotypes. Results also suggest that producer-recorded lameness is correlated with both hoof health (i.e., genetic correlation up to 0.48) and cow mobility (i.e., genetic correlation = 0.64). Moreover, cows that genetically tend to have rear feet that appear more parallel when viewed from the rear are also genetically more predisposed to lameness (genetic correlation = 0.39); genetic correlations between lameness and other feet and leg type traits, as well as between lameness and frame type traits, were not different from zero. Results suggest that if the population breeding goal was to reduce lameness incidence, improve hoof health, or improve cow mobility, genetic selection for either of these traits should indirectly benefit the other traits. Results were used to quantify the genetic gains achievable for lameness when alternative phenotypes are available.

AB  - We report here high-resolution Mn/Ca ratios of planktonic foraminifer, Globigerinoides sacculifer from ODP Site 1144 in the northern South China Sea (SCS). The variation pattern of the Mn/Ca ratios of G. sacculifier from the top 170 mcd is very similar to those of the generally used paleoclimate records. such as delta O-18 of Globigerinoides ruber and SSTs derived from Mg/Ca ratios of G. sacculifer. Robust Milankovitch periodicities are presented in the power spectrum of the Mn/Ca record, as well its in those of the other paleoclimate records, Suggesting orbital forcing for the variation of the Mn/Ca ratios. Further spectral analysis indicates that the variations of the Mn/Ca ratios lead those of the delta O-18 of G. ruber at all the orbital periodicities, and are roughly in pace with or slightly lead those of the SSTs at eccentricity and obliquity periodicities, but lag behind that of the SSTs at precession periodicity. This suggests that the driven forcing for the variation of the Mn/Ca ratios mainly associate with those for the SSTs. Comparisons between the Mn/Ca ratios and other geochemical proxies for redox condition in sediments show that higher Mn/Ca ratios of G. sacculifer generally correspond to higher authigenic Mn concentrations and lower contents of total Sulfur (TS) and total organic carbon (TOC). Thus, the Mn coatings in the G. sacculifer at ODP Site 1144 are mainly associated with Mn oxides. and the variation of the Mn/Ca ratios of G. sacculifer appears to indicate changes of redox condition in sediments. Exception is observed at the top 10 mcd, in which the Mn/Ca ratios show an upward decreasing trend and low core-top values, while other proxies Suggest oxic environment in this section. The low Mn/Ca ratios agree with the general low Mn/Ca ratios in foraminifer tests from core-top sediments in the SCS. and seem to attribute to the fact that authigenic Mn precipitation are mainly generated within sediment column rather than at sediment Surface and the oxidation states for them may change from Mn(III) oxyhydroxides to Mn(IV) oxides after burial. However, details are not well known yet. Despite Of Such Uncertainties, the response of the variation of the Mn/Ca ratios of G. sacculifer to paleoclimate changes is significant, indicating that it is an informative paleoclimate indicator.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. A series of severe air pollution episodes in Europe and North America prior to 1960 have focused scientific and regulatory attention on the adverse effects of air pollution on human health. As a consequence of significant reductions in ambient air pollution levels in the intervening years, scientists and public health officials have become more concerned with the potential health effects of exposure to routine concentrations of air pollution. Several recent time series studies conducted worldwide have found relatively low levels of air pollutants that are below national standards were associated with adverse effects on mortality and morbidity. This study examined the effects of ambient air pollution indicators on the daily rate of pediatric hospital admissions for asthma in the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area from 2001-2003.
   Methods. Data were collected for the number of children : 14 years old hospitalized for asthma on a daily basis (N = 1270) and ambient concentrations of NO2, O-3, PM2.5, mold and pollen concentrations, and meso-scale meteorological conditions.
   Results. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed significant relationships between the total number of hospitalizations per day and the one-hour maximum NO2 level, the proportion of susceptible children < 5 years old, and the ratio of temperature to humidity.
   Discussion. This study of the total number of children aged <= 14 years old experiencing hospitalizations on a daily basis in the Oklahoma City area from 2001-2003 underscores factors other than ambient air pollution, especially when concentrations are low, affect hospitalizations for pediatric asthma. For example, information related to indoor air quality, health care, family history, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and other irritants are not obtainable. Yet, those factors are risk drivers for asthma. Similarly, health privacy requirements prevented obtaining data on physiological factors specific to each child such as differentials in airways functional capacity or other impairments influenced asthma exacerbation. This makes calculating relative risk inappropriate.
   Conclusions. Although ambient air pollution concentrations and meteorological conditions influence pediatric asthma hospitalizations, they are not the major predictors in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. This is consistent with other research that finds limited effects associated with low levels for concentrations of the criteria pollutants.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. Although limiting concentrations for criteria air pollutants to levels below human health-based standards exhibited beneficial effects, other factors also need to be identified and addressed in order to reduce pediatric hospitalizations for asthma.

AB  - A high-resolution calcareous nannofossil record is presented from the Lower Albian Niveau Paquier black shale from the Vocontian Basin (SE France). The Niveau Paquier black shale represents the regional equivalent of the supraregionally distributed Oceanic Anoxic Event 1b (OAE 1b). To reconstruct surface water fertility, a nutrient index based on Zeugrhabdotus erectus, Discorhabdus rotatorius (high fertility indicators), and Watznaueria barnesae (low fertility indicator) was established using principal component analysis. In addition, the distribution of Nannoconus spp. and absolute abundances of coccoliths (coccoliths per gram) were used for reconstructing nutricline dynamics of the surface waters. High surface water fertility coincides with low percentages of nannoconids and vice versa. Moreover, high percentages of nannoconids correlate with low absolute abundances of all other coccoliths. Based on the observed nannoplankton distribution pattern and a suggested similarity in ecological requirements between nannoconids and the modern taxon Florisphaera profunda, a model is proposed that couples nannoconid abundances with dynamics of the nutricline. Time series analyses of the nutrient index show fluctuations within the precessional band. The precession-controlled fluctuations of the surface water fertility may represent a monsoonal signal, with the nutrient supply in the surface waters depending on the strength of monsoonal activity. During periods of enhanced monsoonal activity, which were characterized by humid conditions and stronger winds, mixing of the upper water column was enhanced. During that time, the abundance of nannoconids decreased as a consequence of enhanced wind stress that improved vertical mixing and led to an entrainment of nutrients into the surface waters. This resulted in an increase of primary production. During periods of reduced monsoonal activity, marked by drier conditions and reduced wind stress, the surface waters were depleted in nutrients. As a result of a deep nutricline and a reduced nutrient supply to the upper photic zone in a stratified water column, percentages of nannoconids increased. According to the mechanisms outlined above, fluctuations of the nutrient index and nannoconid percentages have been used as a proxy for reconstructing the physical structure of mid-Cretaceous oceans steered by precession-forced monsoonal activity. The results of the study show that the formation of the Lower Albian OAE 1b from the Vocontian Basin occurred under strongly fluctuating surface waters fertility. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The distribution of calanoid copepods was investigated in the convergence zone between the California Current Water and Transitional Tropical Water in June 2010 to understand how this zooplankton community responds to mesoscale environmental structure. Hydrographic conditions and zooplankton profiles were measured along two transects which crossed a mesoscale front and adjacent structures, visible in sea surface temperature and ocean color satellite images. The hydrographic structure showed strong temperature (similar to 2 degrees C) and oxygen (50 mu mol kg(-1)) gradients in the frontal zone (similar to 90 km) associated with a sinking of the thermocline and oxycline, from similar to 30 m depth in the Transitional Tropical Water, to similar to 90 m depth in the California Current Water. The front was marked by a salinity minimum (<34.3 g kg(-1)) that sank along the sloping thermocline. High chlorophyll-a concentrations associated with the thermocline were detected in the Transitional Tropical Water, where a cyclonic eddy was defined. These concentrations decreased as the thermocline depth increased. Multivariate analysis defined three calanoid copepod habitats related to the hydrographic structure. A habitat with the highest copepod concentration (24,704 copepods 1000 m(-3)) was found on the tropical water side associated with a cyclonic eddy. Subeucalanus subtenuis and Centropages furcatus, indicator species, were concentrated between the thermocline (similar to 30 m depth) and the sea surface. On the subtropical water side, where the thermocline was deeper, a habitat with the lowest copepod concentration (3304 copepods 1000 m(-3), an order of magnitude smaller), characterized by Euchaeta indica and Centropages elongates, was observed. As an unexpected result, the habitat located in the frontal zone, characterized by Scolecithrix bradyi and Heterorhabdus papilliger had low copepod concentration (4453 copepods.1000 m(-3)). This low concetration could be due to the steep thermocline slope in the frontal zone, which could cause the thermocline depth to rapidly exceed the photic zone depth, and therefore affect the availability of food for calanoid copepods. It is concluded that the definition of the calanoid copepod habitats, was not only caused by the front itself, but by its interaction with other fine-scale mechanisms that generate oceanographic conditions leading to development of different food webs depending on the structure of water column.

AB  - In order to recruit into adult populations juvenile fish must be able to find food, successfully compete with other organisms and avoid predation within a habitat, in other words they must be able to locate favourable and avoid detrimental conditions. Bio-chemical research into fish detection and discrimination between chemical cues is extensive, however whether olfactory mechanisms are critical in habitat selection and avoidance of detrimental conditions within the marine environment remains under-researched. Despite being one of the scientifically most explored seas, studies on the use of olfactory system in the selection of water masses of the Mediterranean fish species are absent. Using a chemical choice flume, the chemically mediated behaviour choices to distinct chemical cues (algae, seagrass, predator and conspecifics) of Symphodus ocellatus, a common Mediterranean fish, were investigated. In addition to the conventional analysis, which relies on the amount of the time spent in the specific water mass as the main indicator of preference, the behavioural response triggered by the detection of a particular cue was also examined, by analysing the mean and variance of speed of the individual fish movements, a complimentary approach previously not considered in the flume experiments. Bayesian statistical method was used to calculate both, proportion of time spent in the specific water mass, as well as to analyse the behavioural response of each individual within the specific water mass. In terms of the time spent, the flume trials conducted resulted in no significant fish selection preference or avoidance for any of the water masses tested, however varied speeds and number of burst speed movements were observed in a number of trials. When no olfactory stimulus was present, no change in behaviour was triggered. Thus, juvenile S. ocellatus undoubtedly has a capacity of change in behaviour to a complex array of olfactory stimuli, nevertheless the response in the flume experiment was more complex than just the differences in time of the occupancy between the water masses. As a result, the analyses of speed could in future prove to be an important complementary tool for studying behavioural responses of fish using this methodology. The findings are coupled with the development of the rigorous novel protocol for behavioural analyses using exclusively publicly available apparatus and software, all described within the manuscript.

AB  - Soil development during the Quaternary was investigated, by comparing and integrating analytical datasets of three soil chronosequences developed on different terrace staircases along the Tyrrhenian (western) and Ionian (eastern) coasts of northern Calabria, southern Italy. Two of these soil chronosequences developed on early to late Pleistocene marine terraces in two sectors of the Praia area (western coast), whereas the third one developed on fluvial terraces in the Rossano area (eastern coast) spanning from middle to late Pleistocene ages, respectively. We present and discuss both novel results and already published data related to selected morphological, physical, chemical, mineralogical and SEM analyses from the two coastal sectors. We explored the effects of time on soil development, trying to unravel the role of soil-forming processes, parent material and geomorphic dynamics on direction and rates of pedogenesis. A complex nature of parent materials was indicated by the geochemical signature, coupling certain similarities with some heterogeneity between the two study sectors but also across single soil profiles, as a response to morphodynamic processes (soil reworking, aggradation, burial and/or erosion), in turn promoting soil ageing and/or rejuvenation. These processes and lithological discontinuities were also responsible for some data scattering from calculated soil chronofunctions for peculiar soil properties and pedogenic indices plotted against estimated soil ages. Among the main outcomes, good positive correlations were obtained for the (Fe-d-Fe-o)/Fe-t and Fe-d/Fe-t indices, weighted on the basis of total soil profile and single horizon thicknesses to minimize the effects of soil truncation by erosion processes. Our results confirm the reliability of these indices as soil development indicators. Moreover, they suggest that: (i) rates of soil development did not change significantly over ca. 100 -800 ka, despite the cyclical alternation of Pleistocene climate changes; (ii) dominant soil-forming processes tend to minimize original differences of pedogenic substrata and local (pedo)climatic conditions through time. In addition, soil chronofunctions permitted to estimate the unknown age (the time range of soil development before burial, about 200 ky) of a buried soil profile in the Rossano area, not correlated to any terrace surface of known age. The occurrence of etched quartz grains in soils of different ages for the two study sectors clearly indicates different rates of silica dissolution in the Tyrrhenian and Ionian coasts of Calabria, promoted by different climatic and pedoenvironmental conditions.

AB  - We inferred the climate history for Central Asia over the past 20,000 years, using sediments from core QH07, taken in the southeastern basin of Lake Qinghai, which lies at the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Results from multiple environmental indicators are internally consistent and yield a clear late Pleistocene and Holocene climate record. Carbonate content and total organic carbon (TOC) in Lake Qinghai sediments are interpreted as indicators of the strength of the Asian summer monsoon. Warm and wet intervals, associated with increased monsoon strength, are indicated by increased carbonate and TOC content. During the glacial period (similar to 20,000 to similar to 14,600 cal year BP), summer monsoon intensity remained low and relatively constant at Lake Qinghai, suggesting cool, dry, and relatively stable climate conditions. The inferred stable, cold, arid environment of the glacial maximum seems to persist through the Younger Dryas time period, and little or no evidence of a warm interval correlative with the Bolling-Allerod is found in the QH07 record. The transition between the late Pleistocene and the Holocene, about 11,500 cal year BP, was abrupt, more so than indicated by speleothems in eastern China. The Holocene (similar to 11,500 cal year BP to present) was a time of enhanced summer monsoon strength and greater variability, indicating relatively wetter but more unstable climatic conditions than those of the late Pleistocene. The warmest, wettest part of the Holocene, marked by increased organic matter and carbonate contents, occurred from similar to 11,500 to similar to 9,000 cal year BP, consistent with maximum summer insolation contrast between 30A degrees N and 15A degrees N. A gradual reduction in precipitation (weakened summer monsoon) is inferred from decreased carbonate content through the course of the Holocene. We propose that changes in the contrast of summer insolation between 30A degrees N and 15A degrees N are the primary control on the Asian monsoon system over glacial/interglacial time scales. Secondary influences may include regional and global albedo changes attributable to ice-cover and vegetation shifts and sea level changes (distance from moisture source in Pacific Ocean). The abruptness of the change at the beginning of the Holocene, combined with an increase in variability, suggest a threshold for the arrival of monsoonal rainfall at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Understanding the role of seed banks can be important for designing restoration projects. Using the seedling emergence method, we investigated the soil seed banks of two montane, deciduous riparian forest ecosystems of southeastern Arizona. We contrasted the seed banks and extant vegetation of Ramsey Canyon, which is the site of riparian restoration activities, with that of Garden Canyon, which has been less affected by human land uses. Fewer plant species were found at Ramsey Canyon than Garden Canyon, for both the seed bank and extant vegetation, and the vegetation at Ramsey Canyon (seed bank and extant) had consistently drier wetland indicator scores. As well, vegetation patterns within sampling zones (channel margins and adjacent riparian forests) differed between canyons. At Garden Canyon channel margins, the seed bank and extant vegetation had relatively high similarity, with herbaceous wetland perennial species dominating. Extant vegetation in the floodplain riparian forest zone at Garden Canyon had a drier wetland indicator score than the seed bank, suggesting that the floodplains are storing seeds dispersed from wetter fluvial surfaces. Vegetation patterns for Ramsey Canyon channel margins were similar to those for Garden Canyon floodplains. Vegetation patterns in the Ramsey Canyon riparian forest zone were indicative of non-flooded conditions with an abundance of upland species in the soil seed bank and extant vegetation. Channel geomorphology measurements indicated that much of the riparian forest zone at Ramsey Canyon is functionally a terrace, a condition that may be a legacy of channel erosion from historic land uses. Steep, erodible channel slopes may contribute to the low seed bank germinant density at Ramsey Canyon channel margins, and narrower flood-prone area may explain the greater terrestrialization of the vegetation in both sampling zones. We recommend testing the use of donor soils from more diverse stream reaches to restore biodiversity levels at Ramsey Canyon, following restoration activities such as channel-widening. Seed banks from Garden Canyon, for example, although predominantly consisting of herbaceous perennials, would supply species with a range of moisture tolerances, life spans, and growth forms. We also recommend that restorationists take care not to harm seed banks exposed during removal of introduced species; at Ramsey Canyon, soil seed banks were equally diverse in areas with high and low cover of the introduced Vinca major (a legacy of Ramsey Canyon land use).

AB  - The state of compactness of the arable soil layer chances during the growing season as a result of tillage and traction. The aim of this study was to assess and predict some soil mechanical and physical properties governing machine performance and crop response. The following mechanical properties were studied: compressibility, workability and cone index, CI, the latter as indicator of load-bearing capacity or root penetration resistance. Compressibility of the soil could be described as a semi-log function of pressure versus air volume and moisture content, with texture-specific coefficients for three representative soils, in the range of 6-35% air content. The wet workability limit for 16 Dutch soils was reached when the compaction process turned from "dry" into "wet" at 408 kPa of pressure. Soil rebound after pressure release was taken into account and quantified. Semi-log relations were found for CI versus porosity and moisture. Other physical proper-ties were also studied and it was found that the nature of the pF curve of three representative soils (for seven levels of bulk density) was highly affected by the initial seven pressure-moisture combinations. The "effectivity" of the pore system, indicating the effect of tortuosity and discontinuity on the oxygen diffusion rate, turned out to be proportional to air content in the range of 6-25%. Critical machine and plant related limits for aeration and mechanical resistance, CI, are available from the literature. Aeration is associated with minimum values for air volume and oxygen diffusion rate, respectively. Using this information, CI was associated with minimum values for load-bearing capacity and maximum values for root penetration.
   The applicability of the comprehensive laboratory approach is found in farming practices and evaluations of land management systems. On the operational level, machine performance can be predicted more accurately under fluctuating soil conditions. Also, the effects of modified equipment can be quantified more accurately in the case of unchanged field conditions. The same holds true for the prediction of crop response, as it is influenced by aeration and mechanical limits for plant growth. It was concluded that the approach of predicting the mechanical behaviour of soil, followed by the pF-derived determination. of physical proper-ties, will do justice to the dynamic character of the soil structure related input parameters in the present and future models and simulations for machine performance, crop production and soil conservation.

AB  - Two major hinge zones separate the Gulf of Suez (GOS) of Egypt into three tectonic sub-provinces, namely the northern, central and southern sectors. Based oil bulk and molecular parameters, the crude oils from the GOS can be subdivided into three groups according to their geographical origin from the three sectors. The geochemical characteristics of the oils are consistent with inferred depositional environments of anoxic marine carbonate facies in the central sector, compared to a more oxic environment that has received an increased proportion of elastic input in the southern sector. while the northern is intermediate in character. Most of the oils cover a relatively narrow maturity range (0.86-0.98 R-c) in the peak oil Window. The biomarker parameter Ts/(Ts + Tm) is controlled by variations of facies and depositional environment, but not by maturity. Concentrations of pyrrolic nitrogen compounds in the GOS crude oils are in general relatively low. but show a large range of variability. In crude oils of the northern sector a strong predominance of C-4 and C-5 carbazoles over the lower homologues is observed. Towards the south. the relative abundance of carbazole and the methylcarbazoles increases successively. Variations within the methylearbazoles and C-2-carbazoles are rather small and, therefore. are not useful for a straightforward classification of of families. However, atypical patterns in some of the oils. particularly from the northern sector. give evidence for contributions from yet unidentified local sources, which might not be of general importance in the GOS petroleum province. Benzo[b]carbazole is near or even below detection limit in the GOS crude oils. The benzocarbazole a/(a-c) ratio shows a consistently positive correlation with API gravity. Pr/Ph and Ts/(Ts+ Tm) and a negative correlation With the Sulphur content. Based on these observations. it is inferred that facies and depositional environment of the relevant source rocks are the major factors influencing the benzoearbazole distributions. In the central sector of the GOS, in Which oils are predominantly sourced from carbonates deposited under strongly reducing conditions, a/(a + c) values Lire mainly below 0.5, In the southern sector where source rocks were deposited under less reducing conditions and received significant elastic input, as well as in the northern sector, the a/(a+c) values are mainly above 0.5.

AB  - Short-term exposure to elevated levels of free fatty acids (FFA) perturbs a variety of cellular functions. It is frequently observed that cis-unsaturated fatty acids (FA) mediate these perturbations while trans-unsaturated or saturated FA are relatively inert. This dichotomy has generally been ascribed to the differential effects of these FA on membrane structure, specifically, that cis but not saturated FA alter lipid acyl chain order. Direct support for this view, however, is lacking because membrane partition of FA has not been determined for the relevant FA and for the conditions of the functional studies. Previous measurements of membrane partition of natural long-chain FA have relied on the determination of the amount bound to the membrane rather than the aqueous-phase concentration of FA. Because [FFA] is low, however, the partition coefficient (K(p)) is relatively insensitive to the membrane-bound concentration and, therefore, accurate determinations of K(p) require direct [FFA] measurements. In this study FA partition between the aqueous phase and either lipid bilayer vesicles or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) was measured using a recently developed fluorescent indicator of FFA. This indicator is composed of recombinant intestinal fatty acid binding protein derivatized with acrylodan and is termed ADIFAB. Using ADIFAB, partition coefficients were determined for seven saturated and cis-unsaturated FA under conditions that parallel those in which cis FA have been shown to inhibit CTL signaling. In general, K(p) values were approximately an order of magnitude greater than previous determinations and were found to be greater for the noninhibitory saturated FA than the inhibitory cis FA. K(p) values ranged from about 2 x 10(6) for stearic to 4 x 10(4) for linolenic acid, reflecting a strong dependence on FFA aqueous solubility and relatively little dependence on membrane composition. The K(p) values together with measurements of the corresponding change in membrane lipid order, by fluorescence polarization, allowed the determination of the specific level of acyl chain perturbation by each FA as a function of its membrane concentration. Specific perturbation was generally found to increase with increasing degree of cis unsaturation. Parallel measurements of the cis FA inhibition of the concanavalin A-stimulated rise in CTL intracellular calcium demonstrates that lipid acyl chain perturbation and inhibition are linearly correlated. This correlation suggests that inhibition of CTL signaling results from perturbation of plasma membrane lipid order.

AB  - Today, attention to the issue of industrial ecology in the world has become very high and significant, but in Iran this attention does not exist and is only a slogan and preliminary studies. The purpose of this study is to investigate these conditions and provide a structure and model for the implementation of industrial ecology in Iran. Industrial estates are one of the major centers of producing energy and industrial waste in the country. Developing Industrial Ecology (IE) faces significant obstacles. This study evaluates the barriers due to a combination model, including the DPSIR and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). It prioritizes the responses and alternatives regarding the driving forces, pressures, states, and impacts (criteria). In this study, different responses for IE development in Iran were evaluated and prioritized based on different indicators classified based on DPSIR and FAHP techniques and models. The results suggest prioritizing future IE development in Iran based on current infrastructure and conditions. To compare the analysis of two fuzzy numbers, a new division method based on a comparative example is used; to confirm the proposed method, a comparative example is described and presented. According to the field studies and research background of the research, the number of "18 criteria" and "four responses" were suggested. Finally, improving IE legal is the first step of modifying the industries clustering system, establishing IE national database and industries training. According to the identified priorities, practical suggestions for the development of Iran's industrial environmental model within the framework of legal requirements, infrastructure and regulations that should be developed or updated, were presented and the duties of relevant legal agencies were identified and proposed. Article HighlightsThe application of industrial ecology and its frameworks can minimize environmental pollution.DPSIR technique is effective in identifying areas related to the framework of industrial ecology development in Iran.Combination of DPSIR and modified Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is of great help in recognizing the components of industrial ecology's framework in Iran.Knowledge of industrial ecology for managers is one of the most important issues that can be effective in its development in Iran.43 factors were extracted based on the DPSIR model.18 criteria and four alternatives for developing of IE model in Iran has identified.Improve IE law, Establish IE national database are the effective and priority factors in the development of Iran's IE model.

AB  - The matrinxa (Brycon amazonicus) is one of the species with the greatest rates of commercialization in the Amazon region, however, it has a high frequency of aggressiveness and cannibalism, and these traits are considered a major obstacle to the aquaculture sector. Environmental factors (e.g., water temperature) are known to impact fish behavior and, thus could contribute to reducing fish aggressiveness and improve production conditions. Therefore, we tested the effect of water temperature on aggressive behavior and stress parameters in juvenile B. amazonicus. Aggressive behavior and stress indicators (haematological indices and glucose) were compared in 24 individuals that were isolated for eight days and submitted to one of three temperatures: low (24.33 +/- 0.33 degrees C), intermediate (29.49 +/- 0.43 degrees C) and high (34.48 +/- 0.56 degrees C); eight fish were used per treatment. The experimental period was divided into three phases: A. Initial- the average temperature was equivalent to the acclimatization period (29.49 +/- 0.70 degrees C) and lasted for 60 h; B. Transition- a gradual increase/decrease in temperature over a period of 36 h (similar to 2.55 degrees C/day) was implemented; and C. Final- temperatures corresponded to the respective experimental treatments, to which the fish were exposed for 96 h. Aggressive behavior was monitored from the 5th to 8th days of the experiment, and blood was collected for physiological analysis on the 1st and 8th days. At the end of the experiment, the fish submitted to the higher temperature showed less aggressive interactions compared to fish maintained at the lower temperature (Fisher LSD, P = 0.025). For all temperatures tested, a reduction in hematocrit, red blood cell counts, hemoglobin concentration and plasma glucose was observed at the end of the experiment, but the reductions in most of these parameters did not differ among the treatments (Kruskal-Wallis, X-2 = 1, P = 0.61, ANOVA, F = 0.84, P = 0.17). In conclusion, the higher temperature did indeed cause a reduction in the aggressiveness of the juvenile B. amazonicus, though it did not act as a stressor. These findings may contribute to the improvement of social conditions during the farming of this species and, consequently, to the development of new technologies for the productive sector.

AB  - Seasonal acclimatization and experimental acclimation to cold in birds typically results from increased shivering endurance and elevated thermogenic capacity leading to improved resistance to cold. A wide array of physiological adjustments, ranging from biochemical transformations to organ mass variations, are involved in this process. Several studies have shown that improved cold endurance is accompanied by increases in summit metabolic rate (Msum), a measure of maximal heat production and an indicator of the level of sustainable thermogenic capacity. However, improved endurance to cold can also be achieved without significant changes in Msum. The same is true for basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is known to increase in association with cold acclimatization or acclimation in some species but not in others. We investigated cold acclimation in a migrant shorebird known for extreme physiological flexibility, the red knot (Calidris canutus, the northerly wintering subspecies islandica). We measured BMR and Msum over two months in birds caught in the wild and transferred to experimentally controlled conditions representative of aspects of their seasonal thermal environment ( two groups at constant 25 degrees C, one group at constant 4 degrees C and two groups experiencing variable outdoor temperatures). Birds maintained in both cold and variable ambient temperatures showed a 14-15% higher body mass, 33-45% higher food intake, and 26% and 13% elevations in BMR and Msum, respectively, compared with birds kept at thermoneutrality. These results, together with data on alimentary tract size and pectoral muscle thickness measured by ultrasonography, suggest that red knots acclimate to cold primarily through modulation of ( lean) body mass components. Heavier individuals have larger muscles, which allow higher maximal heat production and better thermal compensation. Cold acclimation effects on BMR are most probably due to changes in the size of visceral organs, although not the alimentary tract in this specific case. The liver, known for its thermogenic capacity, is a probable candidate. Overall, our results indicate that relatively small changes in body mass and muscle size allow enough reserve capacity in terms of heat production to cope with typical wintering ambient temperature variations as measured on the red knot's wintering grounds.

AB  - Analog laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate sub-aqueous bed forms generated under storm-like oscillatory and combined flow. Experiments were carried out in a large wave tunnel and used a range of sand sizes (fine and very fine), wave periods (10.5 and 8 s), oscillatory velocities (0 to 125 cm/s), and unidirectional velocities (0 to 25 cm/s).
   At low unidirectional velocities (<= 10 cm/s), addition of an increasing collinear oscillatory flow caused the bed to evolve from small-scale (wavelength < 20 cm), symmetric, anorbital ripples, to large-scale (wavelength > 100 cm), symmetric, orbital ripples, to plane bed. At higher unidirectional velocities (> 10 cm/s), a similar trend was noted, but ripples were more asymmetric. Three phase diagrams are presented to summarize the observed relationships of bed configurations to flow conditions. These diagrams are intended to assist in the interpretation of shallow marine sedimentary environments where oscillatory and combined flow are thought to be omnipresent.
   Distinctive features of small-scale asymmetric combined-flow ripples generated are: a 3D planform, round crest, and convex-up sigmoidal profile with local pronounced scour at the toe of the stoss side giving the ripple profile a "boxy" appearance. Similarly, large-scale asymmetric combined-flow ripples had broad and round crests, convex-up stoss sides, and "compressed profiles" due to scouring at the toe of the stoss side.
   Hummocky bed forms were generated under moderate to high oscillatory velocities and low unidirectional velocities. Hummocks were not observed as a distinct bed state but rather appeared to mark transitions in bed-form scale and symmetry. Hummocks were more prevalent at longer oscillatory periods and in finer-grained sediment. Stratification produced by "synthetically" aggrading hummocky bed profiles closely resembles hummocky cross-stratification. With the introduction of only a small unidirectional-flow component, hummocks evolve into downstream-migrating large-scale asymmetric ripples, and the resultant cross-stratification becomes similar to that produced by unidirectional-flow dunes. Accordingly, these experiments suggest that much of the hummocky cross-stratification observed in the stratigraphic record is produced by storm-generated long-period oscillatory-dominant combined flows. Inasmuch as long-period, high-energy waves require deep, wide basins to form, hummocky cross-stratification may therefore serve as a useful indicator of deposition in unrestricted, open-water conditions.

AB  - Troxerutin (TRX) is a mixture of semisynthetic hydroxyethylrutosides (Hers) arising from hydroxyethylation of rutin, a natural occurring flavonoid. TRX is commonly used for its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in chronic venous insufficiency and other vascular disorders. In recent studies, the protective effects of TRX in Alzheimer's disease, colon carcinogenesis and hepatocellular carcinoma are emerged. However, the chemical stability of TRX has never been studied. Hence, the aims of the work were to study the TRX chemical stability through a forced degradation study and to develop and validate a new stability indicating LC-UV method for determination of TRX. In order to perform the study, TRX stability was tested in various stress conditions analysing the degradation samples by LC-MS. Three degradation products (DPs; D1, D2 and D3, 3',4',7-Tri-O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)quercetin, 3',4',5,7-Tetra-O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)quercetin and 3',4'-Di-O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)quercetin respectively) arising from degradation in acidic conditions were identified and synthesized: among them, D1 resulted the stability indicator for hydrolytic degradation. Furthermore, a stability-indicating LC-UV method for simultaneous determination of triHer (3',4',7-Tri-O-(beta-hydroxyethyprutin, the principal component of the mixture) and D1 was developed and validated. The LC-UV method consisted in a gradient elution on a Phenomenex Kinetex EVO C18 (150 x 3 mm, 5 m) with acetonitrile and ammonium bicarbonate buffer (10 mM, pH 9.2). The method was linear for triHer (20-60 mu g mL(-1)) and Dl (5.1-35 mu g mL(-1)). The intraday and inter day precision were determined and expressed as RSD5: all the values were <= 2% for both triHer and Dl. The method demonstrated also to be accurate and robust and the average recoveries were 98.8 and 97.9% for triHer and D1, respectively. Moreover, the method resulted selective and specific for all of the components present in the degradation pattern of TRX (diHer (3',4'-Di-O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)rutin), triHer, tetraHer (3',4',5,7-Tetra-O-(beta-hydroxyethyl)rutin), D3, D1 and D2) and it was successfully applied for the stability studies of both drug substances and drug products.

AB  - Marine pollen analysis is an important tool for paleoclimatic reconstruction of regions like the eastern Mediterranean and Near East where few onshore sites provide long pollen records. First, a compilation was made of core-top data from the eastern Mediterranean to Black Seas to map regional variations in modern marine pollen-spore concentrations. These data show a strong link between pollen-spore concentrations and sea surface salinity, with minima of 5 grains/g in the southern Mediterranean and maxima of 160000 grains/g in the Black Sea. Despite under-representation of some forest and herbaceous vegetation indicators, e.g. Fagus and Pistacia, variations in species composition of the marine assemblages correspond closely with the distribution of regional vegetation zones and can be used as proxies for spatial differences in seasonal bind total temperature and rainfall. Pollen-spore assemblages in five cores from the Marmara Sea with multiple ages ranging from 33550 to 1990 yr BP and one Holocene core from southeastern Black Sea were used to compile a Late Quaternary marine pollen stratigraphy. These data were then compared with eastern Mediterranean onshore reference sites in order to reconstruct a vegetation and paleoclimate history for the Black Sea-Aegean corridor from the Pleniglacial interval to present. Five marine pollen zones are recognized. PZ-5 (similar to33.6-24 ka) corresponds to the late Wurm Pleniglacial; PZ-4 (similar to24-13 ka) spans the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM); PZ-3 (similar to 13-10.2 ka) includes the Allerod-Younger Dryas glacial-interglacial transition; PZ-2 (10.2-4 ka) marks the early Holocene interglacial warm, wet interval; and PZ-1 covers the latest Holocene colonization phase, which may also have been cooler and drier. Using the steppe-forest index of Traverse (1975), it is shown that the only intervals of severely dry conditions occurred briefly during the LGM and its transition; during most of the Pleniglacial and all of the Postglacial time, precipitation versus evaporation rates were sufficiently high to permit persistence of oro-Mediterranean forest vegetation. Furthermore, there is no evidence for environmental conditions in the Black Sea-Marmara region that would have encouraged pastoral or agricultural settlement in the littoral region prior to the Bronze Age, commencing 4600 years ago.

AB  - The evaluation of the role of different agronomic strategies in achieving sustainable wheat yields under variable Mediterranean climate conditions may involve the use of resource-use indicators that combine productivity and environmental impact. A two-seasons field experiment was conducted in South Portugal to study the effect of water regimes and nitrogen fertilization on wheat yield, grain quality and water use evaluated with water productivity and water footprint indicators. The water regime treatments were full irrigation, supplemental irrigation, and rainfed. Nitrogen fertilizer treatments, including conventional and enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEF) were distinguished by N splitting and timing over the crop cycle. Contrasting meteorological variables in the two years caused distinct wheat productive responses. Although leading to lower grain yields, supplemental irrigation guaranteed a water productivity similar to full irrigation. The use of EEFs in which 50% of the total nitrogen was applied at the booting phase had a positive significant effect on grain protein content and on dough rheologic properties, indicating that late nitrogen applications benefit the technological quality of wheat. The average total water footprints estimated for the two seasons showed no relevant differences but the partition of the green, blue and grey components in irrigated wheat varied, with an increased importance of blue water consumptive use in the second year of the experiment. In fact, the ratio blue water footprint/green water footprint increased from 0.40 to 2.00 due to higher irrigation requirements. High grey water footprint in rainfed wheat was mostly influenced by lower yields in 2018-2019, and by an advantageous rainfall distribution during the 2017-2018 season. No significant reduction in grey water footprint was observed when using EEFs. A multivariate statistical approach through factor analysis (FA) and multivariate linear regression (MLR) was used to examine the data structure and correlation. FA resulted in three-factor models of yield and water use, yield components and wheat quality, in the first season. In the second, drier, season, variables most related with irrigation water use were clustered in one detached factor. The stepwise MLR pointed to a good prediction capability of water footprints from NDVI measured with proximal sensors at booting, anthesis, maturation and/ or tillering.

AB  - Breeding on improved heat tolerance in dairy cattle is a topic of increasing importance due to the climatic challenges, even in Germany. Attempts in this regard, i.e., the development of genetic evaluations, are under progress in some states of North America. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to estimating genetic parameters and variance components for novel physiological cow traits in dependency of a continuous temperature-humidity-index (THI). Genetic correlations in same traits across THI were evaluated as indicators for possible genotype by environment (heat stress) interactions. Own trait recording during several years considered 838 cows of the local breed Deutsches Schwarzbuntes Niederungsrind (DSN) and their genetic upgrades with HF, which were kept in eight different herds reflecting a pasture based production system. Repeated trait recording considered more than 7000 observations. The recorded physiological traits included respiration rate (RESPR, in number of breaths per minute), pulse frequency (PULSF, in number of heartbeats per minute), body temperature (KT, in C degrees), vaginal temperature (VT, in C degrees) and surface temperature recorded via infrared thermography for different segments of the cow body (free-form polygon covering the whole surface (OTG), rectangle along the spine (OTWI), line along the spine (OTR) circle at withers (OTW)). Barn temperature and humidities from intervals in one minute were used for the calculation of hourly THI, which were merged with the corresponding point in time for cow trait recording. Phenotypically, trait variations were more pronounced under heat stress (THI > 65) in comparison to trait reactions under temperate climatic conditions (THI <= 65). The estimation of variance components for physiological traits was conducted with repeatability models considering distinct THI classes (THI > 65 und THI = 65), as well as via random regression methodology on a continuous THI scale. From both modelling approaches, additive genetic variances and heritabilities increased with increasing THI, implying improved genetic differentiations under stress conditions. Genetic correlations in same traits recorded at THI > 65 and THI <= 65 were close to 0.80 or even smaller, indicating obvious genotype by environment interactions. Especially for THI in greater distance, genetic correlations substantially declined, e.g. 0.31 for OTG. Genetic (co)variance components indicated environmental sensitivity for a local breed, which should be adapted to heterogeneous climatic impact. The longitudinal physiological trait data allows ongoing studies to enhance genetic evaluations towards improved heat tolerance and robustness.

AB  - Relevance. The paper examines the issues of the health care system development of Ukraine in the context of modern challenges. Today, there are many global environmental, socio-demographic, and economic problems threatening the existence of human civilization. One of the problems was the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19, which demonstrated unpreparedness of Ukraine and post-socialist countries' health care systems. These countries are undergoing health care transformations, but they do not meet modern world norms and standards.
   The purpose of the article is to establish the key features of the health care system of Ukraine during its transformation given the positive experience of medical systems in the world, from the positions of human geography to identify current challenges and to assess the ability to respond to social demand and the threat of the global crisis in the form of new diseases, the spread of epidemics threatening to human health, quality and life expectancy.
   Methods. This research is conducted on the basis of human-geographical approach with use of the set of methods and tools to analyze the health care system, which is extremely important for obtaining verified and scientifically sound results. In particular, the authors used methods of induction and deduction, comparison, formalization, analogy, analysis, systematization, including ranking and grouping, historical, graphical, mathematical and statistical, SWOT-analysis methods.
   Results. Scientific novelty and practical significance. The features, advantages and disadvantages of existing models of health care systems in different countries were identified. In particular, models of medical systems were considered: a model of the single-payer, model of obligatory insurance, and hybrid system. The peculiarities of the formation of the health care system of Ukraine were determined, the key features and principles of the M.O. Semashko's system were identified, its positive and negative features preserved to this day were outlined. The distribution of European and post-socialist countries was analyzed according to the indicators of state budget expenditures on health care and GDP, number of doctors, hospital beds per capita. The transformational processes in the health care system of Ukraine, the peculiarities of the medical reform in Ukraine were revealed, the peculiarities of the development of the medical system in the conditions of the pandemic were characterized. The SWOT analysis identified the strengths and weaknesses of the Ukraine's health care system in terms of reform and transformation, its opportunities and threats in the light of current challenges.

AB  - Important factors that determine the physiology of pregnancy are psycho-emotional, micronutritive state of a pregnant woman and fetoplacental complex. Complicated socio-economic conditions, environmental problems, staying in conditions of persistent stress as a result of a military conflict in the east of Ukraine have a negative impact on the health indicators of pregnant women and their children.
   The aim of this study was to determine the peculiarities of the psycho-emotional state and associated changes in the production of placental hormones and micronutrients in pregnant women-displaced persons for further improvement of the antenatal observation program.
   Materials and methods. To perform the tasks of the study, a dynamic prospective clinical and paraclinical examination of 96 pregnant women (the main group) - displaced persons and 39 pregnant women (the control group) living permanently in the territory controlled by Ukraine, who were enrolled randomly in the period of gestation after 22 weeks. All pregnant women were examined (clinical-laboratory and special obstetrical examinations) according to the requirements of the quality standards as required by the Order of the Healthcare Ministry of Ukraine No 417 of 15.07.2011. The evaluation of psycho-emotional state of examined pregnant women was conducted with the help of screening by performing clinical interviews together with routine questioning. The questionnaires containing the questions of Spielberger's tests in the modification of Khanin were developed in advance. The concentration of calcium, magnesium in blood serum was determined by colorimetric method, placental (estradiol, progesterone, placental lactogen) hormones were determined by solid-phase enzyme immunoassay.
   Results. It was found an increase in the concentration of estradiol and a decrease in progesterone and placental lactogen, shift in estrogen-progesterone equilibrium towards a relative hyperestrogenia; micronutritive imbalance with a significant shift in calcium-magnesium equilibrium towards calcium along with significant changes in the concentration of serum magnesium as well as anxiodepressive states with high levels of state and trait anxiety which were 3.9 and 2.2 times, respectively, higher than average statistical indices in the control group.
   Conclusions. The hormonal and metabolic disorders revealed in pregnant internally displaced persons are biochemical markers of placental dysfunction indicating the feasibility of comprehensive pre-conception training with a psychologist involvement and preventive measures inclusion as a long-term progesterone and magnesium support during pregnancy in the programs of such women antenatal monitoring.

AB  - The term 'entrepreneurial eco-system' (EES) currently belongs to the most popular ones in economic geography - and in the practice of start-up support policies in many countries, too. Due to its exclusively positive connotations the usage of this term creates unrealistic hopes among entrepreneurship support practitioners. Scholars may be reminded to previous supposed panaceas of regional economic policies like clusters, 'creative class' members or high-tech industries. As for these predecessors as well, the concept is "fuzzy" (Markusen 1999), the available empirics are "scanty" (ibid.) and its perception among policymakers is oversimplified, exclusively positive and partially naive. To a degree, this is a consequence of an extremely unclear definition of what is meant by an EES. The undertheorization of the EES discourse, as observed by some scholars, is not due to a lack of conceptual approaches per se, but due to a lack of convincing, theoretically strong approaches. In fact, the majority of the EES publications is conceptual or even theoretical, usually without any serious empirical underpinning. From our perspective the latter has one important consequence: EES theory is weak because there is a lack of representative, comprehensive and sophisticated empirical studies, indicators and methods to measure EES. This paper provides a unique attempt to measure EES at the sub-national level of regions, that is, from our perspective, the most appropriate spatial level to identify and measure (and theorize) EES as the regional entrepreneurship literature provides striking evidence in favor of entrepreneurship as being primarily a regional (or local) event. Our paper contributes to the current EES debate by arguing that a robust empirical measurement of various EES at the sub-national level may help to improve the quality of EES theory. We propose to start with Erik S tam's interpretation of an EES based upon ten "conditions" for whom we develop specific variables for application in concrete data collection exercises in different regions. We develop an overall EES index as well as subnational indices for each of the ten conditions. We also propose a method to care for the various weighting problems to be solved. Our attempt has been successfully pretested in Germany and Spain and has meanwhile entered a more ambitious pilot phase in 2018. One of this paper's aims is to get feedback from scholars studying EES regarding our proposed method.

AB  - Background: The current study examines what factors contribute to higher injury risk among Aboriginal peoples, compared to the total British Columbia (BC) population. We explore socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural factors, and combinations of these factors, that contribute to increased injury risk for Aboriginal peoples. This follows from our previously reported findings of improvements in injury risk over time for both the total and Aboriginal populations.
   Data and methods: We use provincial population-based linked health care databases of hospital discharge records. We identify three population groups: total BC population, and Aboriginal populations living off-reserve, or on-reserve. For each group we calculate age and gender-standardized relative risks (SRR) of injury-related hospitalization, relative to the total population of BC, for two 5-year time periods (1999-2003, and 2004-2008). We use custom data from the 2001 and 2006 long-form Censuses that described income, education, employment, housing conditions, proportion of urban dwellers, proportion of rural dwellers, and prevalence of Aboriginal ethnicity. We use multivariable linear regression to examine the associations between the census characteristics and SRR of injury.
   Results: The best-fitting model was an excellent fit (R-2 = 0.905, p < 0.001) among the three population groups within Health Service Delivery Areas of BC. We find indicators in all three categories (socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural) are associated with disparity in injury risk. While the socioeconomic indicators (income, education, housing, employment) were shown to be highly correlated, only living in housing that needs major repair and occupational hazardousness, along with rural residence and Aboriginal ethnicity, remained in the final model. Our data show that cultural density is not associated with injury risk for Aboriginal peoples, and that living off-reserve is associated with reduced injury by improving socioeconomic and geographic conditions (compared to living on-reserve). Finally, our analyses show that Aboriginal status itself is associated with injury risk.
   Conclusions: Our findings confirm previous research indicating that geographical differences differentiate injury risk, including for Aboriginal populations, and that socioeconomic determinants are associated with health risks. Our analyses showing that Aboriginal status itself contributes to injury risk is new, but we can only speculate about pathway, and whether the causes are direct or indirect.

AB  - Field and laboratory investigations were undertaken to determine (1) the relations between discharge, Pb concentration, and the Pb isotopic composition of the dissolved load in Richland Creek, western North Carolina, and (2) the potential influence of varying Pb water chemistry on the Pb isotopic abundances in liver and bone tissues of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Stream waters were characterized by relatively low Pb concentrations during periods of base flow exceeding 10 days in length. Moreover, greater than 65% of the Pb was derived from orchard soils located upstream of the monitoring site which are contaminated by lead arsenate. During small to moderate floods, the dissolved load exhibited Pb concentrations more than twice as high as those measured during base flow, but the contribution of Pb from lead arsenate was relatively low and varied directly with discharge. In contrast to smaller events, Pb from lead arsenate in an 8- to 10-year (overbank) event in May 2003 was minimal during peak flow conditions, suggesting that discharge-source relations are dependent on flood magnitude. The hydrologic and geochemical data demonstrate that aquatic biota in Richland Creek are subjected to short-term variations in Pb concentrations and Pb isotopic abundances within the dissolved load ranging from a few hours to few a weeks. Laboratory studies demonstrated that when rainbow trout were exposed to elevated Pb concentrations with a distinct isotopic fingerprint, the bone and liver rapidly acquire isotopic ratios similar to that of the water. Following exposure, bone retains Pb from the contaminant source for a period of months, while the liver excreted approximately 50% of the accumulated Pb within a few days and nearly all of the Pb within a few weeks. Differences in the rates of excretion resulted in contrasting isotopic ratios between the tissues. It seems plausible, then, that previously observed differences between the isotopic composition of bone and liver in rainbow trout from Richland Creek are related to their short-term exposure to Pb from soils contaminated with Pb arsenate that result from fluctuating hydrologic conditions. If these trends prove to be common in other contaminated aquatic environments, it may be possible to use the Pb isotopic composition of bone as an indicator of the long-term exposure to Pb and the liver as a biomarker for short-term Pb exposures.

AB  - Elevated osmolality and pCO(2) have been shown to alter sialylation in a protein-specific manner. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)MT2-1-8 cells, tPA sialylation changed only slightly from 40 to 250 mm Hg pCO(2), whereas neural cell adhesion molecule polysialic acid (NCAM PSA) content decreased by up to 70% at 250 mm Hg pCO(2), pH 7.2. NCAM PSA content also decreased with increasing NaCl or NH4Cl concentration. This suggests that PSA content is a sensitive indicator of conditions that may alter glycosylation. Amino acids and their derivatives have been used to protect hybridoma and CHO cell growth under hyperosmotic stress. We examined the impact of osmoprotectants on NCAM PSA content in CHO MT2-1-8 cells under hyperosmolality (up to 545 mOsm/kg) and at 195 and 250 mm Hg pCO(2). NCAM PSA content at 545 mOsm/kg was at least twofold greater in the presence of glycine betaine or L-proline compared to that without osmoprotectant. Surprisingly, in the presence of 20 mM glycine betaine, PSA levels were 50-60% of the control level for osmolalities ranging from 320 to 545 mOsm/kg. Thus, glycine betaine inhibits NCAM polysialylation at osmolalities below 435 mOsm/kg and is beneficial at higher osmolalities. In contrast to glycine betaine, L-proline increased PSA content by 25-120% relative to the unprotected culture at less than or equal to545 mOsm/kg. The decrease in NCAM PSA levels of CHO MT2-1-8 cells cultured at 195 mm Hg pCO(2)-435 mOsm/kg was not mitigated by the presence of 25 mM glycine betaine, glycine, or L-threonine, even though all of these compounds enhanced cell growth. At 250 mm Hg pCO(2), all osmoprotectants tested (20 MM L-threonine, L-proline, glycine, or glycine betaine) increased NCAM polysialylation, with 20 mM glycine betaine restoring NCAM PSA to near control levels. Thus, osmoprotectants may (partially) offset changes in glycosylation, as well as the inhibition of growth, in cells under environmental stress. Supernatant beta-galactosiclase levels, which increase upon alkalization of acidic organelles, did not differ significantly under elevated pCO(2) and hyperosmolality from that at control conditions.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of the paper is to determine the basic electrical characteristics and to develop a calculation method and algorithm for optimizing the design parameters of autotransformers intended for use in a melting ice scheme with a non-inductive circuit on 6-10 kV overhead power lines. Methodology. The development of the technical and economic model and the method for calculation of the design parameters of the autotransformer for melting ice is performed on the basis of a systematic approach. Optimization of structural characteristics of autotransformers is carried out using a combined algorithm based on the spatial grid method, adapted to the case of a mixed space of discrete and continuous independent variables, and the specifics of the technical and economic model of the autotransformer. The proposed combined optimization algorithm is implemented in the Delphi environment. Results. Based on the required specific melting power, the main electrical characteristics of autotransformers intended for use in the meltingicr scheme with a non-inductive circuit on 6-10 kV overhead lines, which were the basis for optimizing their design parameters, have been calculated. The technical and economical model of autotransformer for melting ice, which is defined by nine independent variables and describes its cost and technical parameters, is developed. On the basis of the obtained electrical characteristics, optimization of the design parameters of a series of autotransformers is carried out, which includes three standard sizes, differing in maximum length of the transmission line. Originality. A method of calculation of structural parameters of autotransformers for ice melting is proposed, the peculiarity of which is the use of the criterion of the minimum of the cost of the active part and taking into account the conditioned by the circuit of connection of the autotransformers the technical restrictions of errors on the value and angle of secondary current, which are important from the point of view of ensuring the permissible deviation of the specific power of melting ice. Practical value. Optimal correlations of geometrical sizes and electromagnetic loads of autotransformers for ice melting, their cost indicators, as well as the main design characteristics of the magnetic circuit and windings are established. Results of design calculation of autotransformers are sufficient for introduction of their serial production in industrial conditions.

AB  - 1. The application of functional ecology models to aquatic plants often relies on morphological and life-history traits which may reflect, in part, the phenotypic plasticity displayed by aquatic plants. The present study was designed to evaluate the use of physiological traits, such as nutrition patterns, to describe aquatic plant strategies along a gradient of increasing resource availablity.
   2. Taking phosphorus (P) as an example, nutrition-use efficiencies were evaluated in five species, through the P-content in plant tissues, the variations in P-content according to nutrient availability and the perenniality of P-storage. Plasticity in P-storage was also investigated in Ranunculus peltatus, a morphologically highly plastic species.
   3. In 2001, P-content was analysed in Callitriche hamulata, C. obtusangula, C. platycarpa, Elodea nuttallii and R. peltatus tissue samples. These five species were sampled at nine different sites in streams along an increasing resource gradient in the Northern Vosges Biosphere Reserve (NE France). Variations of P-content in the roots, stems and dissected and floating leaves of R. peltatus were also studied.
   4. Only C. platycarpa and R. peltatus were found to occur in low nutrient availability conditions. Callitriche hamulata, C. obtusangula and E. nuttallii were restricted to mesotrophic and eutrophic sites. The highest nutrient-use efficiency was found for E. nuttallii which was able to adapt its P-storage to varying resource availabilities. Ranunculus peltatus was able to store high concentrations of P, but its P-integration within the vegetative structure was less efficient under eutrophic conditions. Callitriche spp. appeared to have relatively low nutrient-use efficiencies, although C. obtusangula displayed a high P-content. While P was stored preferentially in roots in R. peltatus populations occurring in nutrient-rich sites, there was no particular P-storage organ for populations from nutrient-poor sites.
   5. On the basis of P-usage, R. peltatus and E. nuttallii presented competitor traits, C. hamulata and C. platycarpa displayed stress-tolerant nutrient signatures and for C. obtusangula, ruderal or competitor characteristics dominated. The use of physiological traits, such as nutrition patterns, may provide valuable, complementary information about aquatic plant strategies, independent from the influence of morphological trait plasticity often displayed by these plants.

AB  - Investigations were carried out in order to assess the effect of decreased/increased nitrogen (N)- and sulphur (S)-deposition on the growth and vitality if fine-roots of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), in three catchment areas within the Lake Gardsjon basin, SW Sweden. The catchment areas were subjected to decreased N- and S-deposition (G1 ROOF), increased N-deposition (G2 NITREX) and ambient levels of N- and S-deposition (F1 CONTROL). The excavated fine-roots (<1 mm in diameter) were separated into live and dead fractions and chemical analyses were carried out. The proportion of nitrogen to other macro-nutrients in the fine-roots was used as an indicator of mineral nutrient requirements of the forest trees.
   The most 'vital' fine-roots (characterised by high live to dead ratio) were found in all catchment areas in the upper parts of the organic soil horizon, which most frequently exhibited good mineral nutrient and soil water conditions. It was concluded from available climatic data on monthly precipitation and air temperature that the variation in fine-root growth was not caused by climatic changes. The live to dead ratio of the fine-roots gradually decreased with depth and was low in the mineral soil horizon. An increased percentage of living fine-roots in the ROOF catchment suggests an increased 'vitality' in fine-roots (increased live to dead ratios), associated with reduced N- and S-deposition. Chemical analyses of live fine-roots in the same area revealed improved mineral nutrient concentrations, e.g. higher Ca/Al ratios, increased concentrations of K, P, Ca and Mg. Fine-root vitality was improved in the NITREX catchment area, probably as a result of an increased cation release. Fine-root distributions, live to dead ratios and mineral nutrient concentrations appear to be strongly affected by N availability in the soil. Increased concentrations of K and P in proportion to N in fine-roots in the ROOF catchment indicate improved mineral nutrient conditions and lower risk of ion-imbalances. The results are in agreement with findings from other investigations suggesting those nutrient deficiencies and/or metal toxicity may strongly affect the growth of fine-roots.

AB  - Simple Summary After a large avian mortality event occurred in New Mexico in the fall of 2020, we performed an analysis using 11 years of fall bird banding data at two locations in north-central New Mexico to investigate the influence of drought on avian health. Carcass studies after the event indicated that starvation was the primary cause of death. Using fall bird banding data along with regional drought indices, we used multiple logistic regression to predict the body health conditions of a bird during the fall migration period. We found that fat scores for younger, insectivorous, migratory birds were less likely to be greater than zero as drought severity levels increased. Our results suggest that migratory insectivores in the southwestern United States may be less resilient to drought-related climate change. Birds are good indicators of environmental change and are often studied for responses to climate. Many studies focus on breeding birds, while fewer look at the migration period, which is a critical time for many birds. Birds are more susceptible to unusual climatic events during their migration due to the metabolic stress of long-distance movements. In the fall of 2020, an unusual cold weather event coupled with drought and wildfire smoke led to a large avian mortality event in New Mexico. Later analysis pointed to the mortality being largely due to starvation. This was the impetus for our research. We used 11 years of fall bird banding data from two locations, along with local drought indices, to determine what predicts avian health during the migration period. We used fat score data from over 15,000 individual birds to assess whether drought indices, age, diet, or residency influenced avian health using multiple logistic regression. We found that the probability of positive fat scores decreased as drought severity increased for younger, insectivorous, migratory birds. Insectivores had a higher probability of receiving a fat score greater than zero relative to local drought conditions, which is important, since many North American insectivores are in steep decline. Migratory birds showed a greater response than year-round residents, and older birds showed a lower but significant response compared to hatch-year birds. Our results suggest that migratory insectivores in the southwestern United States may be less resilient to drought-related climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary It is widely recognized that the assessment of animal welfare should include measures of positive emotional (affective) state. Existing behavioral and physiological indicators of a positive affective state frequently lack sensitivity, objectivity or are unsuitable in a production environment. Therefore, there is a need to develop new approaches to accurately and objectively measure a positive emotional state in animals, including novel molecular markers such a miRNA. These biomarkers must be measurable in the peripheral circulation and provide an accurate account of the physiological and molecular activity in regions of the brain associated with emotional processing. Further, such markers require validation against established behavioral and physiological indices. Here we investigated the efficacy of circulating miRNA as biomarkers of emotional state in the pig. The ability to assess the welfare of animals is dependent on our ability to accurately determine their emotional (affective) state, with particular emphasis being placed on the identification of positive emotions. The challenge remains that current physiological and behavioral indices are either unable to distinguish between positive and negative emotional states, or they are simply not suitable for a production environment. Therefore, the development of novel measures of animal emotion is a necessity. Here we investigated the efficacy of microRNA (miRNA) in the brain and blood as biomarkers of emotional state in the pig. Female Large White x Landrace pigs (n = 24) were selected at weaning and trained to perform a judgment bias test (JBT), before being exposed for 5 weeks to either enriched (n = 12) or barren housing (n = 12) conditions. Pigs were tested on the JBT once prior to treatment, and immediately following treatment. MiRNA and neurotransmitters were analyzed in blood and brain tissue after euthanasia. Treatment had no effect on the outcomes of the JBT. There was also no effect of treatment on miRNA expression in blood or the brain (FDR p > 0.05). However, pigs exposed to enriched housing had elevated dopamine within the striatum compared to pigs in barren housing (p = 0.02). The results imply that either (a) miRNAs are not likely to be valid biomarkers of a positive affective state, at least under the type of conditions employed in this study, or (b) that the study design used to modify affective state was not able to create differential affective states, and therefore establish the validity of miRNA as biomarkers.

AB  - Crop rotation is a common practice aimed at enhancing both plant disease suppression and crop productivity under open field condition. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of tomato-wheat rotation on Fusarium wilt suppression and shoot growth on tomato in comparison to tomato monoculture. The following factors were determined and integrated through a transdisciplinary approach: (i) soil chemical parameters; (ii) abundance, composition, richness and diversity of soil fungal and bacterial communities; (iii) soil biochemical and enzymatic indicators; (iv) abundance of Fusarium oxysporum isolates in rhizosphere under tomato cultivation and evaluation of the pathogenicity of the isolates; (v) suppressive response of the bulk soil samples against a selected pathogenic strain of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici on tomato; and (vi) tomato shoot growth. The integrated approach included soil amplicon sequencing by metabarcoding analyses carried out by Illumina MiSeq platform in association with the standard procedure for soil analyses. In addition, the pathogenicity of F. oxysporum from the tomato rhizosphere and the suppressive response of the soil bulk to Fusarium wilt were performed by bioassays under greenhouse condition. The results showed that, if durum wheat was rotated with cherry tomato for at least four consecutive years, it had the following beneficial effects: (i) increased suppressive response of the bulk soil samples against F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, (ii) decreased abundance of the F. oxysporum isolates in tomato rhizosphere, (iii) decreased pathogenicity of the F. oxysporum isolates, and (iv) increased tomato shoot growth. The increased abundance of certain microbial groups belonging to potential biocontrol agents against fusaria-related wilt including Bacillales (Bacillus and Paenibacillus), Pseudomonadales (Pseudomonas), Streptomycetales (Streptomyces), Eurotiales (Aspergillus and Penicillium) and Mortierellales (Mortierella), as well as the highest tomato shoot growth, coincided with the end of the second wheat rotation cycle. There were significant Spearman cross-correlations and two-way ANOVA interactions among the microbiome variables with the (i) soil chemical parameters, (ii) abundance and pathogenicity of the F. oxysporum isolates in tomato rhizosphere, (iii) soil suppression to Fusarium wilt, and (iv) tomato shoot growth. The results indicate that a soil managed under tomato-wheat rotation displays increased suppressive response against Fusarium wilt and improved shoot growth in tomato plants by changing the microbial composition and chemical parameters of the soil.

AB  - Lead is considered a highly toxic contaminant with important impacts to bird wildlife. Griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) are a sensitive indicator of the level of environmental contamination due to their position at the top of the food chain and their dependence on human activities. The aim of this study was to assess susceptibility to lead intoxication in Griffon vultures admitted to Wildlife Rehabilitation Centers (WRC), measuring blood lead levels and determining if blood lead concentrations are related to clinical signs, hematological, biochemical or radiographic findings. Also, the influence of age, gender, body condition, season and primary cause of admission were evaluated. This study was realized in all Griffon vultures admitted during a period of one year in the Rehabilitation Center GREFA. Blood lead levels are measured by using anodic stripping voltammetry. In Griffon vultures, we observed that 26% of the analyzed birds presented lead levels above 20 mu g/dL with 74% below 20 mu g/dL([pb] (< 20) = 9.34 +/- 5.60 mu g/dL). In our study, statistically significant differences were found for lead according to sex, season of admission to the center and body condition. A negative correlation was found between levels of metal and hematocrit. No association was found between clinical signs and blood lead levels in Griffon vultures, except for digestive signs as stasis and weight loss. On numerous occasions, the intoxication in this specie is related to ingestion of lead ammunition; however, we have not detected radiographic lead in our vultures. Compared with other studies, we generally found low levels of lead in blood of Griffon vultures but the blood of all birds admitted to WRC presented detectable lead concentrations. This species apparently presents a higher sensibility to the toxic effects of this metal than that described by other authors. It have been observed that there is some evidence that suggests that subclinical levels of lead could be related with a predisposition to injury or diseases, even though these birds might be admitted for other causes. The detection of levels of blood lead in animals that are admitted to a recovery center will give valuable information which could be used to monitor spatial and temporal variations and provide a clearer picture of temporal levels of this contaminant in this emblematic avian specie.

AB  - The study presents the assessment of damage to beech stands using four methods, including that taking into account the radial increment. The condition of stands in 2016, and the growth response of trees to the environmental changes since 1956 are described. The measurements and observations were carried out on 18 sample plots (tab. 1) located in south-western Poland. The mean defoliation accounts for 32.5% ranging from 16.9 to 56.9%, while the average defoliation class value is 1.62 ranging from 0.75 to 2.38. The proportion of trees was found to be the highest (approx. 60%) in class of moderate damage (fig. la). The mean value of vitality is 1.17 (ranging from 0.75 to 2.38). The proportion of trees in vitality classes differs significantly from that in defoliation classes. The highest number of trees (approx. 80%) was found to be within damage class of weakened trees (fig. 1b). The assessment of damage to trees based on synthetic damage index (defoliation and vitality combined using formula [1]) is similar to the assessment method based on tree vitality. The mean value is 1.07, ranging from 0.63 to 1.70. The largest proportion of trees (over 80%) was found to be within class 1 (fig. 1c). The index SynZ combines defoliation and vitality, as well as the growth response of trees over the last 15 years according to formula [2]. Its values range from 0.82 to 1.79 with 1.21 on average. The largest proportion of trees (over 70%) was found to be within damage class 1 (fig. 1d). The response of trees to environmental changes is an important indicator of the growth conditions. The proportion of trees with negative growth responses increases from period to period, while the proportion of trees with neutral and positive responses decreases (fig. 2). The analysed beech stands show fairly large differences in the level of the damage. The most likely cause of this situation are droughts occurring in recent growing seasons, especially in 2012. Of the methods deployed to assess damage to beech trees, the morphological-growth one is the most accurate, but the most laborious. Therefore, it is preferable to use a synthetic damage index as both tree defoliation and vitality can also be assessed outside the growing season.

AB  - Potato, the most important vegetable crop in South Africa, is produced in many distinct geographical regions differing in climate, soils, production seasons and management practices and access to markets. These differences affect the amount of input resources required to produce potatoes as well as yields and crop value, and therefore the use efficiencies of land, water, nutrients, seed and energy. Resource use efficiencies affect the ecological and financial sustainability of potato production in this region, which has in general less favourable potato growing conditions than north-western Europe and the U.S.A., where high resource use efficiencies are usually recorded. This study aimed to assess and benchmark South African potato production regions, representing a wide range of growing conditions, regarding their use of input resources and to identify resource-intensive practices, which may suggest inefficient use of inputs. Surveys were conducted in 2013 and 2014 by interviewing growers in all production regions, to provide data on resource use efficiencies. Quantitative modelling approaches were applied to calculate carbon footprints as a proxy of energy use efficiency, potential crop yields and irrigation needs for each region. Variability in the gap between potential and actual yield was used to identify yield limiting factors. Actual yields achieved were on average 60% of the potential yield, suggesting fairly efficient use of available production factors. Water, seed and nutrient use efficiencies differed widely between and within regions and were not directly proportional to water requirements and yields achieved. Fertilizers (34%) and irrigation (30%) were the greatest contributors to energy use in potato crop production. Energy required to pump water was strongly related to the amount of irrigation applied, pumping depth and distance. Long distance travel of produce to retail points contributed substantially to energy use. Significant improvements in efficiencies are possible by improving management practices. Analysis of the variability in resource use efficiencies between farms and regions provided production sustainability indicators that can assist growers in identifying inefficient practices and yield limiting factors. These can be addressed through the use of decision support systems, such as irrigation scheduling tools, to improve resource use efficiencies and the sustainability of production, not only for the production efficiency of the specific study area, but also for the economic efficiency of potato production anywhere else.

AB  - Aim Range-restricted species account for a large proportion of global biodiversity, and many such species are highly threatened by deforestation and intensifying land use in the tropics. The effects of land use on the diversity of range-restricted species have rarely been studied and remain unknown for vascular epiphytes diverse and important elements of tropical forests. This study analyses the vulnerability of range-restricted epiphyte species to human land use, compared to that of widespread species. Location Western Ecuador (Choco ecoregion): lowland rain forest (Bilsa, 0 degrees 21N 79 degrees 44W, 450650m a.s.l.) and Andean cloud forest (Otonga, 0 degrees 25S 79 degrees 01W, 16502250m a.s.l.). Methods The epiphytic vegetation of 220 study plots was surveyed. Distribution data based on herbarium specimens were compiled for all identified species in order to estimate their geographical and elevational ranges as well as the climatic conditions within the species' ranges. These range characteristics were compared for species found in contiguous primary forests, primary forest fragments, secondary forests, and for isolated remnant trees in pastures. Results Of the 587 identified epiphyte species, 252 were endemic to the Choco ecoregion (42.9%). Choco endemics were not more strongly affected by human land use than non-endemics. However, small geographical ranges and narrow climatic niches were associated with higher vulnerability to habitat changes caused by land use. Epiphyte assemblages in young secondary forests had the lowest proportions of range-restricted species and were dominated by species with broad elevational ranges. Species in secondary forests occupied the broadest ranges of mean annual temperature and precipitation; species on isolated remnant trees at the lowland site inhabited on average warmer and drier geographical ranges than species in the primary forest. Main conclusions Epiphyte species with restricted geographical distributions and narrow climatic tolerances are particularly vulnerable to human-induced habitat changes, but endemism to national or biogeographical entities alone is a poor indicator of vulnerability. Instead, narrower ecological niches correlate with lower plasticity towards changes in microclimatic habitat conditions. Besides a higher extinction risk due to their small range sizes, many range-restricted species might be threatened by their lower tolerance to the impacts of human land use.

AB  - In most countries producing milk, industry-or other stakeholder-driven initiatives are in place to improve welfare and overall dairy farming sustainability. Those initiatives typically include a system of verification of reaching targets and progress over time. Reliable indicators are a fundamental requirement to provide public assurance and allow improvement on farms. Assessing dairy cattle welfare through outcome measures of welfare is done today through visual evaluations, including those of lameness, injuries, hygiene, and body condition. Numerical scoring charts for visual evaluation have been validated, and training programs have been developed to achieve high repeatability of assessors. Sampling strategies have been validated to determine how many animals and how many days are required to obtain reliable estimates of prevalence. However, visual evaluations require long periods of data collection, and multiple visits on farm, along with repeated checks of assessors to ensure repeatability over time, are, in turn, very costly to implement. An attractive alternative is relying on automated measures as activity monitors are becoming common on commercial farms; among those, lying time retains the most attention. The use of herd lying time in both freestall and tie-stall situations has been validated. Current research is looking at relationships between lying time and other outcome measures of welfare, as well as lying time and risk factors for welfare in the environment (e.g., poor stall configuration or hoof trimming routine). We are not quite yet ready to rely solely on lying time to assess welfare; however, activity monitoring could certainly contribute to early detection of health and welfare issues (e.g., frequency of visits to the robotic milking system). Another interesting avenue is the development of early outcome measures of welfare and, possibly, remote indicators, for example, performance data collected routinely in Dairy Herd Improvement agencies' databases. The rationale is that a herd with good health and high longevity should be at lower risk of poor welfare. Research is needed to identify predictors and their conditions of use, allowing us to discriminate good vs. poor welfare status, at both the individual and herd levels. Finally, milk samples are already collected routinely to check quality and safety. It would be convenient to be able to predict cow welfare status directly with the milk using biomarkers, but again, we are not there yet.

AB  - Coalbed methane (CBM) makes up a significant portion of the world's natural gas resources. The discovery that approximately 20% of natural gas is microbial in origin has led to interest in microbially enhanced CBM (MECoM), which involves stimulating microorganisms to produce additional CBM from existing production wells. This paper reviews current laboratory and field research on understanding processes and reservoir conditions which are essential for microbial CBM generation, the progress of efforts to stimulate microbial methane generation in coal beds, and key remaining knowledge gaps. Research has been primarily focused on identifying microbial communities present in areas of CBM generation and attempting to determine their function, in-situ reservoir conditions that are most favorable for microbial CBM generation, and geochemical indicators of metabolic pathways of methanogenesis (i.e., acetoclastic or hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis). Meanwhile, researchers at universities, government agencies, and companies have focused on four primary MECoM strategies: 1) microbial stimulation (i.e., addition of nutrients to stimulate native microbes); 2) microbial augmentation (i.e., addition of microbes not native to or abundant in the reservoir of interest); 3) physically increasing microbial access to coal and distribution of amendments; and 4) chemically increasing the bioavailability of coal organics. Most companies interested in MECoM have pursued microbial stimulation: Luca Technologies, Inc., successfully completed a pilot scale field test of their stimulation strategy, while two others, Ciris Energy and Next Fuel, Inc., have undertaken smaller scale field tests. Several key knowledge gaps remain that need to be addressed before MECoM strategies can be implemented commercially. Little is known about the bacterial community responsible for coal biodegradation and how these microorganisms may be stimulated to enhance microbial methanogenesis. In addition, research is needed to understand what fraction of coal is available for biodegradation, and methods need to be developed to determine the extent of in-situ coal biodegradation by MECoM processes for monitoring changes to coal quality. Questions also remain about how well field-scale pilot tests will scale to commercial production, how often amendments will need to be added to maintain new methane generation, and how well MECoM strategies transfer between coal basins with different formation water geochemistries and coal ranks. Addressing these knowledge gaps will be key in determining the feasibility and commercial viability of MECoM technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water vapor content, instability, and convergence conditions are the key to short-duration heavy rainfall forecasting. It is necessary to understand the large-scale atmospheric environment characteristics of short-duration heavy rainfall by investigating the distribution of physical parameters for different hourly rainfall intensities. The observed hourly rainfall data in China and the NCEP final analysis (FNL) data during 1 May and 30 September from 2002 to 2009 are used. NCEP FNL data are 6-hourly, resulting in sample sizes of 1573370, 355346, and 11401 for three categories of hourly rainfall (P) of no precipitation (P < 0.1 mm h(-1)), ordinary precipitation (0.1 <= P < 20 mm h(-1)), and short-duration heavy rainfall (P >= 20.0 mm h(-1)), respectively, by adopting a temporal matching method. The results show that the total precipitable water (PWAT) is the best parameter indicating the hourly rainfall intensity. A PWAT of 28 mm is necessary for any short-duration heavy rainfall. The possibility of short-duration heavy rainfall occurrence increases with PWAT, and a PWAT of 59 mm is nearly sufficient. The specific humidity is a better indicator than relative humidity. Both 700- and 850-hPa relative humidity greater than 80% could be used to determine whether or not it is going to rain, but could not be used to estimate the rainfall intensity. Temperature and potential pseudo-equivalent temperature are also reasonable indicators of short-duration heavy rainfall. Among the atmospheric instability parameters, the best lifted index (BLI) performs best on the short-duration rainfall discrimination; the next best is the K index (KI). The three rainfall categories are not well recognized by total totals (TT) or the temperature difference between 850 and 500 hPa (DT85). Three-quarters of short-duration heavy rainfall occurred with BLI less than -0.9, while no short-duration heavy rainfall occurred when BLI was greater than 2.6. The minimum threshold of KI was 28.1 for short-duration heavy rainfall. The importance of dynamic conditions was well demonstrated by the 925- and 850-hPa divergence. The representativeness of 925-hPa divergence is stronger than that of 850 hPa. Three-quarters of short-duration heavy rainfall occurred under a negative divergence environment. However, both the best convective potential energy (BCAPE) and vertical wind shear were unable to discriminate the hourly rainfall intensities.

AB  - In theory, it should be possible to use C-isotope variations in speleothems as a monitor of past climate change in a manner analogous to O-isotopes. C isotope values are related to the terrestrial C cycle and provide information about soil and vegetation. Variations in the carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) values of speleothems reflect changes of the vegetation type in the vicinity of a cave and arise because of the differences in the photosynthetic pathways between C3 and C4 type vegetation. Carbon isotopes in speleothems may serve as indicators of vegetative change, climatic conditions, and karst processes. Carbon isotope variations in speleothems arise from a variety of causes from both surface environment (local climate, bioproductivity, vegetation type, etc.) and subsurface environment in which rain water passes through the soil zone and then the epikarst into cave voids. Even within the cave, environmental local processes such as evaporation, drip rates, and changes in cave air pCO(2) controlled by seasonal ventilation can influence the final delta C-13 values found in the speleothem record. Interpretation of delta C-13 records may require several consecutive processes. In the present study, the delta C-13 record of a stalagmite from Nerja Cave was examined to evaluate the roles of environmental processes and local cave conditions on speleothem delta C-13 values. Stalagmite consisted of aragonite crystals with mineralogical composition uniform. There was no observed evidence to indicate recrystallization of aragonite to calcite or the presence of alternating mineral laminae. The influence of vegetation on speleothem delta C-13 primarily reflects changes in the density of vegetative cover and biomass. Greater vegetative cover contributes to lower delta C-13 values as more biogenic CO2 is dissolved into the seepage water. When vegetative cover is reduced by changes in climate or from deforestation, the vegetative contribution of biogenic CO2 diminishes and speleothem delta C-13 values increase. Ventilation of Nerja Cave may also induce changes in cave air pCO(2) that contributed to the delta C-13 record. During cold periods, enhanced air exchange may have occurred between the cold, dense air outside and the internal cave atmosphere. Increased air exchange could have lowered pCO(2) of the cave air, increased degassing, and enriched the precipitating aragonite in C-13.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is ubiquitous throughout aquatic systems. Fluorescence techniques can be used to characterize the fluorescing proportion of DOM, aquatic fluorescent organic matter (AFOM). AFOM is conventionally named in association with specific fluorescence "peaks," which fluoresce in similar optical regions as microbially-derived proteinaceous material (Peak T), and terrestrially-derived humic-like compounds (Peaks C/C+), with Peak T previously being investigated as a tool for bacterial enumeration within freshwaters. The impact of anthropogenic nutrient loading on the processing of DOM by microbial communities is largely unknown. Previous laboratory studies utilizing environmental freshwater have employed growth media with complex background fluorescence, or very high nutrient concentrations, preventing the investigation of AFOM production under a range of more representative nutrient concentrations within a matrix exhibiting very low background fluorescence. We describe a laboratory-based model with Pseudomonas aeruginosa that incorporates a low fluorescence growth matrix consisting of a simulated freshwater (SFW), representative of low-hardness freshwater systems allowing controlled nutrient conditions to be studied. The effects of microbial processing of DOM as a function of available nitrogen, phosphorous, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the form of glucose were investigated over 48 h at highly resolved time increments. The model system demonstrates the production of a range of complex AFOM peaks in the presence and absence of DOC, revealing no linear relationship between cell numbers and any of the peaks for the bacterial species studied, with AFOM peaks increasing with microbial cell number, ranging from 55.2 quinine sulfate units (QSU) per 10(6) cells to 155 QSU per 10(6) cells (p < 0.05) for Peak T during the exponential growth phase of P. aeruginosa under high nutrient conditions with 5 mg L-1 DOC. Nutrient and DOC concentration was found to cause differential production of autochthonous- or allochthonous-like AFOM, with lower DOC concentrations resulting in higher Peak T production relative to Peaks C/C+ upon the addition of nutrients, and high DOC concentrations resulting in higher Peak C/C+ production relative to Peak T. Our results show the production of allochthonous-like AFOM from a simple and non-fluorescent carbon source, and provide uncertainty in the use of Peak T as a reliable surrogate for specific bacterial enumeration, particularly in dynamic or nutrient-impacted environments, pointing toward the use of fluorescence as an indicator for microbial metabolism.

AB  - Background: Hot deserts contain several habitats where the diversity, structure and functional features of plant communities in certain habitats, such as sandy soils and dunes for instance, are little explored. Objectives: This study aimed to characterize the flora of sandy soils of the northern Algerian Sahara in order to determine the different plant functional traits and conservation aspects of the psammophytic communities for a sustainable management of phytogenetic resources. Methods: In seven sites representing different sandy habitats, spontaneous psammophytic communities were sampled using 70 floristic releves 'samples' with an area of 100 m2 for each and 10 replicates per sampling site. In each sample, the number of individual of plant species was measured, then plant diversity and similarity was estimated per site. Several plant traits including lifeforms, morphological types, dispersal forms, Noy-Meir types and chorological categories were attributed for each plant species to characterize psammophyte communities. Results: Overall, plant diversity of Saharan sandy habitats was very low. The sampled sandy soils and dunes included 29 plant species classified into 27 genera and 18 families, with good representation of Poaceae and Brassicaceae. The arido-active species were dominant with 62.1% of the flora, which were mainly represented by perennial plants belonging to chamaephytes, hemicryptophytes and phanerophytes. Plants of sandy soils and dunes adopted various dispersal types, mainly dominated by anemochorous species. The chorological analysis revealed the existence of two endemic species to the Sahara Desert whereas the Mediterranean-Saharan-Arabian species were mostly represented by the Saharo-Arabian element which adapts well to environmental conditions of the Sahara. The assessment of plant abundances showed that the community of psammophytes contained three rare plants, one quite rare species and two fairly common plants in the flora of Algeria. Accordingly, sandy habitats require adequate management measures in order to preserve the biodiversity in Saharan environments. The number of plant species, genera and families significantly increased with the increase in vegetation cover on sand dunes. Conclusions: The results of this survey can represent a first floristic database providing good indicators on plant communities, habitat and environmental conditions of sandy soils and dunes of the Algerian Sahara.

AB  - The European Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation has been in force since 2007 and is intended to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment. The REACH regulation is based on the principle that manufacturers, importers, and downstream users take responsibility for their chemicals. Currently about 23 000 single chemicals are registered within the REACH legislation. A large proportion of substances registered under REACH end up in technical mixtures, intentionally manufactured as such, or generated mixtures containing byproducts of processes. Such mixtures that contain a number of different components are, for example, ink, paint, lacquer, mortar, or cleaning agents. However, REACH focuses on single substances and addresses the safe use of substances as such (e.g., bisphenol A) or substances in mixtures (e.g., bisphenol A used as an antioxidant in mixtures) and in articles (e.g., bisphenol A used as a monomer for polycarbonate production from which greenhouse sheets may be made). In contrast to other substance regulations, under REACH the registrants and downstream users of chemicals are responsible for the risk assessment. According to the REACH regulation, they also have the obligation to derive and communicate safe use conditions for their technical mixtures. Currently, no guidance document and no distinct obligations for an assessment of technical mixtures exist. In light of the available evidence for the joint exposures and effects of chemicals due to co-exposures, the need for approaches for a mixture assessment and improved data communications were highlighted by various stakeholders from industry, European member states, and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The lead component identification (LCID) methodology and the safe use of mixtures information (SUMI) tool were proposed by the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) as working tools for the evaluation of the hazard potential, derivation of safe use conditions, and data communication for mixtures along the supply chain. The present paper analyzes the workability and pitfalls of these proposed methodologies from a regulatory perspective, aiming at a safe use of technical mixtures which considers the joint effects and exposures of its components.

AB  - Photosynthesis is a critical component to understanding how CO2 uptake and vegetation productivity drives the terrestrial carbon cycle. Light use efficiency (LUE) is a key indicator of photosynthesis, which is determined by the most limiting/co-limiting environmental stresses such as nutrition, water, and temperature, restraining the photochemical reaction process across both space and time due to remote sensing offers a capability to relate changes in LUE with changes in the spectral characteristics of leaves through the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). The PRI is a narrow waveband index that responds with changes in xanthophyll-induced absorption feature at 531 nm. It remains challenging, however, to upscale PRI from leaf to canopy and ultimately to the landscape level due to physiological and structural factors such as leaf angle distribution, leaf area, canopy structure and pigment pool size as well as observational considerations such as sun-view geometry and background reflectance. As a result, understanding patterns of PRI and LUE across different climate-induced stress conditions and within age-induced vertical stand structures is helpful for improving our understanding how these relationships change over forested landscapes in anticipation of future airborne and ultimately satellite based observations. In this study, we report on the use of the automated multi-angular spectro-radiometer (AMSPEC) and eddy-covariance techniques to examine how PRI and LUE varies at young (HDF88) and older (DF49) Douglas-fir sites. Results indicate that a strong relationship between bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) corrected PRI and LUE exists (DF49: R-2 = 0.73; HDF88: R-2 = 0.79). The overall LUE at the older, more structurally complex site was higher than at the younger, structurally simpler stand under a range of air temperature and light conditions. We used the standard deviation (SD) of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) return pulses to characterize canopy vertical structure of the site, and found that complex vertical structures (i.e., high SD) may contribute to a higher long-term averaged LUE (R-2 = 0.87). While interesting we conclude the mechanism of the relationship between LUE and vertical forest structures needs to be further explored because of the key role internal and external shadowing has on light regimes with stands and thus vertical patterns of LUE varying across forest stands of different age.

AB  - The cultivation of sugar beet as a winter crop in Central Europe will require tolerance of severe frost. Due to the large variation of survival rates in different environments it is necessary to quantify the risk of frost killing for potential growing regions. The objectives of our study were, (i) to determine the lethal temperature of sugar beet taproot crown tissue as an indicator of frost damage, (ii) the development of a regression model that properly estimates the temperature of crown tissue from standard weather data, and (iii) a risk assessment for frost killing in four beet cultivation regions, representing different climatic conditions in Central Europe. In field trials at six environments, temperatures were measured above the beet canopy (0.3-0.5 m height), at the soil surface, 5 cm deep in the soil, and in the taproot crown. Survival rates were determined after winter.
   The survival rates of sugar beets were highly dependant on the maximum taproot diameter (optimal size: 1-2.5 cm) and the environmental conditions. A crown tissue temperature below -6 degrees C was a reliable indicator for frost killing, even though the exact lethal temperature of optimal sized sugar beets could not be identified. The crown temperature was accurately predicted from available weather data using multiple linear regression models. It was estimated best by combining the parameters 'daily mean air temperature', 'daily mean soil temperature at 5 cm depth' (closest correlation to crown temperature) and 'daily snow depth'. The prediction was further improved by adding the air and soil temperatures of the previous day and the 2-fold interactions of regressors to the model.
   Risk assessment for frost killing in Central European beet growing areas was based on weather data of the past 20 years provided by Germany's National Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD). Our approach showed that at locations with mild winters, such as Cologne, the successful cultivation of winter sugar beet is possible with little risk of frost killing. On the contrary, growing winter sugar beet at places like Gottingen and Regensburg holds a high risk for frost killing. Finally, the presented approach needs to be improved with more accurate estimates of crown tissue temperature, and more precise determination of the lethal temperature of winter beets with the optimal taproot diameter.

AB  - In this study soil chemical and biochemical properties, cover crop biomass production and quality, and climatic factors (AI) have been taken into account in order to identify sensitive agroecological indicators suitable for an early assessment of green manuring outcomes, measured in terms of soil CO2 emission and soil mineralization dynamics in a short term experiment in a Mediterranean environment. The field experiment was conducted over two cropping rotations during 2004-2005 in central Italy. A winter cover crop/sweet pepper sequence with the cover crop used as green manure was adopted. The cover crop treatments were common vetch (CV), rye grass (RG), and fallow soil as the control (Control). Soil enzyme activities (acid phosphatase. protease and beta-glucosidase), CO2 emission, and inorganic nitrogen concentrations were monitored from cover crop green manure incorporation to pepper harvesting in order to evaluate soil mineralization dynamics. The climatic conditions were summarized by the monthly aridity index (AI) calculated as the precipitation/temperature ratio. A group of mineralization indexes, calculated using values of available nitrogen and enzyme activities, was used to describe the soil process during crop cycle after green manure. The mineralization process dynamic results as a combined effect of climatic conditions and soil organic matter quality produced by different cover crop green manures. The common vetch green manuring was effective in lowering the soil C/N with respect to the control soil (5.7 vs. 8.3 and 8.5 vs. 12.1 in 2004 and 2005, respectively), promoting CO2 emission (8.95 vs. 5.19 and 6.75 vs. 4.28 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) in 2004 and 2005, respectively), enzyme activity, nitrogen release, and crop aboveground biomass (8.59 vs. 7.05 Mg ha(-1) dry matter). Among the selected agroecological indicators, the relationships between enzyme activities and the monthly aridity index may suggest a new approach for agronomists and soil scientists to understand the combined effect of temperature and precipitation on soil mineralization dynamic. The high aridity index at the time of green manuring may have caused a priming effect of SOM and promoted soil mineralization during the vegetable crop growing season in a Mediterranean environment. Finally, no evidence was found between soil CO2 emission and the aridity index; soil respiration was mainly affected by cover crop biomass and the soil C/N ratio. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Exceptional preservation of fossils in so-called Konservat-Lagerstatten requires specific depositional regimes excluding disturbance of bottom sediments by either wave actions and currents or by benthic fauna. We here describe a depositional model for the Eocene "Pesciara di Bolca" Konservat-Lagerstatte based on sedimentological, paleoecological,and detailed organic geochemical results. Sediments were deposited in a lagoonal-like basin with stagnant bottom waters located on an extended carbonate platform that was sheltered from open marine waters by a submarine threshold. Run-off from nearby land areas provided nutrients to support an algal community dominated by diatoms. No fossil diatom shells have been identified, but evidence for their presence is given by the high abundance of highly branched isoprenoids in extractable bitumens. Influx of terrigenous organic matter into the lagoon occurred in particular during deposition of the basal fish-bearing level L1. Here not only plant macrofossils, amber, spores and pollen but also the lipid composition indicated notable input of land plants via the presence of n-C-24 to n-C-32 carboxylic acids, long-chain n-alkanes (n-C-27, n-C-29, n-C-31) and angiosperm wax triterpenoids. The redox regime in general was strongly reducing as evidenced by the high concentration of sulfur vs. organic carbon, excellent kerogen preservation as shown by high hydrogen indices, and low pristane/phytane but high phytane/n-C-18 ratios. The water column was highly stratified with anoxic saline bottom and fresh surface waters. Euxinic conditions with free reduced sulfur present in the photic zone could only be detected in sediments from the L1 horizon via traces of aromatic carotenoids derived from green sulfur bacteria (chlorobiaceae), which utilize H2S in anoxygenic photosynthesis. The depositional regime is thus comparable to the lithographic limestones of Solnhofen but based on biomarker evidence lacks the high salinities postulated for the latter. Biomarker composition indicates that best preservation conditions prevailed in the basal part of the studied section (0-7 m above datum) but declined upon deposition of the upper part We interpret the body of the Pesciara as a parasequence of the 4th order (0.01-0.5 Ma), with the lower pan representing a relative sea-level lowstand and the upper part a relative sea-level highstand.

AB  - Every year thousands of horses from Mexico and the United States of America (USA) are transported to slaughter in Mexico, but little is known about their welfare or pre-slaughter logistics. In this study, we recorded the origin, sex, age and condition of horses (121 journeys, 2648 animals) upon arrival to an abattoir in northern Mexico, including transport details. Horse welfare was measured indirectly via individual scores for body condition, coat quality, lameness, ocular and nasal discharge, as well as reactivity to a chute restraint test, all performed shortly after unloading. The average journey duration was 9.69 (+/- 7.6) hours for horses from Mexico and 16.77 (+/- 4.51) hours for horses from the USA (77 % of all journeys). The prevalence of ocular discharge, nasal discharge, skin wounds, lameness and diarrhoea, were 23 %, 12 %, 11 %, 9 %, 1 % (respectively) of all the horses observed, with no significant differences between Mexican and American horses (P 0.05). During the chute test the American horses were calmer than the Mexican ones (P < 0.001), who were more restless and aggressive (P = 0.001). Likewise, vocalizations in their three variants during the restraint, neigh/whinny (P = 0.018), nicker (P < 0.001), and snort (P = 0.018), were more common in horses from Mexico. In order to help characterize fitness for transport, a two-step cluster analysis was applied using the welfare indicators, suggesting the existence of four clusters (C) evaluated on arrival at the abattoir (from good to very poor fitness): good (profile C4, n = 769, 29.1 %), average (profile C1, n = 799 horses, 30.2 %), poor (profile C3, n = 586, 22.1 %) and very poor (profile C2, n = 494, 18.6 %). In fact, the C4 best welfare group had 0% lame, 0% nasal discharge, 16.4 % ocular discharge, 7.9 % skin wounds. Instead, the C2 poorest welfare group had 45.8 % lame, 61.1 % nasal discharge, 42.8 % ocular discharge, and 19.9 % skin wounds. Results show potential for using nasal discharge, lameness and ocular discharge as key indicators of horse fitness and welfare on abattoir. The study provides detailed scientific data to help establish strategies regarding optimal days of recovery post-transport and fattening for homogenization of weights between animals of different origins, logistic planning, and optimization of logistic resources to minimize the biological cost of long-distance transport.

AB  - The growing of catch crops aims to prevent nutrient leaching in autumn after harvest and during the following winter, but due to competition, catch crops may also reduce yields of the main crop. We used meta-analysis to quantitatively review 35 studies conducted in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway over the past four decades. These studies assessed the effect of both non-legume and legume catch crops undersown in spring cereals on nitrogen (N) leaching loss or its risk as estimated by the content of soil nitrate N(NO3- - N) or its sum with ammonium N(NH4+ - N) in late autumn. The meta-analysis also included the grain yield and N content of spring cereals. To identify sources of variation, we studied the effects of soil texture and management (ploughing time, the amount of N applied), as well as climatic (annual precipitation) and experimental conditions (duration of experiments, lysimeter vs. field experiments, the decade in which the experiment took place).
   Compared to control groups with no catch crops, non-legume catch crops, mainly ryegrass species, reduced N leaching loss by 50% on average, and soil nitrate N or inorganic N by 35% in autumn. Italian ryegrass depleted soil N more effectively (by 60%) than did perennial ryegrass or Westerwolds ryegrass (by 25%). In contrast, legumes (white and red clovers) did not diminish the risk for N leaching. Otherwise, the effect on N leaching and its risk were consistent across the studies conducted in different countries on clay and coarse-textured mineral soils with different ploughing times, N fertilization rates (<160 kg ha(-1)), and amounts of annual precipitation (480-1040 mm). Non-legume catch crops reduced grain yield by 3% with no changes in grain N content. In contrast, legumes and mixed catch crops increased both grain yield and grain N content by 6%.
   Therefore, in spring cereal production, non-legume catch crops represent a universal and effective method for reducing N leaching across the varieties of soils and weather conditions in the Nordic countries. Moreover, the trade-off between potential grain yield loss and environmental benefits seems tolerable and can be taken into account in environmental subsidy schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Foraminiferal assemblages, sediments, and delta C-13, delta N-15, and C:N ratios are used to investigate how aquaculture in the Setiu estuarine-lagoonal system (SEL) in Terengganu, Malaysia has affected environmental quality since the mid-1970s. Three cores were collected beneath floating fish-cage sites, two (S43 and S40) from the lagoon and one (S9A) from the estuary. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of core sediment indicate terrestrial sources for organic matter, including mangrove vegetation, throughout the cores. Percent carbon, percent nitrogen, and percent mud increase up core throughout S43. In S40, a similar up-core increase reverses, possibly related to the northward migration of an inlet to a more proximal position. In core S9A a similar reversal in these measurements corresponds to recent abandonment of fish cages at this location.
   Foraminiferal assemblages in cores S43 and S40 are dominated by calcareous taxa, in particular Ammonia aff. A. aoteana and Rosalina globularis. Agglutinated specimens, particularly of Ammobaculites exiguus, increase in abundance near the top of S43 and S40, likely in response to an increase in organic matter. Core S9A contains only agglutinated foraminifera, with Trochammina amnicola, Ammotium directum, Am. exiguus, and Miliammina fusca as the most abundant species. Foraminiferal assemblages do not change at sharp boundaries between sand and mud units in S9A, where T. amnicola dominates assemblages throughout the core except in the uppermost 4 cm. This is likely due to taphonomic loss of the delicate M. fusca down core. The percent of live specimens is relatively low in all three cores. The densities of dead foraminifera at S43 and S40 are extremely high at the base of the cores (i.e., at the onset of aquaculture) and near the surface of S40. These high densities are attributed to a baffling effect created by the fish cages as tidal currents transport sediments northwards in the lagoon.
   Aquaculture has affected organic-matter content, sediment characteristics, and foraminiferal distributions in the SEL. However, rapid return (probably within one-three years) to pre-aquaculture conditions after the abandonment of S9A and a slower return to pre-aquaculture conditions in S40 suggest that environmental health of the SEL is not overly compromised by the current scale of floating fish-cage aquaculture, particularly where significant tidal flushing occurs.

AB  - Treatment of lake sediments with salts is a promising approach for preventing phosphorus release from sediments. Five 35-d treatments of undisturbed sediment cores in the East Lake, Wuhan, China were applied under anoxic conditions: nothing added (control), Al(2)(SO(4))(3) added, FeCl(3) added, CaCl(2) added, and NaNO(3) added. To identify changes in the P binding sites in the sediment caused by the treatments, different P binding forms were extracted from the sediment before and after the treatments. We found that the mean P release rates for anoxic treatments with Al(2)(SO(4))(3), FeCl(3), CaCl(2) and NaNO(3) were -0.6, 0.03, 0.6 and 2.6 mg/(m(2)center dot d), respectively, while the P release rate with no additives was 7.3 mg/(m(2)center dot d). In suboxic conditions, the concentration of total phosphorus (TP(average) 657 mg/kg) in sediment was much lower than that of untreated sediment (TP(average) 688 mg/kg) and treatments with salts (TP(Al(2)(SO(4))(3)) 793 mg/kg, TP(FeCl(3)) 781 mg/kg, TP(NaNO(3)) 802 mg/kg, TP(CaCl(2)) 747 mg/kg). We also found that adding CaCl(2) prevented P release because of apatite formation and because P(Ca) (Ca bound P) increased at the sediment surface. Addition of Fe(3+) and NO (3) (-) to the sediment increased the amounts of P(Fe, Mn) (Redox-sensitive P, mostly Fe and Mn compounds), since iron oxide has the ability to combine P. Addition of Al(2)(SO(4))(3) increased the fraction of P(Al, Fe) (P bound to metal oxides (Al, Fe)) and decreased the P and Fe in the water above the anoxic sediment, showing the greater ability of Al in binding P. The results showed that Al(2)(SO(4))(3), FeCl(3), CaCl(2) and NaNO(3) all had an effect in controlling phosphorus release. The effect was related to the forms of phosphorus existing in the sediment before treatment and the forms resulting after adding the four reagents. The combination of Al(3+) or Fe(3+) with NO (3) (-) promises to be a reasonable chemical treatment for increasing the P retention capacity of sediments in eutrophic lakes. If chemical treatment is combined with bioremediation, the aim of environmental repair may be achieved.

AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) deficiency is a major factor limiting crop productivity in many tropical and subtropical soils. Due to the acidic nature of these soils, rock phosphate (RP)-based P fertilizers that are cheaper than manufactured water-soluble P fertilizers can be an attractive alternative under certain conditions. Assessment of the efficacy of these alternative P fertilizers and a rational management of local P resources for sustainable agricultural production require an understanding of the dynamics of P in the soil-plant system and the interactions of various P sources in soils and monitoring of soil available P levels. The present work was conducted to test the applicability of the P-32 isotopic kinetic method to assess the soil P fertility status and evaluate the agronomic effectiveness of local rock phosphates in subtropical China. A series of experiments was carried out in the laboratory, greenhouse and field conditions with the following specific objectives: (a) to evaluate the suitability of this isotopic kinetic method in evaluating soil P fertility in 32 soil samples collected across southern China, (b) to test and further develop chemical extraction methods for routine soil P testing, (c) to monitor the dissolution kinetics of local low to medium grade rock phosphate sources and their effect on soil properties and (d) to evaluate their agronomic effectiveness in greenhouse and field experiments. Since most of the studied soils had very low concentrations of soluble P and high P-fixing capacities, the isotopic kinetic method was found unsuitable for evaluating soil P fertility and to predict plant P uptake. In contrast, the proposed chemical extraction method (NaHCO3-NH4F) predicted very well plant P uptake, suggesting that this extraction method can be routinely used to evaluate soil bioavailable P in similar soils in subtropical China. From the incubation study, it was found that although the local low to medium grade RPs were inferior to the reactive NCPR in increasing soil available P levels, they have the potential to improve soil chemical properties. Field experiments indeed demonstrated that the medium grade Jinxiang RP significantly increased crop yield, suggesting that local low to medium grade RPs could be used as P sources to provide P to plants and also to improve soil chemical properties. Overall, these results provide important information for a rational management of P resources for sustainable agriculture in subtropical China.

AB  - Microbial transformation rate data and theoretical considerations were analyzed for selected organic chemicals with respect to the general utility of mathematical models for predicting microbial transformation rates for risk assessment and regulatory purposes.  By recognizing the unique problems associated with predicting microbial transformation rates within specific substrate concentration ranges, [S], the research, development, and testing of predictive mathematical models for environmental exposure assessment can be better focused.  Lacking site-specific data, such an approach may yield useful interim models to meet our current needs as our understanding of environmental processes continues towards developing models more capable of accurately predicting microbial transformation rates over broader ranges of conditions.  One range of [S] considered for separate treatment was a sub-maintenance range (less-than-or-equal-to 0.05-mu-M), where microbial transformation rates may depart from pseudo-first-order kinetics (first-order in [S] with constant biomass) as a result of an insufficient substrate concentration for cell biomass maintenance.  In another range of [S] considered for separate treatment, the toxic range (greater-than-or-equal-to 5 mM), organic substrates may be sufficiently toxic to the general metabolic activities of the organism transforming the substrate that transformation rates do not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics.  Without site-specific data, microbial transformation rates in these ranges of [S] should probably either be disregarded or assumed to occur at the maximum possible rate, depending, respectively, on whether the environmental concern lies in the disappearance of a toxic parent compound or in the formation of a toxic metabolite.  Between these ranges lies an area characterized by multisystem kinetics, a region of [S] where microbial transformation rates appear to be reasonably predictable, albeit at a wide range of rates depending on the particular microorganisms dominating the transformation process, their concentrations, and the associated environmental conditions.  For this region of [S], we suggest that there are important considerations to be made whenever a set of apparent kinetic parameters determined by conventional plots of kinetics data at low [S] are used to predict microbial transformation rates at much higher [S], and vice versa.  To accommodate the possible effects of multiple systems operating over a wide range of [S], either the Michaelis-Menten equation with K(m) and V(max) values experimentally determined at moderately high [S] (approximately 0.1-1 mM), or an empirical equation for extrapolating pseudo-first-order transformation rate coefficients and half-life values to higher ranges of [S], should be used.

AB  - Climate-related extremes such as droughts have led to significant impacts on some watersheds. To assess watershed health and develop effective management plans, information about the function and structure of the watersheds in the context of their climatic response, especially to take into account rainfall anomalies and climate change adaptation, is needed. Integration of climatic variables with reliability, resilience and vulnerability (RRV) indicators, is a novel approach for generating this information. This study investigated the behavior of RRV indicators with respect to rainfall variability and drought patterns for three watersheds governed by different climates. Reliability was defined as the probability of a watershed to be in the range of satisfactory Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values. Resilience was indicated as the speed of recovery from an unsatisfactory condition. Vulnerability was defined as a function of the exposure of a watershed to climate change and variation using the SPI. The study areas were the Foyle Watershed in Northern Ireland (temperate oceanic, Cfb), the Xarrama Watershed in Portugal (Mediterranean hot summer, Csa) and the Shazand Watershed in Iran (moderate to cold semi-arid (Bsk). Based on the SPI pattern of each watershed, the SPI of -0.1 for the Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and +0.1 for the Shazand Watershed was selected as the drought threshold. The drought based RRV index was subsequently calculated from long-term (1981-2012) RRV indicators, resulting in means of 0.52 +/- 0.25, 0.53 +/- 0.21 and 0.30 +/- 0.18 for the three watersheds, respectively. These means reflect the status of the watersheds in terms of climatic conditions, which was moderate dry (0.41-0.60) for the Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and dry (0.21-0.40) for the Shazand Watershed. The temporal trend of the drought based RRV index was found to be non-significantly increasing (P-value > 0.52) for the Foyle and Xarrama watersheds and non-significantly decreasing for the Shazand Watershed (P-value > 0.48). The vulnerability indicator and drought based RRV index were significantly (p-value = 0.00) affected by the climatological gradient. The results of the conceptual framework linked to statistical trends can provide researchers, policy makers, and land managers a more comprehensive base to assess variability of watershed health and design drought management plans.

AB  - The present paper attempts to develop a new model by considering various indicators of different types of land degradation or desertification. These types include water erosion, soil salinity, vegetation degradation, and lowering of ground water table. The indicators can be used to find areas with higher rates of degradation which are called Potential Risk Areas (risky zones) in this paper, and can also be used to estimate the probability that degradation will increase in these areas. The Mond river basin, located in the southern part of Iran, has been selected as a test area to assess the risk and kind of desertification. For this purpose two sub basins of the Khormuj and Khane-Zenian & Siakh-Darengun have been chosen for detailed study as these two provide enough variation in climatic conditions like rainfall and topography. The different kinds of data gathered from records and published reports of the different governmental offices of Iran have been used for this purpose. The thresholds for the severity classes of indicators have been established and then the hazard map for each indicator of types of desertification has been prepared in a GIS. The risk maps of water erosion, soil salinization, lowering of water table, and vegetation degradation have been produced for both sub basins. Areas on the maps are assigned to risk classes on the basis of risk scores derived by considering the cumulative effects of all indicators overlying the area in the GIS. It was possible to distinguish the areas under 'actual risk' from areas under 'potential risk' of desertification types. Also areas under potential risk are classified to subclasses with different probability level to show a statistical picture of risk in future. The final map of risk of desertification is produced by overlaying all four maps of degradation types. Between the two basins the overall environmental condition in the Khormuj sub basin is worse. Results show that potential risk areas are much widespread than areas under actual risk in the upper reaches (of both sub basins) of Mond basin, indicating further threat of land degradation or desertification in the future. The percent of areas under actual risk are much more extensive in the lower reaches (Khormuj sub basin), indicating the higher degradation at present. It is hoped that this attempt using GIS will be found applicable for other regions of the world.

AB  - I used litterfall sampling to estimate the biomass, diversity, and community structure of epiphytic lichens in three dry forest cover types in the eastern Washington Cascade range. Cover types represented a temperature/moisture and stand structural complexity gradient. Lichen litterfall biomass increased with increasing stand complexity and moisture. Lichen litterfall biomass was 3.42 kg/ha in open pine stands, 7.51 kg/ha in young mixed-species stands, 8.55 kg/ha in mature mixed-species stands. Six species accounted for 63% of the total sample biomass: Bryoria capillaris (20.2%), Hypogymnia imshaugii (15.8%), Letharia vulpina (14.5%), B. fremontii (7.2%), Nodobryoria abbreviata (2.8%), and Alectoria sarmentosa (2.6%). Bryoria tortuosa, considered rare in most of its range, was relatively common in young forest. Epiphytic lichen species richness and dominance did not differ among the three forest cover types. Lichen associations differed, however, among cover types. The dominant lichen in open pine stands was L vulpina, followed by Bryoria spp., H. imshaugii, and L columbiana. Vulpicida canadensis and L. columbiana were weak indicator species. Young stands were dominated by H. imshaugii, a strong indicator species of young stands, followed by B. capillaris and L. vulpina. Cetraria platyphylla and C. pallidula also were strong indicator species of young stands. Mature stands were overwhelmingly dominated by Bryoria species, primarily B. capillaris and B. fremontii, both strong indicators of mature stands. A. sarmentosa, H. imshaugii, and L. vulpina were other moderately abundant species. Alectoria imshaugii was also a strong indicator species of mature forest. Impacts on epiphytic lichens of dry forest management options that reduce stand density in fire-suppressed stands might vary. Lichens associated with dry open conditions would presumably benefit. The impact on species associated with old or moist conditions, especially forage lichens, might be lessened by variable-density thinning and other practices that maintain open- and closed-canopy patchiness and large trees. That patchiness might be hard to maintain with a maintenance program of understory burning patterned after natural fire regimes. At landscape scales, however, long-term persistence of forage and other lichens associated with mature moist forest would be enhanced by restoration of stable fire regimes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Assessment and monitoring impacts of agricultural systems on soil quality are imperative to establish best management practices and sustainable land use for mitigating climate change, conserving biodiversity and achieving food and energy security. The SMAF has successfully been tested as an objective tool to quantify land use and management effects on soil quality, including under some Brazilian soil conditions. Nevertheless, the SMAF potential to properly address soil quality changes under contrasting soil and climate conditions, and integrated farming systems must still must be investigated. Thus, a field study was conducted to apply the SMAF guidelines as a strategy for assessing land use (native vegetation, pasture, sugarcane, no-tillage, and integrated crop-livestock systems) effects on soil quality in southern Brazil. Soil samples were taken in three layers (0.0-0.10, 0.10-0.20, 0.20-0.30 m) of clay Ferralsol (traditional agricultural region), Sandy loam Ferralsol and Arenosol (new agricultural frontiers), in the state of Parana, Brazil. The soil quality indicators investigated were: chemical attributes (pH, phosphorus and potassium), physical (bulk density) and biological (soil organic carbon). Using the SMAF scoring curves, the measured values were transformed (0 to 1 range) and an overall soil quality index (SQI) was calculated. Our findings revealed that long-term conversion from native vegetation to agricultural land uses (i.e., pasture, no-tillage/integrated crop-livestock system, or sugarcane) reduced soil quality assessed by SMAF scores, compromising the soil's capacity to perform its functions. Nevertheless, conservationist systems, e.g. the no-tillage, associated or not with the integrated crop-livestock system are promising alternative to enhances soil quality by increasing C content and soil chemical fertility compared to degraded pasture or conventional sugarcane cultivation. However, soil physical changes should be monitored to alleviate soil compaction in no-tillage cropping systems. In conclusion, this study provided important insights about soil quality changes induced by land use and diversified cropping systems. In that direction, new studies including a large number of sites, soil types and cropping systems are needed for validating our conclusions in a regional scale, enabling to support decision-making towards more sustainable expansion and intensification of agriculture in Brazil.

AB  - Extreme climatic events are expected to become more frequent under current conditions of increasing global temperatures and climate variability. A key challenge of fisheries management is understanding and planning for the effect of anomalous oceanic conditions on the distributions of protected species and their interactions with fishing gear. Atypical marine states can cause non-target species to shift outside of their normal distribution patterns, leading to unwanted bycatch events that threaten fisheries sustainability. Environmental indicators can serve as early warning signals that allow for proactive management responses before significant bycatch occurs. Marine heatwaves in the Pacific have caused shifts in the distributions of endangered loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), increasing overlap with California's Drift Gillnet fishery and thereby the risk of turtle bycatch events. To reduce bycatch, a fishery closure offshore of Southern California - The Loggerhead Conservation Area - Is enacted when an El Nino event has been declared and local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are warmer than normal. However, this regulation was based on qualitative assessment of bycatch that occurred during past El Nino events, and no explicit threshold for SST anomalies was defined. Additionally, closures enacted under the current regulation rely on structured expert decision-making. Providing a quantitative indicator could help to refine future decisions. We developed and evaluated potential new indicators to guide the Loggerhead Conservation Area closure timing based on thermal indices in three different regions: the equatorial Pacific, regional areas offshore of Southern California, and temperate pelagic areas off the US west coast. Our objectives were to: 1) quantify thermal indicators and their respective thresholds to guide closure timing, and 2) hindcast closure scenarios based on these indicator thresholds to evaluate efficacy in terms of opportunity costs to fishers and ability to avoid turtle interactions. The best indicator in terms of avoiding historical turtle interactions while minimizing opportunity cost to fishers was a six-month average local SST anomaly indicator with closures enacted above a threshold of 0.77 degrees C. This result can improve upon the current closure guidelines by providing a quantified and spatially-explicit indicator and threshold to supplement the structured decision-making process. Our analysis demonstrates a novel approach to developing fisheries management strategies for species with a paucity of data. Issues with data comprehensiveness are frequently present in fisheries management exercises, and precautionary approaches are needed to allow adherence with legislation while considering the best available science.

AB  - In order to study the multi-factor coupling relationships between typical Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. mixed plantations in the Caijiachuan basin of the Loess Plateau of Shanxi Province, West China, 136 sample plots were selected for building a structural equation model (SEM) of three potential variables: terrain, stand structure, and soil characteristics. Additionally, the indicators (also known as observed variables) were studied in this paper, including slope, altitude, diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (TH), tree crown area, canopy density, stand density, leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture content, soil maximum water holding capacity (WHC), soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), and available phosphorus (AP). The results showed that terrain was the most important factor influencing soil moisture and nutrients, with a total impact coefficient of 1.303 and a direct path coefficient of 0.03, which represented mainly positive impacts; while correspondingly stand structure had a smaller negative impact on soil characteristics, with a total impact coefficient of -0.585 and a direct path coefficient of -0.01. The terrain also had a positive impact on the stand structure, with a total impact coefficient of 0.487 and a direct path coefficient of 0.63, indicating that the topography factors were more suitable for site conditions and both the stand structure and the soil moisture and nutrient conditions were relatively superior. By affecting the stand structure, terrain could restrict some soil, water, and nutrient functions of soil and water conservation. The influence coefficients of the four observed variables of DBH, stand density, soil water content, and organic matter, and potential variable topography reached 0.686, -0.119, 1.117, and 0.732, respectively; and the influence coefficients of soil moisture, organic matter and stand structure were -0.502 and -0.329, respectively. Therefore, besides observing the corresponding latent variables, the observed variables had a considerable indirect influence on other related latent variables. These relationships showed that the measures, such as changing micro-topography and adjusting stand density, should effectively maintain or enhance soil moisture and nutrient content so as to achieve improved soil and water conservation benefits in the ecologically important Loess Area.

AB  - Identifying relationships between habitat selection and population processes is important for habitat management and wildlife conservation. For prairie-obligate species, space use and demography in extant grasslands are influenced by habitat conditions caused by rangeland management practices associated with livestock production. Greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) are an indicator species for native tallgrass prairie ecosystems, but populations have declined in the Flint Hills ecoregion of eastern Kansas, USA because of intensification of rangeland management practices, including annual prescribed fire and high stocking densities. Patch-burn grazing is a rotational system that provides heterogeneous habitats and can improve productivity of grassland birds, but the effects of grazing systems on habitat use or survival of greater prairie-chickens are unknown. We used 3 types of survival analyses to investigate impacts of rangeland management on female greater prairie-chickens in the central Flint Hills during 2011-2013: Kaplan-Meier models and Cox proportional hazards to examine factors affecting annual survival rates, hazard functions to assess seasonal patterns of mortality, and Andersen-Gill models to explore the links between habitat selection and cause-specific mortality risk. Females captured at properties managed with patch-burn grazing had annual survival rates (0.610.07SE) that were 35% higher than females on properties managed with annual burning and intensive early cattle stocking (0.45 +/- 0.06). Moreover, females that selected habitats associated with intensive management had increased mortality risk and were particularly vulnerable to avian predators, whereas females that selected habitats created by patch-burn grazing experienced lower overall mortality risk but were more vulnerable to mammalian predators. Overall mortality risk was significantly reduced under patch-burn grazing management, and widespread implementation of annual spring burning and intensive early stocking is likely depressing survival of greater prairie-chickens in the Flint Hills ecoregion. Our results join a growing body of evidence that patch-burn grazing can provide higher quality grassland habitats for native wildlife species than current rangeland management associated with intensive cattle production.

   Our 3-year study provides strong evidence that habitat conditions generated by patch-burn grazing provide improved concealment for female greater prairie-chickens, resulting in lower mortality risk compared to intensive early stocking.

AB  - Quality and safety of fresh produce are important to public health and maintaining commerce between Mexico and USA. While preventive practices can reduce risks of contamination and are generally successful, the variable environment of the supply chain of fresh produce can be suitable for introduction or proliferation of pathogenic microorganisms. As routine surveillance of these pathogens is not practical, indicator microorganisms are used to assess the sanitary conditions of production and handling environments. An opportunity exists to use indicators on fresh produce to measure how handling and transport from field to market may affect microbial populations that contribute to their quality or safety. The objective was to quantify indicator microorganisrns on tomatoes sampled along the supply chain during the harvest year, in order to observe the levels and changes of populations at different locations. Roma tomatoes (n = 475) were taken from the same lots (n = 28) at four locations of the postharvest supply chain over five months: at arrival to and departure from the packinghouse in Mexico, at the distribution center in Texas, and at retail in USA. Samples were analyzed individually for four microbial populations: aerobic plate count (APC), total coliforms (TC), generic Escherichia coli, and yeasts and molds (YM). APC population differed (p<0.05) from 1.9 +/- 1.1, 1.7 +/- 1.1, 23 +/- 1.1 and 3.5 +/- 1.4 log CFU/g at postharvest, packing, distribution center and supermarket, respectively. TC populations were <1 log CFU/g at postharvest, increased at packing (0.7 +/- 1.0 log CFU/g), decreased in distribution (0.4 +/- 0.8 log CFU/g) and increased in supermarkets (1.4 +/- 1.5 log CFU/g). Generic E. coil was not identified from coliform populations in this supply chain. YM populations remained <1 log CFU/g, with the exception of 1.1 13 log CFU/g at supermarkets and tomatoes were not visibly spoiled. The levels reported from this pilot study demonstrated the dynamics within populations as influenced by time and conditions in one supply chain during a harvest year, while the large variances in some locations indicate opportunities for improvement. Overall, packinghouse and supermarket locations were identified as crucial points to control microbial safety risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Arguably the majority of species on Earth utilise tropical rainforest canopies, and much progress has been made in describing arboreal assemblages, especially for arthropods. The most commonly described patterns for tropical rainforest insect communities are host specificity, spatial specialisation (predominantly vertical stratification), and temporal changes in abundance (seasonality and circadian rhythms). Here I review the recurrent results with respect to each of these patterns and discuss the evolutionary selective forces that have generated them in an attempt to unite these patterns in a holistic evolutionary framework. I propose that species can be quantified along a generalist-specialist scale not only with respect to host specificity, but also other spatial and temporal distribution patterns, where specialisation is a function of the extent of activity across space and time for particular species. When all of these distribution patterns are viewed through the paradigm of specialisation, hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the evolution of host specificity can also be applied to explain the generation and maintenance of other spatial and temporal distribution patterns. The main driver for most spatial and temporal distribution patterns is resource availability. Generally, the distribution of insects follows that of the resources they exploit, which are spatially stratified and vary temporally in availability. Physiological adaptations are primarily important for host specificity, where nutritional and chemical variation among host plants in particular, but also certain prey species and fungi, influence host range. Physiological tolerances of abiotic conditions are also important for explaining the spatial and temporal distributions of some insect species, especially in drier forest environments where desiccation is an ever-present threat. However, it is likely that for most species in moist tropical rainforests, abiotic conditions are valuable indicators of resource availability, rather than physiologically limiting factors. Overall, each distribution pattern is influenced by the same evolutionary forces, but at differing intensities. Consequently, each pattern is linked and not mutually exclusive of the other distribution patterns. Most studies have examined each of these patterns in isolation. Future work should focus on examining the evolutionary drivers of these patterns in concert. Only then can the relative strength of resource availability and distribution, host defensive phenotypes, and biotic and abiotic interactions on insect distribution patterns be determined.

AB  - In order to protect a hydrophilic drug and to prolong its further delivery, the formulation of multiple emulsions could be worthy. However, the double emulsions are not stable, their structure can change, leading to the formation of a single emulsion as the destruction of the system, and the drug can release easily from the globules in liquid state. The freeze-drying technology could be used to produce dry emulsion, the powder form being much more stable. The aim of this work was to study the influence of a cryoprotectant and a freeze-drying process on the stability of W/O/W emulsions. Samples were frozen at two different freezing rate (v(f) = 0.55 degrees C/min and 1.25 degrees C/min) and successively dried at two different sublimation temperature (T-s = -10 degrees C and -20 degrees C). The particle size distributions were measured by granulometer and UV spectrophotometer was performed to investigate the leakage of internal constituent. The glass transition temperature (T-g) of the double emulsions was analyzed by DSC. The particle sizes became even smaller after freeze drying, except when K-carrageenan is used as a cryoprotectant. In that case, the particles became aggregated after freeze drying, whatever the process conditions. The mean size is considerably reduced when the globules are diluted at low concentration in glucose and trehalose solution. When the concentration is increased, the size distribution is not significantly affected. The leakage of the internal aqueous phase to the external one during freeze drying was measured as an indicator of the structure stability. It is affected by the nature of the cryoprotectant and the conditions of the freeze-drying process. The leakage of the internal phase was smaller when cycle III (v(f) = 1.25 degrees C/min, T-s = -10 degrees C) was processed. From our experiments, we suppose that the water transfer from the inner phase to the outer aqueous phase results in the diminution of the globules size in double emulsion. The T-g of the double emulsions diluted with trehalose and glucose were determined at -33.8 degrees C and -47.1 degrees C. In contrast, the T-g of double emulsion With kappa-carrageenan and HES did not appear.

TI  - TROPICAL CYCLONES IN THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC - SPATIAL PATTERNS AND RELATIONSHIPS TO SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION AND SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
LA  - English
KW  - REGION
AB  - An analysis of a 20-yr dataset of tropical cyclones in the southwest Pacific has been made to determine the spatial patterns of cyclone occurrence and how these depend on the Southern Oscillation (SO) and sea surface temperature. A local measure of cyclone incidence is defined as the number of cyclones that enter into a 2 degrees lat-long square during some period (e.g., within one season) and this quantity is mapped for four Southern Oscillation index (SOI) categories. The maps show that the geographical distribution of cyclone incidence shifts eastward and northward during negative SOI phases and vice versa. The mean annual incidence for the whole region is 28% higher than average for our strongly negative SO category and 16% below average for our near-zero category.
   To explore the roles of the SO and local SST, correlation analysis was applied to mean values of cyclone incidence for four subregions of 20 degrees longitude width between 10 degrees and 22 degrees S. Markedly different SOI/SST responses were found on either side of 170 degrees E. In the Coral Sea subregion (150 degrees-170 degrees E), seasons with a relatively high tropical cyclone incidence were preceded by significant positive anomalies in SST and weak positive anomalies of the SOI. The behaviors of the three eastern subregions (lying between 170 degrees E and 130 degrees W) were similar to each other, but were very different to that of the Coral Sea subregion. Their seasons of higher cyclone incidence were preceded by significant negative anomalies of SOI and Tahiti pressure,which continued into the cyclone season, but with only weak or nil SST relationships. Analysis of variance was used to determine the relative contributions of the main variables for each subregion. Altogether, SOI/SST variables before the cyclone season can explain from 20% to 50% of the variance for the individual subregions. Concurrent variables can explain 70% of the variance for the three eastern subregions taken as a single unit.
   On the basis of these statistical results, the authors proposed that the primary influence on tropical cyclone incidence west of 170 degrees E is the local oceanic conditions, as represented by SST, while to the east of 170 degrees E it is the eastward extent of favorable atmospheric conditions, as indicated by the SOI or Tahiti pressure. The results have application to seasonal cyclone forecasting and natural hazard assessment and mitigation activities within the region.

AB  - Stormwater management practices (SMPs) rely on infiltration and adsorption capabilities of soil and vegetative cover to mitigate the harmful impacts of contaminants in stormwater runoff, including potentially toxic elements (PTEs). Under chemical equilibrium conditions, the soil-water distribution coefficient (K-d) quantifies the relationship between the solid and aqueous phase PTE concentrations, and thus the PTE removal efficiency and mobility through the SMP soil layers during the infiltration process. The SMP loading ratio (LR), the ratio of the drainage area to the SMP infiltration area, combined with runoff concentration determines SMP mass loading and is also expected to impact PTE transport. In this study, a simulation model was developed to investigate PTE breakthrough and build-up in SMP media, considering the impacts of K-d and LR. Eight PTEs were simulated (Cl-, Cr, Fe, Zn, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb), and Cl- was the only PTE that showed high mobility and reached the groundwater table (e.g., similar to 1 year for breakthrough). Conversely, other PTEs were effectively immobilized in the top -60 cm of soil for a simulated lifespan of 20 years. Soil and porewater contaminant indices, as indicators of SMP lifespan, were estimated based on the ratio of PTE porewater and soil concentrations after 20 years to published standards, suggesting the following order of environmental significance (most concern to least): Cl--( )> Cr > As > Pb > Fe > Cu > Cd > Zn. After 20 years of simulated use, only Cl- pore water concentrations at the groundwater table exceeded regulatory values, with porewater contamination index values of 4 to 7.5. Chloride also exceeded the surficial media soil contamination index, as did As and Cr, though these exceedences were largely associated with media background concentrations. Generally, higher LR and K-d contributed to higher accumulation of PTEs in top layers; however, simulations showed that the combination of low LR and high K(d )may result in lower PTE accumulation in the media, such that the PTE concentration in soil may decrease in deeper layers. In these scenarios, a notable fraction of PTE load was adsorbed on top layers and considerably lower PTE concentrations reached the lower layers. Sensitivity analysis revealed that dispersion, infiltration rate, and kinetically-limited sorption did not impact the PTE accumulation and mobility to a practical extent. The results from this simulation may be adapted to various environmental conditions to enhance the design and maintenance of SMPs.

AB  - Multiple web-based calculators have come on the market as tools to support sustainable decision making, but few are available to agriculture. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has proved to be an objective, transparent tool for calculating environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of products and services, but can often be too complex for non-specialists. The objective of this study was therefore to develop an environmental support tool to determine the environmental impacts of protected crops. An effort was made to provide an easy-to-use tool in order to reach a wide audience and help horticulture stakeholders choose efficient options to mitigate the environmental impacts of protected crops. Users can estimate the environmental performance of their crops by entering a limited amount of data and following a few easy steps. A questionnaire must be answered with data on the crop, greenhouse dimensions, substrate, waste management, and the consumption of water, energy, fertilisers and pesticides. The calculator was designed as a simplified LCA, based on two scenarios analysed in detail in previous tasks of the EUPHOROS project and used as reference systems in this study. Two spreadsheets were provided based on these reference scenarios: one for a tomato crop in a multi-tunnel greenhouse under Southern European climate conditions and the other for a tomato crop in a Venlo glass greenhouse under Central European climate conditions. The selected functional unit was one tonne of tomatoes. Default data were given for each reference system for users who did not have complete specific data and to provide results for comparison with users' own results.
   The results were presented for water use as an inventory indicator and for the impact categories abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming, photochemical oxidation and cumulative energy demand. In the multi-tunnel greenhouse, the main contributors based on the default data were the structure, fertilisers and auxiliary equipment, whereas, for the Venlo glass greenhouse, the main contributors were energy consumption for heating and, to a lesser extent, the structure. The results were evaluated for alternative options of electricity, fertilisers, pesticides and means of transport, as these areas were found to have potential variability, depending on the characterisation model and datasets used.
   The resulting calculator is a useful tool to simulate the environmental performance of protected horticultural production systems and is also helpful to growers and advisers for evaluating the efficiency of input reduction options. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The structure of the soil in the arable layer is controlled by tillage, soil biota activities and weathering, whereas the structure below this layer is mainly the result of the activities of soil biota. Organic farmers tend to minimise the depth of the main tillage operation to encourage soil biota to create a soil structure with continuous biopores and a well crumbled topsoil. The best main tillage operation for preventive weed control, especially important in organic farming, is mouldboard ploughing. The shallow ploughing experiments described in this paper were conducted to ascertain the minimum ploughing depth for an ecologically accountable, sustainable tillage system with good weed control, good land qualities (in terms of workable days, aeration and soil moisture conditions) and finally with good yields. The "ecoplough" used for shallow ploughing was developed by Rumptstad Industries to meet the requirements of relatively shallow ploughing with good soil inversion for weed control. The plough has seven or eight bottoms for ploughing depths of 0.12-0.20 m, a working width of 2.1 m and a working speed of 1.7 m s(-1). Its width is such that the tractor with wide low-pressure tyres runs on top of the land.
   After using the plough for 6 years on Luvisols (> 200 g kg(-1) < 2 mum) in the IJsselmeer polders and on Luvisols (120-160 g k(-1) < 2 mum) in polders near the northern coast of The Netherlands, it was found that compared with conventional ploughing, shallow ploughing required less energy and labour and produced a relatively smooth surface. The latter facilitates the preparation of a seedbed consisting of relatively fine, strong, stable and moist aggregates. Organic matter, soil biota and nutrients were concentrated higher in the profile, influencing the workability of the soil, the growth of weeds and the growth of crops. Most of the yields were similar to yields after conventional ploughing, but weed populations increased when ploughing depth was < 0.2 m. It was concluded that for organic farming on "active" soils (soils subject to shrink/swell with > 200 a ka(-1) < 2 mum), shallow ploughing seems to be the best reduced tillage system. It has several advantages. The main factor determining the minimum ploughing depth is control of weeds, especially of perennials. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the degradation of the herbicides diquat (DQ) and paraquat (PQ) by a solar photo-Fenton process that is mediated by Fe(III)-oxalate complexes at circumneutral pH = 6.5 in compound parabolic collectors (CPC)-type reactors. The photo-Fenton process operates efficiently at acidic pH; however, circumneutral operation was key to overcome drawbacks, such as acidification and neutralization steps, reagent costs, and the environmental footprint of chemical auxiliaries. This work revealed a remarkable reduction of total organic carbon for PQ (87%) and DQ (80%) after 300 min (at ca. 875 kJ L-1). Phytotoxicity assays confirmed that the treatment led to a considerable increase in the germination index for DQ (i.e., from 4.7% to 55.8%) and PQ (i.e., from 16.5% to 59.7%) usingCucumis sativusseeds. Importantly, treatment costs (DQ = USD$8.05 and PQ = USD$7.72) and the carbon footprint of the process (DQ = 7.37 and PQ = 6.29 kg CO2-Eqv/m(3)) were within the ranges that were reported for the treatment of recalcitrant substances at acidic conditions in CPC-type reactors. Life cycle assessment (LCA) evidenced that H(2)O(2)and electricity consumption are the variables with the highest environmental impact because they contribute with ca. 70% of the carbon footprint of the process. Under the studied conditions, a further reduction in H(2)O(2)use is counterproductive, because it could impact process performance and effluent quality. On the other hand, the main drawback of the process (i.e., energy consumption) can be reduced by using renewable energies. The sensitivity study evidenced that carbon footprint is dependent on the energy share of the local electricity mix; therefore, the use of more renewable electrical energy sources, such as wind-power and photovoltaic, can reduce greenhouse gases emissions of the process an average of 26.4% (DQ = 5.57 and PQ = 4.51 kg CO2-Eqv/m(3)) and 78.4% (DQ = 3.72 and PQ = 2.65 kg CO2-Eqv/m(3)), respectively. Finally, from the economic and environmental points of view, the experimental results evidenced that photo-assisted treatment at circumneutral pH is an efficient alternative to deal with quaternary bipyridinium compounds.

AB  - Canine commercial breeding establishments (CBEs) are kennel facilities where puppies are produced in large numbers for commercial sale. In the popular media, CBEs are commonly referred to as "puppy mills" or "puppy farms." Conditions in CBEs vary widely in quality. Dogs in these facilities are routinely housed for their entire reproductive lives in cages or runs, and provided with minimal to no positive human interaction or other forms of environmental enrichment. Numerous anecdotal reports have suggested that after removal from CBEs many of the former breeding dogs display persistent behavioural and psychological abnormalities when compared with the general pet dog population. The purpose of this study was to determine if this anecdotal evidence could be confirmed empirically.
   Behavioural evaluations of the dogs were obtained from current owners/fosterers using the Canine Behavioural Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ), which utilizes ordinal scales to rate either the intensity or frequency of the dog's behaviours. A total of 1169 former CBE dogs were included in the study.
   Among the CBE ex-breeding dogs, 76 different breeds were represented. With the exception of the Bichon Frise (31.5%), all other breeds comprised <5% of the dogs. The sex ratio was 70.3% females and 29.7% males. The dogs had been living in their adoptive homes for an average of 2 years when the C-BARQ was completed.
   When compared with a convenience sample of pet dogs matched for breed, sex, age and neuter status, former CBE breeding dogs were reported as showing significantly higher rates of health problems (23.5% versus 16.6%, P=0.026). With respect to behaviour, CBE dogs displayed significantly higher rates of fear (both social and nonsocial; ordinal GLM models, P<0.001), house-soiling (P<0.001), and compulsive staring (P<0.005); and significantly lower rates of aggression (toward strangers and other dogs; P<0.0001), trainability (P<0.0001), chasing small animals (P<0.0001), excitability (P<0.0001), and energy (P<0.0001).
   By demonstrating that dogs maintained in these environments develop extreme and persistent fears and phobias, possible learning deficits as evidenced by lower trainability, and often show difficulty in coping successfully with normal existence, this study provides the first quantitative evidence that the conditions prevailing in CBEs are injurious to the mental health and welfare of dogs.

AB  - Sediment cores, representing a range of watershed characteristics and anthropogenic impacts, were collected in 11 subalpine marshes in the Lake Tahoe basin, USA and vicinity in order to trace the effect of anthropogenic impacts on sedimentation and sediment accumulation rates. Cores were Pb-210-dated using a CRS model, and these data were used to calculate sedimentation rates and sediment accumulation rates, which were compared with environmental variables. Age-depth profiles indicated that sedimentation rates changed at different times in different marshes, and we separated sediment cores into two parts to show sediment characteristic and sediment-accumulation-rate changes. Ranges of dry mass accumulation rates and sedimentation rates were 0.081-1.356 kg m(-2) yr(-1) and 0.94-4.64 mm yr(-1) in the upper core and 0.094-0.563 kg m(-2) yr(-1) and 0.57-1.75 mm yr(-1) in the lower core. In general, the cores showed recent increases in sediment accumulation rates. Species composition was related to water quality, with the dominant species changing in a predictable series with decreasing water quality: Nuphar, Nuphar and Carex/Scirpus, Eleocharis, Potamogeton, Ranunculus, and Chara. The effect of a rough road used for timber transport was observed as the change of sediment accumulation rates in Upper Grass Lake. Sediment accumulation rates since the improvement of the rough road decreased to ca. 80 % of those prior to the improvement. Road-salt use was related to relatively high water cation concentrations and conductivity in Meyers Grade Marsh adjacent to Hwy 50. Increased lead accumulation rates and concentrations in more recent sediments at Meyers Grade Marsh and Snow Creel, reflect the increasing use of fossil fueled vehicles in this region. Urbanization and animal farming were related to increased N and P concentrations in marsh water. The number of exotic plant species within a marsh was highly correlated with water quality and C and N accumulation rates. This study showed that 8 of the 11 marshes studied are in relatively undisturbed condition, while the remaining 3 have been heavily impacted. Urbanization and increased recreation facilities, and activities are important anthropogenic impacts on subalpine marshes. This study suggests that pristine subalpine marshes be protected from increasing human activities and that marshes impacted by rough roads can be restored to pristine conditions.

AB  - Botrytis bunch rot (BBR) is a major disease occurring in vineyards worldwide. Its control is still largely based on the use of synthetic fungicide sprayings at predetermined intervals, which often produces negative residues in grapes and wines that may affect the environment and/or human health. To rationalize BBR management, disease risk indicators were developed and evaluated in a set of field experiments carried out between 2010 and 2019 in France and Chile. Key indicators include early grapevine vegetative growth, i.e. ground-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the potential berry susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea, which is driven by tannin content in the skin. Under these contrasting weather and cropping conditions, regression analyses, including weather information, showed a highly significant positive correlation between the early NDVI, measured at berry pea size stage, and BBR incidence or severity at harvest, whereas the opposite was demonstrated for tannin content in the berry skin measured at an early herbaceous fruit stage. The exponential relationship between the final disease severity and the early NDVI allowed us to identify a possible threshold NDVI value, i.e. between 0.5 and 0.6, under which the BBR severity should be lower or close to 5% at harvest (BBR tolerance threshold for wine quality). Accordingly, in a leaf-removal vineyard experiment in France, the NDVI level at berry pea size stage was strictly controlled to correspond to three different increasing index values: 0.45, 0.60, and 0.78. Following this increase in NDVI, a significant increase in final BBR severity was noticeable, i.e. 2.4%, 6.6% and 9.9%, respectively. Very interestingly, the NDVI increase was also related to a significant decrease in the tannin content in the skin of herbaceous berries at veraison, from 47 to 22 mg tannin/g skin. All regression analyses explaining BBR development were highly significant, showing the weather conditions before harvest as the primary factor. They also show that some of the disease risk indicators chosen, especially early NDVI, could be used in the future as tools in decision support systems for deciding to spray and/or scheduling optimized fungicide applications during the season.

AB  - 1 We studied light partitioning among species along the natural productivity gradient of herbaceous vegetation with an above-ground dry mass of 150-490 g m(-2). The aim was to investigate how the light capturing ability per above-ground biomass and leaf nitrogen changes in an entire community and to reveal whether different species respond similarly to changes in soil conditions and competition.
   2 Species becoming dominant at high soil resources have intrinsically low leaf area ratios (LAR) and lower tissue nitrogen concentration, and hence relatively high nitrogen use efficiency. These traits lead to dominance when soil resources allow rapid growth so that benefits arising from the ability to locate leaves above neighbours and thereby increasing asymmetry of competition, become more crucial.
   3 In contrast to our expectations, above-ground efficiency of nitrogen use on the community level (aNUE) increased along the productivity gradient. Species level nitrogen use efficiency was unaffected by variation in site productivity; the increase in community aNUE was solely as a consequence of changes in species composition.
   4 Light absorption per unit of above-ground mass, Phi(M), declined significantly at the community level and also in most species, indicating that light use efficiency increased with increased site productivity and LAI.
   5 Light absorption per unit of leaf nitrogen, Phi(N), as an indicator of the ratio NUE/LUE showed no clear pattern on the community level because both NUE and LUE tend to increase with increased productivity. At the species level, Phi(N) tends to decrease because NUE did not change with stand productivity.
   6 Some subordinate species responded by enlarging their LAR to increased competition. Additionally, these species were the most responsive in their leaf chlorophyll/nitrogen ratio to changes in light conditions, which shows that physiological plasticity is important for species that are unable to compete for light with the ability to position their leaves above those of other species.
   7 This study shows how plasticity in above-ground growth pattern and nitrogen allocation differs between species with respect to increased soil fertility and competition, leading to distinctive strategies of survival. Light partitioning analysis reveals that increased competition for light, resulting in changes in species composition, is the key factor that leads to decoupling of species and community level acclimation.

AB  - The ecological implications of the conversion of old-growth temperate rainforests to managed forests have generated much discussion worldwide. This paper examines the effects of such a conversion on different aspects of the biodiversity of the soil collembolan fauna, and attempts to determine the time that will be required for the collembolan fauna to approach the abundance and community structure seen in old-growth forests. The study also investigates the potential of using different measures of species diversity and community structure as indicators of old-growth conditions in forest soils. The study was carried out in three chronosequence sites in Douglas-fir dominated stands on the dry leeward eastern side of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. Each of the three sites contained stands representing four stages of stand development: regeneration (7-9 years), immature (35-46 years), mature (80-102 years) and old-growth (>248 years). The Collembola were extracted from litterbags containing needle litter or wood chips, and from the forest floor (LFH) layer in the late autumn of four successive years.
   Overall abundance of Collembola was highest in the old-growth and lowest in the regeneration stands. Although population numbers in the immature and mature forests were significantly higher than in regeneration stands, they still had not achieved the levels observed in old-growth forests. In the forest floor, species richness was low in regeneration stands compared to later stages of stand development, but did not differ significantly among immature, mature and old-growth stands. Measures of species diversity based on Shannon's and Simpson's indices of diversity did not differ significantly according to the stage of stand development.
   It was not possible to distinguish individual collembolan species that could be used as indicators of old-growth conditions. The same species occurred in most or all stand ages, with differences being determined by changes in relative and absolute abundance of the species comprising the community. However, principal component analysis of data on the Collembola of needle litterbags and the LFH layer showed that the collembolan community of the regeneration stands could be clearly differentiated from those of the forested stands. In addition, the collembolan communities of 80-102-year-old forests could still be distinguished from those of the old-growth forests. In contrast, the collembolan fauna of decomposing wood chips was very similar in all stand ages, with the exception of the regeneration stands. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ability to simulate soil and crop processes in many bi-specific systems (vineyards, orchards, silvo-arable agroforestry, strip-intercropping of arable crops...) is one of the major challenge for crop modelling in order to contribute to the design of agro-ecological cropping systems. A typical question is how soil, climate and management would influence the soil water deficit experienced by a plant grown alone or intercropped with a cover crop, with another crop or a tree, in order to improve the resilience of a cropping system to climate change and limit the use of chemical input.
   This study introduces BISWAT - Bispecific Intercrop System WATer Stress dynamic model - a new water balance model designed to simulate the dynamic of Soil Water deficit Experienced (SWEP) by two Plants when grown together or separated. BISWAT has been built to simulate a large range of agrosystems (annual and perennial crops, mono- or bi-specific) cultivated in various conditions. The model is primarily based on three modelling concepts: i) a 2D generic pattern for the system's spatial representation, ii) the use of the Radiation Interception Efficiency (RIE) to drive potential plant transpiration and soil evaporation, iii) the use of the Total Transpirable Soil Water (TTSW) concept coupled with a simple root dynamics representation. These concepts are not new but they allowed us to define a model able to simulate many crops and trees (including vineyards) using a limited number of inputs and without an explicit need for parameter calibration.
   The model was evaluated on five reference agrosystems (mono-specific salads, mono-specific vineyards, bispecific vineyards, mono-specific peach orchards and bi-specific peach orchards). The RMSE of the SWEP variable ranged from 0.049 to 0.123. A combined sensitivity and uncertainty analysis performed on typical farmer's fields situations stressed the particular importance of model inputs related to the TTSW of the soil-crop system.
   We conclude that the genericity of the BISWAT model, its method of parameterization and its performance open the perspective to use the model in a wide range of conditions where the dynamic of water stress between two species grown together is a key variable to be accessed with limited data for parameterization and a large number of fields to simulate.

AB  - A comprehensive organic geochemical investigation of the Hawsker Bottoms outcrop section in Yorkshire, England has provided new insights about environmental conditions leading into and during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE; similar to 183 Ma). Rock-Eval and molecular analyses demonstrate that the section is uniformly within the early oil window. Hydrogen index (HI), organic petrography, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) distributions, and tricyclic terpane ratios mark a shift to a lower relative abundance of terrigenous organic matter supplied to the sampling locality during the onset of the T-OAE and across a lithological transition. Unlike other ancient intervals of anoxia and extinction, biomarker indices of planktonic community structure do not display major changes or anomalous values. Depositional environment and redox indicators support a shift towards more reducing conditions in the sediment porewaters and the development of a seasonally stratified water column during the T-OAE. In addition to carotenoid biomarkers for green sulfur bacteria (GSB), we report the first occurrence of okenane, a marker of purple sulfur bacteria (PSB), in marine samples younger than similar to 1.64 Ga. Based on modern observations, a planktonic source of okenane's precursor, okenone, would require extremely shallow photic zone euxinia (PZE) and a highly restricted depositional environment. However, due to coastal vertical mixing, the lack of planktonic okenone production in modern marine sulfidic environments, and building evidence of okenone production in mat-dwelling Chromatiaceae, we propose a sedimentary source of okenone as an alternative. Lastly, we report the first parallel compound-specific delta C-13 record in marine- and terrestrial-derived biomarkers across the T-OAE. The delta C-13 records of short-chain n-alkanes, acyclic isoprenoids, and long-chain n-alkanes all encode negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs), and together, they support an injection of isotopically light carbon that impacted both the atmospheric and marine carbon reservoirs. To date, molecular delta C-13 records of the T-OAE display a negative CIE that is smaller in magnitude compared to the bulk organic delta C-13 excursion. Although multiple mechanisms could explain this observation, our molecular, petrographic, and Rock-Eval data suggest that variable mixing of terrigenous and marine organic matter is an important factor affecting the bulk organic delta C-13 records of the T-OAE.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to compare different field, laboratory and physiological methods for the evaluation of frost tolerance in barley; as well as to show both the possibilities and limitations of these individual methods and approaches. The tolerances of 39 barley cultivars and breeding lines were evaluated by four direct methods (based on the exposure of plants to frost) and three indirect (based on diagnostic traits and markers). The direct methods included the evaluation of: (1) field survival after five winters 1999-2004; (2) winter survival in a provocation pot test under natural conditions; (3) lethal temperature (LT50) of plants taken from a field in winter; and (4) LT50 of plants grown and hardened in a growth chamber. The indirect methods were based upon: (1) endogenous levels of abscisic acid (ABA); (2) water content (WC); (3) osmotic potential (OP) of the plants cultivated and hardened in growth chambers. All four direct methods correlated well with one another, and resulted in similar sequences of frost tolerance of the tested barley cultivars and lines. While it was only possible to distinguish individual barley cultivars based on field survival after the 2002/2003 winter, by using the provocation method it was possible to distinguish between barley cultivars after all of the winters. Moreover, the average winter survival of barley from multi-year pot tests was in correlation with the minimal LT50, evaluated in plants hardened in both the field or in growth chambers. From indirect indicators, the levels of ABA increased slightly, while WC and OP clearly decreased in all cultivars during cold hardening. No correlation was observed between LT50 and the ABA content. A significant correlation between LT50 and WC, and between LT50 and OP was found, but only after 1 or more weeks of cold acclimation of the plants had been completed, since both the duration and the rate of decline of these parameters differed in individual cultivars during the cold hardening. The LT50-values of barley cultivars not only accurately characterized their field tolerance to frost, but also were indicative of changes associated with the induction of frost tolerance in plants under the given conditions, when comparing the direct and indirect methods.

AB  - Simple Summary The substitution of soybean meal in farm animal diets is considered vital for the economic and environmental sustainability of the livestock sector. However, data regarding the effects of a soybean meal replacement on the milk yield and quality traits in dairy sheep are scarce. In our study, two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were used, with soybean meal of a typical ration being replaced by a mixture of rapeseed meal, cottonseed cake, and fava beans. The milk yield and the body condition scores were recorded, and milk samples were analyzed monthly for their fat, protein, lactose, and total solids yields, as well as for somatic cell counts, total bacterial counts, pH, electrical conductivity, and the refractive index. Daily and 100-day fat yields were significantly increased in the group fed the experimental ration and the electrical conductivity was significantly decreased in the same group, while no adverse effects on any of the rest of the studied milk production traits were observed. The replacement of soybean meal (SBM) from intensively reared dairy sheep diets has emerged as a significant challenge for sustainable production. However, the effects of this replacement on milk production have not been sufficiently elucidated. The objective of this study was to prospectively assess the effects of replacing SBM with a mixture of alternative protein sources on the milk yield (MY) and the milk quality traits (MQT) in intensively reared dairy sheep. A total of 112 multiparous, purebred milking ewes of the Chios and Frizarta breeds, from two intensive dairy sheep farms, were involved in the study, postweaning, and were assigned to either the control (CR) or the experimental ration (ER) group. In the ER, 3/4 of the SBM was replaced by a mixture of rapeseed meal, cottonseed cake, and fava beans, producing a ration of a similar nutritional value. MY, MQT, and body condition scores were recorded for each individual ewe monthly for a period of 4 months during lactation. The experimental ration was associated with beneficial effects on daily and 100-day fat yields and on the electrical conductivity of milk as an improved udder health status indicator, with no adverse effects on any of the rest of the studied milk production traits.

AB  - Animal welfare within the U.S. slaughter industry continues to prevail as one of the top priorities for livestock producers, businesses, and consumers alike. There are federal regulations that enforce the humane transport, handling, and slaughter of cattle. The journey that cattle must make to the slaughter facility is comprised of many environmental and human factors that can positively or negatively affect animal welfare. Cattle may be exposed to multiple stressors, such as noise, unfamiliar animals and humans, temperature extremes, temporary food/water deprivation, variable transport distances and experiences, and new pen conditions. The animal caretakers involved in these processes attempt to minimize stress and discomfort for the animals, but research is needed to focus on the gaps in knowledge and to support the implementation of strategies known to enhance the human-animal interactions that occur from farm to slaughter. This literature review will provide a summary of fed cattle welfare topics, research, and industry tools that span across the beef animal's journey from the farm/feedlot through the slaughter process. In addition, areas that have had little research focus are identified to highlight the need for future work and development of industry tools. Some of these topics include examining trailer design, the use of trailer slats during weather extremes, the welfare aspects of cattle destined for salvage slaughter, multiple preslaughter factors and interactions, abnormal mobility and nonambulatory cattle, lairage environmental conditions, new stunning methods, and the impact of a well-trained, motivated, and stable workforce on cattle and people welfare. The authors conducted a survey at the 2019 North American Meat Institute Animal Care and Handling Conference, which comprised of stakeholders within the meat packing industry, packing plant employees, and food company employees, educators, and auditors. The survey responses identified training/education and communication as areas of need in animal welfare, whereas the majority of survey responses focused on the aspects of the human-animal interaction as the top challenges for the industry. By continuously identifying, measuring, monitoring, and managing animal welfare challenges within the beef cattle slaughter industry, prioritization and execution of programs and training that improve the welfare of cattle can be achieved as animals move through this final stage of the meat production system.

AB  - An integrated petrological and geochemical analysis of surface and drilled oil sands from the Middle Jurassic Yan'an Formation in the southern Ordos Basin was conducted to investigate the petrophysical properties, organic matter origin/type, and thermal maturity and their relation to environmental conditions during sediment deposition. Petrographic analysis (thin section, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and porosity and permeability determination) of the oil sand was performed to establish the relationships between porosity and permeability and bulk density, reservoir quality index (RQI), normalized porosity index (NPI), and flow zone indicator (FZI). Geochemical analyses include oil extraction, column chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The strong correlation between RQI and permeability (R-2 = 0.98) reveals that porosity has a good correlation with RQI. The positive correlations between porosity and permeability and NPI and RQI (R-2 = 0.77 and R-2 = 0.65, respectively) show that the studied rocks contain many large pores with pore-to-pore throat connection structures that enhance permeability, which is further supported by the relatively high connection coefficient between NPI and RQI (R-2 = 0.65). The organic matter in the Yan'an Formation is mainly composed of oil-prone type I kerogen indicated by the recovery of a large amount of crude oil rich in saturated hydrocarbon fractions from the extracted oil. The biomarker signatures of the analyzed oil (nC(13)-nC(35), Pr/n-C-17 and Ph/n-C-18, and low C-27/C-29 regular sterane) reveal predominantly land plant materials as organic input sources based on the average concentration of alpha alpha alpha C-27:C-28:C-29 sterane 20R of approximately 38%, 22%, and 40%, respectively, and on high values of tricyclic terpane/alpha beta C-30 hopane and regular sterane/alpha beta C-30 hopane. Deposition within a lacustrine paleoenvironment under anoxic conditions enhanced organic matter preservation in the area based on the low Pr/Ph ratios (average 0.74), low alpha beta C-31-22R-hopane/alpha beta C-30 hopane ratios, and high C-26/C-25 tricyclic terpane ratios, as well as the presence of gammacerane and low water salinity. Biomarker maturity parameters (e.g., C-32 homohopane 22S/(22S + 22R), moretane/hopane, and C-29 sterane 20S/(20S + 20R) ratios and CPI) show that the extracted oil sand entered the early oil window stage.

AB  - Simple Summary The assessment of animal welfare should involve physical and mental welfare. Physical welfare is relatively easy to measure. Nevertheless, there is a lack of feasible indicators of positive emotions in farm animals, which causes difficulties in obtaining a complete analysis of welfare. To improve the quality of life of farm animals, it is necessary to be able to assess their welfare in a valid and feasible way. This study aimed to determine whether environmental enrichment, understood to be positive for animal welfare, could influence tail movement and ear movement in fattening pigs. These indicators could be used to assess emotions, with positive or negative valences, as suggested in previous studies on mini-pigs and pigs. The results showed that tail movement was a valid and feasible indicator of positive emotions; pigs moved their tails a greater number of times when they interacted more with enrichment than when they interacted less with it. Regarding ear movements, this study revealed a need for further investigation. This research could play an important role in improving the analysis of different emotions in pigs, thereby improving the assessment of animal welfare in pig breeding systems using valid, feasible, and noninvasive indicators of emotions. The inclusion of emotional indicators in farm monitoring methods can improve welfare assessments. Studies in controlled conditions have suggested that increased tail movement is an indicator of positive emotions in pigs, while others have proposed that increased ear movements are linked to negative emotions. This study aimed to investigate these indicators in pig farm conditions to analyze their validity and the effect of enrichment on welfare. Thirty-six pigs received one of the following enrichment materials: straw in a rack, wooden logs, or chains. Behavioral observations were performed by focal sampling. The results showed that tail movement duration was significantly higher when pigs exhibited "high use" (three or more pigs in a pen interacting with the enrichment) than when they exhibited "low use" (fewer than three) of enrichment (p = 0.04). A positive correlation was found between tail movement frequency and duration (r = 0.88; p = 0.02). The increase in tail movement could be considered an indicator of positive emotions in pigs when measured with other categories of indicators. Regarding ear movements, no significant difference was found. Future studies should further investigate these indicators thoroughly, as the results could be useful for improving the assessment of emotions in pigs.

AB  - Sweet pepper is among the most widely cultivated horticultural crops in the Mediterranean basin, being frequently grown hydroponically under cover in combination with CO2 fertilization and water conditions ranging from optimal to suboptimal. The aim of this study is to develop a simple model, based on the analysis of plant stable isotopes in their natural abundance, gas exchange traits and N concentration, to assess sweet pepper growth. Plants were grown in a growth chamber for near 6 weeks. Two [CO2] (400 and 800 mu mol mol(-1)), three water regimes (control and mild and moderate water stress) and four genotypes were assayed. For each combination of genotype, [CO2] and water regime five plants were evaluated. Water stress applied caused significant decreases in water potential, net assimilation, stomatal conductance, intercellular to atmospheric [CO2], and significant increases in water use efficiency, leaf chlorophyll content and carbon isotope composition, while the relative water content, the osmotic potential and the content of anthocyanins did change not under stress compared to control conditions support this statement. Nevertheless, water regime affects plant growth via nitrogen assimilation, which is associated with the transpiration stream, particularly at high [CO2],while the lower N concentration caused by rising [CO2] is not associated with stomatal closure. The stable isotope composition of carbon, oxygen,and nitrogen (delta C-13, delta O-18, and delta N-15) in plant matter are affected not only by water regime but also by rising [CO2]. Thus, delta O-18 increased probably as response to decreases in transpiration, while the increase in delta N-15 may reflect not only a lower stomatal conductance but a higher nitrogen demand in leaves or shifts in nitrogen metabolism associated with decreases in photorespiration.The way that delta C-13 explains differences in plant growth across water regimes within a given [CO2], seems to be mediated through its direct relationship with N accumulation in leaves. The changes in the profile and amount of amino acids caused by water stress and high [CO2] support this conclusion. However, the results do not support the use of delta O-18 as an indicator of the effect of water regime on plant growth

TI  - Stable Carbon Isotopes Applied to Vegetation Reconstruction in the Teotihuacan Valley, Mexico
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD GEOLOGICA MEXICANA
LA  - English
AB  - Stable carbon isotope values (delta C-13) from organic material in soils and sediments suggest possible sources of carbon in the organic component and contribute to the development of hypotheses concerning the composition of regional vegetation. This paper explores the application of delta C-13 to the study of soils and sediments in conjunction with the analysis of plant remains in the Teotihuacan Valley, Mexico, located approximately 50 km NE of Mexico City, known for the archaeological site of Teotihuacan, occupied between ca. AD 1-650. The ratios of C-13/C-12 from soil organic matter (SOM) provide a complementary approach towards the analysis of past vegetation change in regions characterized by relatively poor preservation of plant macrofossils and pollen. The analysis of phytoliths recovered from soils and sediments offers an additional source of evidence for broad changes in environmental conditions based on changes in the relative proportions of C3 and C4 grasses. In this paper delta C-13 ratios obtained from SOM in profiles in the Teotihuacan Valley are compared with the results of phytolith analysis in the same horizons. The relative proportion of carbon derived from C4-CAMS (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) plants was calculated. Phytolith analysis focused on the relative proportions of C3 (diagnostic phytoliths of the Pooideae subfamily of Poaceae) and C4 grass taxa (subfamilies Panicoideae, Chloridoideae and Aristodoideae). The delta C-13 ratios obtained from Tlajinga, located in an area of prehispanic irrigation south of the San Lorenzo River in the central Valley, indicate the predominance of C4-CAMS plants while phytoliths from the same horizons reflect a greater proportion of C4 grasses, although proportionally lower than isotopic indicators. The values of delta C-13 in SOM from Otumba, situated in close proximity to a river that also provided water for a prehispanic irrigation system, reflect a slightly lower predominance of C4-CAMS plants, and a slight increase in C4 grass phytoliths, with respect to Tlajinga. San Pablo provided evidence for the greatest predominance of C4-CAMS plants based on delta C-13 values in SOM whereas the phytoliths recovered from the same horizons indicate a higher proportion of C3 grasses. In general, the isotopic signatures reported here indicate changes in relative proportions of C4-CAMS plants, suggesting variability in the response of vegetation to local conditions, with a predominance of C4-CAMS plants in soil organic matter and considerable variability in proportions of C4 grass phytoliths in the contexts analyzed.

AB  - This study focuses on the reconstruction of the environment during peat swamp development. Eight coal and sedimentary organic rock bearing seam successions were examined all belonging to the Duckmantian (Pennsylvanian, Late Carboniferous). 410 samples were analysed with coal petrographical methods, 155 of these also by palynological methods. In addition, on 55 samples organic geochemical investigations were carried out with respect to n-alkanes and iso-alkanes.
   The established coal petrographical parameters gelification index (GI), tissue preservation index (TPI), groundwater index (GWI) and vegetation index (VI) were used to characterize different periods of peat swamp development. Furthermore, the new index WCI (=Water Cover Index) was introduced to reflect water level conditions by using the ratio between hydrophilous/hygrophilous and mesophilous plants. In this study the index is based on palynological data but can be equally applied when quantitative macrofloral counts are available.
   GI versus TPI values show two general trends of peat swamp evolution: low GI and TPI values as indicator for drier swamp conditions like ombrogenous mires and high Cl and TPI values which show a trend to water covered environments like topogenous mires. In addition, ash yields and GWI versus VI data also emphasize a general trend from topogenous to ombrogenous mires. A decrease in water level towards the top of the seams and thus resulting in the development of domed mires is reflected by the newly introduced WCI. Hence, these parameters show recurrent peat swamp successions, characterized by mineral- and vitrinite-rich coals, typical for topogenous swamps and an evolution towards inertinite/liptinite-rich coals with low ash yield, typical for ombrogenous swamps.
   n-alkane ratios like the carbon preference index (CPI), pristane/n-C-17, phytane/n-C-18, pristane/phytane and the n-C-17/n-C-27 relationship indicate a strong correlation of these parameters with thermal maturity, e.g. CPI values correlate with vitrinite reflectance.
   Sulphur/organic carbon (S/TOC) ratios are quite uniform in clastic rocks with low to moderate TOC contents, but highly variable in coals, probably reflecting variable sulphate availability during deposition of peats. Sphenophyll-rich floral assemblages are restricted to low sulphur environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Mexico, alcohol and drug consumption has been a social problem for many years. Epidemiological studies show that moderate-to-high alcohol consumption has persisted in recent years, whereas in the case of illegal drugs consumption has become more widespread in both men and women. In fact, there is a tendency for consumption rates to level out between men and women, especially regarding legal drugs. Although most users are moderate consumers, between 5-10% are chronic consumers. It is necessary for these people to have access to a range of treatments that incorporate a system of examination and systematization. Consequently, in Mexico it is necessary to create new programs with a methodological structure that makes it possible to assess whether they assist in curtailing this social problem.
   One program that has proven to be effective is the Daily Satisfaction Program (DSP), which is based on the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA). CRA is notable as one of the most successful programs in helping chronic users of legal or illegal drugs in the United States to give up substance abuse. In Mexico, it was necessary to modify some of the elements of DSP in order to adapt it to our culture, but it has encouraged a significant reduction in consumption patterns among participating users. This is an intensive program that includes several components, due to the serious nature of the problem to be tackled. However, it is necessary to carry out a systematized assessment of each of these components that foster in the user not only a reduction in consumption but also an increase in the satisfaction found in day-to-day activities. In Mexican culture, there are strong social pressures that affect consumption. Consequently the refuse-to-consume component is one of the most important, as it provides the user with the necessary strategies to be able to decline in a situation with peer pressure and in those moments when impulsive thoughts occur that might trigger the consumption response in the subject.
   The refuse-to-consume skills that were assessed in users were: body language, assertive refusal, suggesting alternatives, changing the subject of conversation, offering an explanation, suspending interaction, confronting the offerer, and changing impulsive thoughts by using cognitivist restructuring.
   Some investigators have detected a correlation between high consumption levels and a low degree of self-efficacy in refusing consumption. According to this theory, low self-efficacy in refusing Articulo original consumption is the most accurate indicator of consumption behavior and makes it possible to discriminate between different types of user. High self-efficacy in refusing consumption is associated with less frequent episodes of consumption. With regard to motivation, these authors suggest that better self-efficacy in refusing consumption when offered the substance or in response to impulsive thoughts ha; an influence on the decision to consume or not to consume. In order to achieve a higher degree of self-efficacy in refuse-to-consume skills, it is necessary to control certain body responses that denote the desire or wish to consume. Some of these responses are: avoidance of eye contact, trembling, stuttering, blushing, sweating, palpitations, etc.
   The physiological responses associated with consumption are still displayed after the user has been through a period of non-consumption. They may be triggered by words associated with consumption or by watching videos of people who are consuming. Responses of this kind may be explained from a classical conditioning viewpoint, whereby a given stimulus provokes a given type of response. To explain what elicits, maintains, and increases the consumption of alcoholic drinks, three models of conditioning have been posited: the conditioned withdrawal model, the compensatory response model, and the conditioned motivational model. These models are based on an analysis of alcohol consumption situations with the aim of identifying the related variables.
   The model that most clearly explains alcohol consumption as a conditioned response is conditioned withdrawal. According to this model, in the case of people who have a history of alcohol dependence the stimuli associated with alcohol consumption (visual, olfactory, and auditory) provoke physiological responses such as salivation, trembling hands, or sweating. Alcohol consumption reduces these responses, which the subject is averse to. Users learn that, when they are offered a drink or drugs (the stimulus), they should accept it (the response).
   The aim of refuse-to-consume skills is to teach them to change their response to the stimulus, in other words, to teach users the necessary skills so that they learn to say no. When people are in the process of changing their consumption patterns by learning refusal skills and they experience high-risk situations, ills very probable that on the first few occasions they will exhibit a behavior that shows they are feeling insecure or anxious, such as avoiding eye contact with the person offering them the substance, stuttering, mumbling, not speaking with a decisive tone of voice, sweating, or having shaky hands. These responses make the offerer doubt whether the individual wishes to give up consuming, so he or she is more likely to insist and encourage a relapse in the user. Consequently, it is necessary to teach users how to react to these offers by relaxing and behaving assertively. This can be achieved by applying refuse-to-consume skills. Relaxation produces emotional effects that are the exact opposite of anxiety and which may be used therapeutically in everyday situations. Thus, it is less likely that the person offering the substance will follow up a refusal by repeating the offer, and the user may then take control of the situation and feel more secure. Peer pressure constitutes a high-risk factor that causes many users to relapse. It consists of direct or indirect pressure from other individuals or social groups who exert an influence on the user. In the case of direct pressure, the contact is personal, the offer involves verbal interaction, and the offerer is insistent that the user should consume the substance. In the case of indirect peer pressure, the user responds by watching other people use the substance in question.
   Often peers do not understand that the user has made a decision to quit and are insistent that he or she should continue to consume; the user also frequently feels that justification should be provided when refusing an offer. In reality, such an explanation is not necessary in most cases. It is frequently the case that when the user is with family members or close friends, they may question the refusal. For this reason, it is important for the user to preempt this reaction by asking friends and family members for support as a first step in the recovery process. The user must also interpret events, impulses, and emotions rationally, bearing in mind the negative consequences of consuming and the benefits of being sober or drug-free. Consequently, the user needs to learn to say no to him- or herself whenever temptation arises in the form of thoughts or desires. The user must confront them and change them into positive thoughts that favor his or her wellbeing and are unrelated to consumption.
   The objective of this study was to assess the degree of aptitude attained in refuse-to-consume skills by four chronic drug users in the Daily Satisfaction Program (DSP). Each user performed an evaluation of the high-risk situations in which consumption might occur as a result of peer pressure, and carried out a behavioral test in which the skills learnt were put to use. Subsequently, the users identified their impulsive thoughts and carried out an exercise in which the therapist repeated out loud the impulsive thoughts and the user replaced them with positive thoughts oriented toward reversing the decision to consume. These exercises were recorded and evaluated by two DSP therapists. Results indicate a high level of skill in refusing consumption in the face of external and internal pressure. Users also put these skills into practice in real-life situations, thereby reducing their episodes of consumption or maintaining abstinence.

AB  - Large floodplain-river ecosystems are often highly modified to provide services that society desires, yet these modifications can limit an ecosystem's ability to adapt to changing conditions. The adaptive capacity of an ecosystem, its general resilience, is a conceptual framework for considering how a system will respond to such changes. We sought to apply aspects of three general resilience principles (diversity and redundancy, connectivity, and controlling variables) to our understanding of floodplain-river ecosystem structure and function. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach in a case study of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS). In doing so, we developed ten indicators that highlight important structural and functional aspects of this floodplain-river ecosystem, and likely underlie the capacity of large rivers to cope with environmental change and disturbance. We developed diversity and redundancy indicators for aquatic habitats, patterns of floodplain inundation, and fish communities. Connectivity indicators included metrics of longitudinal and lateral connections. Controlling variable indicators included deviations from historic water surface elevation fluctuations, water clarity, nutrient concentrations, and aquatic invasive species. This set of indicators provides a simple description of the adaptive capacity of four distinct reaches of the UMRS: Upper Impounded, Lower Impounded, Unimpounded Reaches of the Upper Mississippi River and the entire Illinois River. High aquatic habitat diversity and redundancy, fish functional diversity and redundancy, and water clarity, and the scarcity of invasive fish species are all factors that likely contribute to the high general resilience of the Upper Impounded Reach. However, the limited longitudinal connectivity and establishment of a minimum water level for navigation are factors that may inhibit the general resilience of this reach. In the Lower Impounded Reach, there is high within-reach variability for individual indicators such as aquatic habitat diversity, fish functional diversity and redundancy, and longitudinal and lateral connectivity. In the Unimpounded Reach, a high degree of longitudinal connectivity likely enhances its general resilience, but low aquatic habitat diversity, low lateral connectivity, and relatively high number of invasive fish species inhibit general resilience. For the Illinois River Reach, the relatively high fish functional diversity and redundancy likely contributes to its general resilience, whereas high number of invasive fish species, low water clarity, low lateral connectivity, and high range of water levels may inhibit general resilience. Indicators derived from application of concepts of general resilience provide insight into the current coping capacity of the UMRS and identify opportunities for enhancing resilience.

AB  - The chemical composition of plants should be studied in order to understand the role of environmental factors in accumulation of various chemical elements by them, as well as to make a better sense of the specifics of potential resource plants. The safety of the content and accumulation of chemical elements in the phytomass of Leonurus quinquelobatus Gilib. under different environmental conditions in the south of Western Siberia has been assessed. The concentrations of chemical elements have been studied using the ashes of plants grown from genetically homogeneous seeds in the following three regions of the south of Western Siberia: Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, and the Altai Republic (Kamlak). The content of chemical elements in the ash of L. quinquelobatus has been determined by the atomic-emission method using a double-jet argon arc plasmatron and a multichannel analyzer of emission spectra. The content of chemical elements in the extracts has been determined by the atomic absorption method. The concentrations of As and Hg have been found according to the State Standard R 51766-2001 and R 53183-2008, respectively. Statistically significant (p <= 0.05) differences in the content of chemical elements contained by the L. quinquelobatus phytomass from different geographical locations in Western Siberia have been revealed for Cu, Ga, Fe, K, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Pb, Si, Sn, Sr, Ti, V, Y, Yb, Zn, and Zr. It has been shown that the concentrations of As and Hg are below the detection limit. The phytomass of the samples from the Altai Republic has the highest K and Cu content. The contents of Mn and Na are highest in the samples from the Kemerovo region with other chemical elements showing highest levels in plants from the Novosibirsk region. The revealed content of the available forms of chemical elements in plants suggests that the high total concentration of some chemical elements in plants sampled from the Novosibirsk region is most likely due to dust accumulation, because some chemical elements have been shown to be contained in solid soil particles on the plant surface, rather than inside the plant phytomass. The coefficients of biological uptake and biogeochemical mobility vary to a significant degree. The overall total and insoluble (in 10% HCl) ash content and the content of chemical elements in the L. quinquelobatus plants have been found to comply with the regulation requirements for medicinal plants. The accumulation of cation-forming elements prevails in plants of this species. The accumulation of Cr, Pb, Co, Zn, and B in the L. quinquelobatus phytomass has been found to be below average values.

AB  - Domesticated horses mainly live in individual boxes, a housing system reported as compromising animal welfare. A common practice in riding schools involves offering a temporary period on pasture with conspecifics to alleviate the impact of long-term deprivation triggered by boxes. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of this practice using four behavioural indicators reflecting a compromised welfare state: stereotypies; aggressive behaviours towards humans; the "withdrawn posture" reflecting unresponsiveness to the environment; and the "alert posture" indicating hypervigilance. A group of 31 horses was monitored before, during and after a period of 1.5 months on pasture (intra-group comparisons) and their behaviours were compared to those of 29 horses kept in individual boxes during the study (inter-group comparisons). On pasture, no stereotypies and aggressive behaviours towards humans were observed, and the occurrence of the "alert posture" decreased, although the results were not significant. An increase in the expression of natural behaviours such as locomotion, exploration and social behaviours was observed. However, the expression of the "withdrawn posture" increased during the first five days on pasture (Friedman: P<0.001; Wilcoxon signed-rank: P<0.001) before a decrease was observed after 20 days, returning to the level previously observed when horses were in boxes (Wilcoxon signed-rank: P<0.01). These results suggest that going out to pasture can positively influence the welfare state of horses, but also that several days of adaptation are needed, probably due to the novelty of the environmental and social conditions. The most noticeable result occurred when horses returned to individual boxes. A sharp increase in the occurrence of stereotypies (Cochran test: P<0.001; Chi(2) of homogeneity: P = 0.05), of the "withdrawn" (Friedman: P<0.001; Wilcoxon rank-sum: P<0.05) and the "alert" postures (Friedman: P<0.01; Wilcoxon rank-sum: P<0.001) was observed during the first five days of returning to confinement. The expression of the majority of natural behaviours immediately returned to the level observed during the pre-pasture period. After three months, the expression of the four welfare indicators was not different from that in the pre-pasture period. These results demonstrate that the beneficial effects likely to be induced by the pasture do not last when horses return to individual boxes and that the environmental change causes deleterious shortterm effects on the animals' welfare state. It would thus be recommended to keep domestic horses permanently on pasture when possible.

AB  - 1. Highly disturbed areas such as surface-mined land provide a great challenge for ecological restoration. The goal is to identify appropriate restoration approaches in a continuum between technical reclamation and spontaneous succession. In particular, on slopes endangered by erosion, appropriate methods are needed that quickly establish vegetation cover but also take into account the natural potentials of the site.
   2. In the mined area Rossbach (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany), we evaluated the effects of spontaneous succession and assisted site recovery (species introduction through hay transfer and sowing) during a 9-year experiment. We asked how rates and pathways of vegetation development differ between treatments and whether species composition converges over time owing to species exchange.
   3. The application of green hay as well as the sowing of regional seed mixtures clearly accelerated vegetation development and led to the rapid establishment of species-rich grasslands. Hay transfer was most successful owing to the high amount of transferable target species. Moreover, both treatments facilitated the establishment of cryptogams and provided effective erosion control. Also, hay transfer and sowing clearly affected the pathway of succession. Calamagrostis epigejos migrated from nearby source populations and became increasingly dominant at sites with spontaneous succession. In contrast, the species-rich grasslands established after hay transfer and sowing were highly resistant to invasion of Calamagrostis and other ruderals.
   4. Species exchange between treatments led to increasing similarity in vegetation composition over time. Nine years after implementation of the experiment, we did not find any significant differences between treatments in terms of total vegetation cover, species richness and the number of target species. However, the dominance ratio between target and nontarget species differed significantly. Species introduction through hay transfer and sowing led to a permanently higher abundance of grassland species and a lower coverage of ruderals compared with spontaneously developed sites. Hence, our results highlight the importance of initial floristic composition and the order of species arrivals for long-termvegetation development.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Hay transfer and sowing of regional seed mixtures are appropriate restoration tools to achieve rapid revegetation when no potential seed sources of target species are available nearby or there are undesirable species that need to be suppressed. Our results show that introduced grassland species are able to grow under postmining site conditions and can migrate into adjacent spontaneously developing sites. A combination of spontaneous and assisted site recovery can promote the development of species-rich grasslands in postmining landscapes.

AB  - Background. Similar to natural rivers, manmade inlets connect inland runoff to the ocean. Port Everglades Inlet (PEI) is a busy cargo and cruise ship port in South Florida, which can act as a source of pollution to surrounding beaches and offshore coral reefs. Understanding the composition and fluctuations of bacterioplankton communities ("microbiomes'') in major port inlets is important due to potential impacts on surrounding environments. We hypothesize seasonal microbial fluctuations, which were profiled by high throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis.
   Methods & Results. Surface water samples were collected every week for one year. A total of four samples per month, two from each sampling location, were used for statistical analysis creating a high sampling frequency and finer sampling scale than previous inlet microbiome studies. We observed significant differences in community alpha diversity between months and seasons. Analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) tests were run in QIIME 2 at genus level taxonomic classification to determine which genera were differentially abundant between seasons and months. Beta diversity results yielded significant differences in PEI community composition in regard to month, season, water temperature, and salinity. Analysis of potentially pathogenic genera showed presence of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. However, statistical analysis indicated that these organisms were not present in significantly high abundances throughout the year or between seasons.
   Discussion. Significant differences in alpha diversity were observed when comparing microbial communities with respect to time. This observation stems from the high community evenness and low community richness in August. This indicates that only a few organisms dominated the community during this month. August had lower than average rainfall levels for a wet season, which may have contributed to less runoff, and fewer bacterial groups introduced into the port surface waters. Bacterioplankton beta diversity differed significantly by month, season, water temperature, and salinity. The 2013-2014 dry season (October-April), was warmer and wetter than historical averages. This may have driven significant differences in beta diversity. Increased nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations were observed in these dry season months, possibly creating favorable bacterial growth conditions. Potentially pathogenic genera were present in the PEI. However their relatively low, non-significant abundance levels highlight their relatively low risk for public health concerns. This study represents the first to sample a large port at this sampling scale and sequencing depth. These data can help establish the inlet microbial community baseline and supplement the vital monitoring of local marine and recreational environments, all the more poignant in context of local reef disease outbreaks and worldwide coral reef collapse in wake of a harsh 2014-16 El Nino event.

AB  - During the late 1950s and early 1960s, industrial waste material highly enriched with various contaminants (e.g., heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)) was dumped in the inner Bay of Mecklenburg, western Baltic Sea. Between 2002 and 2004, a research program was initiated using chemical analysis in combination with bioanalytical techniques to assess the extent and variability in contamination at this dump site (DS). The data were compared to a reference area (RS) with similar environmental conditions, which is representative of the western Baltic Sea.
   Twelve PAHs were investigated to assess their ecological hazard, as they were identified as major pollutants in the dumped material. In addition to analyzing the actual PAH contamination status in the sediments, PAHs measured in the soft tissue of Arctica islandica were also used as an indicator of contaminant bioaccumulation. A biotest battery was applied to determine the toxic effects of contaminants in the sediment.
   Significantly elevated PAH concentrations (sum of 12 PAHs) of similar to 3,000 ng g(-1) dw and higher bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were determined in the soft body tissue of A. islandica collected at DS (t test, p = 0.025). The results also showed that the sediment PAH contamination was significantly higher at DS (1,952-5,466 ng g(-1) dw) than at RS (1,384-2,315 ng g(-1) dw). The results revealed a major heterogeneity in the PAH concentration at DS due to an attempt to cover the toxic material with clean clay. This resulted in a more heterogeneous distribution of the dump material rather than covering it up completely. However, not all relevant contaminants were included in this study, not only because it is too costly to determine them all but also because unidentified contaminants present at concentrations below the limit of detection cannot be measured. Bioassays were used to fill this gap in the hazard assessment in a cost-effective way by investigating the possible effects of sediment contamination on benthic organisms. The results showed a high variability and magnitude of growth and luminescence inhibition. Bacterial contact tests with marine organisms showed a high toxicity response (> 80 % inhibition) from DS sediments. In contrast, the luminescent bacteria test (Vibrio fischeri) showed equivalent effects of sediments from both DS and RS.
   The spatial distribution of toxicity in DS, the bioaccumulation in mussels and the analytical evidence of PAH pollution clearly show that the dumped material still represents a potential risk even after 60 years.

AB  - The present study aims to investigate whether taxa with a small distribution range or taxa with low abundances indicate specific habitats or a high ecological quality and what the effect is if these taxa are excluded from ecological assessment. We compared autecological features between stream dwelling taxa with a mean abundance >5 individuals per sample and a mean abundance less than or equal to5 individuals per sample as well as between taxa with a small distribution range and taxa with a large distribution range. The number of rare taxa ( either with a small distribution range or with low abundances) in a sample was related to the ecological quality classes. To test the effect of exclusion of rare taxa we constructed 8 data sets all including 142 samples of Dutch lowland streams. From each data set we stepwise excluded taxa that had low abundances or taxa that were known to be restricted in their distribution range. With help of the AQEM assessment software we calculated the final ecological quality classes and the metrics that were included in the multimetric for the original data and the 8 selected data sets. Autecological features of the taxa within the different selections showed that taxa with small distribution ranges were often running water taxa, living on stones and gravel and indicating oligosaprobic water conditions in contrast to taxa that had a large distribution range. There were only small differences between taxa with low and high abundances. However, current velocity preference was lower for taxa with abundance less than or equal to5 individuals per sample, saprobic values were higher and scores for typical stream habitats, such as lithal, psammal and akal were lower compared to high abundant taxa. If taxa with low abundances were excluded a higher ecological quality class was achieved in most cases, while excluding taxa with a small distribution range resulted in lower ecological quality classes. In conclusion, excluding taxa with a small distribution range led to worse ecological quality classes because these taxa have special autecological features that often indicate natural streams. On the other hand, excluding taxa with low abundances resulted in higher ecological quality classes because these taxa indicate more disturbed situations and because the number of taxa per sample was strongly reduced. Although the documentation of rare taxa ( either with low abundances or with small distribution ranges) is often time and cost-intensive regarding field work, laboratory work, data processing, and analyses, the indicative power of these taxa for natural circumstances is essential and therefore rare taxa should be included in ecological assessment studies.

AB  - Species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) are used in chemical safety assessments to derive predicted-no-effect-concentrations (PNECs) for substances with a sufficient amount of relevant and reliable ecotoxicity data available. For engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), ecotoxicity data are often compromised by poor reproducibility and the lack of nano-specific characterization needed describe an ENM under WA exposure conditions. This may influence the outcome of SSD modelling and hence the regulatory decision-making. This study investigates how the outcome of SSD modelling is influenced by: 1) Selecting input data based on the nano-specific "nanoCRED" reliability criteria, 2) Direct SSD modelling avoiding extrapolation of data by including long-term/chronic NOECs only, and 3) Weighting data according to their nano-specific quality, the number of data available for each species, and the trophic level abundance in the ecosystem. Endpoints from freshwater ecotoxicity studies were collected for the representative nanomaterials NM-300 K (silver) and NM-105 (titanium dioxide), evaluated for regulatory reliability and scored according to the level of nano-specific characterization conducted. The compiled datasets are unique in exclusively dealing with representative ENMs showing minimal batch-to-batch variation. The majority of studies were evaluated as regulatory reliable, while the degree of nano-specific characterization varied greatly. The datasets for NM-300 K and NM-105 were used as input to the nano-weighted n-SSWD model, the probabilistic PSSD +, and the conventional SSD Generator by the US EPA. The conventional SSD generally yielded the most conservative, but least precise HC5 values, with 95 % confidence intervals up to 100-fold wider than the other models. The inclusion of regulatory reliable data only, had little effect on the HC5 generated by the conventional SSD and the PSSD +, whereas the n-SSWD estimated different HC5 values based on data segregated according to reliability, especially for NM-105. The n-SSWD weighting of data significantly affected the estimated HC5 values, however in different ways for the sub-datasets of NM-300 K and NM-105. For NM-300 K, the inclusion of NOECs only in the weighted n-SSWD yielded the most conservative HC5 of all datasets and models (a HC5 based on NOECs only could not be estimated for NM-105, due to limited number of data). Overall, the estimated HC5 values of all models are within a relatively limited concentration range of 25 -100 ng Ag/L for NM-300 K and 1 -15 mu gTiO(2)/L for NM-105.

KW  - stages of growth and fall
AB  - The article presents results of the study of relations between the enterprise life cycle and the efficiency of investment in the context of dynamic, rapid changes in the conditions of enterprises operation and development. It is determined that one of the main factors of success is the introduction of innovative technologies in the production process, which cannot be carried out without attracting investments. It is the investment activity of enterprises that determines the dynamics of their development, the level of competitiveness and the growth of productive resources, which affects the efficiency of their activities. It is proved that it is relevant to take into account the possible negative effects of the influence of factors divergence. The purpose of the study is to analyse possibilities of determining the impact of life cycle stages on the efficiency of investing in an enterprise. The methodological basis of the research is grounded on the general scientific methods of dialectics, observation, measurement, and formalization; methods of the system and statistical analysis. In particular, to determine the influence of internal factors on the indicators of the efficiency of investment activity of the enterprise at the stages of its life cycle, deterministic factor analysis is applied; methods of systematization and synthesis, analysis and synthesis are also used. It is determined that the construction industry plays a special role in the national economy since its development creates a synergistic effect for the development of other industries, increases the standard of living of the society through solving certain socioeconomic problems. The analytical data of construction enterprises activity in Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions of Ukraine became the basis for the approbation of the proposed approach. The use of the life cycle model of the enterprise, which includes the stage of growth (slow and rapid growth, stability stage) and the stage of the fall (slow and rapid fall, crisis stage), is substantiated. The features of investment activity according to the given stages of the life cycle of the enterprise are considered. It is determined that the growth and fall stages have a different effect on the nature of the investment indicators, which depends on certain factors. Further research is aimed at improving the mechanism of monitoring the environment in order to determine the force of factors influence on investment activity and implementation of preventive measures. The lack of a rapid reaction of the company to changes in the environment can lead to a crisis state of management, which determines the high degree of significance of adaptation for any life cycle of the enterprise.

AB  - A reef finfishing pressure risk assessment model was developed to predict the status of reef and lagoon fisheries in terms of the current likelihood for Sustainable or unsustainable finfishing for any given rural coastal community and its associated reef area in the Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs). The prediction model aimed at developing a robust system that allows planners to confidently classify any coastal rural site within PICTs with a minimum and relatively easy-to-obtain dataset as being exposed to four classes of low to high finfishing pressure. This model is a response to limitations on data regarding current resource and user status in PICTs that make it difficult to ascertain fish supply for food security and livelihood of coastal communities. The model is based on the latest reef productivity scenarios developed based on a global review of currently known landing data and ecological footprints, reported likelihood of reduced reef productivity in PICTs due to ecological and human factors, and the use of current finfish catch rates collected as a proxy for fishing pressure. The prediction model was developed on the basis of a regional dataset including 63 study sites in 17 PICTs using linear discriminant analysis. The smallest feasible model with a leave-one-out error rate of 14.3% demands nine input variables that can be easily obtained and require only a minimum survey effort. Statistically significant response of decreasing fish length in six fish families important to artisanal fisheries in PICTs (Acanthuridae, Lethrinidae, Mullidae, Scaridae, Serranidae and Siganidae) to increasing catch rates or increasing fishing pressure proxies was used as an independent external factor to validate our hypothesis and the model developed. The reported catch length for Acanthuridae, Scaridae and Serranidae was statistically significantly different between the four finfishing pressure risk groups defined. Due to the lack of data on the natural status and productivity of the coral reefs in question and their historic use, care should be taken in interpretation of current catch rate figures. Classification of sites at low current finfishing pressure risk may reflect catch rates that are adapted to low stocks, either caused by previous depletion or due to natural unfavorable conditions. At the same time, sites classified as being at potentially high finfishing pressure risk may indeed be subject to current over fishing, but May as well feature high natural stock and productivity assets that allow for higher catch rates than elsewhere.

AB  - In situ benthic chamber experiments were conducted in the Than Lagoon that allowed the simultaneous determination of the benthic exchanges of trace metals (Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Pb and U) and mercury species (iHg and MMHg). Fluxes of organotin compounds (MBT, DBT and TBT) were also investigated for the first time. The benthic incubations were performed during two campaigns at four stations that presented different macrobenthic and macrophytic species distribution and abundance (see [Thouzeau, G., Grall, J., Clavier, J., Chauvaud, L., Jean, E, Leynaert, A., Longpuirt, S., Amice, E., Amouroux, D., 2007. Spatial and temporal variability of benthic biogeochemical fluxes associated with macrophytic and macrofaunal distributions in the Than lagoon (France). Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 72 (3), 432-446.]). The results indicate that most of the flux intensity as well as the temporal and spatial variability can be explained by the combined influence of microscale and macroscale processes. Microscale changes were identified using Mn flux as a good indicator of the redox conditions at the sediment-water interface, and by extension, as an accurate proxy of benthic fluxes for most trace metals and mercury species. We also observed that the redox gradient at the interface is promoted by both microbial and macrobenthic species activity that governs 02 budgets. Macroscale processes have been investigated considering macrobenthic organisms activity (macrofauna and macroalgal cover). The density of such macroorganisms is able to explain most of the spatial and temporal variability of the benthic metal fluxes within a specific site. A tentative estimation of the flux of metals and organometals associated with deposit feeder and suspension feeder activity was found to be in the range of the flux determined within the chambers for most considered elements. Furthermore, a light/dark incubation investigating a dense macroalgal cover present at the sediment surface illustrates the role of photosynthetic activity in controlling benthic exchanges. Significant changes in benthic flux intensity and/or direction were reported for all redox sensitive elements (Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Pb, U, and iHg). For MMHg and organotin species, other complimentary processes such as photodegradation/uptake and hydrophobic absorption/desorption need to be considered. This work demonstrates that the processes governing benthic exchanges are complex and that benthic organisms play a major role in the significant seasonal, diurnal and spatial variability of trace metals and organometals benthic fluxes in the lagoon.

AB  - Pollen spectra from seven short cores taken from deltaic sites in the central and northern parts of Lake Tanganyika provide information about vegetation changes around the lake during the last 5000 years. Pollen analysis was undertaken to understand the history and timing of catchment deforestation and its causal linkage to excess sedimentation and ecosystem change in Lake Tanganyika. The spectra are dominated by grass pollen at all levels in every core. Grass pollen percentage values range between 40 and 80%. Low values of arboreal pollen taxa (1-20%) were documented from most cores except core LT-98-2M. Core LT-98-2M represents the longest duration vegetation record of this study (close to 5000 years BP), and records the onset of increasingly arid conditions in the Late Holocene, especially after similar to 500 A. D., with the probable replacement of forest by open grassland in the Mahale Mountains region. The pollen/spore content for other cores showed a consistent trend of a decrease in grass pollen and an increase in pteridophyte and forest indicator pollen taxa during the last few centuries, contemporaneous with other indications of increased watershed disturbance from forest clearing (especially isotopes and lake faunal change). The timing or strength of this trend is not tied to specific levels of watershed disturbance. However, increasing fern spore abundance does occur progressively later towards the south, where modern human population densities are lower. Although increasing fern spore abundance is consistent with a land-clearing hypothesis, the rising arboreal pollen percentages are seemingly counterintuitive. One possible explanation is that increasing arboreal pollen proportions reflects the recycling of abundant pollen of this type from rapidly eroding soils. Another likely explanation for this finding is that land clearing involved the replacement of miombo woodland, with its mixture of trees producing little pollen and understory grasses producing large amounts of pollen, by the present day cassava, banana, and legume agricultural systems, all of which are poor pollen producers. This shift in catchment vegetation would increase the relative contribution of Afromontane pollen transported long distances from the surrounding highland regions. This hypothesis is consistent with both the lack of correlation of palynological history with specific watershed deforestation attributes, as well as the broader historical record of human habitation in the Lake Tanganyika region. This study also highlights the need for both modern pollen transect data from the region and comparative cores from low elevation swamps or ponds (wetlands) in the region with smaller catchment areas.

AB  - Fossiliferous silts within the Late Pleistocene Kempton Park Gravel, of the River Thames Valley, were exposed in 1980 during foundation works for the Ismaili Centre in South Kensington, London. The results of a multidisciplinary study of the geomorphology, sediments, fossil plants, vertebrates, molluscs, ostracods and insects are reported. The silts were deposited under two distinct climatic regimes; a lower unit accumulated when the climate was arctic and an upper when the temperatures were at least as warm as those of the present day. Both these units occupy the same channel system and are separated from one another by less than a metre of sediment, implying that the climatic change was probably sudden and intense. The strongest evidence for this climatic difference comes from a study of the Coleoptera, which show an almost complete replacement of the arctic element in the fauna by a suite of temperate species. Palaeotemperature reconstructions using the Mutual Climatic Range method, based on the coleopteran assemblages from the lower unit, suggest that the mean temperature of the warmest month was 9+/-2 degrees C and that of the coldest month -22+/-10 degrees C. For the upper unit the mean temperature of the warmest month had risen to about 17 degrees C and that of the coldest month to about -4 degrees C. The episode represented by the lower unit, with its arctic climate, had not previously been recognized in the Thames Valley. The fauna from the upper, temperate, unit is very similar to that from other sites in the Kempton Park Gravel, such as that from Isleworth, 10 km upriver, which, like the upper unit at the Ismaili Centre, was characterized by the virtual absence of trees. It would appear that in such cases this treelessness does not indicate cold conditions, equivalent to those of the modern tundra, but may instead result from a combination of ecological and temporal factors. The value of multidisciplinary studies in reaching such conclusions is emphasized.
   The temperate episode described here is correlated with the thermal maximum at the early part of the Upton Warren Interstadial Complex. An earlier suggestion, based on amino acid epimerization ratios, that the Upton Warren Interstadial correlates with Oxygen Isotope Sub-stage 5a is not supported by the data, which show no evidence of the forested environments that characterized this period in both Britain and the adjacent Continent. It is thought that the temperate deposits at the Ismaili Centre belong to the Middle (Pleniglacial), rather than the Early, Devensian (Weichselian) and are equivalent to Oxygen Isotope Stage 3.

AB  - Purpose The structural behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) beams made with waste foundry sand (WFS) was examined in this study by using investigational data. Five RC beams were tested in this present work, four beams with varying WFS content and one beam with natural aggregates. The factors considered for studying the flexural performance of RC beams were WFS content (10%, 20%, 30% and 40%), 15% Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) is used as supplementary cementitious (SCM) content for all beams and tension reinforcement ratio (0.95%). The crack pattern of the RC beams with WFS (RCB1, RCB2, RCB3 and RCB4) was similar to that of referral beam-RCB0. The RC beams made with WFS (RCB1, RCB2, RCB3 and RCB4) show lesser number of cracks than referral beam-RCB0. It is observed that RCB1 beam shows higher ultimate moment carrying capacity than other RC beams. A detailed assessment of the investigational results and calculations based on IS: 456-2000 code for flexural strength exhibited that the present provisions conservatively predicts the flexural strength and crack width of RC beams with WFS and 15% GGBS. It is suggested that 10% WFS can be used to make RC beam. Design/methodology/approach In this present work, four RC beams made WFS and one RC beam made with natural aggregates. 15% GGBS is used as SCM for all RC beams. After casting of RC beams, the specimens were cured with wetted gunny bags for 28 days. After curing, RC beams like RCB0, RCB1, RCB2, RCB3 and RCB4 were tested under a four-point loading simply supported condition. An assessment of investigational results and calculations as per IS: 456-2000 code provisions has been made for flexural strength and crack width of RC beams with WFS and 15% GGBS. The crack pattern is also studied. Findings From this experimental results, it is found that 10% WFS can be used for making RC beam. The RCB1 with 10% WFS shows better flexural performance than other RC beams. RC beams made with WFS show lesser number of cracks than referral beam-RCB0. IS: 456-2000 code provisions can be safely used to predict the moment capacity and crack width of RC beams with WFS and 15% GGBS. Originality/value By utilization of WFS, the dumping of waste and environmental pollution can be reduced. By experimental investigation, it is suggested that 10% WFS can be used to make RC structural members for low cost housing projects.

AB  - Purpose Pharmaceutical residues in the environment can pose significant risks to ecosystems and human beings due to adverse pharma-specific effects. Existing life cycle assessment (LCA) studies do not usually consider the use and end-of-life (EoL) phase of pharmaceuticals and thus exclude relevant potentially toxic emissions of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Therefore, a simplified inventory model for the use and EoL phase of pharmaceuticals is provided by estimating API flows and emissions to the environment. Methods Both the qualitative description of the use and EoL phase of pharmaceuticals and the quantification of the flows within each life cycle phase are based on literature and expert knowledge. Existing approaches to determine the API emissions are adjusted to make them applicable in LCA. In addition, different uses and EoL scenarios (e.g. depending on the patients' disposal behaviour) are specified, and assumptions are highlighted. Finally, the model is exemplarily applied to the oral intake of ibuprofen to test its applicability. Results and discussion Eleven potential flows and emissions of an API are identified and quantified for different application forms (pulmonary, oral, cutaneous). The model is applied to ibuprofen where potential API emissions result from administered and unused products. Referred to the administered amount of ibuprofen (reference flow), the product is mainly metabolized (73.1%). The unmetabolized (parental) compound enters the sewage treatment plant where it is degraded (13.94%), or emitted to surface water (8.35%), air (0%) and sewage sludge (0.36%). The remainder cannot be clearly assigned to one of the flows (4.25%). The results of this example are hardly comparable to existing measured data because they are related to the functional unit. The effect of assumptions, limitations due to data availability and the geographic scope reveal the need for further research. Conclusions To facilitate the consideration of the use and EoL phase of pharmaceuticals in future pharma-LCAs, a simplified inventory model specified for German conditions, is provided which allows to calculate inventory results with easily and publically accessible data. However, remaining challenges such as the lack of data to model the behaviour of metabolites in the sewage treatment plant, missing approaches to include specific pharmaceuticals (e.g. hormones, anticancer drugs), the consideration of other sewage treatment technologies such as ozonization, the integration of API emissions from sewage sludge (e.g. due to the use as fertilizer) or the scope expansion with regard to the geographic validity of the model shall be further examined.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate a conceptual model to explain alcohol and drugs abstinence in persons that meet the DSM-IV dependence criteria.
   This study incorporated and evaluated the conceptual proposal of the Integrated Model of Everyday Satisfaction. The structure of this model is based on the Niaura's Dynamic Regulator), Model and the Social Learning Theory that included the classical conditioning, the operant and the vicar to explain the dependent-consumption and incorporated some of the criticisms to the different cognitive-behavioral models, as the need to measure, by means of a direct observation, the specific type of skills used by the consumption-dependent users when facing everyday situations; as well as identifying changes of the functioning of the variables making up the model at the moment of turning towards abstinence; it also considered the indicators that the variable everyday satisfaction has been poorly studied and not been included in the study of conceptual models.
   Thus, the proposed conceptual model: Integrated Model of Everyday Satisfaction, included the following variables: consumption, precipitators, self-efficacy, everyday satisfaction, as well as variables measuring the facing of specific situations: communication, problem-solving, refusal of consumption, depression and anxiety.
   These variables were evaluated in an intentional, non-probabilistic sample with 20 dependent users of addictive substances, before and after the cognitive-behavioral intervention adapted to the Mexican population. This intervention model included the following components: Functional Analysis, Demonstration of Non-Consumption, Daily Life Goals, Communication, Problem Solving, Consumption Refusal, Marriage Guidance, Employment Searches, Recreational and Social Skills, Emotional Self-Control and Prevention of Relapses.
   The pre-post-test evaluation methods were: Retrospective Baseline, Situational Confidence Scale and/or Drug Consumption Self Confidence Scale, Daily Life Satisfaction Scale, Inventories of Drug Consumption Situations and/or Inventories of Alcohol Consumption Situations, Beck's Inventories for Depression and Anxiety. Occurrence records were used to assess the video-filmed behavioral assays of consumption refusal, problem-solving and communication. The didactic techniques used in the training were: verbal instruction, modeling, behavioral trials and feedback.
   In the scaled analysis, the Model showed, at the moment of consumption, solidity accounting for 95% of the variance. At this moment, significantly related to the variables: risk situations, self-efficacy to avoid consumption, everyday satisfaction and anxiety Dependent consumers, showed bigger diversity and intensity of risk situations previously associated to consumption, reduction of facing skills that caused their insecurity to refuse consumption, increased of their physical symptoms of anxiety and decreased of everyday satisfaction related with their poor functioning in different areas of daliy living.
   The increase of anxiety was an indicator of manifested abstinence syndrome, and confirmed that the used filter criterion, showed sensitivity to attract target population; in turn, anxiety as precipitator confirmed, was sustained by the conditioned withdrawal model.
   Refusal of consumption, communication and problem-solving at the moment of consumption in the user prior to the training were not significantly associated, indicating the need to acquire and develop these skills in the behavioral repertoire.
   Eighteen from the twenty dependent users showed in the analysis of interrupted time series, that the amount and frequency of the consumption was significantly changed toward abstinence after their participation in the cognitive-behavioral intervention.
   The scaled analysis indicates that it was a solid model in terms of abstinence accounting for 96% of the variance. In the final configuration of the Model variables with regard to its proximity to abstinence, identified the proximity between the: decreased of consumption, the more skills for facing risk situations, and refusal of consumption were detected with major proximity; subsequently, more everyday satisfaction and more self-efficacy to avoid consumption; then less anxiety and depression; and eventually, more communication and problem-solving skills.
   The following variables were significantly associated, during abstinence: the More Everyday Satisfaction from the functioning in daily living, more skills and variety of behavioral alternatives to cope risk situations, more self-efficacy to avoid consumption at coping different risk situations, less anxiety and depression, also more skills to consumption refusal, and decrease of substance consumption.
   Self-efficacy worked as mediator between behavior and emotion; everyday satisfaction was associated to cognitive variables: self-efficacy and emotional self-control; anxiety and depression. This study detected that it may work as an early advice of relapse, and as antecedent of abstinence.
   The variables that acted as predictor of abstinence, accounted for 73.2% of the variance and were: coping risk situations with alternative behaviors, getting everyday satisfaction from their performance in activities of different areas of daily living, self-efficacy to resist consumption at risk situations and refusal of consumption in front of persons modeling consumption and invitations and pressure to consume; depression was not significant with the Enter method regression model.
   The measuring of problem-solving did not include the efficacy of application in everyday life, so that it was not directly associated to consumption.
   One limitation was not having evaluated the generalization behavior of variables: communication and problem-solving in natural settings; and the lack of physiological measures in order to evaluate the emotional self-control. In another study, it is suggested to assess the variables during follow-up to detect changes in its functioning in this other moment.
   It may be concluded that the relationship between the diversity of variables inserted in this Model during the organism-environment interaction, is favorable to the abstinence, everyday satisfaction, facing non-consumption, behavior entails, flexibility and integration of a number of cognitive-behavioral skills.
   The functioning of Everyday Satisfaction as early warning of relapse is an important finding to be considered by the therapist who, when applying the intervention on these users, will have to perform subsequent evaluations of this variable in the process of change in order to anticipate and avoid relapses.

AB  - Predictive models relating ecological assemblages to environmental conditions are widely used in environmental impact assessment and biomonitoring. Such models are often parameterized using comprehensive ecological sampling and taxonomic identification efforts. Limited resources mean that expensive sampling and analytical procedures should be planned to maximize information gain and minimize unnecessary expense. However, there has been little consideration of cost-effectiveness in parameterizing predictive models using ecological assemblages and no explicit consideration of cost-effectiveness in balancing investment in the crucial aspects of sample size and taxonomic resolution. Using lacustrine diatom (Bacillariophyceae) assemblages from four large-scale (c. 77000-13million km(2)) data sets containing between 207 and 493 lakes, we address the following questions: (1) how does taxonomic resolution affect information content; (2) how does sample size affect information content for different taxonomic resolutions; and (3) what are the most cost-effective strategies for constructing environmental assessment models using diatom assemblages across a range of budgets? We use weighted averaging regression models for pH, phosphorus, salinity and lake depth and realistic data collection costs to examine the relationship between cost and model information content (R-2 and root mean squared error of prediction). For diatom-based models, finer taxonomic resolutions almost always provide more cost-effective information content than collecting more samples, with (morpho)species being the most appropriate taxonomic resolution for nearly all budget scenarios. Information content exhibits an asymptotic relationship with sample size and budget, with greatest information gain during initial sample size increases, and little gain beyond c. 100 samples. Smaller sample sizes can also achieve surprising predictive power in some cases, suggesting low-cost regional models may be achievable. However, caution is necessary in such an approach, because spatial dependencies in predictions may be missed and analogues with predicted assemblages may be poor.Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the utility of explicitly considering cost estimates to determine optimal sampling effort and taxonomic resolution for ecological assemblage models. For large, regional biomonitoring programmes, cost-effective sampling could save millions of dollars. Our framework for determining optimal trade-offs in ecological assemblage models is easily adaptable to other taxa and analytical techniques used in biomonitoring and environmental assessment.

AB  - The agricultural sector fulfils several functions such as the production of food energy and landscape conservation. An equilibrium between economic development and environmental protection should be found and research should aid political decision-making. In recent years, great efforts have been made to assess the environmental and economic implications of changes in both environmental and agricultural policies. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been extended by cost functions and social parameters. The validation of suggestions for political measures can be improved by combining existing environmental and economic models. This approach is applied in this paper in order to compare an increased support for organic farming with specific environmental policy measures, focusing on the resulting impacts and socioeconomic indicators.
   The LCA tool Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment (SALCA) has been linked with the economic optimisation model Swiss Agricultural Sector Forecasting System (SILAS). Since the focus lies on agricultural production, the farm gate represents the system boundary of the LCA. By linking SALCA with SILAS, the classic LCA impact categories have been extended by socioeconomic indicators. A reference scenario representing the assumed development of economic conditions between 2008 and 2015 was varied by a support for organic farming and four specific policy measures (support for ecological compensation areas and a tax on energy, fertiliser and concentrates, respectively). To remain comparable, the changes in total payments were set to the same amount in all scenarios (100 million CHF).
   A support for organic farming would have favourable effects on several environmental and socioeconomic indicators, but the differences compared to a combination of the four specific measures are small. However, some of these single measures could reach parts of the targets more efficiently: an energy tax would stimulate the application of available energy-saving measures, and a tax on concentrates would lead to a shift from intensive animal husbandry to crop production, reducing imports of concentrates and emissions of ammonia. Overall, the predicted developments in product and factor prices combined with the assumed reductions of public payments until 2015, as represented by the reference scenario, have the greatest effect on environmental impacts.
   Theoretically, specific policy measures are more efficient than measures directed towards multiple goals. Especially in the case of agriculture, however, a specific measure not only has an impact on the associated target but affects all agricultural functions. The results of the model combination suggest that a support for organic farming lowers the risk of undesirable side effects on environmental and socioeconomic indicators. Before implementing more specific measures, their impacts on the different functions should be estimated. For this purpose, a combination of decision-support models with LCA may be an appropriate instrument.

AB  - Global grasslands are typically under management practices (such as fire and grazing) that alter nutrient cycling ecosystem composition and distribution if organic matter from the unmanaged condition. We evaluated landscape-level response to fire and grazing treatments in the Konza Tallgrass Prairie Research Natural Area, Kansas, using spectral mixture analysis of Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data acquired 31 August 1990. Spectral mixture analysis derives the fractional abundances of spectrally unique components in the landscape. The reflectance spectra of these components are called endmembers. Endmember fractions values were compared against ground values of live biomass, current standing dead biomass, and litter for 12 watersheds. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on 37 watersheds with known burning and grazing histories for each of the remote sensing variables. Seven endmembers were selected from the AVIRIS data using a manual endmember selection method: nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), soil, rock, shade, and three green vegetation endmembers (GV1, GV2, and GV3). Each vegetation endmember correlated differently to biomass measurements and revealed unique relationships to management treatments. From regressions, ANOVAs, and image analysis, these three endmembers were inferred to represent canopy vertical structure or leaf area index (LAI), greenness, and fractional cover of grass, respectively. There was a stronger relationship between the sum of GV1 and GV3 fractions and live grass biomass values than there was with the (unsummed) individual fractions. In an ANOVA, the sum separated both burn and grazing treatments as well as the treatment interaction. The NPV fraction was strongly correlated with ground measurements of litter and standing dead biomass, and significantly separated burn treatments. The soil fraction differentiated grazing treatments, and analysis of the soil fraction image revealed a spatial coherence of grazing patterns along drainages. Similar analysis were perfomed on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a commonly used two-band index computed from red and near-infrared reflectance. NDVI, shown in previous studies to estimate the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation (FPAR), was a poor indicator of canopy biomass, but it successfully separated fire treatments.
   Broad-scale assessment of the state and structure of managed grassland systems requires the identification of several indicator variables. Spectral mixture analysis, unlike NDVI, not only separated treatments but also allowed for the identification of five remotely sensible factors affected by the management treatments, namely, vertical structure, percentage cover or patchiness, greenness, and distribution of soil and litter.

AB  - Demand for grass-based dairy production, which relies heavily on grazing and use of forage crops, is growing in the United States, primarily due to reported human health benefits of the milk produced as well as perceived environmental and animal welfare benefits. We used a whole-farm model to evaluate environmental footprints of all-grass, grass supplemented with grain, and confinement dairy production systems in the temperate climate of the northeastern U.S. Model results were depicted per unit of farmland and per unit of milk produced to provide alternate perspectives from the viewpoint of land management and commodity production. For most environmental indicators, the grass-based systems had smaller environmental impacts per unit of farmland but larger impacts per unit of milk produced compared to confinement fed systems. To verify the simulation of grass-based operations, eight dairy farms - ranging from herds that were grazed and fed only forage to herds that received some grain supplementation - were surveyed and modeled. Due to variation in climate, soil characteristics and management practices, a comparison of the two grass-based farm types showed no significant differences in environmental impacts. Farms of the same size using each production strategy along with a more traditional confinement production system were then simulated using the same climate and soil conditions for a better comparison. Predicted nitrogen and phosphorus losses to the environment, fossil energy use, water use, and greenhouse gas emissions were less from the grass-based farms compared to the confinement operation. Due to lower milk production on the grass-based dairies, nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions expressed per unit of milk produced were generally greater than those of the confinement system. Within the grass-based dairy systems, the system that supplemented with grain had slightly lower nitrogen and phosphorus losses per unit of farmland compared to the grass-only system, and much lower losses and emissions when expressed per unit of milk produced. Total production cost was less for the all-grass dairy than the grass with grain dairy. With a greater milk price, the all-grass system provided greater profitability per unit of land used and per unit of milk produced compared to the confinement farm of similar size. These data indicate that grass-based dairy farms can provide environmental benefits to a local watershed, but due to a lower efficiency in milk production, they may increase the aggregate environmental impacts of regional and global supply chains.

AB  - Large amounts of fossil fuel combustion wastes (e.g. fly and bottom ash) are discharged on land surface all over the world. The uppermost layer of disposal sites is subject to soil-forming processes after the development of plant cover due to natural succession or reclamation works. The present study presents the analysis of technogenic soils (Technosols) developed from ashes after combustion of bituminous coal and lignite. The study involved the determination of their properties, their classification, and discussion of the indicators of early pedogenesis. Technosols located on the surface of settling ponds and landfills of selected thermal power stations in Poland combusting both bituminous coal and lignite were examined. Standard pedological methods for the determination of soil morphology and physical-chemical properties were applied. Dithionite and oxalate extractions of Fe, Al, Si, and Mn were used in order to determine transformations of soil substrate during pedogenesis. Moreover, optical microscope observations permitted finding microscale effects of soil-forming processes in the studied Technosols. The properties of the analysed Technosols are primarily influenced by the properties of the parent material (i.e. ash from thermal power stations) which in turn are strongly dependent on (1) the type of ash (fly ash vs. bottom ash), (2) the kind of fuel (bituminous coal vs. lignite), as well as (3) the mode of ash deposition and type of disposal site (settling pond vs. dry landfill). Properties of the studied soils are also controlled by the following soil-forming factors: vegetation (input of soil organic matter), human (acceleration of soil-forming processes by reclamation), and climatic/weather conditions (leaching of soluble compounds by water from precipitation). The most important morphological and physical-chemical indicators of pedogenesis of the studied Technosols over several decades of soil formation are as follows: (1) the development of soil structure in A horizon related to the accumulation of soil organic matter, (2) the decrease in pH (a change in reaction from strongly alkaline towards less alkaline or acidic), (3) the formation of pedogenic carbonates and their subsequent leaching from the topsoil after several dozen of years of pedogenesis, and (4) the release of oxalate-extractable Al and Si during the pedogenesis. The studied soils were classified according to WRB as Spolic Technosols (or Leptic Spolic Technosols) with various supplementary qualifiers (Alcalic or Eutric, Arenic and/or Loamic, Calcic or Protocalcic, Fluvic, Hyperartefactic, Laxic, Relocatic, Tephric or Vitric). Certain suggestions to improve the WRB soil system are discussed in the paper.

AB  - Quantitative prediction of environmental impacts of land-use and climate change scenarios in a watershed can serve as a basis for developing sound watershed management schemes. Water quantity and quality are key environmental indicators which are sensitive to various external perturbations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impacts of land-use and climate changes on water quantity and quality at watershed scale and to understand relationships between hydrologic components and water quality at that scale under different climate and land-use scenarios. We developed an approach for modeling and examining impacts of land-use and climate change scenarios on the water and nutrient cycles. We used an empirical land-use change model (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects, CLUE) and a watershed hydrology and nutrient model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) for the Teshio River watershed in northern Hokkaido, Japan. Predicted future land-use change (from paddy field to farmland) under baseline climate conditions reduced loads of sediment, total nitrogen (N) and total phosphorous (P) from the watershed to the river. This was attributable to higher nutrient uptake by crops and less nutrient mineralization by microbes, reduced nutrient leaching from soil, and lower water yields on farmland. The climate changes (precipitation and temperature) were projected to have greater impact in increasing surface runoff, lateral flow, groundwater discharge and water yield than would land-use change. Surface runoff especially decreased in April and May and increased in March and September with rising temperature. Under the climate change scenarios, the sediment and nutrient loads increased during the snowmelt and rainy seasons, while N and P uptakes by crops increased during the period when fertilizer is normally applied (May through August). The sediment and nutrient loads also increased with increasing winter rainfall because of warming in that season. Organic nutrient mineralization and nutrient leaching increased as well under climate change scenarios. Therefore, we predicted annual water yield, sediment and nutrient loads to increase under climate change scenarios. The sediment and nutrient loads were mainly supplied from agricultural land under land use in each climate change scenario, suggesting that riparian zones and adequate fertilizer management would be a potential mitigation strategy for reducing these negative impacts of land-use and climate changes on water quality. The proposed approach provides a useful source of information for assessing the consequences of hydrology processes and water quality in future land-use and climate change scenarios.

AB  - Labile soil carbon fractions and enzymatic activity are typically more sensitive to changes in soil management practices or environmental conditions than total soil organic matter, and consequently they are well-established as early indicators of change due to crop residue incorporation, soil use or pollution. However, less information has been reported for volcanic soils under different cropping systems where there are unique C stabilization mechanisms that promote faster accumulation of soil organic matter. The aim of our study was to compare the influence of three types of crop rotations (annual, arable crop and crop-pastures rotation) on total soil C and N as well as on several early indicators (mineralizable C and N, soil microbial biomass (C(mic)), particulate organic matter (POM) and dehydrogenase activity), using a long-established experiment in volcanic soil (medial, amorphic, thermic Humic Haploxerands) of the central valley of Chile. The results found that the sensitivity to management changes varied between treatments for microbial biomass C and N, mineralized C and N, and dehydrogenase activity, and that in general these responses were proportionately greater than those found for total C. However, differences in POM-C content were less consistent Our results confirm the value of these labile fractions and this enzyme as sensitive indicators for detecting changes in SOM in the short term both for annual arable crop and crop-pasture rotations. In conclusion, microbial biomass and dehydrogenase activity were the indicators most sensitive to changes in soil-crop management increasing in 1-2 times their sensitivity in comparison with other indicators. However, increases in microbial biomass C in all treatments were proportionally lower than increases in organic C that resulted in low values for the microbial quotient (C(mic) to C(org)) (although there were different between treatments) suggesting that the stabilizing mechanisms acting in volcanic soils can result in proportionally larger amounts of stabilized organic matter that are contained in the total organic C of the soil. POM was not an appropriate indicator of changes in soil organic matter (SOM) for this volcanic soil under distinct crop rotations. The inclusion of pastures (5 years of alfalfa or white clover) in the annual crop rotation promotes the increase of both total and labile fractions of soil organic matter in comparison with annual arable crop rotations, while the inclusion of short rotation pastures (2 years of red clover) had a minimum effect on biological parameters.

AB  - Currently, similar to 65% of extant primate species (ca 512 species) distributed in 91 countries in the Neotropics, mainland Africa, Madagascar, South Asia and Southeast Asia are threatened with extinction and 75% have declining populations as a result of deforestation and habitat loss resulting from increasing global market demands, and land conversion for industrial agriculture, cattle production and natural resource extraction. Other pressures that negatively impact primates are unsustainable bushmeat hunting, the illegal trade of primates as pets and as body parts, expanding road networks in previously isolated areas, zoonotic disease transmission and climate change. Here we examine current and future trends in several socio-economic factors directly or indirectly affecting primates to further our understanding of the interdependent relationship between human well-being, sustainable development, and primate population persistence. We found that between 2001 and 2018 ca 191 Mha of tropical forest (30% canopy cover) were lost as a result of human activities in the five primate range regions. Forty-six percent of this loss was in the Neotropics (Mexico, Central and South America), 30% in Southeast Asia, 21% in mainland Africa, 2% in Madagascar and 1% in South Asia. Countries with the greatest losses (ca 57% of total tree cover loss) were Brazil, Indonesia, DRC, China, and Malaysia. Together these countries harbor almost 50% of all extant primate species. In 2018, the world human population was estimated at ca 8bn people, ca 60% of which were found in primate range countries. Projections to 2050 and to 2100 indicate continued rapid growth of the human populations in these five primate range regions, with Africa surpassing all the other regions and totaling ca 4bn people by the year 2100. Socioeconomic indicators show that, compared to developed nations, most primate range countries are characterized by high levels of poverty and income inequality, low human development, low food security, high levels of corruption and weak governance. Models of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSPs) projected to 2050 and 2100 showed that whereas practices of increasing inequality (SSP4) or unconstrained growth in economic output and energy use (SSP5) are projected to have dire consequences for human well-being and primate survivorship, practices of sustainability-focused growth and equality (SSP1) are expected to have a positive effect on maintaining biodiversity, protecting environments, and improving the human condition. These results stress that improving the well-being, health, and security of the current and future human populations in primate range countries are of paramount importance if we are to move forward with effective policies to protect the world's primate species and promote biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Phylogenies are increasingly incorporated into ecological studies on the basis that evolutionary relatedness broadly correlates with trait similarity. However, phylogenetic approaches have rarely been applied to monitoring long-term community change or guiding management. We analysed a 25-year resampling data set (1976-2001) of 41 tallgrass prairie remnants (Illinois, USA) to test for phylogenetic signals of plant community structure, change, environmental associations, fire management and functional traits. A community phylogeny was constructed using GenBank sequences, and trait data were acquired from the TRY consortium. Phylogenetic measures of alpha and beta diversity were compared with taxonomic and functional measures. From 1976 to 2001, communities became more phylogenetically clustered relative to null model expectations, that is increasingly restricted to subsets of species more closely related than expected by chance. Phylogeny was a sensitive indicator of environmental gradients and fire management. There were strong relationships between phylogeny and traits: key traits were phylogenetically non-random and phylogenetic diversity was a necessary complement to species richness for explaining variation in trait diversity. Phylogeny revealed a shift in community structure over time, with sites having been phylogenetically random in 1976 but becoming differentiated from each other by 2001. In contrast, measures of taxonomic and functional diversity showed differentiation at both time points. Phylogenetic patterns likely reflected changes in species' abundances mediated by the influence of environmental conditions and fire frequency.Synthesis and applications. Phylogenetic analyses can elucidate factors central to sound monitoring and management of plant communities. In this system, phylogeny was not a proxy for other indicators, but provided information complementing taxonomic-based and trait-based approaches for understanding vegetation structure, change and response to fire management. Phylogenetic approaches to ecological analysis are increasingly accessible, but fuller understanding of phylogeny-trait relationships and further development of user-friendly analytical tools are needed for phylogenetics to widely inform restoration and management. In some systems, targeting phylogenetic diversity may be an effective means for restoring functionally diverse plant communities.

AB  - Purpose Life cycle assessment (LCA) is generally considered as a suitable methodology for the evaluation of environmental impacts of processes. However, it requires large amount and often inaccessible process data at early design stages. The present study provides an approach to streamline LCA for a broad set of biomass process chains. The proposed method breaks away from conventional LCA work in that the purpose is to support decision at early stages assuming minimal use of data available and points to most dominant LCA impacts, providing useful feedback to process design. Methods The prediction mechanism employs decision trees, which form "if-then rules" using a set of critical parameters of the process chain with respect to various environmental impacts. The models classify products into three classes, namely having low, medium, and high environmental impact. Data for model development were obtained from early design stages and include descriptors of the molecular structure of the product and process chain-related variables corresponding to chemistry, complexity, and generic process conditions. Twenty-three LCA metrics were selected as target attributes, according to the ReCiPe and the cumulative energy demand (CED) methods. A broad set of process chains is derived from the work of Karka et al. (Int J Life Cycle Assess 22(9):1418-1440, 2017). Results and discussion Results demonstrate that the average classification error for the decision trees ranges between 13.4 and 43.8% for the various LCA metrics and multifunctionality approaches. Allocation approaches present a better classification performance (up to 25% error) compared with the substitution approach for LCA metrics, such as climate change, CED, and human health. For the majority of models, low- and high-output classes are characterized by better predictive performance compared with the medium class. The interpretability of selected decision trees is analyzed in terms of pruning levels and "irrational" branches. The results of the application of the decision tress for recently published case studies show for instance that 8 out of 13 cases were correctly classified for CED. Conclusions The proposed approach provides a first generation of models in the form of computationally inexpensive and easily interpretable decision trees that can be used as pre-screening tools for the environmental assessment of bio-based production ahead of detailed design and conventional LCA approaches. The transparent structure of the decision trees facilitates the identification of critical decision variables providing insights for improvement in terms of process parameters, biomass feedstock, or even targeted product.

AB  - The pollution of the snow cover in the city of Chita (Transbaikalia) with heavy metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, and Cu) is analyzed, and a level of its pollution is compared with similar characteristics in the cities of neighboring regions. The method of inversion voltammetery made possible to find that the content of water-soluble forms of toxic trace elements in the snow is several times greater than in other settlements outside Chita. However, the median values of these values (indicators) are close. Similar results (indicators) were also noted in the ecological and geochemical coefficients, according to which the city of Chita may be attributed to areas with the average level of pollution (Z(C) = 35.66). Trends in the accumulation of mobile forms of heavy metals in the snow cover of other cities were similar features as it follows from low values of the Saet coefficient (Z(C) < 32). The charge coefficient calculated for the liquid fraction of the snow cover was found to be high. Therefore, for safe use, melt water should be diluted with clean water 75.24 times for fishery purposes and 9.4 times for economic and drinking use. Rather low content of heavy metals was found in the dust fraction of the snow cover, but in the industrial zone and the zone of residential many-storeyed buildings concentrations of all trace elements exceeded the maximum permissible values (TLV - threshold limit value). At the same time, similar data for other settlements had still greater values, and the exceedings were tens and hundreds times greater the TLV values (the maximum permissible concentrations). The total pollution index (Z(C) = 72.5) with consideration for the toxicity of chemical elements (Z(CT) = 98.8) shows that the geochemical conditions in Chita is at the average level. For most other cities, values of the Saet coefficient were smaller 32 that corresponds to low and medium pollution levels. According to the level of dust load Chita is characterized by a high level of pollution (P-n >= 10 tons/km(2)), and it means that more than 8000 tons of dust fall to the snow cover. It has been found that by the total load index (Z(P) = 493.5) the dust fraction characterizes urbanized territory of Chita as highly polluted, and in this case cadmium (Cu = 255.47) is the main polluter. Comparison of our results with those of other researchers allows making the conclusion that during the period of the Soviet Union disintegration by the beginning of the XXI century pollution of a snow cover notably reduced.

AB  - In previous studies we related the mechanical properties of spider trichobothria to a generalized mathematical model of the movement of hair and air in filiform medium displacement receivers. We now present experiments aimed at understanding the complex stimulus fields the trichobothrial system is exposed to under natural conditions.
   Using the elicitation of prey capture as an indicator and a tethered humming fly as a stimulus source, it has been shown that the behaviourally effective range of the trichobothrial system in Cupiennius salei Keys. is approximately 20 cm in all horizontal directions. Additionally, the fly still elicits a suprathreshold deflection of trichobothria while distanced 50-70 cm from the spider prosoma.
   To gain insight into the fluid mechanics of the behaviourally effective situation we studied: first, undisturbed flow around the spider in a wind tunnel; second, background flow the spider is exposed to in the field; and third, flow produced by the tethered flying fly.
   1. The motion of air around a complex geometrical structure like a spider is characterized by an uneven distribution of flow velocities over the spider body. With the how approaching from the front, both the mean and r.m.s. values are higher above the legs than above the pro- and opisthosoma; the velocity in the wake behind the spider, however, is markedly decreased. The pattern of these gradients is more complicated when the spider's horizontal orientation is changed with respect to the main flow direction. It introduces asymmetries, for exmple, increased vortical, unsteady flow on the leeward compared with the windward side.
   2. Sitting on its dwelling plant and ambushing prey in its natural habitat, the background air flow around Cupiennius is characterized by low frequencies (< 10 Hz), a narrow frequency spectrum, and low velocities (typically below 0.1 m s(-1) with less than 15% r.m.s. fluctuation).
   3. The distinctive features of a biologically significant air flow (for example, that produced by the humming fly) seem to be a concentrated, i.e. directional unsteady, high speed flow of the order of 1 m s(-1), and a relatively broad frequency spectrum containing frequencies much higher than those of the background flow. For a spider, sitting on a solid substrate (a leaf of a bromeliad, for example), air speed just above the substrate increases and thus provides higher sensitivity when compared to a spider in a orb web, which is largely transparent to the airflow. The flow patterns stimulating the ensemble of the trichobothria contain directional cues in both the undisturbed flow and the flow due to prey cases.

AB  - The article discusses the laws of conservation and change in the development of natural processes. The classification of equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems in nature and society is presented. It is known that if the system is in a state of equilibrium, then internal generalized forces balance all external generalized forces. Therefore, an equilibrium system cannot perform external work. Nonequilibrium systems have the ability to evolve over time, i.e. over time they can do external work. In this case, external generalized forces are not balanced by internal ones. There are different options for changing the value characterizing nonequilibrium systems: 1) the value can stably decrease in time, 2) the value can stably not decrease in time. The combination (mixing) of these invariants leads to oscillatory (wave) changes in nonequilibrium systems.
   Based on the presented data, the evolution of catastrophes of various genesis in the nature-society-man system is considered. The balance of catastrophes of various genesis and the limits of the existence of the system "nature - society - man" are considered. The anthropogenic load affecting nature and society, taking into account the power load of catastrophes, should not exceed 70 kW/km(2). If the anthropogenic load, taking into account the power of catastrophes of various genesis, exceeds 70 kW/km(2), respectively, the energyecological balance of catastrophes is violated and the path of degradation and biosphere instability of nature and society is maintained. Sustainable development conditions are maintained if the anthropogenic load affecting nature and society, taking into account the power load of catastrophes, does not exceed 70 kW/km(2).
   A methodology for assessing disasters of various genesis based on basis indicators of sustainable development is proposed. Based on the presented methodology, it becomes possible to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the consequences of disasters of various genesis in the territory of any region. This makes it possible to establish the degree of influence of the consequences of disasters on the sustainability of the development of the regional environmental social and natural environment, including its economy, ecology, and social environment. Moreover, the sustainability of natural and socio-economic systems is determined by the scale and consequences of disasters, leading either to complete or partial degradation of territories. Sustainable development of territories is determined by the requirement of non-decreasing and continuous in time reduction of the power of disasters.
   Formalization of the consequences of disasters makes it possible to increase the effectiveness of managing sustainable development of territories in the face of the increasing impact of disasters of various genesis.

AB  - Organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts and acritarchs are a vital tool for reconstructing past environmental change, in particular in the Neogene of the high northern latitudes where marine deposits are virtually barren of traditionally used calcareous microfossils. Yet only little is known about the paleoenvironmental value of fossil assemblages that do not have modem analogues, so that reconstructions remain qualitative. Thus, extracting their paleoecological signals still poses a major challenge, in particular on pre-Quatemary timescales. Here we unravel the relationship between species relative abundance and sea surface temperature for extinct dinoflagellate cyst and acritarch taxa from the Neogene of the Iceland Sea using palynological assemblages and organic geochemical (alkenone) data generated from the same set of samples. The reconstructed temperatures for the Miocene to Pliocene sequence of Ocean Drilling Program Site 907 range from 3 to 26 degrees C and our database consists of 68 dinoflagellate cyst and acritarch samples calibrated to alkenone data. The temperature range of five extant species co-occurring in the fossil assemblage agrees well with their present-day distribution providing confidence to inferred temperature ranges for extinct taxa. The 14 extinct dinoflagellate cyst and acritarch species clearly exhibit a temperature dependency in their occurrence throughout the analysed section. The dinoflagellate cyst species Batiacasphaera hirsuta, Labyrinthodinium truncatum, Cerebrocysta irregulare, Cordosphaeridium minimum, Impagidinium elongatum and Operculodinium centroccapum s.s., and the acritarch Lavradosphaera elongatum, which are confined to the Miocene, have highest relative abundances and restricted temperature ranges at the warn end of the reconstructed temperature spectrum. The latter five species disappear when Iceland Sea surface temperatures permanently drop below 20 degrees C, thus indicating a distinct threshold on their occurrence. In contrast, species occurring in both the Miocene and Pliocene interval (Batiacasphaera micropapillata, Habthacysta tectata, Reticulatosphaera actinocoronata, Cymatiosphaera? invaginata) show a broader temperature range and a tolerance towards cooler conditions. Operculodinium? eirilcianum may have a lower limit on its occurrence at around 10 degrees C.
   The calibration of species relative abundance versus reconstructed sea surface temperature provides a quantitative assessment of temperature ranges for extinct Miocene to Pliocene species indicating that temperature is a decisive ecological factor for regional extinctions that may explain the frequently observed asynchronous highest occurrences across different ocean basins. It demonstrates that qualitative assessments of ecological preferences solely based on (paleo) biogeographic distribution should be treated with caution. In addition to enhancing knowledge on marine palynomorph paleoecology, this study ultimately improves the application of palynomorphs for paleoenvironmental reconstructions in the Neogene of the Arctic and subarctic seas, a region essential for understanding past global climate.

AB  - \ Background and Purpose: The paper presents results of comparison of structural elements that have an impact on natural regeneration and viability in non-managed and managed uneven-aged beech and fir forests. Basic structural indicators, structure of tree crowns and regenerative potential were recorded. The vertical stand profile with trees measured on the field was made by application of digitalization. Too many overmature trees, complete absence of young tress in the thinnest diameter classes, as well as shortage of medium thick fir trees are indicators of disturbed natural structure. In addition, there was an excessive crown cover over soil of almost 90% and low quality, old young growth of beech in the shrubbery layer which ultimately resulted in absence of natural regeneration and questionable capacity for sustainability of these stands. Continuous natural regeneration is the fundamental condition for the existence of adequate structure in the preservation of biological diversity of beech and fir forests.
   Materials and Methods: Two permanent experimental plots, 100 by 100 in, were laid out. All trees larger than 7.5 cm in diameter were marked by numbers, and basic data recorded (diameter at breast height, tree heights and stem lengths). A sub-plot, 60 x 60 in in size, was set up in the most homogeneous part of the plot. Horizontal projections of tree-crowns were recorded for all trees on the sub-plot. Crown projections were digitalized, and a vertical stand profile was made. The structure and numbers of young growth, as well as of the shrub layer were recorded on an area of 360 m(2) (three strips, 2 x 60 m) within each subplot.
   Results and discussion: Distribution of the number of trees indicates the absence of fir of the smallest diameter and the absence of medium diameter trees and an excessive number of large-diameter trees in both, non-managed and managed forests. Regarding the smallest diameter beech filled in the lace of fir trees. Digital models of tree crown projections and vertical profiles of the stands indicated very dense canopy of the beech in the second layer which prevented normal natural regeneration of the fir
   Conclusions: The results indicated questionability of satisfactory natural regeneration and survival of stands. The models of tree crown projections enable permanent computer-digital monitoring of changes in stand structure, their simulation, and open new possibilities in the study of stand structure.

AB  - Central Europe's temperate forests are heavily shaped by centuries of human activity. Their natural vegetation, mainly consisting of beech-dominated (Fagus sylvatica) deciduous forests, has been widely replaced by more profitable species grown outside of their natural ranges. This has strongly influenced forest-dwelling communities. Necessary adaptations to changing climatic conditions and the increasing demand for forest ecosystem multifunctionality are reversing these shifts in tree species composition. Integrative approaches that seek to balance production and conservation goals promote mixed forests of beech with spruce (Picea abies), pine (Pinus sylvestris), or oak (Quercus spp.). These mixed forests more closely resemble the natural vegetation and have reduced vulnerability to disturbances compared to coniferous monocultures, but higher commercial value compared to pure beech forests. However, our understanding of how different levels of admixture of commercially relevant tree species to beech forests affect multi-trophic diversity and community composition remains limited. We investigated herbaceous plants, fungi, oribatid mites, springtails, true bugs, beetles, birds and bats in 41 mature forest stands differing in tree species composition. We assessed the effects of admixtures on abundances and alpha and gamma diversity, i.e. the total number of species per forest type, and a measure of multidiversity by comparing reference beech stands with stands containing varying proportions of admixed species. At the plot level, the proportion of admixtures was especially important regarding oak and pine. Increasing shares of oak positively affected birds, true bugs and herbivorous beetles. Increasing shares of pine benefitted herbivorous true bugs and understory plants but negatively affected other true bugs, bats, and litter-decomposing fungi. Spruce admixture resulted in higher saproxylic beetle and bird diversity. At the landscape level, admixture significantly increased gamma diversity in plants, mycorrhizal and litter decomposing fungi and herbivorous and saproxylic beetles. Only springtail gamma diversity decreased in the presence of admixture. Admixture also significantly altered community composition for six out of 13 taxa. Indicator species were found for all forest types, and seven species groups included species significantly associated with pure beech stands. Our results indicate that forestry decisions determine forest biodiversity across trophic levels via tree species composition, combining habitat heterogeneity effects and tree species-specific associations. Even low shares of admixed species affect local abundances and diversity. By displacing some species while benefitting others, admixing also alters community composition. This study provides a basis for estimating how altering tree species composition in Central European forests changes the diversity and composition of forest communities.

AB  - A global dataset of carbon stable isotope (delta C-13) values from yellowfin, bigeye, and albacore tuna muscle tissue (n = 4275) was used to develop a novel tool to infer broad-scale movement and residency patterns of these highly mobile marine predators. This tool was coupled with environmental models and lipid content (C:N ratio) of tuna muscle tissues to examine ocean warming impacts on tuna ecology and bioenergetic condition across Longhurst provinces. Over a 16-year study period (2000-2015), latitudinal gradients in tuna delta C-13 values were consistent, with values decreasing with increasing latitude. Tuna delta C-13 values, reflecting modelled global phytoplankton delta C-13 landscapes ("isoscapes"), were largely related to spatial changes in oxygen concentrations at depth and temporal changes in sea surface temperature. Observed tuna isoscapes (delta C-13(LScorr)), corrected for lipid content and the Suess effect (oceanic changes in CO2 over time), were subtracted from model-predicted baseline isoscapes (Delta C-13(tuna-phyto)) to infer spatial movement and residency patterns of the different tuna species. Stable isotope niche width was calculated for each Longhurst province using Delta C-13(tuna-phyto) and baseline-corrected nitrogen isotope (delta N-15(tuna-phyto)) values to further quantify isotopic variability as evidence of movements across isoscapes. A high degree of movement-defined as the deviation from the expected range of Delta C-13(tuna-phyto) values- was evident in three Longhurst provinces: Guinea current coast, Pacific equatorial divergence, and the North Pacific equatorial counter current. The highest level of population dispersal (variability in Delta C-13(tuna-phyto) values) was observed in Longhurst provinces within the western and central Pacific Oceans and in the Guinea current coast. While lipid content was low in yellowfin and bigeye, high and variable lipid stores in albacore muscle were consistent with seasonal movements between productive foraging and oligotrophic spawning habitats. Our ability to characterize tuna movement patterns without ambiguity remains challenged by uncertainty in trophic discrimination factors and ecological (e.g. diet variability) processes. However, this study illustrates that model-corrected delta C-13 values are a valuable, relatively cost-effective tool for identifying potential areas of mixing across management zones, particularly when electronic tagging studies are limited or absent. Stable isotope analyses of tuna tissues can therefore be an additional tool for guiding spatial stock assessments on top predator movement, dispersal patterns, and how they may be altered under a changing climate.

AB  - A better understanding the effects of urbanization on vegetation is vital to promoting the sustainable development of cities in China, which has also experienced the world's most remarkable urbanization during the past decades. This paper used satellite-derived night light, vegetation index, and socio-economic data to analyze spatio-temporal patterns of vegetation changes and evaluate the influence of urbanization on vegetation cover in 46 Chinese metropolises over the last four decades. To examine the effects of urbanization on vegetation and its valid distance, we proposed a new method of comparing three indicators, namely, annual average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), long-term trend of NDVI change and the proportion of pixels characterized by significant change in NDVI between built-up areas and its multiple buffer zones. The results showed that the effects of urbanization on vegetation have obvious spatial differences. Urbanization generally resulted in the decrease of vegetation coverage in built-up areas for most of China's central and eastern metropolises, while in Western China, usually restricted by natural conditions, the urbanization usually improved vegetation coverage. The rates of increase in NDVI were significant lower than that of the buffer zones for most cities in central and eastern China. Urbanized areas of most cities located in central and eastern China had a higher percent of vegetation pixels, representing degradation than that in the buffer zones. The opposite was true for pixels representing vegetation restoration. The changes of NDVI in the cities in Western China were basically contrary to those in central and eastern China. The impacts of urbanization on vegetation are stage-specific. With the continuous progress of urbanization level, the adverse effect of urbanization on vegetation were gradually diminished or even disappeared. Cities with higher nighttime light levels appeared to have less vegetation coverage in the early years, and negative correlations between mean NDVI and the mean digital number value have become weak in more recent years. The changes in NDVI in urbanized areas of most cities significantly followed a 'U' shape. This phenomenon may further suggest that positive effects of urbanization become more obvious over time during advanced urbanization. The spatial scope of the impacts of urbanization on vegetation was beyond the urban built-up areas, and the effect intensity appeared to attenuate as the buffer distance became further away from the urbanized area. The valid distance of impacts of urbanization on vegetation is generally about 30-40 km.

AB  - Most of the fish stocks in the world, including European fish stocks, are threatened by overfishing and/or degraded environmental conditions. Although the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the main policy instrument managing fish stocks in Europe, there is continued concern as to whether commercial fish stocks will achieve Good Environmental Status (GEnS) in 2020 in accordance with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). In this context, the evaluation of the status of fish stocks in the subareas of FAO fishing area 27 was carried out using mean trophic levels (MTL) in fish landings and spawning stock biomass (SSB). Comparisons were made before and after 2008 to establish whether the trend is positive or negative. The main data sources for landings and SSB were the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) advisory reports. MTLs in landing and SSB were determined for each subarea and the subareas were categorized into four groups, according to MTLs after 2008. The first group (subareas I + II, V) had higher MTL in landings and higher MTL in SSB after 2008. Therefore, fisheries in these subareas appear sustainable. The second group was subareas VIII + IX, for which the fish stocks have higher MTL in landings but low MTL in SSB, indicating that SSB was being overfished. The third was subarea (VI), where fish stocks have lower MTL in landings than those in SSB after 2008, which may indicate that fish stocks are recovering. Fish stocks in the fourth group (subareas III, IV and VII) had low MIL in landings and the MTL in SSB was lower than that of landings before 2008. This may be due to heavy fishing. In addition, we estimated the harvest rate (HR) of the fish stocks before and after 2008. The results showed that most of the fish stocks have lower HR after 2008, indicating that the status has improved, perhaps due to improvements in the implementation of CFP. However, some fish stocks showed high HR even after 2008, so that new management options are still needed. Other factors such as eutrophication, seafloor disturbances, marine pollution, invasive species etc., influence SSB ecosystem health options and should also be incorporated in the management criteria. Most of these environmental pressures are of high priority in the MSFD, and therefore the findings of this study will be useful for both CFP and MSFD. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The definition of restoration targets and the evaluation of restoration success require a comprehensive, ecosystem-based analysis of all successional pathways, which proceed along gradients of land use intensification and continue after implementation of restoration measures. In the presented study, such analysis was applied to fen ecosystems. Study areas were river valleys and eutrophic lakes in The Netherlands and in Schleswig-Holstein, the northernmost state of Germany. At these sites high fen degradation has taken place and restoration strategies such as "recovery of peat-forming systems" and "development of species-rich fen grasslands" have recently been pursued. Based on an indirect successional analysis, we derived characteristic shifts of abiotic (hydrodynamics, soil parameter) and biotic (species composition, phytomass production) ecosystem traits relative to increasing land use intensity. Species richness and nature conservation value (NCV) initially increased and afterwards decreased during the process of land use intensification. This floristic change was accompanied by an initial decrease and subsequent increase in system productivity. Indicators for P-availability showed the same trend and there was evidence that nutrient limitation changed initially from N- (tall sedge reeds) to P- or P/N (co)-limitation (small sedge reeds) and afterwards again to N-limitation (wet and mesic grasslands). The successional analysis documented the abiotic requirements of vegetation types and their characteristic species, and thus, allowed for the use of these ecosystem traits as indicators to evaluate the success of specific restoration targets. For example, the decrease of Scheuchzerio-Caricetea species could be related more directly to reduced light availability than to an increase of the groundwater tables. Furthermore, we calculated threshold values of these traits for the occurrence of target species. For instance, a sustainable establishment of light-demanding mesotrophic species can only be expected if the standing crop value is less than 400 g m(-2). In a further step, we estimated the restoration success in selected study areas by applying the findings of the successional analysis. Results showed that rewetting measures have to be carried out with caution if both restoration strategies are aspired in one specific area. Moreover, restoration success of both strategies is limited in initially highly degraded areas. Sources for target species are often missing and abiotic conditions such as nutrient levels and flooding periods are often inappropriate. Consequently, expectations for restoration success should be adapted to the realistic development potential of the individual system and a cost-benefit analysis has to be carried out to avoid unnecessary management costs.

AB  - Soil temporarily excluded from agricultural production is exposed to several factors which deteriorate its chemical, physical and biological properties. To preserve the productive potential of uncropped soil, it is recommended that the soil surface be turfed. In the spring of 1996, a field experiment was set up in Knopin (municipality Dobre Miasto, the Province of Warmia and Mazury), where the effect of the type of a plant cover or its lack (bare fallow) on the physical and chemical characteristics of soil was investigated. One of the goals of the study reported below, which was conducted between 2000 and 2007, was to determine how the way uncropped farmland was maintained affected the content of nitrogen in soil. The experiment comprised five treatments: bare fallow, traditional fallow, a fallow field cropped with eastern galega (Galega orientalis Lam), or a mixture of eastern galega (Galega orientalis Lam.) and smooth brome (Bromus inermis), and finally a fallow field seeded with smooth brome (Bromus inermis). The set-aside land was only sampled for soil, while the biomass which grew on it every year was left in the field. Soil for analyses of physical and chemical characteristics was sampled from the 0-25 cm topmost layer, four times a year (April, July, September and November). During the research, there was only one agritechnical treatment performed, such as the mechanical weeding of the bare fallow field. The best way to maintain land excluded from agricultural production for many years proved to be by seeding it with eastern galega or its mixture with smooth brome. A far less beneficial solution was to grow smooth brome alone. When there was no grass on a field to synthetise free nitrogen, the content of nitrogen mineral forms in soil decreased. However, the depeletion of nitrogen from turfed soil was distinctly lower than from the soil kept as a bare fallow. Consistent eradication of weeds most probably ensured much better conditions for organic matter mineralisation. Hence, the concentration of nitrates in soil under a bare fallow field was the highest. The absence of a plant cover, as many authors maintain, exclude the possibility of the uptake of mineral nitrogen forms, which is conducive to their leaching into the deeper layers of a soil profile, a consequence which mostly affects nitrates. The study reported underneath supports this opinion. In the light of our results we can conclude that farmers should be discouraged from keeping set-aside land as a bare fallow.

AB  - Microbial parameters have been used to monitor changes in the topsoil under different land covers. Soils from five land cover systems common in northern Iran, including virgin natural forest, Alnus subcordata C.A.M. plantation, Quercus castaneifolia C. A. Mey plantation, Cupressus sempervirens var. horizontalis plantation and degraded natural forest were used to assess the effects of land cover changes on soil. We tested the following hypotheses: (i) deforestation would markedly influence topsoil C, N and P microbial ratios which make it distinct from the natural forest and plantations in the long-term, (ii) virgin natural forest and the establishment of plantations promote soil enzyme activities and the fractions of particulate organic matter (POC and PON) and dissolved organic matter (DOC and DON), 30 years after planting. Sixteen samples per land cover were taken from top 15 cm soil and characterized with respect to pH, organic C, total N, N mineralization, NH4+, NO3-, available P, fine root biomass, enzymes activities (urease, acid phosphomonoesterase, arylsulfatase and invertase), basal respiration (BR), substrate inducted respiration (SIR), microbial biomass-C,-N and-P (MBC, MBN and MBP), POC, PON, DOC and DON. There were no significant differences in BR/MBC, MBC/Corg, BR/SIR and MBC/MBN microbial indices among the plantations, virgin and degraded natural forests. The values of soil MBC/ MBP were increased, more than one and half-fold, following deforestation (12.82) compared to virgin natural forest (8.53) site. The natural forest and establishment of plantations reduced the ratio of MBN/MBP, while the greater amount (1.14) was observed under degraded natural forest. With replacement in the type of tree species from Carpinus betulus and Parrotia persica in the natural forest to Quercus castaneifolia plantation, almost 30 years after planting, POC/PON increased significantly in the topsoil (13.29), about two-three fold, compared to virgin (7.13) and deforested (3.96) natural forests. The soil DOC/DON ratio varied significantly and it increased by about one and half-fold, following the growth of Quercus castaneifolia (2.87) and Cupressus sempervirens (2.68) trees compared to the other ecosystems. Based on PCA, virgin natural forest and Alnus subcordata plantation presented a good condition of soil fertility, more microbial and enzyme activities with a low ratio of microbial indicators. In general, microbial/biochemical indicators showed perceptible deterioration in the topsoil due to deforestation. As a conclusion, soil enzyme activity, MBC/MBP, MBN/MBP, POC/PON and DOC/DON are robust and sensitive indicators that can be used to measure long-term variations in the topsoil due to changed land cover.

AB  - There is a need to assess social impacts of products along the full life cycle, not only to be able to address the "social dimension" in sustainability, but also for potentially improving the circumstances of affected stakeholders. This paper presents a case study for a social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) based on the recently published "Guidelines for Social Life Cycle Assessment of Products" developed by the United Nations Environment Programme/Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (UNEP/SETAC) working group. General aim is to "try out" the proposed method. The case study itself compares the impacts of rose production in Ecuador with the Netherlands. Furthermore, the objective is to identify differences and similarities in environmental and social life cycle modelling and both social and environmental hot spots in each of the life cycles.
   The study considers the production of rose blossoms and the cutting and packaging process in two fictitious companies in Ecuador and the Netherlands. Both rose bouquets are delivered to the European market and auctioned in Aalsmeer, the Netherlands. The social assessment is based on the UNEP/SETAC guidelines for S-LCA. Data are mainly obtained from governmental and non-governmental organisations. For the calculation of the environmental burden, a screening-type LCA is conducted, including midpoint impact assessment.
   This paper asserts that rose production in Ecuador is associated with many negative social effects, e.g. child labour, unfair salary, or bad impairment to health. The rose production in the Netherlands has no obvious negative social impacts but rather ecological consequences. Responsible for this is the high-energy consumption of the greenhouses.
   Application of the UNEP/SETAC guidelines in case studies can be encouraged based on results of this case study. The consideration of different stakeholder groups with corresponding, very diverse themes allows a comprehensive analysis of the actual conditions. However, finding suitable indicators to measure the status of the subcategories may be challenging. Moreover, the case study shows that results can be completely different for the environmental and for the social dimension, so that it often will be needed to perform both assessments if a complete picture is required.
   It will be interesting to apply the UNEP/SETAC approach of S-LCA to other products; products with a more complex life cycle will be a special challenge. As with any new method, getting experience on data collection and evaluation, building a data stock, integrating the method in software, and finding ways for effective communication of results are important steps until integrating S-LCA in routine, recognized decision support.

AB  - The study was performed by part of a multidisciplinary team to assess the soil-plant compound in a dairy unit with silvopastoral system, located in the Havana province, in the western part of the country. It provides information about the soils and the grassland in respect to their integral characterization of chemical (content of N, P, Ca, Mg, and OM), physical (granulometry composition and microstructure, apparent density, field capacity, specific weight, total porosity per calculation, resistance to penetration, coefficient of dispersion) and biologic (basal respiration (BR)of the soil and induced by substrates, total number of individuals, population of acari, collembolans and other insects, number of individuals and biomass of the macrofauna) indicators. The integral study of the indicators permitted to determine with higher accuracy the degree of stability of the soil, as well as the influence of the grassland condition and the predominant type of soil. It was determined that there is a trend to the physical degradation of the soil The values of apparent density were low (1.11 g/cm(3)) and there was trend to dispersion, which leads to the deterioration of the structural stability of the soil In general terms, the chemical composition of the soil had acceptable levels Ca, Mg and P were the most variable elements. The studies of the soil biology indicated that there are no signs of microbiological degradation They are characterized by having biologically assimilable nitrogen sources and potentially active microfauna that responds to the addition of external sources of C, N, and P. Populations of meso and macrofauna were determined. The population of other insects were the most outstanding group of the mesofauna having the lowest number of acari and collembolans, although it was not possible to predict a population dynamics in these groups. In the macrofauna, among the main individuals, earth worms, coleopteran larvae and ants were noteworthy. As to the plant component, it was evidenced that natural pastures occupied 66 % of the species and the leaf litter accumulation did not surpass 25 g DM/m(2). Leucaena was not available for the animals and the pasture availability was of approximately 1.2 t DM/m(2). In general, the seasonal changes were the factor influencing the most the variation of underground phytomass. The evaluation of the degree of soil stability and the grassland productivity showed that in this system the low accumulation of leaf litter from the grassland and the low levels of infiltration were the most limiting factors. It is concluded that the silvopastoral system in this dairy unit contributed positively to the evaluation of some soil indicators. However, the absence of improved basic pasture affected negatively the soil stability.

AB  - Sustainable intensification (SI) has been regarded as the basis for environmentally sound and equitable agricultural development. Field based assessment of technologies needs to move beyond production and economic performance to include environment, social and human condition. In this study we systematically consider all five domains of SI based on participatory action research (PAR) initiated in 2012 at three Central Malawi sites that varied in agroecology from low to high potential. Fifteen SI indicators were assessed for four technologies: sole maize (Zea mays L) with 0 and recommended fertilization (69 kg N ha(-1) and 9 kg P ha(-1)), pigeonpea (Cajanus Cajun (L.) Millsp.)-maize intercrop (half rate fertilizer), and doubled up legume rotation (DLR, a pigeonpea-groundnut intercrop) sequenced with maize at half rate fertilizer in that phase. Through radar charts SI performance and tradeoffs were visualized, and causal loop analysis allowed identification of research gaps. SI indicator assessments included crop performance from on-farm trials, profitability, modeled probability of food sufficiency, risk of crop failure and ratings of technologies by women farmers who were engaged in evaluation of technologies through participatory research. The PAR included six mother trials, 236 baby trial farmers and a survey that was carried out with 324 farmers (baby trial farmers plus control farmers) to document socioeconomic factors and management practices on focal fields. Replicated mother trials further provided the basis for simulation modeling (APSIM) of weather-associated crop failure risk and slow processes such as soil carbon (C) accrual. Radar charts were used to visualize SI performance of the technologies. Environmental performance of the two pigeonpea-diversified technologies was variable, but generally high compared with sole maize systems, due to gains in vegetative biomass, duration of cover and biological nitrogen (N) fixation. Maize production and economic assessment varied by site, and with steeper tradeoffs for legume diversification in the mesic site, less so in the marginal site. The domains of social and human capacity building were superior for legume integration, notably in terms of diverse diet, food security and farmer preferences (notably, female farmers generally favored legume crops). Performance varied by site with legume systems most beneficial at the most marginal site, including less risk of crop failure than unfertilized maize. Causal loop analyses identified regulators of SI that require further attention, notably: crop-livestock conflicts and opportunities, male-female control of legume crop production, and residue management. Overall, the SI indicators framework provided a systematic means to consider tradeoffs and opportunities associated with novel crop combinations and management practices.

AB  - UNESCO has been required by its Member States to assist in implementing the recommendations of the World Conference on Science, held in Budapest in June 1999. In particular, UNESCO should identify national strategies for biodiversity protection in biosphere reserves and similarly managed areas, with special emphasis on coastal areas, small islands and mangroves, South-South technology transfer and intensive training for the management of renewable natural resources in selected case studies throughout specific developing countries. With generous support from the Government of Japan. UNESCO is now implementing the ASPACO project from January 2001 to December 2003, in close collaboration with MAB-Japan, ISME and the UNU. The project emphasises the role of biosphere reserves as catalysts for both conservation and development. The complementary roles of UNESCO, ISME and UNU in scientific issues of nature preservation and sustainable use of natural resources are eminent for action in (1) integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas, including economic zones, and the preservation of natural and cultural heritage via "ethical tourism"; (2) mangrove forest environmental protection, (3) sustainable use and conservation of renewable natural resources under national jurisdiction; and (4) strengthening international, including regional, co-operation and co-ordination. This project will pay particular attention to those countries having or planning biosphere reserves and to those countries whose governments have strong relations with the MAB of UNESCO. Training, capacity building and increase of local capabilities for research and management of sustainable use of renewable natural resources are key elements of the project. In particular, through the involvement of ISME, the project will promote exchange of information, research results and scientists with respect to preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. It will help to disseminate knowledge of comparative research through publications and/or network databases. Within the framework of action for poverty eradication, the project will try to identify how to improve living conditions for the inhabitants of concerned areas as a basic requirement for human security, with special attention to food and fodder production and the rational use of biodiversity for the benefit of local populations. Capacity building for the development of biosphere reserves will be through North-South exchanges; exchange of experience by training of biosphere reserve managers will be through South-South exchanges. This includes strengthening of existing capacities and increase of local capacity for carrying out management, natural resources assessment, research and training, with special emphasis on the education of young women. Project activities will be located in selected countries of the Pacific region, including small islands of the Pacific and the West Coast of Latin America.

AB  - Bacterial biomass and activity were investigated in deep waters at two sites in the eastern Atlantic, of similar depth (4560-4800 m), but varying in their nutritional status. The Northern (N) site was eutrophic and subject to a strong seasonal input of surface derived organic matter (phytodetritus) to the sediment. The Southern (S) site was oligotrophic. Deep water at this site does not appear to receive any strong seasonal input. Bacterial numbers in the deep water column at the N site showed no significant seasonal variation but were greater than those at the S site. Deep water bacteria were typically small and free-living. From biovolume determinations, if was estimated that mean concentrations of bacterial organic carbon at depths greater than 500 m were 0.12 (0.03-0.29) mu g Cl-1 and 0.02 (0.01-0.04) mu g Cl-1 at the N and S sites, respectively. Rates of thymidine and leucine incorporation were used as indicators of bacterial activity. Bacterial communities in water in contact with the sediment (SCW; sediment contact water) at both sites (but especially at the S site) were strongly barophilic at in situ temperatures (2.5-4.1 degrees C). The barophilic response of thymidine incorporation was enhanced when SCW samples from the N site were incubated at 11.5 degrees C. It is proposed that this result indicated an elevating effect of pressure on cardinal temperatures and that the SCW community was obligately psychrophilic when unpressurised. Comparison of cell-specific incorporation rates determined under in situ conditions showed bacteria in the SCW to have levels of activity comparable with bacteria from a depth of 150 m. Thymidine incorporation rates were highest in SCW samples taken at the N site in May 1988 and September 1989. Thymidine incorporation by SCW samples taken immediately before (10 April 1994) the main spring-bloom-associated deposition of phytodetritus was significantly lower and comparable with that determined for the oligotrophic S site. The attributes exhibited by the SCW community appeared to be highly localised. We conclude that the bacterial communities of the SCW are active and adapted to their environment. Activity is influenced by the trophic nature of the site and may show temporal changes linked with episodic food supply. We postulate that the existence of such communities is linked to the role of the sediment-water interface as the initial site of deposition of sea-surface derived labile organic material.

AB  - Among the many publications on the environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of transport, there are only a few examples of works dedicated to means of internal transport. For this reason, it was decided to gather energy-oriented inventory data and to assess the environmental impact related to the operation of selected forklift trucks, as the most commonly used means of internal transport. This paper presents the main assumptions and the results in relation to the four phases of LCA: the goal and scope definition, the life cycle inventory, the life cycle impact assessment results, and the interpretation.
   Ten forklifts with different engines were selected in order to carry out the life cycle assessment study. The research was based on the results of measuring the operating fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions, conducted using the SEMTECH-DS mobile device from the PEMS group of devices. In order to make the measurements under a circumstance close to the real conditions of forklift exploitation, it was decided to slightly modify the operating cycle proposed in VDI 2198. The environmental impact of the fuel/electricity usage and exhaust gas emissions was assessed using the ISO 14040x guidelines and the IMPACT 2002+ method.
   The study showed that using an electric forklift to transport 1 t of payload over a distance of 1 km has a significantly smaller environmental impact than using one of the selected forklifts powered by an internal combustion engine. Using forklifts powered by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) engines leads to a significantly higher environmental impact whilst the use of vehicles with diesel engines has an impact at a level several times lower. In a case of drives without load, where functional unit was defined as covering 1-km distance with no vehicle load, a lower impact for the electric vehicles was also obtained. The analysis includes the influences of the upstream processes of fuel and electrical energy production.
   Even when Poland's production scenario (based almost entirely on fossil fuels) is taken into consideration, the electric forklifts still show a clear advantage. It should be expected that, if the technological mix of electrical energy production for countries with a higher share of renewable or nuclear energy were to be taken into account, the environmental indicators for electric vehicles would be even lower. It is worth noting that only the energy aspects of forklift operation were analysed. Further studies aiming to collect inventory data relating to other exploitation aspects, as well as the production and utilization of the same vehicles, are planned as a continuation of this research.

AB  - Biomonitoring by means of the supersensitive cultivar Nicotiana tabacum Bel-W3 is frequently used to obtain information on ozone effects on plants and estimates of ozone exposure. However, most of biomonitoring surveys do not account for other environmental variables (predictors in a statistical model) and their inherent multicollinearity with ozone. We tested the relative role of different predictors (fixed: time and site; random: ozone, temperature and humidity) on height growth and on the development of visible foliar symptoms of N. tabacurn Bel-W3 plants. To do this, we investigated a relatively small area (256 km(2)), used a random design at every stage of the survey, controlled watering and protected plants from direct solar radiation and wind. QA/QC procedures were adopted at every stage of the investigation. Linear correlation shows that Leaf Injury Index (LII) and height increment (HI.) positively related to ozone concentration, elevation and temperature, and negatively to relative humidity. All the predictors correlate to each other. However, relationships between response and ozone vary with the site and the monitoring week. The effect of the random factor "ozone" in combination with fixed factors "site" and "time" on the response variables was therefore formally investigated using the ANCOVA model. Besides ozone, the interactions "ozone x site" and "ozone x time" resulted always significant (0.001 < P < 0.05). While the factor "time" emphasize the inherent development of injury and growth through time, the interaction "ozone x site" pointed out the importance of local conditions. When watering, solar radiation, wind and plant characteristics were controlled, the remaining site-specific covariates of interest were temperature (T) and humidity (RH). When T and RH were accounted for by means of partial correlation analysis, no significant relationship was found between ozone and LII. On the other side, 03 and RH resulted significant for both absolute and relative height increment. In short, LII seemed to be not solely dependent on ozone, T and RH, but showed to integrate their combined effect. On the other side, H.I. seemed to be favoured by high RH and T, and depressed by high ozone. Based on the above results, we recommend caution when handling bioindicator data: if the purpose is to infer ozone concentrations by leaf injury data, results may be affected by a serious bias, as the frequently reported correlations may be partly an artefact due to co-variation between predictors.

AB  - The composition of suprabenthic crustacean assemblages, their diversity, production (P) and production/biomass (P/B) ratios, were analyzed at species level along two transects situated to the north (N) and south (S) of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean) at depths between 134 m and 760 m, based on a ca. bi-monthly sampling performed between August 2003 and June 2004. Differences with depth and season in assemblage composition and diversity were analyzed as a function of the contrasting environmental features (e.g. water mass dynamics) of the two areas. We identified 187 species (18 decapods. 5 euphausiids, 16 mysids, 76 gammaridean amphipods, 13 hyperiids, 1 caprellid, 21 isopods and 37 cumaceans). Substantial mesoscale variability in the deep-sea suprabenthic assemblages coupled with diversity trends between the N and S transects were found. Seasonality was the most important gradient influencing the dynamics of suprabenthos over the upper (350 m) and middle (650-750 m) slope in the N area. Conversely, the S area appeared to be more stable temporally with depth as the main gradient inducing assemblage differences. Different depth-related patterns were observed both for diversity and P/B. To the north diversity was very low at the shelf-break, increasing on the upper-slope (H'>3.00) and then decreasing again on the middle-slope. To the south diversity increased smoothly downward, reaching the highest values on the middle-slope. Regarding productivity, P/B was highest at intermediate depths to the north (over ca. 450-500 m), while to the south highest P/Bs were found deeper (over ca. 600-650 m). The higher P/B at intermediate depths found along N are likely due to higher % of organic matter (OM) in sediments, a product of oceanographic frontal systems. In particular, P/B was higher along N among omnivores and detritus feeders (e.g. Andaniexis mimonectes. Lepechinella manco and combined cumaceans), coupled to enriched OM in sediments, while along S mesoplanktonic carnivores (Rhachotropis spp.) had higher P/Bs. We conclude that on the north slope the influence of frontal systems and more active flow dynamics of different water masses (WIW and LIW) increases natural disturbance in the area, increasing productivity and diversity of suprabenthic peracarids in the Benthic Boundary Layer. Also, species showed a displacement of their average distributions (their Centres of Gravity, CoG) to shallower depths along N. which is another indicator of more favorable habitat conditions for suprabenthos in the 400-500 m range at N.

AB  - The relationship between the river channel parameters - morphological, hydraulic and substrate - and the composition and distribution of macrozoobenthos communities was studied on the 75 m channel reach of the stream (Teplicka brook, Strazovske vrchy Mts., Slovakia) located at the altitude of 256 m; with average width 4 m, depth 0.25m, average current velocity 0.32 m s(-1) and discharge in sampling season 0.2 m(3)s(-1). Following the River Morphology Hierarchical Classification (RMHC), the fluvial geomorphological research was realised on the selected channel reach - taxon defined in accordance to RMHC. The plane bed and a riffle-pool channel types have been identified in the investigated channel reach.
   At the habitat level morphological and hydraulic features represent an alternative approach of habitat assessment in order to gain representative macroinvertebrate sample in stream assessment according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The morphological units defined in terms of Froude (Fr) and Reynolds (Re) numbers differed in the extent of the shear stress and turbulence of the water environment. Also Fr and Re values rose in the row of flow types: standing water (SW) - scarcely perceptible flow (SP), smooth flow (S) - rippled (R) - unbroken standing waves (USW) - broken standing waves (BSW) - chute (CH). Different taxa and feeding groups preferred different morphological units and flow types. In terms of morphological units, runs, bars, edge-waters and scours were generally inhabited by the lowest abundance of all invertebrate groups; only Gastropoda reached the higher abundance in these habitats. Glides, pools and backwaters were inhabited by somewhat higher numbers of invertebrates, Oligochaeta and Bivalvia dominated here. Units with organic substrate (moss on boulder clusters and roots) together with rapids and riffles were characterised by high abundance mainly of Gammaridae and Simuliidae.
   Regarding flow types, standing water separated from others by its low abundances of taxa group but Gastropoda and Bivalvia. SP, S and R types were preferred by Oligochaeta and Chironomidae, while Gammaridae and Simuliidae dominated in standing waves (USVV, BSW) and chutes. Also distribution of feeding groups followed the gradient of local environmental conditions. Significant correlations of feeding groups and flow types, current velocity, Fr, Re and depth were observed. Organic substrates played an important role in distribution and abundance of the macrozoobenthos. Overall abundance and also abundance of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera was significantly higher in the moss or roots compared to other habitats.. Benthos communities of these habitats showed similarities with habitats in the highly turbulent environment (riffles, rapids).

AB  - In the Madang Lagoon, on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea (PNG), distinct groups of foraminifera, defined by numerical Q-mode cluster analysis of foraminiferal species occurrences, occupy four major environments and sedimentary regimes, generally aligned parallel to the coast: (1) the harbor and bay inlets, which have large fresh-water runoff and organic detrital inputs; (2) the fringing reefs along the west side of the lagoon which are influenced by coastal factors such as overhanging mangroves or fresh-water runoff; (3) the central lagoon floor which is over 50 m deep and covered with fine sand and patch reefs rising from it; and (4) the reef barrier with adjacent live coral-covered fore-reef slope and generally sandy back-reef slope. The four clusters are also mirrored in both species richness and Fisher alpha diversity analysis. Cluster 4 includes 79 species of large, thick-shelled miliolids, robust agglutinated species, calcarinids, and amphisteginids (Fisher alpha greater than or equal to20) that occur on the coral-rich barrier reef and back-reef. Cluster 3 has 50 species (Fisher alpha=8-20) and occupies the central lagoon floor. Cluster 2 has 25 or fewer species (Fisher alpha=2-6) and occurs on the shallow fringing reefs. Cluster 1 is the least diverse (less than or equal to7 species, Fisher alpha less than or equal to2) and occurs in the harbors and bays in the mouths of larger rivers and streams. The larger, endosymbiont-bearing foraminifera (alveolinellids, soritids, amphisteginids, nummulitids, and calcarinids) generally live on the back- and fore-reef slopes and in the lagoon, avoid the organic-rich coastal and harbor habitats, and preferentially dwell in well-lit environments to the bottom of the lagoon. The river mouths and bays are unusual for reef systems because of their high organic content, which creates low-oxygen and nutrient-rich conditions. Here the foraminiferal fauna is dominated by only a few and, for the most part, particularly thin-shelled and highly fragile species. Each faunal group contains a number of numerically abundant indicator species that do not occur in other faunal clusters. This implies low horizontal transport rates within the reef and lagoon complex and signifies that faunal mixing among the cluster groups is limited. Foraminiferal death assemblages may thus be autochthonous and retain information regarding the original community structure. They may also preserve environmental information useful in paleoecological studies and they are good ecological indicators of reef and lagoon habitats.

AB  - Many invasion theories invoke resource competition as the primary mechanism of invader advantage. These include Darwin's naturalization hypothesis (DNH), which treats phylogenetic similarity as a proxy for niche overlap and competitive intensity, and the evolutionary imbalance hypothesis (EIH), which suggests the phylogenetic diversity (PD) of an introduced species' native range is an indicator of its competitive ability.
   Few tests of invasion theory, however, consider habitat characteristics associated with the role of competition in community assembly. In particular, plant invasions of habitats characterized by high environmental stress and disturbance levels should rarely be driven by competition. This suggests tests of EIH and DNH are habitat dependent, and their relative importance in invasiveness models should be predictable based on habitat qualities related to competitive intensity.
   Using a dataset of plant invasions in New Zealand (NZ) natural areas that distinguishes naturalized species according to both habitat type and community impact, we evaluated the predictive ability of factors related to EIH, DNH and covariates including year of introduction, introduction mode and life history attributes, in driving species invasiveness. We hypothesized that EIH and DNH would be more important predictors of invasiveness in forested habitats and decline in importance as communities shifted towards those more dominated by herbaceous species and/or more sparsely vegetated.
   We found mixed support for the role of competition linked to DNH and EIH as a driver of invasions in relation to habitat type. Native range PD was among the best predictors of invasiveness in forests, and declined in importance in more disturbed habitats, supporting EIH. In contrast, phylogenetic nearest neighbour distance (PNND) of invaders to native communities was more important in disturbed environments, suggesting competition does not drive DNH. Further, for most habitats and across all of NZ, neither PD nor PNND was as important as year of introduction or life history and growth form attributes in predicting invasiveness.
   Synthesis. Although both native range PD and PNND predict the invasiveness of naturalized plants in NZ, the results of our habitat-specific models indicate that only PD is consistent with an invasion mechanism based on competitive ability. Effects of PNND were greatest in grasslands that have been extensively modified by fire and grazing, suggesting they are more likely driven by invader pre-adaptation to modified habitat conditions. Due to the importance of matching species' traits to environmental context, invasiveness risk assessments perform better when applied to invaders of particular habitats.

AB  - The identification of the livestock production systems (LPS) existing in a given area constitutes the first step to manage farms sustainably, since it improves the knowledge of its operation and subsequently allows for establishing the appropriate managerial strategies for each LPS. It is of great interest, as LPS are key for agro-ecosystem conservation and rural population in many areas. The present study was conducted in light of the importance of the beef cattle sector for one of the oldest and most heavily protected agroforestry systems ('dehesa', SW Spain and Portugal). A total of 63 beef cattle farms (including organic and conventional ones) were analysed from the structural and technical-economic points of view, aiming to: (i) improve the knowledge of the dehesa beef cattle sector; (ii) define specific managerial strategies tailored to each typology (LPS) in order to increase their sustainability as well as that of the dehesa ecosystem; (iii) clarify whether there is a relationship between the typologies obtained on the basis of technical-economic indicators and a previous classification of the farms based on their condition of being organic, and their productive and market orientation. For this purpose, the analysis paid special attention to the level of intensification, productive orientation (presence of a calf-finishing period) and self-reliance (related to their dependence on subsidies). The methodology yielded the following four typologies: (i) extensive farms selling at weaning with low productivity; (ii) extensive farms with low productivity and high dependence on subsidies; (iii) calf-finishing farms with average stocking rates and high profitability; (iv) irrigated farms with low presence of livestock, and high fixed capital and economic fluxes. In general terms, management and structure of dehesa beef cattle farms positioned them in a good place regarding CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) trends (mainly in terms of environmental protection). However, the farms studied must improve several aspects. Firstly, they need to increase their degree of self-reliance (reducing their dependence on external workforce and subsidies). Secondly, their productivity and economic performance must also be increased. The latter could be achieved by adding value to the products being sold, i.e. finishing more calves, developing new products and/or participating in marketing. Generally speaking, a close relationship between farm typologies and the previously established groups of farms (Conventional, Organic 1 and Organic 2) has not been observed. This was due to the similarities between organic and conventional farms in the context of the dehesas with regard to indicators used in the present study.

TI  - The thin green line: sustainable bioenergy feedstocks or invaders in waiting
T2  - NEOBIOTA
LA  - English
AB  - Numerous fast growing and highly competitive exotic crops are being selected for production of renewable bioenergy. Tolerance of poor growing conditions with minimal inputs are ideal characteristics for bioenergy feedstocks, but have attracted concern for their potential to become invasive. Miscanthus x giganteus is one of the most promising bioenergy crops in the US, but grower adoption is hindered by high establishment costs due to sterility. Newly developed fertile tetraploid M. x giganteus may streamline cultivation while reducing establishment costs. However, fertile seed dramatically increases the potential propagule pressure, and thus probability of off-site plant establishment. To empirically evaluate the invasive potential of fertile M x giganteus in the Southeastern US, we compared fitness and spread potential relative to ten grass species comprising 19 accessions under both high and low levels of competition and disturbance. We chose species known to be invasive in the US (positive controls: Arundo donax, naturalized M. sinensis, M. sacchariflorus, Phalaris arundinacea, Sorghum halepense) and non-invasive (negative controls; Andropogon gerardii, ornamental M. sinensis, Panicum virgatum, Sorghum bicolor, Saccharum spp.). This novel design allows us to make relative comparisons of risk among species with varying invasiveness. After three years of establishment and growth in Blacksburg, Virginia, neither aboveground disturbance nor interspecific weed competition influenced fitness for fertile M x giganteus or our positive and negative control groups. Fertile M. x giganteus produced 346% and 283% greater aboveground biomass than our positive and negative species, respectively. However, fertile M. x giganteus produced 74% fewer inflorescences m(-2) than our positive controls and 7% and 51% fewer spikelets inflorescence(-1) than the positive and negative control species. After 18 months of growth, we observed the vegetative and seedling spread of three of our positive control species (S. halepense, P. arundinacea, and M. sacchariflorus) outside the cultivated plot into receiving areas of both high and low competition. After 24 months of growth, numerous species were observed outside the cultivated plot including fertile M. x giganteus and 50% of negative control species. Notably, in three years sterile M. x giganteus 'Illinois' and Arundo donax never moved from the cultivated plot. The addition of fertile seed appears to increase the potential for offsite movement, but within the geographic confines of our empirical evaluation, fertile M x giganteus seedlings are more similar to native P. virgatum and were not nearly as fast growing or as competitive as our positive control S. halepense. The use of numerous species providing relative comparisons allow us to draw important conclusions which may help prepare for widespread commercialization, while providing novel methodology for ecological risk assessment of new species.

AB  - Purpose Sediments serve as integral and dynamic parts of our aquatic systems. Within the last 15 to 20 years, however, the scientific community has begun noticing deterioration of sediment quality at an alarming rate worldwide. Sediments are now harboring hazardous pollutants that can directly influence water quality, thereby creating very stressful conditions for aquatic life. As a consequence, global efforts were initiated in the early 1970s, to find ways to assess sediment quality. Because of their obvious ecological and economic significance, fish have remained a major taxonomic group for appraising the general quality of aquatic systems. However, for sediment risk assessment, fish have lagged behind invertebrates due to their mobility and generally, pelagic lifestyle. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that comprehensively presents and reviews the versatile role of fish in assessing the state of health of aquatic sediments.
   Main features Through a literature search of the more relevant and/or more recent studies, this review attempted to trace the development of the various approaches as well as to describe the future prospects of using fish as sentinels for sediment quality assessment. Initially, the use of whole fish (juveniles or adults) bioassays contributed immensely to our understanding of sediment contamination and ecotoxicology. But due to economic as well as ethical issues linked to the use of live vertebrates for toxicity testing, the approach has shifted to using fish cell cultures and fish embryos. Much newer approaches involving receptors and gene arrays in fish cells to elucidate the mode of action of sediment-borne contaminants are very promising. The review paper also lists and explores some of the issues associated with the use of juvenile or adult fish, fish cell cultures, fish embryos, and fish gene expression profiles in sediment toxicity evaluations to stimulate further discussions, and hopefully, to serve as benchmark for future handling of similar or related aspects of fish utilization in sediment risk assessment.
   Conclusions and perspectives Overall, the present review has comprehensively explored the changing and progressing roles of fish in sediment toxicity evaluation. Indeed the usefulness of this taxon as test organisms has provided a significant contribution to the advancement of sediment toxicology. However, despite the quite optimistic and bright future for these current procedures, a number of issues and problems remain. Therefore, efforts to develop new technologies and to refine current methods and approaches continue to challenge many laboratories worldwide.

AB  - To prevent grounding of ships and collisions between ships in shallow coastal waters, an underwater data collection and communication network is currently under development: Acoustic Communication network for Monitoring of underwater Environment in coastal areas (ACME). Marine mammals might be affected by ACME sounds since they use sounds of similar frequencies (around 12 kHz) for communication, orientation, and prey location. If marine mammals tend to avoid the vicinity of the transmitters, they may be kept away from ecologically important areas by ACME sounds. One marine mammal species that may be affected in the North Sea is the harbour porpoise. Therefore, as part of an environmental impact assessment program, two captive harbour porpoises were subjected to four sounds, three of which may be used in the underwater acoustic data communication network. The effect of each sound was judged by comparing the animals' positions and respiration rates during a test period with those during a baseline period. Each of the four sounds could be made a deterrent by increasing the amplitude of the sound. The porpoises reacted by swimming away from the sounds and by slightly, but significantly, increasing their respiration rate. From the sound pressure level distribution in the pen, and the distribution of the animals during test sessions, discomfort sound level thresholds were determined for each sound. In combination with information on sound propagation in the areas where the communication system may be deployed, the extent of the 'discomfort zone' can be estimated for several source levels (SLs). The discomfort zone is defined as the area around a sound source that harbour porpoises are expected to avoid. Based on these results, SLs can be selected that have an acceptable effect on harbour porpoises in particular areas. The discomfort zone of a communication sound depends on the selected sound, the selected SL, and the propagation characteristics of the area in which the sound system is operational. In shallow, winding coastal water courses, with sandbanks, etc., the type of habitat in which the ACME sounds will be produced, propagation loss cannot be accurately estimated by using a simple propagation model, but should be measured on site. The SL of the communication system should be adapted to each area (taking into account bounding conditions created by narrow channels, sound propagation variability due to environmental factors, and the importance of an area to the affected species). The discomfort zone should not prevent harbour porpoises from spending sufficient time in ecologically important areas (for instance feeding areas), or routes towards these areas.

AB  - In recent years, decreased runoff and sediment, intensified storm surge and seawater intrusion, urbanization, petroleum exploration, and production, and other factors have gradually deteriorated the unique wetland ecosystem in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Although previous studies have analyzed the relationships between vegetation and soil properties at different scales, few studies have documented quasi-circular vegetation patches (QVPs) in the YRD, which appear to exhibit faster succession rates that make them ideal for studies on the relationships between vegetation and soil properties. Therefore, this study investigated differences in soil physicochemical properties at 0-20 cm depths between QVPs and inter-QVP bare soil areas, among QVPs, and among plant species communities. Additionally, spatial variations in soil physicochemical properties were explored in south-north and west-east transects across and within QVPs. The results showed that soils beneath QVPs had significant fertility island effects associated with soil organic matter (SOM) and total nitrogen (TN). Furthermore, these areas were richer in clay content, showed slightly higher pH values, and exhibited less available phosphorus (APH), available potassium (APO), total salt content, and silt content than those of bare soil areas. A multiple independent samples nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis H test detected significant differences in SOM, TN, APH, and pH among 18 QVPs, but no significant differences were found in APO, total salt content, sand, silt, and clay contents. Regardless of plant species, different plant species communities had significant effects on soil physicochemical properties. Particularly, soils underneath plant species communities with Tamarix chinensis were richer in SOM and TN, and they contained less APH, APO, and total salt content than those without T. chinensis. In each QVP, values of SOM and TN in soil samples along the patch perimeter were less than those of samples located midway toward the perimeter, and these values were less than those of samples centered in the patch. However, APO and total salt content values exhibited opposite changes from the perimeter to the center of the patch. The results also indicated significant differences in SOM, TN, APH, APO, and pH between south-north transect A and west-east transect B across QVPs, but no significant differences were found in total salt content, sand, silt, and clay contents. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that QVPs have significant effects on topsoil nutrients and salinity but little effects on soil texture. Furthermore, the occurrence and development of QVPs are associated with suitable soil conditions, including higher clay fractions and lower total salt content values.

AB  - Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) focuses primarily on assessing how policies, plans, and programs (PPPs) influence the sustainability of the involved regions. However, the processes of assessing policies and developing management strategies for pollution load and resource use are usually separate in the current SEA system. This study developed a policy management methodology to overcome the defects generated during the above processes. This work first devised a dynamic management framework using the methods of systems thinking, system dynamics, and Managing for Results (MFRs). Furthermore, a driving force-pressure-state-impact-response (DPSIR) indicator system was developed. The golf course installation policy was applied as a case study. Taiwan, counties of Taiwan, and the golf courses within those individual counties were identified as a system, subsystems, and objects, respectively. This study identified an object-linked double-layer framework with multi-stage-option to simultaneously to quantify golf courses in each subsystem and determine ratios of abatement and allocation for pollution load and resource use of each golf course. The DPSIR indicator values for each item of each golf course in each subsystem are calculated based on the options taken in the two decision layers. The summation of indicator values for all items of all golf courses in all subsystems according to various options is defined as the sustainability value of the policy. An optimization model and a system (IDPMS) were developed to obtain the greatest sustainability value of the policy, while golf course quantity, human activity intensity, total quantities of pollution load and resource use are simultaneously obtained. The solution method based on enumeration of multiple bounds for objectives and constraints (EMBOC) was developed for the problem with 1.95 x 10(128) combinations of possible options to solve the optimal solution in ten minutes using a personal computer with 3.0 GHz CPU. This study obtain the policy with the optimal environmental sustainability value in Taiwan is 102 golf courses. Human activity intensity and total quantities of pollution load and resource use which are concurrently obtained are less than those of the existing policy and the existing quantities in 2006. The optimal solution remains unchanged under most sensitivity analysis conditions, unless the weights and constraints are extremely changed. The analytical results indicate that the proposed methodology can be used to assist the authorities for simultaneously generating and assessing the policy during the SEA process.

AB  - Coral reefs are one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They are currently exposed to increasing levels of anthropogenic perturbations. Several recent reviews point to the lack of good indicators for these perturbations especially to monitor their effects on fish populations or fish assemblages. The SW lagoon of New Caledonia is an ideal location to test indicator species in this context as contrasting sites are present within a small geographical range. This study analysed fish from four sites, one with heavy industrial pollution, another dominated by domestic waste, a third with historic mining activities, and the fourth as a control. The butterfly fish, Chaetodon speculum, was chosen to determine C. speculum's potential as an indicator species due to its link to coral, its sedentary behaviour and its wide geographical distribution. The size distribution, growth rate, age distribution and whole otolith composition were analysed at each site. Age and mean growth rate were analysed from daily increments of the otoliths. The concentrations of eight elements (Li, Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Rb, Sr, and Ba) were measured by ICP-MS in the otoliths of a subset of individuals. The sites under anthropogenic impact were distinct from the control site by fish size frequencies, age distributions, and the chemical content of their otoliths. The chemical elements Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, and Rb showed differences amongst sites. Fish belonging to the sites furthest from Noumea could be discriminated in nearly 80% of samples or 60% of the cases when otolith weight or fish age respectively were taken into account. Ni concentrations of the otoliths were also higher in the bays where water concentrations of this element were known to be higher, but these differences were no longer significant once corrected for otolith weight. These results should be mitigated by the fact that: (1) despite significant differences between sites in age distribution and size frequencies there were no differences in growth rates or body condition; (2) differences in age or size were not correlated to perturbation levels; and (3) discrimination between sites based on chemical levels in the otoliths, even though significant, was not sufficient to identify the origin of the fish at a level useful for screening tests. The hypothesis that environmental differences between sites would be reflected in the otolith chemical composition is therefore not fully supported by our results. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Metarhizium anisopliae, an entomopathogenic fungus, is a prototypic microbial pesticide licensed for indoor control of cockroaches, a major source of allergens. We have previously demonstrated allergy and asthma-like responses in BALB/c mice intraperitoneally (IP) sensitized in the presence of adjuvant and intratracheally (IT) challenged with the soluble factors from M. anisopliae crude antigen (MACA) (Ward et al., 1998, 2000). This protocol has been used frequently to establish animal models of allergenicity. However, the sensitization protocol is artificial and not representative of an environmental exposure. Concern has been raised that this protocol might produce allergic responses that would not occur under normal environmental exposure conditions. The objective of this study was to compare responses in mice to MACA by two exposure protocols: (1) exclusive respiratory exposures without adjuvant (representative of environmental exposures) and (2) intraperitoneal sensitization in the presence of adjuvant followed by IT challenge (the traditional approach). The intratracheal protocol consisted of four IT exposures of 10 mu g MACA in 50 mu l HBSS each over a 4-week period. A vehicle control group of mice was exposed IT to HBSS. The intraperitoneal protocol consisted of IP sensitization with 25 mu g MACA in 0.2 ml of 1.3% alhydrogel (aluminum hydroxide) followed 14 days later with an IT challenge (10 mu g MACA/50 mu l HBSS). Airway reactivity responsiveness to methacholine was assessed, serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were obtained, and the lungs were fixed for histopathology at 1, 3, and 8 days Following the last MACA IT challenge. Both groups exhibited immune and pulmonary responses typical of allergic asthma. In general, local responses in the lung, including inflammatory responses (eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages), BALF IgE, and functional responses to methacholine were greater in the IT sensitized group compared to the IP sensitized group, whereas the systemic IgE response was greater in the IP sensitized group. The BALF IL-5 cytokine levels were elevated before and throughout the eosinophil influx. IL-4 was detected in the BALF of IP sensitized, but not IT sensitized mice. Histopathologic changes in the two groups were similar in nature but more severe in the IT mice. The results suggest that the IP sensitization protocol does not induce the level of respiratory responsiveness that results from sensitization by a physiologically relevant route of exposure. Thus total serum IgE levels, which were greater following IP sensitization, may not be the best indicator of allergen potency, at least with respect to respiratory responses.

AB  - Phytoplankton is one of the crucial components of water body ecosystems. Its presence and development depend on biological, physical and chemical factors and in consequence it is an important indicator of ecosystem condition. Monitoring of phytoplankton production, measured as chlorophyll a concentration, is a useful tool for assessing the status of dam reservoirs. Modeled chlorophyll a concentrations are used as water quality indicators in locations not included in monitoring systems, in situations when the temporal resolution of the monitoring is not enough, and in assessments of the impacts of future activities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to find correlations between hydro- and thermodynamics and the chlorophyll a concentration for possible application in reservoir monitoring and management, using an ELCOM-CAEDYM model. The analysis included summer and fall which are most prone to algal blooms, and four phytoplankton groups identified as dominant in the reservoir based on periodic observations.
   Comparisons of simulated water temperature and both observed and simulated chlorophyll a concentrations confirmed that these variables are significantly correlated (correlation of hourly chlorophyll a and water temperature was 0.70, ranging from 0.55 to 0.81 in the bottom and surface water layers, respectively, while for daily outputs it was 0.74, ranging from 0.60 to 0.83). This relation was stronger than that of chlorophyll a to nutrient (N, P and Si) concentrations. What is more, the method used allowed the assessment of a much more detailed spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton groups compared with conventional monitoring techniques.
   The study indicated that the phytoplankton community was dominated by Chlorophytes and Diatoms with a larger share of Chlorophytes in shallow parts of the reservoir. This domination was weaker after short water mixing events in summer and especially after the fall turnover. The increase in phytoplankton diversity was estimated to occur mainly near the surface and in shallow parts of the reservoir. Most of the observed concentrations of individual phytoplankton groups differed from simulation results by less than 25% and the model reflected accurately 74% of observed trends in concentrations. Calculated chlorophyll a concentration was well matched to hourly monitoring data (mean squared error = 5.6, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient = 0.51, Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.72 and p-value = 0.0007).
   High compatibility of the model to the values measured in the reservoir make it a promising tool for the prediction and planning of actions aimed at maintaining good functioning of the reservoir.

AB  - The present study investigates ecological patterns and relationships to environmental variables among a time-series of larval fish species abundance from late spring surveys (1981-2003) in the northwest Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Links between interannual variation in species abundance and the physical environment were explored using generalized additive modeling (GAM). Trends in larval abundance and connections with physical variables displayed patterns that indicate unique and complex responses among species to environmental forcing during the larval period. In particular, the observed patterns suggest that ontogenetic-specific responses, representing sub-intervals of early life, are important. In addition, a notable degree of synchrony in larval abundance trends, and similarity in links with physical variables, were observed among species with common early life history patterns. The deepwater spawners, northern lampfish, arrowtooth flounder, and Pacific halibut, were most abundant in the study area during the 1990s, in association with enhanced wind-driven onshore and alongshore transport. Years of high abundance for Pacific cod, walleye pollock, and northern rock sole were associated with cooler winters and enhanced alongshore winds during spring. High larval abundance for spring-summer spawning rockfish species and southern rock sole seemed to be favored by warmer spring temperatures later in the time-series. This apparent exposure-response coupling seems to be connected to both local-scale and basin-scale environmental signals, to varying degrees depending on specific early life history characteristics. Understanding such ecological connections contributes to the evaluation of vulnerability and resilience among GOA species' early life history patterns to fluctuating climate and oceanographic conditions. This investigation also provides crucial information for the identification of "environmental indicators" that may have a broad-spectrum effect on multiple species early life history stages, as well as those that may be more species-specific in exerting control on early life history survival. Of particular interest was the emergence of the EP-NP (East Pacific-North Pacific) teleconnection index as the top-ranked variable in the CAM models exploring the connections between late spring larval abundance and the physical environment. The EP-NP index represents an important and often primary mode of spring-summer atmospheric variability in the northeast Pacific, with a strong expression in the GOA, and its connection with species in this study implies that it may be a climate mode of significant ecological importance.

AB  - Around Niamey, in Niger, the shrub Guiera senegalensis dominates all of the fallows in almost totally monospecific stands. The species has a strong resprouting ability enabling it to survive cutting when clearing land for crops, whereas all other species succumb to cutting. However, in this dry environment (560 mm of annual rainfall from June through September), this remnant-increaser species has to cope with variations of available water in space and time. The daily course of its water status is an indicator of the variation of the intensity of water flux between the soil, vegetation and atmosphere, and it is often estimated with Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) models.
   We assessed the water status of G. senegalensis through its daily cycle leaf water potential (Psi), using six populations representative of the local diversity by measuring three shrubs per population on two excised leaves per shrub for each measurement.
   We made our measurements over two vegetative cycles (from July 1994 to December 1995), fortnightly during the rainy season, and once a month during the dry season, until the sample shrubs lost their leaves in their deciduous cycle.
   We used linear models to characterize the daily Psi cycle of the shrubs, and of the populations during each season. For each population, three sources of variation were considered: the shrub number, the date and the hour in day. Date and hour in day effects are presented as trend surface models defined by the degrees of polynomials and the status of shrub effects. The status of shrub effects characterizes the variability in accounting for environmental conditions.
   The group of plant populations that explain the least variability in every model as well as the least total variance among the shrubs and between seasons were in locations with the best water supply. Two other groups were defined according to the median and the highest explained variability of Psi, respectively. For all stations, the most temporal variability is explained by models accounting for the interaction between shrubs and the temporal variation, with the least variability for models that do not account for the shrub effect at all. Models accounting only for the additive effect of shrubs explain intermediate values. The models used herein indicate the large range of variability in G. senegalensis water status, both for inter- and intra-populations. This high physiological plasticity must contribute to the strong species-dominance stability in its current distribution area. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reactive solutes flow, transport, and transform in natural subsurface that is ubiquitously heterogeneous. How much are the heterogeneity effects on solute reactive transport? At what spatial scale heterogeneity effects diminish? Answers to these questions are important to understand controls of and to predict solute reactive transport in natural environments. Although these questions have been explored for non-reactive tracers and solutes that go through relatively simple single-component sorption, heterogeneity effects remain poorly understood for solutes that go through surface complexation. These reactions typically include multi-component and are subject to influences of local geochemical conditions. This work aims to address these questions and to understand how and how much effective capacity (C-sc,C- m), early (k(c1)) and late (k(c2)) rates of Cr(VI) surface complexation are influenced by heterogeneity characteristics and length scales. A two-dimensional model with Cr(VI) surface complexation were calibrated using column data. Numerical experiments were carried out in heterogeneous media characterized by different permeability variance sigma(2)(Ink) (0.2, 4.5), correlation length lambda(L) (0-6.0 cm), and domain length (0.1-1.0m). Results show that long lambda(L) and high sigma(2)(Ink) facilitate the formation of preferential flow and elongate the diffusion length, leading to high connectivity that minimizes C-sc,C- m and k(c1). In highly connected media (>2.0), C-sc,C- m and k(c1) can be N-2 orders of magnitude lower than those in corresponding homogeneous media. Connectivity however is not a good indicator for k(c2) that is predominantly controlled by diffusion. The heterogeneity effects are scale dependent. As the domain length increases, C-sc,C- m and k(c1) values approach those of homogeneous media due to longer mixing lengths and continued pH increase during Cr(VI) surface complexion. The "critical length" at which heterogeneity effects disappear occurs at about 20 lambda(L) and differs only slightly at different sigma(2)(Ink) values. The heterogeneity effects however linger at much longer lengths for k(c2), the values of which are N-2 orders of magnitude lower in heterogeneous media even at 20 lambda because of the longer characteristic times of diffusive transport. These results underscore the strong regulation of solute reactive transport by mineral spatial patterns, suggesting the importance of subsurface characteristics and spatial scales at which they are important in estimating natural attenuation, residence times, and natural system capacity to sorb chemicals.

AB  - Eutrophication of inland waters by phosphorus as well as loads of coastal and marine waters by nitrogen is a major problem that impedes water bodies to meet the status defined by the Water Framework Directive. In order to reduce the nutrient load on the aquatic environment, first the significance of various pollution types should be thoroughly analyzed. The analysis of phosphorus runoff from agricultural land under normal rainfall-runoff conditions, and of nitrogen runoff associated with the application of manure on farmland shows their different impact on water body status in the Vltava river basin. The assessment of phosphorus indicates that annual specific phosphorus runoff ranges from 0.1 to 9.98 kg/km(2) and in the sub-basins of the Upper Vltava, Berounka, and Lower Vltava, the average values from all water bodies reach 4.08, 2.92, and 4.02 kg/km(2), respectively. Compared with the allowable capacity of water bodies for achieving a good status, the average rate of phosphorus input on the load of water bodies comes within 20%, with a maximum value slightly exceeding 50%. This phosphorus input will not be a significant source of eutrophication of inland waters and measures will have to focus rather on other eutrophication sources. Estimating the significance of the impact of manure application on the nitrogen load of water bodies provides a completely opposite picture. The analyses showed that the load of water bodies ranges from very low values in areas without livestock to high loads in tens of kg/ha per year (max. 31.5 kg/ha/year). In the sub-basins of the Upper Vltava, Berounka, and Lower Vltava the annual specific runoff of nitrogen reaches average values for all water bodies (4.8, 3.9, and 5.7 kg/ha, respectively). The assessment of the proportion of nitrogen input on the load of water bodies showed that 25% of cases in the area of the water body may represent a critical load leading to an adverse assessment of ecological status. In many other water bodies it can, however, taking into account the load of mineral fertilizers, lead to exceeding the allowable capacity of water bodies and the risk of not achieving a good status. Nitrogen input after application of manure in soils represents an important source that threatens the good status of waters. Attention should thus be paid to all types of measures that will reduce the load of this source or restrict its transport from soil to waters.

AB  - For several decades, breeding goals in dairy cattle focussed on increased milk production. However, many functional traits have negative genetic correlations with milk yield, and reductions in genetic merit for health and fitness have been observed. Herd management has been challenged to compensate for these effects and to balance fertility, udder health and metabolic diseases against increased production to maximize profit without compromising welfare. Functional traits, such as direct information on cow health, have also become more important because of growing concern about animal well-being and consumer demands for healthy and natural products. There are major concerns about the impact of drugs used in veterinary medicine on the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria that can negatively impact human health. Sustainability and efficiency are also increasingly important because of the growing competition for high-quality, plant-based sources of energy and protein. Disruptions to global environments because of climate change may encourage yet more emphasis on these traits. To be successful, it is vital that there be a balance between the effort required for data recording and subsequent benefits. The motivation of farmers and other stakeholders involved in documentation and recording is essential to ensure good data quality. To keep labour costs reasonable, existing data sources should be used as much as possible. Examples include the use of milk composition data to provide additional information about the metabolic status or energy balance of the animals. Recent advances in the use of mid-infrared spectroscopy to measure milk have shown considerable promise, and may provide cost-effective alternative phenotypes for difficult or expensive-to-measure traits, such as feed efficiency. There are other valuable data sources in countries that have compulsory documentation of veterinary treatments and drug use. Additional sources of data outside of the farm include, for example, slaughter houses (meat composition and quality) and veterinary labs (specific pathogens, viral loads). At the farm level, many data are available from automated and semi-automated milking and management systems. Electronic devices measuring physiological status or activity parameters can be used to predict events such as oestrus, and also behavioural traits. Challenges concerning the predictive biology of indicator traits or standardization need to be solved. To develop effective selection programmes for new traits, the development of large databases is necessary so that high-reliability breeding values can be estimated. For expensive-to-record traits, extensive phenotyping in combination with genotyping of females is a possibility.

AB  - Intensive land use, e.g. pastoralism, decreases biodiversity and leads to homogenization of habitats. However, the effect of land-use changes differs under varying climatic conditions. Thus, it is essential to study how land use affects biodiversity on a large scale. Moreover, species respond differently to environmental changes depending on whether they are specialists or generalists. We studied macro-moths in Mongolian pastures under two different grazing regimes (grazed and less grazed plots) in ten study sites that belong to two distinct biomes along a large-scale latitudinal gradient from desert to steppe. We explored 1) how livestock grazing affects macro moth diversity, species composition, and species richness, 2) how specialist and generalist moths respond to grazing in desert (Desert and xeric shrublands) and grassland (Temperate grasslands, savannas & shrublands). Moths are sensitive to environmental changes and suitable bioindicators. We also revealed a) indicators of grazing and b) indicators representative for certain sections of the latitudinal gradient. Totally, we recorded 80 species in the desert and 202 species in grassland in 2018 and 2019, which were DNA barcoded. In the desert, grazing did not affect macro-moth diversity, whereas grassland was negatively affected. However, not all moth families showed the same response to grazing. Species diversity, species richness, and abundance of Erebidae, Geometridae, and Noctuidae were significantly higher in the less grazed plots. Further, species dissimilarity between grazed and less grazed plots was mainly due to species replacement rather than species loss. In the desert, the species richness of both specialist and generalist moths did not differ between grazed and less grazed plots; in contrast, in grassland, the species richness of both groups was higher in less grazed plots. We found two indicator species of grazing in the desert: Hyles chuvilini in less grazed, and Cucullia splendida in grazed pasture. In grassland, we found ten indicator species exclusively for less grazed pastures: Catarhoe cuculata, Euxoa ochrogaster, Lacanobia thalassina, Megalycinia strictaria, Mythimna comma, Polia bombycina, Rhyacia simulans, Sideridis kitti, Sideridis egena, and Smerinthus caecus. These indicator species can be used as references for habitat quality and for moths' dispersal due to climate change in future studies. Among the environmental variables, plant species richness, altitude, and livestock number were the most important variables. Species composition of high altitudes in the desert was distinct, and higher species richness in this area indicated that high altitudes could serve as a refuge area during global warming and should receive conservation management.

Few studies have evaluated the recovery trajectories of forest litterfall by simultaneously monitoring forest restoration strategies and reference ecosystems. The general objective of our study was to determine the functional recovery of an abandoned pasture under passive and active restoration, and in secondary (40-year-old) and mature (120-year-old) forest, by analyzing litterfall and its components (leaves, flowers, fruits, woody parts) over a period of five consecutive years. We determined the vegetation structure and tree species composition of these four conditions and compared 1) production of litterfall, leaves, flowers and fruits, 2) leaf litter nutrient inputs (C and N) and, 3) recovery by tree species in leaf litterfall. In five years, litterfall increased from 2.6 to 7.8 Mg ha- 1 and from 3.5 to 9.1 Mg ha- 1 in the passive and active restoration treatments, respectively, while it increased from 6.0 to 8.6 Mg ha- 1 in the secondary forest. In the mature forest, litterfall varied around 10.0 Mg ha- 1. The reproductive component increased significantly in restoration (0.3 to 1.5 Mg ha- 1) but remained around 0.6 Mg ha- 1 in secondary and 1.3 Mg ha- 1 in mature forest. Secondary and mature forests both presented correlations to monthly precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures, indicating strong seasonality. However, litterfall production in the passive and active treatments was continuous throughout the year. Basal area and tree density were higher under active compared to passive restoration. Although the dominant tree species were similar under passive and active restoration, active restoration presented a higher forest species recovery, while the dominance of exotic grass patches persisted under passive restoration. The results suggest that litterfall production can be a useful and accurate indicator with which to evaluate the recovery of ecosystem function, while flower and fruit component can indicate reproductive recovery. Although litterfall production increased rapidly after five years, it did not present a seasonal dynamic. This is probably due to the fact that the species composition still differs from that of the reference systems. Evaluations of cloud forest restoration success should therefore include temporal assessments of vegetation structure and biodiversity recovery in relation to the reference forests in order to establish additional restoration techniques, particularly in the case of passive restoration strategies.

AB  - Landfast sea ice (fast ice) attached to Antarctic (near-)coastal elements is a critical component of the local physical and ecological systems. Through its direct coupling with the atmosphere and ocean, fast-ice properties are also a potential indicator of processes related to a changing climate. However, in situ fast-ice observations in Antarctica are extremely sparse because of logistical challenges and harsh environmental conditions. Since 2010, a monitoring program observing the seasonal evolution of fast ice in Atka Bay has been conducted as part of the Antarctic Fast Ice Network (AFIN). The bay is located on the northeastern edge of Ekstrom Ice Shelf in the eastern Weddell Sea, close to the German wintering station Neumayer III. A number of sampling sites have been regularly revisited each year between annual ice formation and breakup to obtain a continuous record of sea-ice and sub-ice platelet-layer thickness, as well as snow depth and freeboard across the bay.
   Here, we present the time series of these measurements over the last 9 years. Combining them with observations from the nearby Neumayer III meteorological observatory as well as auxiliary satellite images enables us to relate the seasonal and interannual fast-ice cycle to the factors that influence their evolution.
   On average, the annual consolidated fast-ice thickness at the end of the growth season is about 2 m, with a loose platelet layer of 4 m thickness beneath and 0.70 m thick snow on top. Results highlight the predominately seasonal character of the fast-ice regime in Atka Bay without a significant interannual trend in any of the observed variables over the 9-year observation period. Also, no changes are evident when comparing with sporadic measurements in the 1980s and 1990s. It is shown that strong easterly winds in the area govern the year-round snow distribution and also trigger the breakup of fast ice in the bay during summer months.
   Due to the substantial snow accumulation on the fast ice, a characteristic feature is frequent negative freeboard, associated flooding of the snow-ice interface, and a likely subsequent snow ice formation. The buoyant platelet layer beneath negates the snow weight to some extent, but snow thermodynamics is identified as the main driver of the energy and mass budgets for the fast-ice cover in Atka Bay.
   The new knowledge of the seasonal and interannual variability of fast-ice properties from the present study helps to improve our understanding of interactions between atmosphere, fast ice, ocean, and ice shelves in one of the key regions of Antarctica and calls for intensified multidisciplinary studies in this region.

AB  - Background. Grazing is widely regarded as a critical factor affecting the vegetation structure, productivity and nutritional value of natural grasslands. To protect and restore degraded grasslands, non-grazed exclosures are considered as a valuable tool. However, it is not clear whether long term non-grazed exclosures of grazers can improve the condition and nutritional value of vegetation and soil properties.
   Methods. We have compared the impact of long-term non-grazed and continuous grazed management strategy on vegetation structure, nutritional values and soil properties of alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by field investigation (11-13 years) and indoor analysis during 2015-2017.
   Results. Our results showed that long-term non-grazed exclosures clearly increased the aboveground biomass and coverage of plant functional types. Long-term non-grazed exclosures improved the development of all vegetation types, except NG (GG, grass species type; SG, sedge species type; LG, leguminous species type; FG, forbs species type and NG, noxious species type). Long-term non-grazed exclosures significantly improved all six measured soil properties (TN, total nitrogen; TP, total phosphorus; TK, total potassium; AN, available nitrogen; AP, available phosphorus and AK, available potassium) in 0-10 cm soil layer, considerable effect on the improvement of all measured soil properties, except TK in 10-20 cm soil layer and all measured soil properties, except TN and TK in 20-30 cm soil layer were observed. However, long-term non-grazed exclosures significantly decreased biodiversity indicators i.e., species richness, Shannon diversity index and Evenness index of vegetation. A substantial decrease in the density, biodiversity and nutritional values (CP (crude protein), IVTD (in vitro ture digestibility) and NDF (neutral detergent fiber)) of all vegetation types, except NG were recorded. While a downward trend in aboveground biomass and all measured soil properties except TP and TK were observed during 2015-2017 in alpine meadows due to long-term grazed treatment. The density, diversity and nutritional value (CP and IVTD) of long-term non-grazed alpine meadows showed a downward trend over time (2015-2017). By considering the biodiversity conservation and grassland livestock production, long-term non-grazed exclosures are not beneficial for the improvement of density, biodiversity and nutritional values of plant functional types. Thus, our study suggests that rotational non-grazed and grazed treatment would be a good management strategy to restore and improve the biodiversity and nutritional values of plant functional types in natural grassland ecosystems.

AB  - In the South China and Java Seas, cage farming is a recent regional activity, which since the year 2000 has experienced an annual growth of 29%. The region holds the highest diversity of marine life, which is partly or completely dependent on coral reefs. The increasingly growing coastal human population in the area relies on ecosystem goods and services provided by the reefs that are threatened by anthropogenic activities. Sea cage farming is one of the stressors negatively impacting coral reefs by being point sources of nutrients and other effluents. To date no systematic information is available on the physical location of marine farms in relation to the coral reefs. Little is known about the distance where impact from the farms can be detected on nearby coral reefs. The present survey aimed to fill this gap by assessing to what extent marine cage farms in South East Asia are placed in the vicinity of the reefs and at which distance stress indicators from the farms are observed. We used Google Earth satellite images to investigate the extension and spatial distribution of sea cage aquaculture in relation to the presence of coral reefs. The stress indicators were locally assessed in Central Vietnam by recording turf algal overgrowth, coral mortality, live coral and branching coral cover at increasing distances from the farms. We found that 90% of sea cage farms throughout the region clustered closer than 5 km from coral reefs and 50% of them closer than 1 km from reefs. In Taiwan, 71% of the cages were located within 100m from a reef. This pattern is nonrandom and could not be explained by the natural distribution of coral reefs; only 5% of the Vietnamese coast harbors coral reefs, and sea cage farms are present in these areas only. This indicates that the farms require similar conditions as the reefs including clear and shallow waters and protection against storms and wave action. We found that turf algal overgrowth decreased at 287 m +/- 54 m, dead coral at 1446m +/- 154 m, live coral cover increased at 566 +/- 221 m and branching corals increased at 867 m +/- 140 m from the cage farms. We conclude that proximity to coral reefs should be considered when planning future developments of sea cage aquaculture, and recommend that distances of at least 1.5 km should be kept.

AB  - Through slash-and-burn techniques, vast areas formerly occupied by tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) in Mexico have been converted into croplands and secondary forest of different ages. Despite the dramatic changes in soil properties and processes detected during cropping and forest regeneration, no attempts have been made to develop soil quality indicators (SQI) to assist in the assessment of soil conditions during such changes. SQI are considered to be essential in evaluating plans of forest restoration or management: as such, the objectives of this study were to (i) select soil properties that can be used as SQI during forest regeneration for abandoned crop fields in a TMCF area managed under the slash-and-burn method: and (ii) examine the ecological significance of stand age for function-based interpretations of the selected SQL To this end, the soil properties of three adjacent chronosequences in El Rincon, Sierra Norte, Southern Mexico were analyzed. Each chronosequence consisted of ordered series of five stands of different age after abandonment: a cornfield and adjacent forests of similar to 15 (incipient forest), similar to 45 (young forest), similar to 75 (mature forest), and >= 100 (old-growth forest) years after abandonment. The soil properties of undisturbed old-growth forest stands were used as a reference. After inspection of principal component analysis results and control charts, the following soil properties were chosen as SQI in TMCF areas: soil organic carbon, pH, plant-available P, O horizon thickness and exchangeable Al3+. The selected SQI displayed different rates of change during forest regeneration. Soil organic carbon had a fast recovery rate and, therefore, a greater ability to return to its original level after disturbance. In contrast, O horizon thickness, soil pH, plant-available P, and exchangeable Al3+ showed a slow rate of change during the fallow period. SQI did not always change linearly nor improve with the age of the forest. The highest exchangeable Al3+ concentration was detected in 45-year-old forests, suggesting that at this forest age, soil become an important filter against Al3+ sensitive species, potentially affecting vegetation composition. Considering the slow recovery rate of some SQL we estimate that fallow periods of at least 100 years are required in order to reach good soil quality in TMCF ecosystems. Management practices should therefore consider the maintenance of forest of different ages spanning at least 100 years in the landscape. Doing so would achieve more sustainable management practices by allowing a relatively continuous recovery of the ecosystem without prolonged interruptions of land utilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study is an attempt to understand the role of Nepalese alder (Alnus nepalensis D. Don) in litter production, leaf litter decomposition, leaf area index (LAI) and rate of forest floor respiration as indicators of carbon flux in white oak (Quercus leucotrichophora A. Camus) forests. Five forest stands of oak mixed alder (OMA) and five oak without alder (OWA) were selected along a basal area gradient under similar ecological conditions in Indian central Himalaya. We estimated monthly variations in litterfall, leaf litter decomposition and leaf area index (LAI) in Q. leucotrichophora and A. nepalensis in OMA and OWA stands. Soil and litter CO2 effluxes were estimated seasonally using the soda-lime absorption method. The seasonal pattern of litterfall showed a bimodal trend in OMA and unimodal trend in OWA forest stands. Forest floor biomass (leaf, twig, reproductive parts, herbaceous and miscellaneous litter) was highest in summer (707-1080 g/m(2)) followed by winter (414-678 g/m(2)) and rainy (281-541 g/m(2)) seasons in OMA stands. In OWA stands, forest floor biomass was highest in summer (463-646 g/m(2)) followed by rainy (321-411 g/m(2)) and winter (149-279 g/m(2)) seasons. Total litter production, leaf litter decomposition rates, change in LAI and soil respiration were significantly higher (p < 0.01) for OMA stands than OWA stands. The maximum annual LAI(ma)(x) ranged from 4.10 to 6.78 m(2)m(-2) in OMA stands and from 1.9 to 3.06 m(2)m(-2) in OWA stands. Total soil respiration (TSR), litter-free soil respiration (LFSR) and litter respiration (LR) were also higher (p < 0.01) in OMA compared to OWA stands. Mean rate of TSR, LFSR, and LR was 280.18 mg m(-2)h(-1), 180.45 mg m(-2)h(-1), and 46.40 mg m(-2)h(-1) in OMA and 188.46 mg m(-2)h(-1), 150.1 mg m(-2) h(-1), 38.35 mg m(-2)h(-1), respectively, in OWA stands and for both recorded highest in monsoon season. The results indicate that A. nepalensis enhances litter production, LAI, leaf litter decomposition, and forest floor respiration in the oak forests, which in turn would result in increased carbon flux.

AB  - Organic geochemical proxies (OGPs) preserved in coastal lake sediments have recently been used to reconstruct millennia-long hurricane records. Although OGPs (delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N) appear to be a more sensitive indicator of past storm events than traditional proxies used in paleotempestology, the method has not been tested in many lakes with modern data. In this study, we measured the delta C-13, delta N-15 and C/N values of particulate organic matter (POM), along with the salinities and stable isotopic compositions of water (delta O-18 and delta D), in two coastal lakes on seasonal or much shorter time scales throughout a 3-year period. This work was intended to develop a better understanding of the dynamics of OGPs in these lakes. The time-series data not only show that geochemical properties of these lakes varied seasonally, reflecting variations in lake biological and environmental conditions, but displayed unique variation patterns in response to storms that caused either seawater flooding or freshwater flooding of the lakes. The data show that seawater flooding led to higher delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, with either lower or no change in the C/N ratios of the POM, generally consistent with a previously proposed conceptual model for detecting seawater flooding events. The data also show that freshwater flooding reduces delta N-15 and increases the C/N values of POM, in addition to lowering the salinity, delta O-18 and delta D of lake water. These time series modern data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting past storm events that were large enough to cause either seawater or freshwater flooding by examining variation patterns of multiple OGPs in coastal lake sediments. Applying this understanding to a sediment core from one of the study lakes (Mullet Pond, Florida), we reconstructed a centuries-long record of storms based on the variation patterns in OGPs together with Pb-210 ages. The OGP-based storm record suggests that 30 flooding events, including 15 seawater flooding and 15 freshwater flooding incidents, occurred over the last 165 years. Almost all of these flooding events can be matched (within the dating uncertainty) to the historic hurricanes that are known to have passed within 150 km of the study site. This further confirms that OGPs preserved in sediments in coastal lakes of Florida or similar regions may be used as reliable recorders of past storm activity. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Between 1948 and 1950 the German phytosociologist Harro Passarge conducted 120 releves in a 2,200 ha large forest area near Magdeburgerforth (Flaming, Saxony-Anhalt, NE Germany). The study area is characterized by a remarkable diversity of forest communities of the alliances Agrostio-Quercion petraeae, Alnion glutinosae, Alnion incanae, Carpinion betuli, Dicrano-Pinion and Quercion roboris. Because of this broad ecological spectrum, and because many processes which impact Central European forests today (nitrogen deposition, climate change) were not noticeable at the date of the first survey, it provides a good opportunity for a resurvey study after 60 years. As the position of Passarge's releves were not marked in a map, in the 2014 resurvey we sampled the most similar forest stands within a search area defined by the forest compartment and the Passarge vegetation map. In this way, 97 (81%) of the releves could be repeated. Vegetation change was analysed by NMDS ordination and the comparison of a diversity, Ellenberg indicator values and linkage to forest habitats of species from both censuses, as well as by the identification of winner and loser species.
   Although, due to the methodology, only the smallest possible vegetation change was indicated, we nevertheless gained results which conform to those of resurveys based on quasi-permanent plots. The main trends (eutrophication, succession after management change, loss of plant species that are light demanding and linked to oligotrophic sites, spread of nitrophilous and mesophilous forest species, immigration of neophytes, no general decline in species richness) are in agreement with the results of several other resurvey studies in Central and Western European forests. Because of the wide spectrum of habitats within the study area (from wet to dry, as well as from acidic and nutrient-poor to relatively base-rich) we could demonstrate more clearly than in previous studies that the resilience of forests to vegetation change differs strongly according to the initial forest type, and that different drivers of temporal changes are active. Mesophilous forests (Stellario-Carpinetum and Luzulo-Quercetum) turned out to be relatively stable, while Circaeo-Alnetum forests also showed few signs of environmental change despite some species turnover. In contrast, forests of nutrient-poor habitats (Sphagno-Alnetum, Betulo-Quercetum, Dicrano-Pinion) were characterized by many loser species and a strong tendency towards eutrophication. Thermophilous forests and lichen-pine forests, which are especially dependent on historical forest management techniques, largely disappeared.

AB  - Subfossil chironomid analysis was applied to a sediment core from Sagistalsee, a small lake at present-day treeline elevation in the Swiss Alps. During the whole 9000-year stratigraphy the chironomid fauna was dominated by taxa typical of alpine lakes. Major faunistic trends were caused by changes in accumulation rates of three taxa, namely Procladius, Stictochironomus, and Tanytarsus lugens-type. In the early Holocene Procladius was the dominant taxon. In younger samples, Stictochironomus tended to have as high or higher abundances and both taxa showed an increase in accumulation rates. A possible cause of this succession is the decrease of lake-water depth due to infilling of the lake basin and changes in associated limnological parameters. The immigration of Picea ( spruce) at ca. 6500 cal. C-14 yrs BP and the resulting denser woodlands in the lake's catchment may have promoted this trend. During three phases, from ca. 70 - 1450, 1900 - 2350, and 3500 - 3950 cal. BP, remains of Procladius, Stictochironomus, and Tanytarsus lugens-type are absent from the lake sediment, whereas other typical lake taxa and stream chironomids show no change in accumulation rate. Together with sediment chemistry data, this suggests that increased oxygen deficits in the lake's bottom water during these intervals caused the elimination of chironomids living in the deepest part of the lake. All three periods coincide with increased human activity in the catchment, as deduced from palaeobotanical evidence. Therefore, enhanced nutrient loading of the lake due to the presence of humans and their livestock in the catchment is the most likely cause of the increased anoxia. The chironomid fauna reacted the same way to intensive pasturing during the last ca. 1500 years as to Bronze Age clear-cutting and more moderate pasturing during the Bronze, Iron, and Roman Ages, suggesting that alpine lake ecosystems can be extremely sensitive to human activity in the catchment. On the other hand, the chironomid assemblages show a considerable amount of resilience to human disturbance, as the chironomid fauna reverted to the pre-impact stage after the first two periods of human activity. In recent years, even though pasturing decreased again, the chironomid fauna has only partly recovered. This is possibly due to other human-induced changes in the lake ecosystem, e. g., the stocking of the lake with fish. The chironomid stratigraphy is difficult to interpret climatologically as the strongest changes in chironomid-inferred temperatures coincide with periods of intensive human activity in the catchment.

AB  - The continuing decline in biodiversity presents a major environmental protection challenge. The conservation of sufficiently extensive and diverse habitats requires an array of coordinated actions, often involving large areas. While a set of conservation objectives have been defined for the Natura 2000 network, no universal methods of accomplishing them have been specified, and so they must be designed by individual Member States. Deadwood volume and the density of large deadwood pieces are widely used for evaluating the quality of forest habitat types designated under the Habitats Directive. In the present study, data from 5557 sample plots were used to evaluate the mean values of the two deadwood indicators as well as the ratio of deadwood volume to living tree volume for each of the 13 habitat types in Poland. In addition, a logistic regression model was constructed to evaluate the effects of terrain, site, and tree stand characteristics as well as protection type on deadwood volume in Natura 2000 areas. Mean deadwood volume varied greatly between habitat types, with the lowest values found for Central European lichen Scots pine forests (91T0-2.5 m(3)ha(-1)) and Old acidophilous oak woods (9190-4.4 m(3)ha(-1)), and the highest for Riparian mixed forests (91F0-43.1 m(3)ha(-1)) and AcidophilousPiceaforests of the montane to alpine levels (9410-55.4 m(3)ha(-1)). The ratio of deadwood volume to living tree volume ranged from approx. 1%-17%. Additionally, the presence of large deadwood differed among habitat types: in some, there were no deadwood pieces with a diameter of >= 50 cm, while their maximum density was 6.1 pieces ha(-1). The logistic regression model showed that the likelihood of a habitat type to have a 'favorable conservation status' as defined by deadwood abundance (a threshold of at least 20 m(3)ha(-1)according to Polish manuals on habitat type evaluation) increased with sample plot elevation, site fertility, and moisture, as well as stand age and volume. Positive effects were also observed for forests under strict and active protection versus managed forests. Planned efforts are necessary to enhance the quality of habitats with insufficient deadwood, especially in managed forests. Special attention should be given to areas that are readily accessible due to gentle terrain and low site moisture. Furthermore, younger stands on less fertile sites may require intervention to promote deadwood accumulation. We recommend retaining a certain proportion of mature stands until natural death and decomposition. Increasing the density of large deadwood is currently one of the most pressing conservation needs in most habitat types.

AB  - The Es-3(L) (lower sub-member of the third member of the Eocene Shahejie Formation) shale in the Jiyang Depression is a set of relatively thick and widely deposited lacustrine sediments with elevated organic carbon, and is considered to be one of the most important source rocks in East China. We can determine the mineralogy, organic and inorganic geochemistry of the Es-3(L) shale and calculate paleoclimate indexes by using multiple geochemical proxies based on organic chemistry (total organic carbon [TOC] and Rock-Eval pyrolysis), major and trace elements, X-Ray diffraction, and carbon and oxygen isotope data from key wells alongside ECS (Elemental Capture Spectroscopy) well log data. These indicators can be used to analyze the evolution of the paleoenvironment and provide a mechanism of organic matter (OM) accumulation. The Es-3(L) oil shale has high TOC abundance (most samples >3.0%) and is dominated by Type I kerogens. Additionally, the organic-rich shale is rich in CaO and enrichment in some trace metals is present, such as Sr, Ba and U. The positive delta C-13 and negative delta O-18 values, high Sr/Ba, B/Ga and Ca/Ca + Fe ratios and low C/S ratios indicate that the Es-3(L) shales were mainly deposited in a semi-closed freshwater brackish water lacustrine environment. The consistently low Ti/AI and Si/AI ratios reflect a restricted but rather homogeneous nature for the detrital supply. Many redox indicators, including the Th/U, V/(V + Ni), and delta U ratios, pyrite morphology and TOC-TS-Fe diagrams suggest deposition under dysoxic to suboxic conditions. Subsequently, the brackish saline bottom water evolved into an anoxic water body under a relatively arid environment, during which organic-lean marls were deposited in the early stage. Later, an enhanced warm-humid climate provided an abundant mineral nutrient supply and promoted the accumulation of algal material. OM input from algal blooms reached a maximum during the deposition of the organic-rich calcareous shale with seasonal laminations. High P/Ti ratios and a strongly positive relationship between the P and TOC contents indicate that OM accumulation in the oil shale was mainly controlled by the high primary productivity of surface waters with help from a less stratified water column. Factors such as the physical protection of clay minerals and the dilution of detrital influx show less influence on OM enrichment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Poland is one of the largest common carp producers in the European Union. By 2006, the annual production of carp and other cyprinid fish species had reached around 17 000 t. The economic efficiency of pond farms is not only significant for the performance of Poland's traditional carp market, but it also supports the non-productive environmental functions of earthen carp ponds. The objective of this study was to determine the costs and revenues of carp ponds, and to identify the key conditions for improving the profitability of carp farming in Poland.
   Materials and Methods. Data from 2005-2007 were collected through a survey of 18 carp farms keeping full accounting records of a total pond area of 17 302 ha, accounting for around 34% of the total in Poland. Data was both biological and economic. The former consisted of survival rate of different age groups of fish. The latter included farm revenues (sales of carp and other species, angling fees, and other income sources) and annual production costs. The cost was separated into two main parts, variable-and fixed costs. The income was determined by subtracting the annual total cost from the total revenue. The profitability was defined as the cost-to-income ratio. The results were compared with available economic indicators of carp production in Germany and Hungary in 1999-2002.
   Results. The proceeds from the sale of market-size carp had a predominant share of total revenues of the investigated farms. The variable cost consisted of labour (37%) and feed (20%), while the share of the remaining cost components did not exceed 10% of total expenses of fish farms. Only in 2007 was pond fish production profitable (merely 3.95%) while in 2005 and 2006, the total costs of the farms were higher than their revenues (on average -7.42% and -2.42%, respectively). The average survival rates of stocking carp in the studied farms, including fry between 0 and 2 years of age, were very low at 36% and 38%, respectively. The survival rates of market-size carp were much higher, on average 67%.
   Conclusion. The economic situation of Polish carp farms, within the studied time period, was difficult. The low survival rates of stocking carp seemed to be one of the main causes for the low return on carp production. This may be a compound effect not only of epizootic diseases but also of piscivorous animals and environmental restrictions imposed on carp ponds. Farmers could find it difficult to reconcile fish production with the pond environmental functions and the need to maintain a healthy profit margin without external financial support.

AB  - To compare the impact of parasite control agents in sheep faeces, I kg quantities of fresh faeces were spread uniformly over I m(2) pasture plots in June 2001 (winter; a time of high earthworm activity). Faecal treatments applied to five replicate plots were C(none), C+ (from untreated sheep), B (from sheep with an intra-ruminal bolus releasing a benzimidazole anthelmintic-'albendazole'), NIL (from sheep with a bolus releasing a macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic-'ivermectin'), F (from sheep receiving a daily feed supplement containing chlamydospores of the nematophagous fungus, Duddingtonia flagrans). The disappearance of faeces was assessed visually over the 50 days following faecal application, then soil samples were taken to assess: (a) populations of earthworms and other soil macrofauna, (b) nematodes and other soil microfauna, and (c) the presence of D. flagrans in soil. Faecal disappearance was greatest in F and C+ plots and least in ML and B plots at 12 and 23 days (P < 0.05). Earthworm casting after 23 and 50 days was greater (P < 0.05) in plots with faeces (C+, ML, F, but not B) than in plots without faeces (C-). Greater earthworm activity in plots with faeces was reflected in greater numbers of earthworms, cocoons and greater biomass m(-2) than in C- plots. On the basis of faecal dry weight applied, F plots had most earthworms and ML plots the least. After 50 days total nematodes in 0-5 cm soil showed a treatment effect (P < 0.001), being more abundant in F, C+ and B than in C- and ML plots; enchytraeids, rotifers, tardigrades and copepods showed no treatment effects. A few nematode taxa (Acrobeles, Alaimus, Pungentus, Tylencholaimus) showed significant treatment effects. The greatest effect among nematodes was in nematode channel ratio (NCR) (P < 0.008), with a decrease in F plots; changes in NCR may reflect the impact of earthworm activity on soil processes rather than a direct effect of the fungal treatment on nematodes. D. flagrans did not become established in the soil. During the trial conditions were favourable for earthworms and their activity was high in all treatments receiving faeces, with F and ML plots being the extremes. There was an apparent shift towards fungal-mediated decomposition in F plots. At the end of the 50-day trial, in a period when earthworms were active, there was no evidence of differential effects of any of the anthelmintic treatments on environmental indicators.

AB  - A site in Oak Ridge, TN, USA, has sediments that contain >3% iron oxides and is contaminated with uranium (U). The U(VI) was bioreduced to U(IV) and immobilized in situ through intermittent injections of ethanol. It then was allowed to reoxidize via the invasion of low-pH (3.6 to 4.0), high-nitrate (up to 200 mM) groundwater back into the reduced zone for 1,383 days. To examine the biogeochemical response, high-throughput sequencing and network analysis were applied to characterize bacterial population shifts, as well as cooccurrence and coexclusion patterns among microbial communities. A paired t test indicated no significant changes of alpha-diversity for the bioactive wells. However, both nonmetric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity confirmed a significant distinction in the overall composition of the bacterial communities between the bioreduced and the reoxidized sediments. The top 20 major genera accounted for >70% of the cumulative contribution to the dissimilarity in the bacterial communities before and after the groundwater invasion. Castellaniella had the largest dissimilarity contribution (17.7%). For the bioactive wells, the abundance of the U(VI)-reducing genera Geothrix, Desulfovibrio, Ferribacterium, and Geobacter decreased significantly, whereas the denitrifying Acidovorax abundance increased significantly after groundwater invasion. Additionally, seven genera, i.e., Castellaniella, Ignavibacterium, Simplicispira, Rhizomicrobium, Acidobacteria Gp1, Acidobacteria Gp14, and Acidobacteria Gp23, were significant indicators of bioactive wells in the reoxidation stage. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that nitrate, manganese, and pH affected mostly the U(VI)-reducing genera and indicator genera. Cooccurrence patterns among microbial taxa suggested the presence of taxa sharing similar ecological niches or mutualism/commensalism/synergism interactions.
   IMPORTANCE High-throughput sequencing technology in combination with a network analysis approach were used to investigate the stabilization of uranium and the corresponding dynamics of bacterial communities under field conditions with regard to the heterogeneity and complexity of the subsurface over the long term. The study also examined diversity and microbial community composition shift, the common genera, and indicator genera before and after long-term contaminated-groundwater invasion and the relationship between the target functional community structure and environmental factors. Additionally, deciphering cooccurrence and coexclusion patterns among microbial taxa and environmental parameters could help predict potential biotic interactions (cooperation/competition), shared physiologies, or habitat affinities, thus, improving our understanding of ecological niches occupied by certain specific species. These findings offer new insights into compositions of and associations among bacterial communities and serve as a foundation for future bioreduction implementation and monitoring efforts applied to uranium-contaminated sites.

AB  - High quality forest nursery material is obtained on soils with favorable physico-biological and nutrient-rich properties. Due to insufficient rainfall and uneven distribution, one of the most important melioration treatments in forest nurseries is irrigation, which makes it possible to systematically supplement water with optimum doses for young plants. The economical solution is to use a drip irrigation system, whereby water is delivered directly to the root zone of the plant. An important indicator of the biological quality of soil under forest plantations is enzymatic activity. The effect of drip irrigation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on growth parameters of undergoing mycorrhizal treatment and the activity of soil enzymes dehydrogenases and catalase were evaluated. The research was conducted 2013-2016 on the former land intended for afforestation located in Kruszyn Krajenski (53 degrees 04'53 '' N, 17 degrees 51'52 '' E) near Bydgoszcz (Kuyavian-Pomeranian Province, Central Poland), on the soil classified into a quality class V-VI (black-soil-type degraded belonging to very weak and weak-rye-soil-complexes). Irrigation was used in the two variants: 0 - without irrigation (control) and K - drip irrigation.The experiment included a total of 8 plots (2 x 4). Irrigation was done with the drip line "Euro Drip" where the distance between the dripers was 20 cm. In the research 1-year old Scots pine seedlings with covered root system (container production) was used. Seedlings during production were subjected to a standard combined with mycorrhiza fungus Hebeloma crustuliniforme mycorrhization and bedding based ectohumus forest. The Scots pine seedlings subjected to mycorrhizal colonization were characterized by 100% survival in the four-year study period (2013-2016). The drip irrigation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) significantly increased the height of the above ground part, the diameter of the shoot, and the lateral shoot length. Also, drip irrigated plants were 102% higher compared to the control in 2016 years. Also, pine plants growing under irrigation conditions were 95% larger in shoot diameter than those grown under natural humidity. Drip irrigation resulted in the significant increase of a lateral shoot on the last circle by 58%. Experience shows that irrigation affects soil oxidase and stimulates their activity especially in the deeper layers of the soil profile. The level of irrigation tested in this study is sufficient to maintain both the enzymatic activity of soils and the appropriate production of biomass by pine trees.

AB  - Context: Addressing the environmental impact of agriculture requires a comprehensive analysis of the system at stake, and accounting for the social diversity (i.e. social groups involved in farming and relationships between them) is particularly important for designing efficient policies aimed at mitigating these impacts. However, the integration of this diversity in environmental assessments remains challenging, partly due to the lack of frameworks for combining data and concepts belonging to bio-technical and social sciences. Objective: In this study, we aimed at assessing how the combination of the conceptual frameworks of comparative agriculture and territorial metabolism helps to better understand the environmental impacts of agriculture. In particular, we look at the crop-livestock integration as a possible way to reduce nitrogen losses from agriculture, and study how social diversity shapes this integration. Methods: Combining comparative agriculture and territorial metabolism frameworks, we carried out an intensive fieldwork in Petlad (Gujarat, India) organised in four steps so as to successively (i) capture farm diversity at the micro-regional level, (ii) build archetypes representing farming systems, (iii) assess nitrogen flows at farming systems' level and (iv) model nitrogen metabolism at village level. Results and conclusions: We found that despite obvious potential, crop-livestock interactions were limited, accounting for minor nitrogen flows compared to the flow of inputs, mainly synthetic fertilisers and feed concentrates. The output flows, mainly tobacco, cereals and milk, were also low and most of the input nitrogen was lost to the environment (surplus of over 600 kg N/ha from the cropping system balance), contributing to pollution. While large subsidies for synthetic fertilisers had a role in the development of such huge surpluses, our study showed that this environmentally harmful situation was also influenced by the existing socio-economic conditions and social relations in Petlad. Most of the owners who had sufficient access to land (>1 ha) focused on the very profitable tobacco production and tended to abandon livestock, which they no longer needed either technically or economically. Conversely, households with low or no access to land were motivated to raise dairy animals, in order to supplement small incomes from crops, but faced difficulties in feeding them. We conclude that promoting crop-livestock integration as a potential lever to reduce nitrogen surplus would be unlikely to succeed in the presence of such a strong social lock-in. Significance: Concurring with certain critiques of socio-ecological systems approaches, this result advocates for a better consideration of social diversity in the analysis of the environmental impacts of agriculture and in the design of interventions.

AB  - Although inselbergs are iconic rock outcrops with a high biogeographic value, little is known about drivers responsible for the plant community assembly. The aim of this research was to evaluate how the patch size distribution of vegetation influences the species-area relationship and species abundance distribution of a community in an inselberg of the "Piedra La Tortuga" Natural Monument of the Guayana region, Venezuela. In this context, three research questions were established: What is the effect of patch size on species richness? What species-area model (SAR) has the best fit in those vegetation patches? How is the distribution of species abundances (SADs) induced by the patch size distribution? A stratified random sampling was performed in patches ranging from 0.34 to 14.8 m(2). totaling 40 sampling units (226 m(2)). All individuals found in the 40 patches were identified at species level. The floristic composition in the different samples was represented by 19 families. 22 genera and 24 species, of which 50 % are endemic to inselbergs and two, are threatened of extinction. Two groups of patch sizes were identified (large 8-15 m(2) and small <= 7.9 m(2)) in relation to the abundance and composition of species. The species accumulation curves for each patch size group show a contrasting tendency with marked differences in the observed richness among patch size groups. The curves of the SADs models had a significant adjustment of the geometric series in the two categories of patches. The SAR model of the power function presented the best species-area adjustments, where the increase in patch area accounted for 82% of the variation in the increase in the number of species. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time how vegetation patches of a tropical inselberg have a strong influence on richness, abundance distribution and species composition. Likewise, it was determined that the SAD geometric model presented the best fit in the community as a function of patch size as a resource indicator, where the abundance of a species can be equivalent to a proportion of the space occupied. It is also presumed that changes in patch sizes could be associated with nutrient and water availability, as has been demonstrated in other dryland environments. In some studies it has been argued that variation in species composition among vegetation profiles of tropical inselbergs is mainly conditioned by habitat structure and water deficit. However, it had not been discussed how the size of patches of vegetation has an effect on richness. SADs and SAR analyzes can provide complementary explanations on community assembly in inselbergs.

AB  - Energy balances are increasingly used to assess the energy efficiency and productivity of agricultural production. In this study, energy balances for sugar beet cultivation in commercial farms in Germany were calculated. 109 farmers with 285 fields were interviewed about the sugar beet cultivation 2004. The energy input and the energy output were calculated with standardised balance-sheet approaches and energy equivalents. Calculated energy balance parameters were the energy gain (energy output less input), the output-input ratio (energy output versus input) and the energy intensity (energy input versus natural yield measured in Grain Equivalents). A factor analysis was performed to explain the variation of the energy balance parameters between the fields by crucial factors for energetic efficiency and productivity. Fields with similarly valued factors were grouped into common clusters by a cluster analysis and a discriminant analysis. The influence of specific growing conditions and cultivation methods on the energy balances were examined for the clusters.
   Total energy input (median: 17.3 GJ ha(-1)), energy output (261.7 GJ ha(-1)), energy gain (244.6 GJ ha(-1)), output-input ratio (15.4) and energy intensity (87.4 MJ GE(-1)) revealed a significant variation. The total energy input was significantly lower and the energy yield was significantly higher than in previous studies. Thus, the energy gain and the output-input ratio have clearly risen compared to earlier studies. Today, sugar beet cultivation is energetically more productive and efficient than the cultivation of many other arable crops in Middle Europe.
   The intensity of the cultivation measures irrigation, catch crop cultivation, tillage and N fertilisation as well as the management of all cultivation measures and the site were determined as crucial factors for energy efficiency and productivity. The intensity of the different cultivation measures influenced the total energy input significantly, but no influence on the energy output was determined. In contrast, the cultivation management (quality and adaptation of cultivation measures) was mainly responsible for the energy output. Whereas the cultivation management mostly explained the energy gain, the factor cultivation management and the factors representing cultivation intensity together were responsible for the output-input ratio.
   Cluster and discriminant analysis resulted in the formation of 13 clusters. For clusters with an above-average energy gain and output-input ratio, the intensity and in particular the management of cultivation measures were essential for optimising the energy balance.

TI  - ECONOMICS OF NATURAL-GAS CONVERSION PROCESSES
T2  - FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Industry and academia have been pursuing the conversion of natural gas to higher valued products. Potential process routes include the manufacture of olefins and chemical intermediates, gasoline, and distillate fuels. All indirect manufacturing routes start with a synthesis gas step, which requires expensive steam reforming or partial oxidation of the natural gas feed. The direct routes to conversion seek to convert natural gas directly into a higher valued product and to avoid this costly front-end step. Regardless of the approach, natural gas conversion processes, at their present state of development, typically are capital intensive and generate relatively low cash margins. Although there are exceptions, economic returns typically will be low unless process improvements can be made or unless higher product prices evolve in the future.
   Commercial technology already is in place for the production of three major liquid products from natural gas, which are gasoline, distillate, and methanol. Of these, methanol stands alone in total quantity of natural gas converted, number of process plants, and overall length of time in practice. Consequently, methanol manufacture can be viewed as a basis for the comparison of other, less mature, gas conversion processes.
   This paper examines the potential profitability of a selected group of possible natural gas conversion processes from the perspective of a manufacturing entity that has access to substantial low cost natural gas reserves, capital to invest, and no allegiance to any particular product. The analysis uses the revenues and costs of conventional methanol technology as a framework to evaluate the economics of the alternative technologies. Capital requirements and the potential to enhance cash margins are the primary focus of the analysis.
   The basis of the analysis is a world-scale conventional methanol plant that converts 3.2 Mm(3) per day (120 MMSCFD) of natural gas into 3510 metric tonnes (3869 short tons) per day of methanol. Capital and operating costs are for an arbitrary remote location where natural gas is available at US $0.47 per GJ (US $0.50 per MMBtu). Other costs include ocean freight to deliver the product to market at a US Gulf Coast location.
   Payout time, which is the ratio of the total capital investment to cash margin (revenue less total operating expenses), is the economic indicator for the analysis. Under these conditions, the payout time for the methanol plant is seven years. The payout time for the alternative natural gas conversion technologies is generally much higher, which indicates that they currently are not candidates for commercialization without consideration of special incentives.
   The analysis also includes an evaluation of the effects of process yields on the economics for two potential technologies, oxidative coupling to ethylene and direct conversion to methanol. This analysis suggests areas for research focus that might improve the profitability of natural gas conversion.

AB  - Natural abundance of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) has been used to indicate ecosystem C and N status and cycling; however, use of this approach to infer plant and microbial N preference under projected ecosystem N enrichment is limited. Here, we investigated natural abundance delta C-13 and delta N-15 of five dominant plant species, and soil delta N-15 of microbial biomass and available N forms under N addition in a meadow steppe. Additional N, applied as urea, led to decreases in delta N-15 of soil NO3- (delta N-15(nitrate), from 3.0 to 0.4 parts per thousand) and increases in delta N-15 of soil NH4+ (delta N-15(ammonium), from -1.3 to 11 parts per thousand) and dissolved organic N (delta N-15(DON), from 8.5 to 15 parts per thousand) that reflected increased net nitrification rates, a possible increase in NH3 volatilization, and greater availability of the three N forms. An overall increase in delta N-15 of soil total N (delta N-15(TN)) from 7.1 to 7.9 parts per thousand indicated accelerated and greater openness of soil N cycling that was also partially revealed by enhanced net N mineralization rates. Plant delta N-15, which ranged from -1.8 to 2.1 parts per thousand, generally decreased with N addition, indicating a greater reliance on soil NO3- under N-enrichment conditions. Nitrogen addition decreased delta N-15 of microbial biomass N (from 14 to 2.8 parts per thousand), possibly because of a shift in preferential N form (DON to NO3-), that indicated a convergence of plant and microbial preferential N forms and an increase in plant-microbial N competition. Microbes were thus more flexible than plants in the use of different forms of N. Addition of N decreased plant litter delta C-13, whereas plant species delta C-13 remained unaffected, likely because of a shift in the abundance of dominant species with a greater proportion of biomass coming from delta C-13-depleted species. Enrichment factor (the difference in plant delta N-15 relative to delta N-15(TN)) of four nonlegume species was negatively related to soil inorganic N availability, net nitrification rate, and net N mineralization rate, and was proven to be a good indicator of ecosystem N status. Our study highlights the importance of natural abundance of N-15 as an indicator of plant-microbial N competition and ecosystem N cycling in meadow steppe grasslands under projected ecosystem N enrichment.

AB  - Purpose The research aimed to investigate properties and functions of soils constructed from alkaline mining wastes of different origin to remediate the industrial barren resulted from long-term emissions of the copper-nickel factory in the Subarctic region (Kola Peninsula, Russia). Conventional indicators of the remediation effectiveness (pH and metal content in geochemical fractions) were related to the indicators of soil functions such as biomass production, accumulation of organic carbon, microbial activity, and soil respiration. Materials and methods The experimental area included two sites with polluted and degraded Podzol and Histosol soils located in 1.5 and 0.7 km from the nonferrous (Cu-Ni) smelter, respectively. At the sites, artificial soil constructions were made from mining wastes or quarry sand covered by the vermiculite layer with lawn grasses planted on top. Plant biomass was collected every year starting from the experiment set-up. In 5 to 8 years, soil samples were collected on the layer basis, and chemical, biological, and morphological properties were analyzed. Sequential fractionation of metals was conducted using a modified Tessier's scheme. The microbial biomass and its respiration activity were determined. Micromorphological studies were conducted using an optical microscope. Soil respiration was measured on-site by IRGA with simultaneous observations of soil moisture and temperature. Results The plant growth and residues' deposition at both experimental sites triggered carbon accumulation and resulted in 2-3 times higher content of organic carbon in the upper constructed soil layer compared to the initial content in mining wastes. Carbon accumulation was a key driver for the development of soil microbial communities and had a positive effect on the metal immobilization. This effect was strengthened by high pH inherited from the alkaline wastes and resulted in the performance of constructed soils as geochemical barriers. In their upper layers, where the root biomass was the highest, about 30-60% of Cu and Ni were bound by organic matter. In the underlying polluted soil, the most toxic water-soluble metal fraction was completely neutralized; and the metal concentrations in exchangeable fraction decreased by a factor of four improving the habitat conditions of the microbiome. Organic matter accumulation by clay material with the formation of organo-mineral films was found in the vermiculite-lizardite variant. Conclusion Soil constructions made from alkaline mining wastes in the Subarctic supported the development of plant and microbial communities, organic matter accumulation, and metal immobilization. This technology allows protecting the environment from further pollution under the continuous emissions of the copper-nickel factory.

AB  - Forest ecosystem services such as clean water, wildlife habitat, and timber supplies are increasingly threatened by drought and disturbances (e.g., harvesting, fires and conversion to other uses), which can have great impacts on stand development and water balance. Improved understanding of the hydrologic response of forested systems to drought and disturbance at spatiotemporal resolutions commensurate with these impacts is important for effective forest management. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key hydrologic variable in assessing forest functioning and health, but it remains a challenge to accurately quantify ET at landscape scales with the spatial and temporal detail required for effective decision-making. In this study, we apply a multi-sensor satellite data fusion approach to study the response of forest ET to drought and disturbance over a 7-year period. This approach combines Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET product time series retrieved using a surface energy balance model to generate a multi-year ET datacube at 30-m resolution and daily timesteps. The study area (similar to 900 km(2)) contains natural and managed forest as well as croplands in the humid lower coastal plains in North Carolina, USA, and the simulation period from 2006 to 2012 includes both normal and severe drought conditions. The model results were evaluated at two AmeriFlux sites (US-NC2 and US-NC1) dominated by a mature and a recently clearcut pine plantation, respectively, and showed good agreement with observed fluxes, with 813% relative errors at monthly timesteps. Changes in water use patterns in response to drought and disturbance as well as forest stand aging were assessed using the remotely sensed time series describing total evapotranspiration, the transpiration (T) component of ET, and a moisture stress metric given by the actual-to-reference ET ratio (f(RET)). Analyses demonstrate differential response to drought by land cover type and stand age, with larger impacts on total ET observed in young pine stands than in mature stands which have substantially deeper rooting systems. Transpiration flux shows a clear ascending trend with the growth of young pine plantations, while stand thinning within the plantation leads to decreases in both remotely sensed leaf area index and T, as expected. Time series maps of f(RET) anomalies at 30-m resolution capture signals of drought, disturbance and the subsequent recovery after clearcut at the stand scale and may be an effective indicator for water use change detection and monitoring in forested landscapes.

AB  - Phosphate oxoanions and phosphorylated biomolecules (such as nucleotides, lipids, and proteins) play key roles in a wide range of biological processes. The ability to selectively detect these ions in the presence of each other has numerous applications in biochemistry and biomedicine. However, receptors and sensors that can discriminate between polyphosphate species with high selectivity and in biologically relevant conditions are rare.
   In this Account, we show how peptides (both cyclic and linear) can be used to position two zinc(II)dipicolylamine [Zn(II)DPA] binding sites in an appropriate arrangement to provide selective binding of pyrophosphate (PPi) in the presence of other polyphosphate species, including ATP, and in complex media such as cell growth buffer.
   The use of peptide scaffolds to position the Zn(II)DPA anion binding sites allowed the synthesis of small receptor libraries in which the arrangement of the two binding sites could be subtly altered to evaluate the factors affecting both binding selectivity and affinity for PPi. We altered a number of structural elements including peptide length, cyclic peptide ring size, amino acid composition, the positioning of the binding sites with respect to one another, and the relative stereochemistry of the peptides. Backbone modified cyclic peptides based on the Lissoclinum class of natural products were initially employed to provide an added degree of preorganization to the receptors, although it was subsequently found that short, flexible bis[Zn(II)DPA]-functionalized linear peptides are also effective scaffolds for selective pyrophosphate recognition.
   The peptidic receptors were successfully employed for the detection of PPi in aqueous media by indicator displacement assays using both colorimetric and fluorescent indicators, with the best compounds able to bind to PPi selectively in both cell growth media and artificial urine and also allow the accurate determination of PPi concentrations in physiologically relevant ranges (micromolar concentrations) in these complex media. Improved pyrophosphate selectivity was observed upon increasing the complexity of the media from HEPES buffer to cell growth media (Krebs saline).
   Pyrophosphate sensors in which a fluorescent indicator was covalently attached to either a linear or cyclic peptide scaffold through a flexible linker were then constructed. When the Zn(II)DPA binding sites and the indicator were suitably placed with respect to one another on the peptide scaffold, these 'intramolecular indicator displacement assays' showed improved selectivity for PPi over other polyphosphate anions, such as ATP, when compared to the intermolecular indicator displacement assays. This observation provides the basis for the design and application of future PPi sensors in biochemistry and biomedicine.

AB  - In European forests, large scale biodiversity monitoring networks need to be implemented - networks which include components such as taxonomical groups that are at risk and that depend directly on forest stand structure. In this context, monitoring the species-rich group of saproxylic beetles is challenging. In the absence of sufficient resources to comprehensively survey a particular group, surrogates of species richness can be meaningful tools in biodiversity evaluations. In search of restricted subsets of species to use as surrogates of saproxylic beetle richness, we led a case study in Western Europe.
   Beetle data were compiled from 67 biodiversity surveys and ecological studies carried out from 1999 to 2010 with standardised trapping methods in France and Belgium. This large-scale dataset contains 642 forest plots, 1521 traps and 856 species. Twenty-two simplified species subsets were identified as potential surrogates, as well as the number of genera, a higher taxonomic level, taking into account, for each surrogate, the effort required for species identification, the practical monitoring experience necessary, the species conservation potential or the frequency of species occurrence. The performance of each surrogate was analyzed based on the following parameters: overall surrogacy (correlation between subset richness and total species richness), surrogacy vs. identification cost balance, surrogacy variation over a wide range of ecological conditions (forest type, altitude, latitude and bio-geographical area) and consistency with spatial scale. Ecological representativeness and ability to monitor rare species were supplementary criteria used to assess surrogate performance.
   The subsets consisting of the identifiable (or only easy-to-identify species) could easily be applied in practice and appear to be the best performing subsets, from a global point of view.
   The number of genera showed good prediction at the trap level and its surrogacy did not vary across wide environmental gradients. However, the subset of easy-to-identify species and the genus number were highly sensitive to spatial scale, which limits their use in large-scale studies. The number of rare species or the species richness of single beetle families (even the best single-family subset, the Cerambycidae) was very weak surrogates for total species richness. Conversely, the German list of monitoring species had high surrogacy, low identification costs and was not strongly influenced by the main geographical parameters, even with our French and Belgian data.
   In European-wide monitoring networks, such internationally validated subsets could be very useful with regard to the timing and cost-efficiency of field inventories. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Production diseases are often of multi-factorial origin in which environment (housing, nutrition and management) health and reproductive challenges show complex interactions. The aim of this study was to identify specific environment-related factors and to discuss their associations with health, welfare and reproductive performance in sows and piglets, in diverse systems using data from 130 farms from five EU countries.
   Two sets of data were used: a) a questionnaire was developed for sows and piglets covering farm management, interventions and housing and b) farm production data covering various performance parameters. Eight parameters were further selected, four of which were related to sow reproductive performance (litter index, replacement rate, repeat breeding (i.e. failure to breed after one mating), weaning to first mating interval) and the remaining four to litter / piglet health performance (piglets born alive per litter, piglets born dead per litter, preweaning mortality rate and weaned piglets per litter).
   Univariable and multivariable linear models were employed to identify risk factors. Associations were considered significant if P <= 0.007 (a criterion of p <= 0.05 corrected for the number of parameters tested). Various risk and protective factors were identified for each tested outcome variable. Country effects were included in all models as a fixed factor. Adjusted R-squared values for the multivariable models varied between 9.6% (preweaning mortality) and 66% (litter index).
   Litter index (litters/sow/year) was negatively associated with a higher weaning age of the piglets. Housing recently weaned sows to be inseminated in a separate unit from the gestation unit had a positive association with litter index. Repeat breeding was negatively associated with PRRS-free farms, farms that bred (raised) all gilts on the farm and farms that perform farrowing induction of sows. PRRS-free farms were also associated with a higher replacement rate.
   Farms that bred gilts on the farm and PRRS-free farms were negatively associated with preweaning mortality. Natural ventilation in the gestation unit was associated with fewer piglets born alive and with fewer weaned piglets. Closed type of farms was associated with less piglets born dead. The use of open box housing system for pregnant sows (provision of individual resting areas) was associated with more weaned piglets.
   In conclusion, several factors related to applying good farm and health management, and optimal housing conditions showed positive association with various sow and piglet performance parameters. Further studies will help to assess causal links for these factors.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the impact of participation in sustainable agricultural intensification practices (SAIPs) on household food security status in Northwestern Ghana.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study utilised the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) indicator for the measurement of food access data from 168 households in ten communities from the Northwestern region of Ghana for the analyses. Households were categorised into participating households (treatment) and non-participating households (control). The endogenous treatment effects model was employed to evaluate the impact of participation in SAIPs training on food insecurity access scale.
   Findings - The results show that participation in SAIPs training lowers, on average, the household food insecurity access by 2.95 points, approximately an 11 per cent reduction in HFIAS score. Other significant factors found to influence household food insecurity access scale are age of household head, experience in farming, total acres owned by household, income level of the household and occupation of the head of the household.
   Research limitations/implications - The training programme of participation in SAIPs has massive implications for food security, rural economy and farmers' livelihoods. However, due to the unique conditions prevailing in Northwestern Ghana, the findings of this research are limited in terms of their generalisability. Future research direction in the area of SAIPs trainings and impact study replications in all qualifying rural food production areas in Ghana, which are susceptible to household food insecurity, will provide a national picture of the efficacy of SAIPs trainings on household food insecurity.
   Practical implications - A proven means to decrease natural resource degradation, increase crops yields, and increase subsistence farmers' income, and food security is an important intervention to resolve the seasonal food shortage, which last for five months in a typical year for agro-food-dependent farming communities in Northwestern Ghana.
   Social implications - Ensuring household food security improvement and environmental sustainability will help improve living standards of food producers and reduce the adverse social challenges associated with food insecure communities such as health problems due to food deficiencies, social inequalities, environmental pollution and natural resource degradation in Northwestern Ghana.
   Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is the novel thought and approach to examine the impact of the SAIPs trainings on household food security in Northwestern Ghana using the household food insecurity access scale indicator. The study also examined the factors that affect household food security using the endogenous treatment model, which also evaluates the impact of the training programme on the outcome variable.

AB  - The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority has been implementing a regulatory cooperation program in the Russian Federation for over 10 years, as part of the Norwegian government's Plan of Action for enhancing nuclear and radiation safety in northwest Russia. The overall long-term objective has been the enhancement of safety culture and includes a special focus on regulatory supervision of nuclear legacy sites. The initial project outputs included appropriate regulatory threat assessments, to determine the hazardous situations and activities which are most in need of enhanced regulatory supervision. In turn, this has led to the development of new and updated norms and standards, and related regulatory procedures, necessary to address the often abnormal conditions at legacy sites.
   This paper presents the experience gained within the above program with regard to radio-ecological characterization of Sites of Temporary Storage for spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste at Andreeva Bay and Gremikha in the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia. Such characterization is necessary to support assessments of the current radiological situation and to support prospective assessments of its evolution. Both types of assessments contribute to regulatory supervision of the sites. Accordingly, they include assessments to support development of regulatory standards and guidance concerning: control of radiation exposures to workers during remediation operations; emergency preparedness and response; planned radionuclide releases to the environment; development of site restoration plans, and waste treatment and disposal. Examples of characterization work are presented which relate to terrestrial and marine environments at Andreeva Bay. The use of this data in assessments is illustrated by means of the visualization and assessment tool (DATAMAP) developed as part of the regulatory cooperation program, specifically to help control radiation exposure in operations and to support regulatory analysis of management options. For assessments of the current radiological situation, the types of data needed include information about the distribution of radionuclides in environmental media. For prognostic assessments, additional data are needed about the landscape features, on-shore and off-shore hydrology, geochemical properties of soils and sediments, and possible continuing source terms from continuing operations and on-site disposal. It is anticipated that shared international experience in legacy site characterization can be useful in the next steps. Although the output has been designed to support regulatory evaluation of these particular sites in northwest Russia, the methods and techniques are considered useful examples for application elsewhere, as well as providing relevant input to the International Atomic Energy Agency's international Working Forum for the Regulatory Supervision of Legacy Sites.

AB  - Early detection and comprehensive monitoring of inland water algal blooms is fundamental to their effective management and mitigation of potential ecosystem and public health impacts. With the spatial and temporal limitations of in situ sampling, algal bloom monitoring capabilities have been enhanced greatly by advancements in satellite Earth Observation (EO). Three turbid, eutrophic Canadian lakes (Lake Winnipeg (LW); Lake Erie (LE); Lake of the Woods (LoW)) have been the focus of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) research and monitoring initiatives due to concerns over persistent degraded water quality from recurring algal blooms. ECCC's EOLakeWatch was developed to deliver a suite of useful, easily interpretable, and accessible EO-derived products to support algal bloom monitoring on these three lakes. Algal bloom indices, describing bloom spatial extent, intensity, duration, and severity were derived using the European Space Agency's OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) sensor for observations from 2016 to present and its predecessor MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) for 2002 to 2011. Results document widespread blooms on each lake, with maximum spatial extent of 21,641 km(2) (representing 88.1% of the lake area) on LW, 3070 km(2) (79.5%) on LoW and 5257 km(2) (19.7%) on LE. Bloom intensity showed seasonal and inter-annual variability on all three lakes, with a suggestion that LoW may be responding to reduced nutrient loads with a recent decrease in bloom intensity. Annual bloom duration on LW and LoW was on average 44 and 47 days respectively, while on LE blooms were significantly shorter in duration at an average of 24 days. Variance among the derived bloom indices was shown to be significant (i.e. the most extensive bloom was not necessarily the longest or most intensive), demonstrating the need for the indices to be used collectively, or for any single comprehensive bloom indicator to capture the variability of all individual metrics. Bloom indices are processed in a fully automated operational capacity, distributed in near-real-time through a web portal and collated into end-user-friendly annual algal bloom reports for each lake. These products go a long way to address existing monitoring gaps, delivering prompt, consistent measures of lake-wide algal bloom conditions required to provide stakeholders with early warning of bloom risks, identify areas of potential concern, quantify spatio-temporal trends, further understand bloom dynamics and drivers, as well as guide and determine the effectiveness of implemented management actions.

AB  - The Zoige Plateau Wetland is the largest high-altitude swamp wetland in China. It plays a key role in ecological balance and the global change. Climate change and improper utilization have consequently resulted in decreased wetland area, disrupted ecosystem structure, and wetland function degradation and function loss. The Zoige Plateau Wetland thus faces severe ecological degradation problems. In this study, selecting the Zoige Plateau Wetland as the study area, remote sensing was used to track the ecological degradation process during 2000-2015 from three aspects (area degradation, structure degradation and function degradation) and at three administrative levels (study area, county and key township). To assess the wetland degradation quantitatively, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to construct a composite wetland degradation index based on five indicators: wetland area change rate, landscape fractal dimension, landscape fragmentation, vegetation biomass and vegetation coverage. The results showed the following. (1) In terms of area change rate, the total wetland area had continuously decreased during 2000-2015 compared to that in the 1990s, and 2010 was the most significant. The frequency of negative change in the wetland area reached 87.5% in all four counties and across four time periods (2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015), and 85% at the township level. At the spatial scale, Hongyuan County had the smallest wetland area change rate. (2) In terms of structure change, the variations in landscape fractal dimension and landscape fragmentation generally exhibited similar trends at different levels. Specifically, the ecosystem structure was seriously affected in 2000, then gradually recovered in 2005 and 2010, and was again under aggravated interference in 2015. (3) In terms of function change, the above-ground biomass yield in the northeastern region was higher than that in the southern region. A low value was detected in 2000, and then the value increased and remained essentially the same in 2005 and 2010. However, the value decreased in 2015, indicating deteriorated vegetation condition. The vegetation coverage in the study area remained steady, without deterioration in a particular year. (4) In terms of the whole study area, the wetland degradation grades in the four periods were mild (2000), moderate (2005), mild (2010) and mild (2015). In brief, the wetland degradation was the most severe in 2005. Over the 2000-2015 period, the spatial degradation pattern of the Zoige Plateau Wetland progressed from the northeast to the southwest. The model built in this study could be widely applicable. And this study has also some reference value for monitoring and management of wetland degradation by remote sensing.

AB  - Human-induced impact on the biocoenoses in small water bodies within field landscape, aquatic ecosystems undergoing habitat loss, is not only restricted to trophic increase. Ponds are often used for amateur fish production, mainly carp and crucian carp. In addition, in order to limit the growth of aquatic vegetation alien fish species to native fauna, grass carp, are frequently introduced. Only temporary ponds remain entirely free of such manipulations. Therefore, changes in diversity and the occurrence of specific species can be expected in ponds representing different scenarios of fish predation FP and water regime WR.
   In order to establish conditions responsible for zooplankton occurrence in field ponds subjected to FP (three categories of ponds: fish-free; low fish stocking; high fish stocking) and WR (two categories of ponds: permanent vs. temporary), material was collected from the open water of six neighbouring ponds, thirteen times in 2009, covering the spring, summer and autumn. A total of 134 zooplankton taxa was recorded with rotifers (94 taxa) prevailing taxonomically over cladocerans (24) and copepods (16). A tendency of certain taxa and species diversity to group along a gradient of WR and FP was observed. Higher species diversity was attributed to fish-free ponds, partly depending on the higher contribution of macrophyte-dominated areas, which are known to support a high variation of organisms. Two groups from among the most frequent species that indicated temporary ponds were: 1/littoral-associated (e.g. Lepadella ovalis, Chydorus sphaericus) in fish-free ponds and 2/large-bodied mainly pelagic (e.g. Eudiaptomus gracilis) in low-fish ponds. Fish ponds that were of permanent character, however, had lower species richness, with a high frequency of typically eutrophic taxa such as Brachionus angularis, Keratella cochlearis f. tecta or Trichocerca pusilla. However, they were also a source of rare species such as Brachionus falcatus, Lecane tenuiseta, Ceriodaphnia dubia that occurred exclusively in these ponds compared to natural fish-free ponds, which were remnants of lost species richness. This in turn increased overall zooplankton richness in the regional aspect. Thus, the co-occurrence of temporary ponds along with fish-production targeted permanent ponds may lead to a rise in zooplankton biodiversity on a local scale. We assume therefore that not only patterns of zooplankton biodiversity but also the occurrence of particular species can be treated as a useful indicator of FP and WR in small water bodies and are crucial for conservation purposes and management of aquatic systems at regional and landscape levels.

AB  - The presence and abundance of particular nematode genera in marine sediments are bioindicators of environmental disturbance. They can even reveal the existence of specific toxicants, such as trace-metals and hydrocarbons derived from fossil fuels. We studied this important infaunal component during a three-year monitoring program in Mexico's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the aftermath of a major oil spill in the northern Gulf of Mexico caused by the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon platform (DWH) in April of 2010. A closer look at the nematode composition and density values throughout and after the DWH oil spill revealed considerable changes. Continental shelf and upper slope sediments sampled in the summer of 2010 included 48 genera and a density of 44.45 ind/10 cm(-2). Eight months later in the winter of 2011, there was a critical decrement in genera number (23) and density (25.22 ind/10 cm(-2)). However, in 2012, the nematode community showed signs of recovery: genus diversity was 58 with a density of 91.45 ind/10 cm(-2). Significant differences were recorded between the first and the last sampling periods, driven by a remarkable turn-over in genera composition, and by an increase in density of the genera Sabatieria, Dorylaimopsis, and Cheironchus. Similarly, significant spatial differences between the nematofauna of the inner-middle shelf and the deepest zone (> 2000 m) were detected. Correlation analyses confirmed the tolerant behavior of the above genera to Ni and Co, and their proliferation when hydrocarbon compounds presumably derived from the DWH oil spill increased throughout the study. The Maturity Index (MI) estimated for each survey ranged from 2.35 to 2.6. Environmental Quality Status conditions in the summer of 2010 were good while in the winter of 2011 were poor, and moderate towards the winter of 2012. Index of Trophic Diversity (ITD) values for each survey were high: 0.70, 0.68, and 0.74, respectively. A high predominance of feeding guilds 1B and 2B was recorded throughout the study.
   The estimated Index of Trophic Diversity (ITD) values resulted high (Table 5). These values apparently indicated that the four feeding types were proportionally distributed in the nematode assemblage. This fact was better reflected during the winter of 2012. Nonetheless, these results are not congruent with the high predominance of feeding guilds 1B and 2B observed throughout the study.

AB  - The Jifarah Arch of NW Libya is a structurally prominent feature at the eastern end of the regional Talemzane Arch, separating the Ghadamis hydrocarbon province to the south from the offshore Pelagian province to the north. The Arch has experienced a complex structural history with repeated episodes of uplift, exhumation and burial. This paper provides a provisional assessment of its hydrocarbon habitat based on detailed geochemical analyses of potential Triassic, Silurian and Ordovician source rocks encountered by wells drilled in the area. Twenty-seven core and cuttings samples of marine shales were collected from eight widely- dispersed wells and analyzed using standard Rock-Eval pyrolysis techniques. Kerogen types II-III were identified in the majority of Triassic samples analysed, indicating a low hydrocarbon generation potential, but oil-prone Type II kerogen was found in the basal Silurian Tanezzuft Formation and Ordovician Memouniat Formation. The presence of steranes and acyclic isoprenoids suggested variable inputs of algal, bacterial and terrestrial organic matter, while biomarkers including C-30-gammacerane and -carotene and selected biomarker ratios (Pr/Ph ratio and homohopane index) were used to assess their depositional environment. Results indicate that extended zones with periodic (if not continuous) oxygen-deficient conditions existed throughout the basin during Late Ordovician and Early Silurian time, favouring the preservation of organic matter. The thermal maturity of the samples was assessed by Rock-Eval pyrolysis, zooclast reflectance, molecular ratios including C(32-)22S/(22S+22R)-homohopanes, Ts/(Ts+Tm), C-29-steranes and parameters based on the relative abundance of methylphenanthrene, methyldibenzothiophene and methylnaphthalene isomers. The results indicate significant variability in thermal maturity, with Ordovician and Silurian source rocks ranging from 0.6% to 0.7% VRo equivalent increasing to 1.0% locally. These values represent palaeo-maturities achieved at different times in the past and are considered too low to have generated significant volumes of hydrocarbons directly. However the downdip equivalents of these source rocks in the adjacent Ghadamis Basin contributed to prolific petroleum systems. The absence of large petroleum accumulations on the Jifarah Arch contrasts with the western part of the geologically similar Talemzane Arch, which harbours several giant and supergiant oil and gas fields. This difference is attributed both to the complex structural history of the Jifarah Arch, which permitted post-charge leakage of palaeo-accumulations, and stratigraphic migration barriers which restricted migration between Tanezzuft source rocks and Ordovician and Triassic reservoirs.

AB  - Improved remediation strategies or predictive modelling of acid mine drainage (AMD) sites, require detailed understanding of the sulphide oxidation reaction pathways, as well as pollutant-source characterisation. In this study, ore minerals, solids and water-soluble fractions of an oxidising Cu-W-F skarn tailings in Yxsjoberg, Sweden, were chemically and isotopically (delta S-34 and delta O-18) characterised to reveal sulphate (SO42-) sources, sulphide oxidation reaction pathways and historical environmental conditions in the tailings. delta S-34 was additionally used to trace the weathering of danalite [(Fe,Mn,Zn)(4)Be-3(SiO4)(3)S], a rare and unstable sulphur-bearing silicate mineral containing high concentrations of beryllium (Be) and zinc (Zn). Eighteen subsamples from a drill core of the tailings were subjected to batch leaching tests to obtain water-soluble fractions, which reflected both existing porewaters and easily-soluble secondary minerals. The tailings were categorised into three geochemical zones: (i) oxidised zone (OZ), (ii) transition zone (TZ) and (iii) unoxidised zone (UZ), based on prevailing pH, elemental concentrations and colour. The upper OZ (UOZ) showed a sharp depletion of sulphur (S) and relatively higher delta O-18(SO4) values (3.0 to +0.1%) whereas the underlying lower OZ (LOZ) showed S accumulation and lower delta O-18(SO4) values (4.6 to 4.2%). The higher delta O-18(SO4) suggested the role of atmospheric oxygen, O-2 (as oxidant), contribution of evaporated rainwaters and/or evaporation in the upper zones of the tailings. The lower delta O-18(SO4) values were indicative of ferric iron (Fe3+) as oxidant and the possible incorporation of O-16 into SO42- during its formation, most probably from snow melt or depleted rainwater. The delta S-34(SO4) values in the OZ (+2.3 to +2.4%) suggested SO42- from pyrrhotite oxidation in the UOZ which has been subsequently mobilised to the LOZ. Low delta S-34 fractionation (+0.2 to +1.9%) between SO42- in the OZ and pyrrhotite, as well as the low delta O-18(SO4) values in the LOZ suggested the complete oxidation of pyrrhotite by Fe3+, signalling that previously, a low pH (<3) prevailed in the tailings. Mineralogical observations confirmed that pyrrhotite was completely oxidised in the UOZ, with the formation of hydrous ferric oxides (HFOs) coatings. The observed current high delta O-18(SO4) and pH (3.9-4.5) values in the UOZ were attributed to decreased oxidation rate and silicate buffering, limiting the availability of aqueous Fe3+ and subsequent formation of HFOs. The delta S-34(SO4) signatures of the water-soluble SO42- in the TZ and UUZ suggested the dissolution of gypsum which precipitated from a leachate from the weathering of danalite in the UOZ. In the middle UZ, the delta S-34(SO4) (0.8 to +0.6%) and delta O-18(SO4) (1.8 to 1.0%) signatures corresponded to SO42- from a mixture of pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite oxidation by O-2 at the LOZ (i.e. oxidation front). Negative delta S-34 fractionation values (3.0 to 1.
   6%) between these minerals and the water-soluble SO42- were attributed to the potential formation of intermediate S species, due to the partial oxidation of the sulphides. Consequently, the S accumulation in the LOZ could be due to the likely formation of the intermediate S species and secondary pyrite identified in this zone. The lower UZ coincided with the groundwater table and registered consistent negative delta S-34(SO4) (2.6 to 1.8%) and delta O-18(SO4) (7.6 to 4.4%) values. These signatures were hypothesised to be controlled by SO42- from the mineralisation of organic S in peat underneath the tailings and/or H2S oxidation, with possible contribution from sulphide oxidation in the tailings. This study highlights the usefulness of delta S-34 and delta O-18 as tracers of geochemical processes and environmental conditions that have existed in the tailings.

AB  - The state of the external respiration system is one of the most important factors determining the functional capabilities of the body of athletes and the effectiveness of sports activities. Indicators of its functioning among northerner athletes are modulated not only by the training process, but also by climatic and geographical factors. Literature data on the study of the function of external respiration in ski racers in the annual cycle are absent, there are only works considering seasons or some months of the year. Therefore, the aim of our work is to study the volumetric characteristics of the function of external respiration in the annual cycle of ski racers living and training in the European North, which is important for understanding the mechanisms of adaptation to environmental conditions during sports activities, as well as the influence of environmental conditions on the success of training and competitive processes.
   Seventy people aged 16-34 years (20.2 +/- 0.6 years) participated in the study. Participants were professional athletes living in the territory of the European North (62 degrees N, 51 degrees E) practically since birth. Studies were carried out monthly for 7 years. Every subject's height and body weight were measured during the tests. External respiration function (FEV) was determined using microprocessor spirograph SPM-01-"R-D" of the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Medical Instruments and Equipment (Russia) in a sitting position. The height of ski racers was 175.9 +/- 0.6 cm; their body weight was 69.4 +/- 0.7 kg. In the annual cycle, the following was studied: tidal volume of respiration (Vt) and minute volume of respiration (MV), vital (VC) and forced vital (FVC) lung capacity, inspiratory (IRV) and expiratory (ERV) reserve volumes, forced expiratory volume in 0.5 second (FEV0.5) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), as well as Tiffeneau-Pinelli index (FEV1/FVC). The obtained data were processed using Fisher's and Student's tests with the Bonferroni correction. Data were presented as arithmetic mean and mean error (M +/- m(M)). The studies were conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 1964, as modified by the WMA General Assemblies from 1975 to 2013. The methods were approved by the bioethics committee of the Komi Scientific Centre, Ural Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences (Syktyvkar, Russia).
   For ski racers, for the first time, the values of volumetric characteristics of the function of external respiration were determined and the ranges of annual changes in these indicators were identified, which are from 56.3 to 11.5% and are most pronounced for inspiratory and expiratory reserve volumes, as well as the tidal volume. We established that ski racers who live and train in the North, compared to non-athletic men, are characterized by increased tidal volume (12.6%), vital capacity (15.7%) and forced vital capacity (15.5%), inspiratory and expiratory reserve volumes (59.2%), forced expiratory volume in a half-second and a second (0.5-25.9%,), Tiffeneau-Pirelli index (3.4%) and reduced minute ventilation (9.1%) (See Tables 1 and 2). The annual dynamics of indicators of the function of external respiration made it possible to determine February as the month with maximum adaptation to the climatic conditions of the cold period of the year against the background of the competitive period and September-October as months favorable for the function of the respiratory system against the background of the preparatory training period (See Fig. 1 and 2). Apparently, for ski racers, the adaptation of the respiratory system to the cold period of the year occurs two months earlier than for non-athletic men, and the period of a more comfortable functional state lasts one month longer. Athletes during the annual weather - climate cycle have a deeper remodeling of the respiratory system, compared to non-athletic men, due to living in a cold climate and the training process. The identified features of the functioning of the respiratory system in ski racers allow more purposeful planning of the training process and measures of health correction in the North.

AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forming coenopopulations in diverse soil-hydrological conditions is of utmost interest in studying the environmental mechanisms of divergence among populations of tree species. The analysis of protein polymorphism educed the genetic differentiation between bog land and upland coenopopulations of Scots pine, emerging from phenological isolation. Thus, we find it essential to study further the mechanisms of developing the population structure of tree plants with the use of more meaningful methods of molecular genetic analysis that would allow identifying differences at the DNA level. The aim of the research is to study the indicators of genetic diversity and differentiation of coenopopulations of Scots pine growing in contrastive swamp and dry land conditions, using ISSR markers.
   The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method with IS SR primers was used to identify the level of genetic polymorphism and differentiation. DNA for analysis was isolated from the cambial layer of the trunk using the CTAB method. Four upland and three bog coenopopulations were studied in total (See Table 1). Within each coenopopulation, 30 trees were analyzed using (CA)(6)AGCT, (CA)(6)AG, (CA)(6)GT, (CA)(6)AC, (AG)(8)T and (AG)(8)GCT primers. We used the following reaction mixture (total volume of 10 mu l) to amplify DNA with ISSR primers: 1 mu l of PCR buffer; 0.2 mu l 10 mM dNTPs; 0.1 mu l of 100 gm primer; 1 mu l of DNA sample; 0.1 mu l of Taq polymerase (2 u / op; 7.6 mu l of water. PCR mode: 5 min. denaturation at 94 degrees C, 35 cycles: 0.5 min. denaturation at 94 degrees C, 45 sec. annealing at 60 degrees C, 45 sec elongation at 72 degrees C, final elongation for 7 min at 72 degrees C. The PCR results were visualized by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel in TBE buffer. The results were recorded and data were processed using the GelDoc 2000 gel documentation system (Bio-Rad, USA) and the Quantity One (R) Version 4.6.3 software package. The date analysis was performed by the software tools POPGENE ver. 1.31., POPTREEW, GenAlEx and PAST 3.25.
   We revealed that out of 215 ISSR-loci elicited in 240 trees out of eight coenopopulations 208 ISSR-loci were polymorphic. The number of elicited ISSR loci in different coenopopulations varied from 162 to 194 (See Table 2). The studied coenopopulations were characterized by different levels of genetic diversity. Indicators of genetic diversity ranged within the following: the proportion of polymorphic loci was 67.9-88.5; the observed number of alleles was 1.679-1.805; effective number of alleles 1.279-1.331; the expected heterozygosity was 0.174-0.207. However, no dependency of genetic diversity indicators on soil-hydrological conditions has been found. Moreover, we considered that dry and bog coenopopulations differed significantly in the ISSR-markers frequency obtained with five of six ISSR-primers, which indicates a different genetic structure (See Table 3). Nei's genetic distance between different coenopopulations varied from 0.100 to 0.317. The UPGMA dendrogram and analysis of principal coordinates (PCoA) show that the bog forests make up a separate cluster (See Fig. 1 and 2). This may be a sign that there are genetic processes inducing the divergence of dry and bog coenopopulations of Scots pine. The Mantel test shows that genetic distance between populations had a weak positive correlation with geographic distance (R=0.3085, P=0.1728). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) shows that 9% of total variation was accounted for by differences between groups of upland and bog land coenopopulations (See Table 4). The percentage of genetic variation among coenopopulations within compared groups was 13%. The majority of the variation was found within populations (78%). The overall level of genetic subdivision of coenopopulations was 17% (G(ST)=0.17), hence, the main part of genetic variation is inside the coenopopulations (83%) (See Table 5). Thus, we showed a significant impact on the genetic structure formation of P. sylvestris population in this research.

AB  - A commercial sprayer operated at a field speed of 24 km h(-1) simultaneously applied glufosinate-ammonium through seven spray tip treatments spaced along a 30.5 m boom for measured foliar deposits of herbicide in 35 cm tall Palmer amaranth weeds and spray deposits on foliar-mounted water-sensitive paper (WSP). The experiment followed one that found increased herbicide deposits for dual tips with an adjacent, fore-aft mount, downward-pointed pre-orifice tip (Extremely Coarse) operated with blended pulse-width modulation (bPWM) and a pre-orifice tip (Fine) operated constant (non-bPWM) under moderate ambient wind velocities from 3.1 to 4.1 m s(-1). Additional dual-tip treatments were added to the dual-tip configuration for the current experiment to expand droplet Coarseness and to add dual tips operated constant to isolate bPWM effects. Tested treatments in common with the previous experiment included the original dual-tip bPWM and non-bPWM combination, Y-adapter fore-aft-mounted pre-orifice tips with diverging spray patterns both operated bPWM, and an air-induction extended-range tip operated constant. Palmer amaranth weeds, total spray volume rate of 93.5 L ha(-1), sprayer speed of 24 km h(-1), and test methods were similar between studies, except for negligible wind in the current experiment. Conditions were clear and sunny during spraying without indicators of a stable atmosphere. Overall mean glufosinate-ammonium deposits recovered from leaves were greatest for dual-tips operated constant at reduced droplet size (Very Coarse and Fine) due to reduced required tip size operated without bPWM, and for increased droplet size for Y-adapter-mounted pre-orifice tips (Extremely Coarse and Coarse) operated with bPWM, resulting in overall mean glufosinate-ammonium leaf deposits of 15.9 and 15.0 mu g a.i. cm(-2), respectively. The combination of dual tips at reduced droplet size or the Y-adapter fore-aft spray pattern divergence of bPWM tips coupled with high sprayer speed enhanced droplet interception by Palmer amaranth plants under negligible wind conditions, since the collected deposits, even without summed integration over foliage height, significantly exceeded the applied rate of 8.2 mu g a.i. cm(-2). An air-induction extended-range tip non-bPWM (Very Coarse) provided the next highest mean in overall glufosinate-ammonium deposit. One increased-droplet size dual-tip, pre-orifice tip bPWM and non-bPWM (Ultra Coarse and Coarse) resulted in a mean deposit that was not significantly different from the air-induction extended-range tip operated non-bPWM. Other dual-tip combinations with bPWM and non-bPWM, including the original dual-tip configuration in the previous study, resulted in significantly reduced mean herbicide deposits. Considering all tested tips, advantages of bPWM depended on spray tip droplet size classifications and Y-mounted fore-aft divergence of spray patterns. Overall mean WSP spot deposits were greatest for reduced droplet size (Very Coarse and Fine) dual pre-orifice tips operated non-bPWM, corresponding with the highest numerical overall mean of glufosinate-ammonium deposit. This correspondence of highest spot deposits and highest mean glufosinate-ammonium deposit also occurred in the previous study. Increased Palmer amaranth control correlated with increased glufosinate-ammonium deposit and decreased volume median diameter (Dv0.
   5) determined with WSP electronic scans, with the air-induction extended-range tip operated constant and the Y-adapter pre-orifice tip operated as bPWM providing the highest weed control. Overall mean WSP spot deposits ranged from 42.3 to 81.1 spots cm(-2), compared to 14.0 to 47.0 spots cm(-2) previously reported for similar spray conditions, with spot deposits attributed to negligible wind versus wind, respectively. Thus, the spray environment, particularly wind, exhibited effects on nozzle tip comparisons for foliar deposition and may offer some rationale for the conflicting published data beyond the examined treatments.

AB  - Context. Clinical toxicologists perform risk assessments and clinical evaluations for patients with potential exposure to airborne toxicants in which the patient's self-reported perception of odor may be the only indicator that an exposure may have taken place. Objective. To review the factors that may affect the human ability to perceive chemical odors and relate those odors to specific chemical exposures. Methods. The medical literature, from 1950 through 2012, was searched using the OVID database and the PUBMED database. The searches returned 238 articles, of which 113 involved human studies and were published in the English language. Of these 113 articles, 40 articles discussed odor issues and thus were chosen as specifically relevant to the topic. Bibliographies of all articles were also searched for other relevant references and this found six additional articles, making a total of 46. Factors that may affect olfaction and the ability to perceive odor Genetic/population. Ethnic background is associated with widely differing odor detection abilities and thresholds. A significant genetic influence for the ability to smell and perceive odor has been reported. Gender. Women are superior to men in their ability to identify odors. Age. Increasing age is correlated with higher odor detection thresholds. Medical conditions. A variety of medical conditions have been associated with deficits in olfaction, including diseases of the nose and sinuses, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia. Alcoholism and smoking. Abuse of alcohol results in impaired olfactory sense, and smoking tobacco products alters odor detection threshold in a dose-related manner. Occupational and environmental factors. Repeated inhalation of any chemical results in olfactory fatigue over relatively short time frames that leads to a decreased ability to accurately detect and identify an odor. Recent exposure to relatively high concentrations of a chemical has been shown to affect sensitivity to that particular odorant, altering subsequent detection thresholds by up to three orders of magnitude. Applicability of proposed odor thresholds. Humans are only able to identify three to four components of complex olfactory mixtures and the odorants present in the mixture affect which individual components are detected. Odorants present in suprathreshold concentrations in a mixture may effectively mask the presence of odorants present in perithreshold concentrations. Self-rating of olfactory function may not correlate with actual olfactory ability. It is even more difficult to accurately determine intensity of an odor in a quantifiable way. For example, under conditions of constant stimulation with hydrogen sulfide, perceptual intensity was reported to decrease exponentially with time of stimulation. Concomitant visual stimulation also affects odor intensity. Some chemicals, such as hydrogen sulfide, may induce reactions in humans related solely to their odor, even when they are present in concentrations substantially lower than those levels usually associated with the development of adverse clinical effects. There is a wealth of literature suggesting that the intensity of perceived odor, the degree of irritation, and the reported health effects of exposure to an odorant chemical are affected by psychological state and bias. Multiple theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive basis for perceived illness in association with the perception of odor. The concept of odor has been reported to be intrinsically and cognitively associated with illness rather than with health.
   Assigning negative bias to an odor prior to an exposure results in the reporting of significantly more health-related symptoms following exposure. This suggests that those symptoms are not mediated by the odor directly, but rather by an individual's cognitive associations between odor and health. Conclusions. Attempts to verify exposure intensity based on the report of a perceived odor is unreliable and has no useful application in legitimate exposure assessment paradigms. Detection of an odor does not imply a medically significant exposure to a toxicant and, due to subject bias and the difficulty of detecting individual odorants in mixtures, may not constitute an exposure to the purported substance.

AB  - Ginsenosides are the main active compounds of ginseng, American ginseng and Panax notoginseng. They have certain pharmacological effects on the cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems. Most ginsenosides are naturally classified as protopanaxatriol ( PPT), protopanaxadiol ( PPD), and oleanolic acid ( OA) according to their aglycone skeletons. The nine main ginsenosides are Rbl, Rb2, Rb3, Re, Rd, Re, Rf, Rgl and Rg2. Accurate quantification of ginsenosides is imperative because they are the characteristic components and quality evaluation indicators of health foods. A new method based on solid phase extraction-ultra performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry ( SPE-UPLC-MS/MS) was developed for the determination of the nine ginsenosides in health foods. First, the pretreatment conditions were optimized. With the aim of purifying the samples and removing impurities, SPE cartridges with different packing materials, such as Alumina-N/XAD-2 SPE Cartridge, C-18 and HLB were investigated. Based on the purification efficiencies, recoveries and other factors, the Alumina-N/XAD-2 SPE cartridge composite SPE column was selected as the pretreatment purification column.
   The eluents were then optimized. When water was used as the eluent, the ginsenosides could remain adsorbed on the SPE column, and could not be eluted down with other water-soluble substances. By increasing the proportion of ethanol in the eluent, the ginsenoside adsorbed on the filler of the SPE column could be gradually eluted. When the proportion of ethanol in the eluent reached 70%, the ginsenosides could be completely eluted. The effects of different volumes of 70% ethanol elution solvent (5-30 mL) on the extraction efficiencies of ginsenosides were also investigated. The results showed that when the volume of the elution solvent reached 20 mL, the ginsenosides were completely eluted.
   Then, the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters were optimized. By examining the ionization cracking of ginsenosides, the quasi-molecular ions and corresponding fragment ions in ginsenoside primary MS were determined. After optimizing the chromatographic conditions and MS parameters, not only the sensitivity of the method was improved, but also the isomers Rb2, Rb3 and Re with the same quasi-molecular ions and the corresponding fragment ions were completely separated. Good separation was achieved for the nine ginsenosides, thus meeting the requirements for accurate quantification.
   Finally, chromatographic separation was achieved on a Hypersil Gold C-18 column ( 100 mmx 2. 1 mm, 1. 9 mu m) under linear gradient elution using a 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate solution ( with O. 1% formic acid) and acetonitrile as the mobile phases. The nine ginsenosides were detected using a triple quadrupole MS detector under EST- and multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM) modes, and quantified by the external standard method.
   The nine ginsenosides showed a strong positive linear correlation ( r(2) >0. 995 0) in the range of 0. 005-0. 5 mu g/mL. The sample recoveries and the corresponding relative standard deviations ( RSDs) were 81. 1%-114. 2% and 0. 4%-8. 0% (n=6), respectively. Eleven batches of health foods on the market, among which six batches contained ginseng, American ginseng or Panax notoginseng ingredients, were analyzed by the developed method, and the ginsenosides were detected. The total ginsenosides contents were close to those mentioned on the label. However, the nine ginsenosides were detected in one batch of health food, whose label did not indicated ginseng, American ginseng or Panax notoginseng. The nine ginsenosides were not detected in the remaining batches of health foods.
   The health food extract was directly loaded and purified without any complex pretreatment. The UPLC-MS/MS method, not only helped shorten the analysis time, but also accurate quantification of low ginsenoside contents in complex matrix samples. The developed method is simple and rapid, with high throughput, thus being suitable for the quantitative analysis of the nine ginsenosides in health foods.

Based on systematization of theoretical approaches to the definition of a concept and structure of living standards found in scientific literature and their critical analysis, we have identified and justified the fundamental structural blocks of the quality of life as a complex aggregate indicator reflecting the level of development of many areas of a modern person's life together affecting the degree of his or her life activity's efficiency.
   Using an extensive range of statistical data and tools of economic and mathematical modeling, we aim to identify the degree of influence of macroeconomic indicators that characterize certain areas of human life (healthcare, education, living conditions, security, income level, etc.) on living standards.
   Given the above, the central hypothesis of this study is that public management of the quality of life in the Republic of Kazakhstan can be more effective if it provides a scientifically grounded system of tools based on the assessment of the quality of life which takes into account both regional and industry specifics, feedback from the population as a recipient of public services, and is based on the principle of integration and consistency of state body management decisions.
   Results we have obtained imply the existence of a correlation between such quantitative indicators as natural growth, a number of pension recipients, the Gini coefficient and the quality of life index determined by qualitative indicators: general life satisfaction of the population and the level of perception of happiness. Results of the study confirm current trends in the socio-economic development of Kazakhstan, characterized by income inequality issues in both intersectoral and interregional sections, aggravated against the background of the global pandemic threat, the recession of a prolonged nature, and other external shocks and challenges.
   Based on the results obtained, the authors conclude that the key causes of socio-economic differentiation in Kazakhstan are associated with a weak institutional environment and weak performance of formal institutions. The quality of institutions impacts the process of socio-economic development in a creative way, including through the formation of an appropriate institutional environment regulating the entire set of socio-economic relations. This circumstance emphasizes the priority of challenges state management bodies face in the context of improving the existing institutional environment, which allows determination of rational behavior boundaries for people and economic entities to optimize and stabilize the socio-economic development of the state as a whole.
   We have developed and proposed a number of suggestions and recommendations for improving the existing institutional environment and the system of state management, practical implementation of which should reduce the existing large gap in income levels as the main factor of living standards in Kazakhstan.

AB  - The basic physical properties of chernozems in agroforest landscapes of the Central Chernozem region are studied within the framework of the program by the topic of the state assignment for 2018-2020. The studies carried out in the conditions of agrocenoses and undisturbed ecosystems were divided by the effect of agrogenic and agroforestal nature. Agrogenic effect was considered through a case study of the fallow lands put in operation in tillage. While agroforestal effect was considered through a case study of the influence of forest belts on soil cover. It is found that rearrangement of soil aggregates number takes place under the influence of forest belts and at introduction of fallow lands to agricultural use, but in different scenarios. The soil blocky fraction (less than 10 mm) in the arable horizon increases by 6-14 times under the agrogenic effect in comparison with the fallow. Contrary to this, the share of silt fraction (less than 0.25 mm) on the arable land decreases by 2-4 times and the structure coefficient decreases by 8-13 times. The minimum content of agronomically valuable aggregates (sum of 0.25-10 mm) is registered for the arable land soils compared to the fellow and forest belt for all selected layers. The average amount of aggregates lies in the range of 58-73 % for the amble lands, whereas the share of aggregates in the size of 0.25-10 mm is in the range of 85-95 % for the forest belt and fallow. A content reduction in the fractions of the following sizes 0.25-0.5; 0.5-1; 1-2; 2-3 and 3-5 mm influenced on a decrease in the agronomically valuable structure of the arable land in comparison with the fallow. The agroforestal effect on the structural composition of soil cover is more gently. The share of soil blocky fraction increases slightly. The sum of the agronomically valuable aggregates in the soil of the forest belt in depth of 10-20 and 20-40 cm corresponds the chernozem level of the fallow. Herewith, the share of the silt fraction in the soils of the natural cenoses is higher. And as a consequence of this, the values of the structural soil coefficient of the forest belt chernozem insignificantly exceed similar values in the fallow soils at the same depths. Statistical features of distribution of the basic aggregates in the soils subjected to intensive agrogenic and agroforestal influence are established in comparison with the fallow lands. Some statistical characteristics of distribution of the basic structural separates of the chernozem soils are calculated. The indicators of bulk density at various depths of the study sites are defined. They increase in the row of fallow - forest belt - arable land.

AB  - Uncertainty how ecosystems will behave and look like in the future has been increasing. Several concepts, such as sustainable, adaptive, or risk-based management, were proposed to cope with uncertain, incomplete knowledge, and with changing environmental conditions. However, there is a lack of agreement what those concepts mean and how they differ from traditional forest management approaches. The paper aims at (1) exploring general systems theory, control theory, and risk management theory for general principles that may be guiding the future development of ecosystem management, and that (2) developing a concept in adaptive ecosystem management that may act as a shared mental model for both scholars and practitioners.
   The exploration of systems- and risk-based theories results in decisive foundations of adaptive management: (I) emergence, adaptation, and resilience are fundamental concepts to characterize the dynamic behavior of ecosystems, accounting for their ability for purposeful transformational change. (2) Space-time scale matters. The space-time window of traditional, silviculture-based forestry has been focusing on the patch and stand level, whereas adaptive management has to consider much larger time-space windows, covering a range from the needle to the landscape. (3) Risk-informed management starts with the identification of critical effects, then quantifies the dose-response relationship between exogenous strain and endogenous stress. The paper proposes a concept in adaptive ecosystem management, being founded on three general concepts. First, control theory is the backbone to keep system dynamics within an acceptable range even if external disturbances are acting, the underlying model is based on uncertainties, and if the real process can only be modeled incompletely. Second, adaptive ecosystem management has to focus on processes across different space-time scales instead of looking at the static, "frozen" structures like trees of stands. Third, interaction of processes across space-time scales, characterized by dose-response functions, are the driving forces to shape the long-term development of the systems.
   The proposed concept challenges different domains. Research has to improve its understanding of process interactions across space-time scales, characterized by dose-response models, which are essential to understand system robustness (resilience). Higher education related to ecosystem management should refocus on scientific competences to the analysis of complex adaptive systems, and the use of control theory to continuously improve policies and practices for ecosystem management. Practitioners on the ground have to become convinced that the goal of ecosystem management is a, "moving target", consisting of a portfolio of ecosystem goods and services. They have to internalize the principle of "rule discovery" as a systematic learning process to improve management practices and by looking for "biodiversity in our minds". The paper is expected to trigger discussions among scholars and practitioners, leading to a set of principles for resource use that consider both complexity and dynamics of ecosystems.

AB  - Drawing inferences about the past from the ecology of living organisms is one of several approaches to reconstructing palaeo-environments. Pteridophytes are a major component of fossil floras, but their use as environmental indicators is constrained as much by lack of ecological data on living species as by an understanding of the distribution of fossils. Taking a neobotanical perspective, this paper discusses some important ecological strategies of ferns and allied plants and their underlying selection pressures, based on an extensive survey of tropical and temperate species and on horticultural experience of the behaviour of wild species in experimental cultivation. Broadly parallel developments to similar selection pressures and environmental responses have been sought from amongst distantly related extant families, to derive broad concepts of weaknesses and strengths inherent in the biology of these plants.
   From this evidence, seven main limitations and twelve important advantages imposed on pteridophytes by aspects of their biology are identified as follows:
   Limitations:
   The handicap of an independent gametophyte stage
   Single growing-point limitations of sporophyte architecture
   Slow plant growth rates
   Intolerance of widely fluctuating conditions
   Poorly controlled evaporative potential
   Uncontrolled high reproductive commitment
   Need to 'return to the water to breed'
   Advantages:
   Low-light photosynthetic ability
   Diverse phytochemical armament
   High disease resistance under saturated humidity levels
   High tolerance of acute nutrient disequilibrium substrates
   High migrational ability of the airborne spore
   Spore tolerance of adverse aerial environments
   Flexibility of breeding systems to match varying ecological opportunity
   Revivalist tendencies of certain gametophytes
   Potential longevity of resultant sporophytes
   Exploitation of mycotrophy
   Exploitation of potentials of polyploidy
   Biotic independence
   It is argued that collectively these weaknesses and strengths provide a broad framework, which, operating in varied combinations, limit or open opportunities for exploitation of a considerable array of ecological habitats by Pteridophyta. Based on these data, several general ecological principles are developed. It is proposed that, through time, such strategies are likely to have opened many pteridophyte habitat opportunities, though not all of these will necessarily have left directly identifiable signals in the fossil record.
   Modern fern ecological limitations and advantages are shown to occur across broad taxonomic spectra and many are innate abilities of the plants. It is, therefore, argued that a similar general framework of weaknesses and strengths is likely to have operated in the past, and thus have been of similar relevance in defining and promoting the ecological achievements of the fossil pteridophytes in relation to selection pressures and consequent adaptations. This opens up the potential to extrapolate from the modern ecology for interpretation of palaeo-ecology and palaeo-environments. Examples of this potential are given for each limitation and advantage, where possible incorporating evidence from the fossil record. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Earth's magnetic field shields our habitat against potentially harmful charged particles from outer space. Moreover, it is an important source of information about Earth's deep interior and geological history, both inaccessible to direct observations. Geomagnetism, the study of all aspects of the Earth's magneticfield, formed as a field of natural sciences in the early nineteenth century, largely under the influence of two prominent polymaths, Alexander von Humboldt and Carl Friedrich Gauss. On the occasion of the AGU 2019 centennial and Alexander von Humboldt's 250th anniversary, we link Humboldt's activities in geomagnetism with modern research in this domain and its challenges. Based on magnetic field observations during his scientific journeys, Alexander von Humboldt determined the increase of magnetic intensity with distance from the equator. He initiated coordinated observations across the globe and thus laid the foundation for international data exchange and collaboration. Observation is a prerequisite to a better understanding of the Earth's magnetic field with its various sources from the Earth's core, lithosphere, and electrical current systems outside the Earth, with a multitude of applications from navigation, exploration, natural hazard assessment, and study of Earth's evolution. A full understanding of the physical processes underlying the various geomagnetic field sources is mandatory to tackle the challenge of forecasting the future geomagnetic field evolution and to take advantage of the information that the geomagnetic field can provide about the Earth's history, geological and tectonic conditions and processes, and the near-Earth's space environment.
   Plain Language Summary Earth's magnetic field shields our planet against highly energetic particles from the Sun and outer space, which threaten modern technology. The main part of the magnetic field originates from dynamical processes in the Earth's outer, fluid core, and changes slowly. Additional contributions are due to magnetized rocks in the uppermost parts of the Earth. Moreover, several quickly varying electrical current systems flowing at distances from approximately 60 km to several Earth's radii around our planet contribute to geomagnetic field observations. Alexander von Humboldt played an important role in establishing the science of geomagnetism. He described the systematic change of magnetic field strength with distance from the equator, and he initiated synchronized magnetic field observations worldwide. Since that time, significant progress has been made in understanding the various geomagnetic field sources, and we have recognized applications ranging from understanding the Earth's geological history, exploration for natural resources, natural hazard assessment, navigation, and protection against adverse space weather influences. Main challenges in geomagnetic field research include a clear separation of signals from the individual field contributions and a full understanding of their physical sources, a more complete understanding of the long-term history of the geomagnetic field, and forecasting future field changes.

AB  - The Arketas pier in the Gernika estuary (southern Bay of Biscay) has during summer periods waters with strong hypoxia (less than or equal to1 ml l(-1)) but curiously bears the richest assemblages of foraminifers and ostracods in the whole estuary. The most abundant species in Arketas are: Ammonia beccarii, Cribroephidium williamsoni, Haynesina germanica and Lobatula lobatula (foraminifers) Loxoconcha elliptica and Leptocythere castanea (ostracods). The benthic foraminifer sub-species A. beccarii tepida exhibits in this estuary three different morphotypes, whose distributions are controlled by changes in the salinity, dissolved oxygen and nutrient content of the waters, and thus could be used as a good indicator of environmental alteration caused by those parameters. To determine whether this environmental alteration is due to natural causes or is anthropogenic, micropalaeontologic and sedimentologic contents of a sediment core 140 cm thick have been analysed. The study of Foraminifera and Ostracoda assemblages, species diversity, and A. beccarii tepida morphotypes allows us to reconstruct the evolution of this part of the estuary over the last 3800 years. To examine anthropogenic effects at this site, we compared the occurrence of heavy metals Pb, As, with the record of A. beccarii tepida morph C in Arketas. The maximum concentration of heavy metals coincides with the maximum occurrence of A. b. tepida morph C, in the 1970s (date calculated according to the estimated rate of sedimentation in this area). This indicates that distribution of A. b. tepida morph C is, at least partially, caused by heavy metal pollution. Nevertheless, the fact that we have found no deformed tests of this taxa in Arketas induces us to think that another factor, such as dysaerobia caused by eutrophization of nutrient inputs in several areas of this estuary, might have been responsible for at least of part of the anomalous shift of A. b. tepida morph C at that time. In recent times, an increase in this anthropogenic activity was evident, reaching its maximum in the 1970s and decreasing from the 1980s. During the late Holocene period (up to 3500 years BP), this site was a middle-outer estuarine settlement, euryhaline with low to moderate salinity. This episode ends with a marine transgressive pulsation. After depositional hiatus of unknown duration, recent sediments suggest a modern palaeogeographic position of Arketas located in a lower estuary environment. The study of A. beccarii through the Holocene sediments of Arketas indicates that dysaerobic/pollution conditions were not a singular event. At the same time, the increase of A. b. tepida morph C were particularly strong over several years of the 20th Century, at precisely the time that a noticeable decrease of richness and diversity of calcareous microfauna is detected in the estuary.

AB  - In Ukraine zoonoses are a permanent threat to human health, some of them are bacterial diseases associated with farm animals. Complete avoidance of outbreaks of bacterial zoonoses is not possible but it is appropriate to study them to reduce the risks of transmission of zoonosis pathogens from industrial farms to the human population and the environment. The article highlights the results of a literature review on the potential role of industrial livestock farms in the spread of major bacterial zoonoses in Ukraine. About half of all of the country's farmed animals are kept on farms using industrial technology; more than half of the establishments are classified as medium and large. The technology of keeping animals on such farms contributes to the development of diseases of obligate hosts caused by fecal bacteria. The systematic search and selection of literary sources, which are relevant to the topic of the study were carried out. The vast majority of analyzed publications are published in Ukrainian in local peer-reviewed scientific journals. An analysis of open-access official statistics from the state authorities of Ukraine was also conducted. The authors analyzed statistics and scientific papers published over the last 10-15 years discussing the outbreaks of food-borne zoonoses among humans and the studying their pathogens (Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli (STEC strains), Listeria spp.) on industrial livestock farms. The main source of Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. distribution are industrial poultry, including broilers and chickens, respectively. The STEC strains E. coli carriers are various types of farm animals, including cattle and pigs. The majority of infections documented in Ukraine are cases of salmonellosis in humans and animals. Despite reports of a significant prevalence of campylobacteriosis, colibacillosis and listeriosis in livestock farms, their association with outbreaks of food-borne zoonoses in humans remains poorly understood. The concept of an industrial livestock farm involves a permanent presence of a risk of outbreaks of bacterial zoonoses and their rapid spreading to the human population. This is due to concentrated maintenance of animals, standardized feeding, the priority of achieving the highest productivity of animals and economic indicators. Under such conditions, disturbance of hygienic norms and technologies significantly increases the risk of bacterial zoonoses on industrial farms. It is important to enforce the continuous control of the level of microbial pollution of farms, animal health, hygiene of milk production and processing, meat, eggs, etc. Farms have a negative impact on the ecological welfare of the surrounding territories. The problem of spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacterial zoonoses is a very serious one. Efforts for the formation of a national system of epidemiological supervision over bacterial zoonoses, comprising epidemiological, epizootological, ecological, microbiological, serological and molecular genetic monitoring, as well as the development on this basis of effective prophylactic and anti-epidemic measures are relevant and necessary.

AB  - This study discusses a new use of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) environmental assessment to measure unified (operational and environmental) and scale efficiencies among inputs, desirable and undesirable outputs. In particular, the measurement of scale efficiency is discussed by two non-radial models. That is a new methodological contribution. To discuss these efficiency measures, this study first examines a concept of disposability from the perspective of corporate strategies to adapt a regulation change on undesirable outputs. The concept is separated into natural and managerial disposability. After discussing how to measure the degree of scale efficiency within the non-radial approach, this study applies the proposed DEA environmental assessment to measure the performance of coal-fired power plants in the U.S. north-east region. The region has been long producing a large amount of coal from the Appalachian Mountains. The coal mining industry has supported U.S. energy utility and other industries. Because of the long history, the quality of coal became worse and the coal-fired power plants have been producing a large amount of undesirable gases. This study has statistically confirmed that there is a significant difference between the two types (BIT: bituminous coal and SUB: subbituminous coal) of coal-fired power plants in terms of their unified efficiency measures, including their scale efficiencies, under the concept of managerial disposability (the first priority: environment performance and the second priority: operational performance). In contrast, under the natural disposability (the first priority: operational performance and the second priority: environmental performance), this study cannot find such a statistical significance between them. The fact, in which BIT outperforms SUB in terms of their unified and scale efficiencies, suggests the policy implication that these power plants need to shift their coal combustions from SUB to BIT in the United States. Besides the empirical finding, this study cannot confirm the other hypothesis on whether coal-fired power plants with small operation (less than 50% in plant capacity factor) outperform ones with large operation (more than 50% in plant capacity factor), and vice versa, in terms of their unified and scale efficiency measures under natural and managerial disposability. An exception is found in environmental performance under variable returns to scale. The rationale is because their plant operations are frequently monitored by regulatory agencies. As a consequence, this study cannot find such a statistical difference between them on operational performance. This result implies that the regulation on coal-fired power plants has been effective on their unified performance but large power plants may have a potential to improve their environmental performance.

AB  - A delta Ca-44/40 excursion of -0.5 parts per thousand is recorded during the Hirnantian glaciation event in carbonate rocks of the Monitor Range section in Nevada. The timeframe for the glaciation is 1.03 +/- 0.2 Ma. The delta Ca-44/40 changes are synchronous with lithofacies and biofacies indicators of sea-level change, and co-vary negatively with a large positive delta C-13 excursion of 7 parts per thousand that was previously interpreted to reflect local C-cycling effects in circulation-restricted waters of the (epeiric) Martin Ridge Basin. The synchronousness of the Ca and C isotope excursions is inconsistent with what we know of Ca and C geochemical cycles in the modern ocean because the residence time of Ca is longer than that of C. A box model is used to illustrate that the negative delta Ca-44/40 excursion would take longer to recover than the positive delta C-13 excursion if the relative timescales of the Hirnantian Ca and C cycles were scaled similarly to those in the ocean today. One way to speed up the timescale of the Ca-isotope response is to decrease the size of the Ca-reservoir. This is what is accomplished when seawater circulation is restricted between oceans and epeiric seas. Approximately 30% of the -0.5 parts per thousand shift in Hirnantian delta Ca-44/40 values may be attributed to lower sea surface temperatures in the tropics during glaciation. The remainder is attributed to local Ca-cycling effects in the Martin Ridge Basin, which include an increase in isotopically light Ca-inputs by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and a larger kinetic isotope fractionation effect due to increased carbonate precipitation rate. The hypothesized increase in carbonate precipitation rate may have been caused by high photosynthesis rates, maintained by high nutrient fluxes from SGD, which increased the local carbonate-saturation state of the waters. Additionally, the conditions in this setting may have fostered a suite of organisms employing a calcification mechanism that involved microenvironments (bacterial or algal surfaces, biofilms, or sedimentary pore fluids) where biological activity could effectively alter the carbonate chemistry in very small C-reservoirs. A similar scenario was presented by LaPorte et al. (2009) to explain the bulk of the anomalously large 7 parts per thousand positive delta C-13 excursion in the same section. The strong negative coupling between the stratigraphic records of Ca and C isotope changes in the Martin Ridge Basin may serve as a tool to identify other epeiric sea settings in the rock record where similar physical and ecological attributes developed during periods of restricted circulation brought on by low sea-level.

AB  - Chilling requirement is an important agronomic trait of peach and other deciduous fruit trees. It is a quantitative indicator of natural dormancy and its release in a low temperature environment. It is directly related to the distribution area of fruit trees and the success of cultivation. Therefore, chilling requirement evaluation is very important for cultivar breeding and plant introduction. The existing evaluation method has obvious disadvantages such as harsh conditions, complex operation and time-consuming, which greatly prolong the evaluation process. Chilling requirement of peach floral buds could be quickly estimated by a portable E-nose (PEN3.5). The ratio R of the actual accumulated chilling hours during any period of the dormancy and release process to the chilling requirement was used to indicate the stage of chilling accumulation. 5 stages were set as the R value was 0 (StageI), 0.4 (Stage II), 0.8 (Stage III), 1.0 (Stage IV) and 1.2 (Stage V). Volatile compounds from the floral buds of 9 cultivars with known chilling requirements at the five stages were tested, and the signals of 10 types of sensors were different. Broad-methane gradually decreased during the dormancy process, and reached the bottom at dormancy release, with a significant difference in each stage (p<0.05), while it increased significantly after dormancy release (p<0.05). The sulphur-organic compound showed a significant decrease in the early and mid-term of dormancy (p<0.05), while stayed in relatively high content during and after the release (p<0.05). Methane-aliph slightly increased during the dormancy and reached the highest content at dormancy release, which was significantly different from that in the initial period of dormancy (p<0.05), and significantly decreased after the dormancy was released (p 0.05). So the three types of compounds could be used as the metabolic markers for different stages of dormancy and release. PCA and LDA analysis indicated that the 5 stages could be clearly distinguished. PLSR analysis was performed on the R value and volatile compounds content indicating by the response of sensors, and the quantitative model was established. Cultivars with different chilling requirements were used to validate the model, and it was found that there was no significant difference between predicted chilling accumulation and chilling requirement estimated by traditional method (p 0.05). It proved that the model established in this paper can be used to evaluate the chilling requirement of peach floral buds. This is the first time that E-nose detection and PLSR quantitative analysis model are combined to be used in the estimation of chilling requirements and have achieved efficient and convenient evaluation. It has a high potential to be applied in the evaluation of peach chilling requirements in the future. And for other deciduous fruit trees or plants, the innovative method is of great reference significance.

AB  - Landscape evolution is occurring at rapid rates in alpine areas in response to recent climate warming, also due to the susceptibility and the heterogeneity of these environments. Here we present a prediction model of surface displacements that takes into account both topographic and climatic variables. Observed points of surficial displacements have been associated to non-climatic (altitude, slope, solar radiation, till deposit type, deposit age, vegetation coverage) and climatic (days of snow permanence, ground surface temperature index, ground heating index, ground cooling index) variables through a general regression model in the European central Alps.
   The model output shows the importance of slope and ground heating index (GHI) - an estimation of the amount of energy transferred to the ground, to predict surface displacements independently from the type of considered processes. In particular, the general regression model shows that steep zones with high GHI are more susceptible to undergo periglacial and paraglacial processes producing surface displacements. As expected, slope is fundamental to trigger processes such as gravitation, nivation, solifluction and their interactions. The results of our model emphasize the key role of GHI, highlighting the importance of climate in controlling the surface displacement. Indeed, in areas in which GHI is higher, the ground can remain snow free for a longer time and snow melting can be faster, the former favoring more runoff and slopewash, and the latter promoting the saturation of the deposits consequent to a higher intensity of solifluction and/or mass movements processes.
   Within the study area, the sites with the largest displacements (> 35 cm) were detected where permafrost degradation occurred since 1990. This permafrost degradation process could remain one of the main triggering factors of future surface displacements. Our results confirm that when movement involves material with coarse texture (pebbles and boulders) exceeding the rooting depth, only tolerant plant species can withstand the high movement rates. The areas where this can happen (like rock glaciers or screes) act as a physical barrier to grasslands species not adapted to surface displacements and trying to shift towards higher altitude in response to climate warming. However, plant species not considered as indicators of movement (such as graminoids), can develop also with large surface displacements in specific geomorphic conditions. Therefore, the combination of surface displacement type (deep vs surficial), material texture (fine vs coarse) and vegetation cover (high vs low) and floristic composition can be used as a valuable ecological indicator of movement.
   Our results suggest that both landscape degradation and vegetation displacement can be rapid especially where the air warming was strong as in the selected study area.

AB  - Purpose Anthropic water uses can affect aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems through various pathways. To address these impacts in life cycle assessment, an array of impact assessment methods can be applied. The currently well-known review of methods carried out by the UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative's WULCAworking group (Kounina et al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 18(3):707-721,2013) recommends that practitioners Bsimultaneously apply all indicators to evaluate damage on ecosystem quality and to cautiously sum up the score into a single metric". This call for caution is attributed to the fact that methods reviewed cover different ecosystem targets. Their characterisation factors and units also vary. However, the review lacks a detailed analysis of compatibilities and coherence between methods that identifies inconsistencies to be overcome to further method harmonisation. This is precisely the aim of this study.
   Methods Existing methods were analysed against a scheme. It consists of four issues (1) covered impact pathway, (2) structure of characterisation model and factor, (3) fate factor modelling, and (4) effect factor modelling, further specified based on ten criteria. Among these, one criterion evaluates the legitimacy of using steady-state fate factors to model pulse-type water uses based on the theorem presented by Heijungs (Environ Sci Pollut Res Int 2: 217-224, 1995). New terminology is proposed for a proper description of the criteria. All of the criteria evaluate scientific and technical aspects. The analysis approach involves a qualitative description of each model.
   Results and discussion Important findings of the analysis include the following: (1) for several methods, the environmental intervention proposed and its connection to the impact assessment phase are debatable; (2) the location of the midpoint stressor (i. e. the indicator of change in the environment due to the environmental intervention) along the causality chain causes problems of compatibility among fate factors of different models; (3) it is appropriate to use the steady-state solution to find the new system condition after pulse-type water use. None of the models have justified this fundamental choice before. Recommendations for future method development respectively, involve the following: (1) avoid the use of inventory information in characterisation models and jointly develop inventory data and characterisation factors to ensure the applicability of impact assessment methods; (2) use the more environmentally relevantmidpoint stressor (the one along the causality chain closer to ecosystem damage; and (3) justify the use of the steady-state solution for fate factor modelling.
   Conclusions This study identifies sources of inconsistency in the indicator structures analysed and provides recommendations that will foster harmonisation. The current mismatch between methods leads us to not recommend aggregating indicators into one single metric until a common framework underpins existing and future water use impact assessment methods for ecosystem quality.

T2  - ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
LA  - Polish
AB  - Exploitation of the deposits is limited by the requirements of nature, preservation of the environment and land use for activities other than mining. Currently, the protection of the deposits is understood as conservation of their occurrence before the development, which would prevent access to the reserves. The need for mineral resource protection, especially of hydrocarbons, and the geological environment use for production through proper management of geological resources are the priorities of our state. In 2011, 345 crude oil and natural gas fields were found in Poland. A number of them are non-exploited (62 deposits of natural gas and crude oil 9). In Poland there is also the possibility of the discovery of unconventional resources, both of natural gas and crude oil. All non-exploited and discovered deposits in the future should be valorized and analyzed in terms of protecting their resources.
   The proposed valorization of hydrocarbon fields is based on rating the basic characteristics of the deposit and aspects of its management. Total points will form the basis for making deposits and assessed rankings split into groups with different levels of protection. In the assessment of hydrocarbon deposits in terms of their potential protection it is proposed to include criteria related to: the geological-reservoir conditions, the availability of deposits (environmental and land planning) and deposits development. Valorisation takes into account deposits that are not eligible for the exploitation and the deposits of low, medium and high evaluation of various criteria. In each group of criteria it is proposed to assign different weights to the criteria for geological and reservoir accounting for 60% of the total assessment, the availability of deposits of 30% and 10% of the deposit development. As a result of this indexation of the deposits, they have been divided into three categories.
   The deposits, which will have the highest score of 5.7 points for natural gas and 7.8 for oil (category I) should be especially protected because of their geological and reservoir parameters (quite large resources and raw mineral quality), availability and access to pipelines and roads. The second group of deposits to average deposits of protection in the event of the proposed evaluation, they will have crude oil from less than 4 to 1.9 points; deposits of natural gas from less than 5.2 to 2.6 points (category II). The deposits of the lowest rated points in the evaluation are below 3.1 points for oil and less than 4.4, for natural gas (category III).
   It is essential that the certification of reserves is an aspect of the geological reservoir. Their low score eliminates a number of further revisions. Just like in the deposits, this assessment of environmental planning, will receive 0 points for lack of access to resources. This low score with the management aspects of the deposit will not disqualify it for future use.

AB  - Subsurface fluid systems are important for chemical weathering, ore formation and thermal evolution of the crust. Changes in the dynamics and distribution of subsurface fluid flow systems are controlled by changes in global and regional terrestrial climate, tectonics, and elevation. This paper concerns the dating of changes in ancient subsurface hydrologic systems. However, direct dating of water-rock interaction is challenging because of the lack of appropriate materials to date and the more open and complex nature of subsurface flow regimes. Here, we explore the prospects of using U-Pb dating of petrified (silicified) wood as a means of quantifying continental paleo-hydrology. Oxidizing fluids, often of meteoric origin, tend to leach and mobilize U from the country rock, but when such waters contact organic-rich material, U can become reduced and immobilized, resulting in U-rich silicified wood. We present in situ laser ablation ICPMS analyses of U-Pb isotopes and trace elements in petrified wood from the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation (225-208 Myr) in the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona (USA), allowing us to establish a generalized workflow for making meaningful paleo-hydrologic interpretations of the U-Pb systematics of silicified wood. Wood characterized by brownish colors and preservation of cellular structure have low Fe contents and positive Ce anomalies, indicating silicification in reducing environments and isolation in relatively reduced conditions after silicification, resulting in closed system behavior of U and Pb. Wood characterized by vivid colors (orange, red, etc.) and little to no preservation of cellular structure are much higher in Fe and exhibit negative Ce anomalies, indicating influence by more oxidized fluids. The brownish samples yield U-Pb ages clustered between 250 and 200 Ma with a peak coinciding with the time of deposition (similar to 220 Ma), which indicates that fossilization largely took place almost immediately after deposition and that U-Pb in quartz faithfully retains the time of such fossilization. In contrast, the orangish-reddish-whitish samples yield younger U-Pb ages, defining distinct errorchron ages, which reflect subsequent generations of quartz crystallization. Scatter associated with errorchrons are likely due to local (mm-to cm-scale) U or Pb mobility or variable initial Pb composition. Distinct younger age peaks appear to correlate with the timing of regional unconformities associated with tectonic or epeirogenic uplift. We suggest that uplift and exhumation may initiate the onset of oxidizing fluid systems, resulting in leaching and transport of U from the surroundings, followed by subsequent generations of quartz precipitation. In summary, U-Pb dating of petrified wood or silicified organic material, has high potential for dating paleo-hydrologic events. However, due to complexities in terrestrial hydrologic systems, interpretations of U-Pb systematics must be informed by accompanying geochemical and textural observations.

AB  - While the quantity of soil organic carbon and nitrogen are used as indices of soil quality assessment and sustainable land use management, soil microbial activity is also a sensitive indicator of soil quality. Though the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystem can be largely affected by macro factors such as climatic conditions, local micro environmental factors such as land use history, plant functional type and management practices also play an important role in this regard. The present study was aimed at assessing and analyzing different types of land use patterns so as to understand their influence on the depth wise distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and microbial activity under the same management practices. The investigation was carried out in an organic farm located at Anand, Gujarat, India. Three different types of land use patterns viz., (i) fodder grass raising land, (ii) teak woodland, and (iii) wheat-pearl millet cropland were selected. Vertical (0-100 cm depth) variation in soil biophysical properties was recorded. Analysis of variance showed SOC (%) and TN (%) varied significantly (P < 0.001) with land use patterns (LU), depth (D), and LUxD. It was found that at all three land use patterns SOC and TN were highest at upper layer (0-10 cm) then decreased towards deeper layers (up to 40 cm) and then again increased with depth (40-100 cm) in soil profile. Highest values of SOC (%) and TN (%) (1.02% and 0.08% respectively), were reported in wheat-pearl millet cropland at 0-10 cm depth. Use of organic amendment made a great impact on SOC (%) in wheat pearl-millet cropland throughout the soil profile. We found almost same quantity of SOC (%) at 0-10 cm and 80-100 cm in teak woodland and grass raising land. The microbial biomass (carbon and nitrogen) and dehydrogenase activity were also found to be highest at upper layer (0-10 cm) in wheat-pearl millet cropland (418.2 mu g/g, 52.9 mu g/g and 104.05 TPF mu g/g respectively) as compared to other two types of land use patterns. A significant positive correlation was observed between soil organic carbon and total nitrogen with microbial biomass and dehydrogenase activity at all three land use patterns. Our findings suggest that changes in land use pattern and management practices make a significant impact on vertical distribution of SOC and TN. Accurate investigation of SOC and TN storage at regional levels is important for detecting changes in carbon and nitrogen sequestration potentials induced by land use changes over a period of time to enable the rebuilding of SOC and TN in agro-ecosystems.

AB  - In general, the well-being of aquatic ecosystems is a key parameter reflecting ecosystem wealth. To avoid negative influences on fish physiology, the stress state of species must be monitored. beta-D-glucose level is one of the key indicators of acute stress in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) juveniles and has been associated with different environmental conditions, including different amounts of chemicals. In the present study, we explore the possibility of assessing the beta-D-glucose level in water as a reliable indicator of acute stress in the fish exposed to chemical contaminants. Amperometric biosensor utilizing immobilized into membrane glucose oxidase Aspergillus niger (GOx) for the measurement of low concentration of beta-D-glucose in fish holding water was developed and described. Specific layers of the enzymatic membrane allowed to eliminate interfering signals and the biosensor have been fitted for beta-D-glucose measurements in fish-holding water. Besides that, the biosensor exhibited several advantageous functional properties, i.e. a wide linear range (0.005-30 mM), high sensitivity (1.07 +/- 0.01 mu A mM(-1)cm(-2)), good selectivity and long-term stability. It was the combination of these biosensor properties that made the simultaneous measurement of beta-D-glucose both at low (in water) and high (in fish blood) concentrations and operating in non-pretreated turbid media feasible. Fish were exposed to the primary complex metal (Zn - 0.1, Cu - 0.01, Cd - 0.0015, Ni - 0.034, Pb - 0.014 and Cr - 0.01 mg.L-1, respectively) mixture (MIX) (prepared at maximum-permissible-concentrations for inland waters in European Union (EU)) and MIX5 down arrow (5-fold reduced (down arrow) concentration of each metal in the mixture). The obtained results revealed that the blood-glucose level in fish did not change over time significantly, while the level of beta-D-glucose released into water by the fish after 3 h exposure to MIX was found to have significantly increased. However, potential stress was observed in the fish exposed to both MIX and MIX5. metal mixtures revealing fish sensitivity and proving suitability of the glucose measurement procedure. No significant relationship was found to exist between blood-glucose and water beta-D-glucose levels. The results showed that in contrast to blood-glucose measurements, the proposed non-invasive measurement of beta-D-glucose in water was beneficial. Thus, this study provides a new approach for the development of a method for stress indication in fish using the measurement of glucose in holding water. Moreover, this glucose measurement procedure can prove to be another valuable tool for stress evaluation method in aquaculture, fish welfare and toxicological research, especially for studying short-term stress responses induced by chemicals.

AB  - Climate change affects biophysical processes related to the transmission of many infectious diseases, with potentially adverse consequences for the health of communities. While our knowledge of biophysical associations between meteorological factors and disease is steadily improving, our understanding of the social processes that shape adaptation to environmental perturbations lags behind. Using computational modeling methods, we explore the ways in which social cohesion can affect adaptation of disease prevention strategies when communities are exposed to different environmental scenarios that influence transmission pathways for diseases such as diarrhea. We developed an agent-based model in which household agents can choose between two behavioral strategies that offer different levels of protection against environmentally mediated disease transmission. One behavioral strategy is initially set as more protective, leading households to adopt it widely, but its efficacy is sensitive to variable weather conditions and stressors such as floods or droughts that modify the disease transmission system. The efficacy of the second strategy is initially moderate relative to the first and is insensitive to environmental changes. We examined how social cohesion (defined as average number of household social network connections) influences health outcomes when households attempt to identify an optimal strategy by copying the behaviors of socially connected neighbors who seem to have adapted successfully in the past. Our simulation experiments suggest that high-cohesion communities are able to rapidly disseminate the initially optimal behavioral strategy compared to low-cohesion communities. This rapid and pervasive change, however, decreases behavioral diversity; i.e., once a high cohesion community settles on a strategy, most or all households adopt that behavior. Following environmental changes that reduce the efficacy of the initially optimal strategy, rendering it suboptimal relative to the alternative strategy, high-cohesion communities can fail to adapt. As a result, despite faring better early in the course of computational experiments, high-cohesion communities may ultimately experience worse outcomes. In the face of uncertainty in predicting future environmental stressors due to climate change, strategies to improve effective adaptation to optimal disease prevention strategies should balance between intervention efforts that promote protective behaviors based on current scientific understanding and the need to guard against the crystallization of inflexible norms. Developing generalizable models allows us to integrate a wide range of theories and multiple datasets pertaining to the relationship between social mechanisms and adaptation, which can provide further understanding of future climate change impacts. Models such as the one we present can generate hypotheses about the mechanisms that underlie the dynamics of adaptation events and suggest specific points of measurement to assess the impact of these mechanisms. They can be incorporated as modules within predictive simulations for specific socio-ecological contexts.

AB  - This work describes how a general, process-based mass-balance model (CoastMab) for phosphorus for coastal areas may be used as a tool to estimate realistic values of "natural" or preindustrial reference levels of key bioindicators in coastal science, including the Secchi depth, a standard measure of water clarity, the chlorophyll-a concentration, an operational measure of phytoplankton biomass and the concentration of cyanobacteria, a measure of the concentration of harmful algae. The CoastMab-model is an ecosystem model giving monthly predictions to achieve seasonal variations of basin-wide properties. The selected case-study area, the Gulf of Riga, is sensitive to nutrient loading because of its shallowness and low openness towards the Baltic Proper. The morphometry of any coastal area, as given by the size and form parameters, influences all internal processes, such as sedimentation, resuspension, diffusion in water and from sediments to water, biouptake and retention in biota, stratification, mixing and outflow. There has been no mass-balance modeling for nitrogen (N) in this work because empirical data (from the HELCOM database) clearly indicate that the monthly primary production in the Gulf of Riga is regulated by phosphorus (P) the mean monthly total-N to total-P ratios are well over 7.2 (the Redfield-ratio) and generally higher than 15 for the data used in this study (from 1992 to 2005). At present anthropogenic loads, the average modeled monthly values for Secchi depth, chlorophyll (Chl), cyanobacteria (CB) and total-P (TP) are 3.2 In, 3.8 mu g/l, 78 mu g/l and 31.3 mu g/l, respectively. If 50% of all anthropogenic sources to the Gulf of Riga via rivers, point sources and diffuse sources were to be removed, these values would be 3.6 m, 3.4 mu g Chl/l, 63 mu g CB/l and 29.1 mu g TP/l. If 60% of the anthropogenic phosphorus fluxes to the Baltic Proper were to be omitted and as well as 75% of all direct anthropogenic sources to the Gulf of Riga, the values would be 4.6 m, 2.7 mu g Chl/l, 45 mu g CB/l and 25.4 mu g TP/l. These values represent the "natural" reference levels and it is not realistic to expect that remedial measures would improve the conditions more than that. Using the CoastWeb-model, similar calculations can be made for any given coastal area and the data necessary for such calculations are discussed in this work. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), a combined measure of temperature and humidity effects on thermal comfort, is used to define heat stress waves (HSWs). While emerging research has raised concerns on future changes in heat stress, for the first time, this study examines spatiotemporal changes in multiple HSW characteristics (intensity, duration, frequency, and cumulative mean intensity) in the 21st century under three emissions scenarios. It is the sustained nature of HSWs that impose more adverse impacts than extreme heat on a single day. HSWs are expected to be more intense, persistent, frequent, and influential due to anthropogenic influence. Models project the largest increases in multiple HSW characteristics will occur over the tropics and subtropics. The exception is maximum intensity, which displays a relative uniform increase over most global land areas. Analysis of regional population exposure to HSWs under different climate and socioeconomic scenarios emphasizes the importance of aggressive mitigation to minimize the potential impacts of HSWs. We further investigate how different regional HSW characteristics are projected to change relative to increasing global mean surface temperature (GMST). Our results confirm the varying rates and different trajectories at which regional HSWs change, independent of forcing pathway, strongly related to GMST. On both globally aggregated and regional scales, the maximum intensity and GMST are highly linearly associated, with an approximately 1:1 increase. However, the other three HSW characteristics are projected to change at a nonlinear rate per degree of GMST increase in general and display large regional variation in the rates of their changes.
   Plain Language Summary Besides air temperature, air humidity is another important factor in determining the impact of heat waves on humans. High humidity will reduce the efficiency of evaporative cooling and, when combined with high temperature, could pose a serious threat to human health or even life safety. Heat stress indices, taking into account both temperature and humidity effects, are considered to be better indicators of environmental conditions conducive to heat stress on human health. We here employ a widely used heat stress index, wet bulb globe temperature, to define heat waves, namely, heat stress waves (HSWs). Heat waves can be considered through a number of characteristics, and it is their distinctive characteristics that result in the vast array of adverse impacts. This also applies to HSWs. Our results show that more intense, longer-lasting, frequent, and influential HSWs are anticipated during the 21st century, and anthropogenic warming substantially increases the occurrence of HSWs. Except intensity, tropical regions will generally witness the largest increases in multiple HSW characteristics and the number of people that may be exposed to HSWs. Changes in HSW characteristics are confirmed not to depend on whether a particular warming is reached sooner or later; they are strongly related to global mean surface temperature.

AB  - Prolonged production of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) post-smolts in closed-containment systems has prompted research into biological requirements under higher production intensities. This study examined the effect of fish density and specific water flow on skin health in post post-smolts particularly focusing on epithelial cell morphology and gene expression. In the density experiment, post-smolts were kept at five different fish densities (25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 kg/m(3)) at a specific water flow rate of 0.6 l/kg/min. Microscopic examination of fluorescence stained whole-mount skin samples demonstrated differences in epithelial cell morphology with increased spacing between epithelial cells at 50 kg/m(3) and 125 kg/m(3). Gene expression analysis revealed increased transcription of mucin-like 2, cathepsins B, -D, -L, matrix metalloproteinase 9 and claudin 10 in fish reared at a density of 125 kg/m(3), while only matrix metalloproteinase 9 and claudin 10 had increased transcription at a density of 100 kg/m(3). Together, these results suggest structural alterations in the skin epithelium at densities >= 100 kg/m(3). In the specific water flow experiment, four different water flow levels were established (0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 l/kg/min) while the fish density was kept constant at 75 kg/m(3). After eight weeks, transcription of mucin-like 2 and -5ac, inducible nitric oxide synthase, lysozyme and cathepsin B and -L increased in skin samples from fish reared in tanks with a specific water flow of <= 0.3 l/kg/min. Increased transcription of these genes implies activation of stress and immune responses in skin at low specific water flow. Results from this study suggests that skin is a sensitive organ for environmental changes, and suggests several molecular indicators that may be valuable in predicting the effects of varying rearing conditions on skin health. Further validation through long-term studies, combined with other health parameters is required for practical recommendations regarding critical fish density and water flow for optimal fish health and performance in semi-closed production systems.
   Statement of relevance: This paper is of high importance for the industry as it investigates the effects of fish density and specific water flow on skin properties in semi-closed-containment-systems in Atlantic salmon post-smolt production. Increased fish densities and reduced specific water flow can increase production profitability. Thus, biological limits related to these two factors are important to identify to avoid reduced animal welfare. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The removal of aged and deteriorated molecular overlayers from the surface of paintings is a delicate and critical intervention in Cultural Heritage (CH) conservation. This irreversible action gets particularly complicated given the multitude of materials that may be present within a painted work of art (often in ultrathin layers or traces), as well as the exceptional sensitivity of the original surfaces to environmental conditions such as heat, light, and so on. Lasers hold an important role among the available deaning methodologies, as they enable high control and accuracy, material selectivity, and immediate feedback Still, prior to their implementation, it is imperative to optimize the deaning parameters, so to ensure that any potential implications to the remaining materials are minimal and well understood.
   Toward this aim, research at IESL-FORTH is focused on both refining and continuously updating the laser-deaning protocols (by introducing novel laser technologies into the field, i.e., ultrashort laser pulses), as well as on investigating and studying the nature and extent of laser-induced physicochemical alterations to the involved materials. In this Account, extended work for the understanding of ultraviolet (UV) laser ablation of polymers is presented. Emphasis is placed on the use of model systems (polymers doped with chromophores of known photochemistry) to examine the in-depth laser-induced modifications at the processed surfaces and thus to illustrate the dependence of their nature and extent on laser parameters and material properties.
   Furthermore, studies for the potential use of femtosecond UV pulses to overcome certain limitations involved with the nanosecond ablation of molecular overlayers from CH surfaces are highlighted. In particular, it is demonstrated that in the femtosecond regime any chemical modifications are, qualitatively and quantitatively, highly defined, limited and nearly independent of the material properties, such as the absorptivity and the degree of polymerization/molecular weight. Thus, they can be highly potent in the treatment of molecular substrates, enabling new material processing schemes that have not been possible with nanosecond laser technology, as for example, processing of ultrathin varnish layers.
   Finally, a sensitive indicator is introduced to elucidate the extent of any photochemical or structural modification induced at the substrate on the process of the laser-assisted removal of overpaints. A realistic scenario of an overlayered modem painting is simulated by a sensitive polymer film covered with acrylic paint The indicator is doped with photosensitizers of known photochemistry and strong fluorescence emission, which allow the employment of laser induced fluorescence (LIF) for the detection of any chemical modifications generated into the substrate during laser cleaning. In addition, nonlinear microscopy techniques are successfully employed to examine the extent of these modifications. The suggested methodology is proven to reliably and accurately detect potential changes, and thus, it can serve as a monitoring tool to fine-tune the deaning protocol and safeguard the original painting

AB  - The Wami Rivers basin is an important area due to its diversified use which benefits a multi-diversity of stakeholders. While large scale irrigated sugar production is the main issue of concern upstream, there are other equally important socio-economic activities which include biodiversity and environmental conservation, domestic water supply, livestock water needs, and fishing. A large water supply project has just been completed downstream of the Wami River to provide water for the Chalinze township and surrounding villages. Other important undertakings include irrigated rice farming in Dakawa area, livestock keeping activities, and the establishment of the Sadani National Park (SANAPA) and the Wami-Mbiki Wildlife Management Area (WMA). The Wami River basin forms significant parts of both the Wami-Mbiki WMA and the SANAPA wildlife conservation areas. Regardless of its importance, the basin is increasingly being degraded through deforestation for agricultural expansion, timber, and more important charcoal making. The basin is also being polluted through disposal of excess molasses from the sugar industry, and use of poisonous substances and herbs in fishing. The worsening environmental condition in the basin has become a health threat to both people in the surrounding villages and wildlife. To a large extent, such changes are intensifying poverty levels among the local population. These changes are raising concerns about the long-term environmental sustainability and health implications of the current water use competition and conflicts in the basin.
   The purpose of this paper is to examine the main water resource use conflicts and how they affect environmental sustainability in the long-run. It also intends to establish linkages between wildlife management, pastoralism, agricultural activities and how such linkages influence poverty alleviation efforts in the basin. An attempt has been made to examine the environmental and health implications of human activities in the basin in relation to poverty indicators, people's lifestyle, and integrated water resource use in the Wami River basin. In the process of examining linkages and sources of conflicts, key strategies to harmonize the interests of various stakeholders and ensure integrated and sustainable use of the Wami River waters will be identified. As a conclusion to paper, issues related to population pressure, pollution, wildlife, pastoralism and many others will be discussed with the view of harmonizing the needs of various stakeholders and minimizing their effect on the river ecosystem. The discussion shows how poverty levels are linked to resources over-exploitation, hence limiting sustainability in the basin. Under the current poverty levels in almost all villages surrounding the Wami River basin, there is no alternative ways or technology to replace non-sustainable resource exploitation. Many villages depend on charcoal burning and selling as a survival strategy and source of income. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The extractable organic matter of 10 immature samples from a marl bed of one evaporitic cycle of the Vena del Gesso sediments (Gessoso-solfifera Fm., Messinian, Italy) was analyzed quantitatively for free hydrocarbons and organic sulphur compounds. Nickel boride was used asa desulphurizing agent to recover sulphur-bound lipids from the polar and asphaltene fractions. Carbon isotopic compositions (delta vs PDB) of free hydrocarbons and of S-bound hydrocarbons were also measured. Relationships between these carbon skeletons, precursor biolipids, and the organisms producing them could then be examined. Concentrations of S-bound lipids and free hydrocarbons and their delta values were plotted vs depth in the marl bed and the profiles were interpreted in terms of variations in source organisms, C-13 contents of the carbon source, and environmentally induced changes in isotopic fractionation; The overall range of delta values measured was 24.7 parts per thousand, from -11.6 parts per thousand for a component derived from green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) to -36.3 parts per thousand for a lipid derived from purple sulphur bacteria (Chromatiaceae). Deconvolution of mixtures, of components deriving from multiple sources (green and purple sulphur bacteria, coccolithophorids, microalgae and higher plants) was sometimes possible because both quantitative and isotopic data were available and because either the free or S-bound pool sometimes appeared to contain material from a single source. Several free n-alkanes and S-bound lipids appeared to be specific products of upper-water-column primary producers (i.e. algae and cyanobacteria). Others derived from anaerobic photoautotrophs and from heterotrophic protozoa (ciliates), which apparently fed partly on Chlorobiaceae. Four groups of n-alkanes produced by algae or cyanobacteria were also recognized based on systematic variations of abundance and isotopic composition with depth. For hydrocarbons probably derived from microalgae, isotopic Variations are well correlated with those of total organic carbon. A resistant aliphatic biomacromolecule produced by microalgae is, therefore, probably an important component of the kerogen. These variations reflect changes in the depositional environment and early diagenetic transformations. Changes in the concentrations of S-bound lipids induced by variations in conditions favourable for sulphurization were discriminated from those related to variations in primary producer assemblages. The water column of the lagoonal basin was stratified and photic zone anoxia occurred during the early and middle stages of marl deposition. During the last stage of the marl deposition the stratification collapsed due to a significant shallowing of the water column. Contributions from anaerobic photoautotrophs were apparently associated with variations in depth of the chemocline.

AB  - Trends in eutrophication and meromixis pose serious threats to water quality and biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems around the world. Because long-term observational data rarely exist, it is very difficult to assess whether meromixis is the result of anthropogenic impacts, climate variability, natural ecosystem development or a combination of these factors. Lake sediment proxy-data may help understand how and why eutrophication and meromixis occurred and disappeared in the past. In this study, we present a novel method and proxy to investigate past episodes of meromixis and, hypolimnetic anoxia recorded in lake sediments. We use high-resolution (70 x 70 mu m/pixel) calibrated hyperspectral imaging of a varved lake sediment core from meromictic Lake Jaczno (north-east Poland), to quantitatively map the spatial distribution of Bacteriopheophytin a (Bphe a) at very high sub-varve (i.e. seasonal) resolution. Bphe a is a bacterial pigment and stable degradation product of Bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchl a), which is produced by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (APBs) at the chemocline of meromictic lakes. Using sedimentary Bphe a we infer episodes of meromixis (i.e. long-term hypolimnetic anoxia) and changing mixing conditions (i.e. seasonal temperature, event-based water mixing) for the past ca. 120 years. Absence of meromixis occurred on several occasions. From the beginning of our record in CE 1891 until ca. CE 1918, meromixis was not observed. During this time, green pigments (mainly chlorophyll a [Chl a] and diagenetic products) produced by phototrophic algae were deposited while Bphe a was absent. This suggests that regular lake overturning prevented the formation of a persistent chemocline. Bphe a was identified before CE 1890 (Butz et al. 2015),, but over the studied period 1891-2011, meromixis was established in CE 1918 and generally persisted through modern times. However, short-term interruptions of the chemocline were observed following events of rapid sedimentation (CE 1943, CE 1946, CE 1950) and after a strong,pulse of terrigenous material in CE 1978. These events were able to break up meromixis for a short period. After a few years, the system always turned back to meromixis. After ca. CE 1960, meromixis became particularly persistent. This can be attributed to the increased use of fertilizers (causing eutrophication) and warm summers after CE 1990. While interannual summer temperature variability played a major role in the mixing regime until ca. CE 1920, the climatic influence generally decreased in the following decades as the lake remained persistently in a meromictic state due to eutrophication. However, the climatic fingerprint remained detectable for very warm or cold summers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (e.g., fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterococci) have been used for decades to monitor for and protect the public from waterborne pathogens from fecal contamination. However, FIB may not perform well at predicting the presence of waterborne pathogens or human health outcomes from recreational exposure to fecal-contaminated surface waters. Numerous factors can influence the relationship between FIB and pathogens or human health outcomes, including the source(s) of contamination, the type of pathogen(s) present, differences in the survival and behavior of FIB and pathogens in the wastewater conveyance and treatment process, and varying environmental conditions. As a result, different indicators, such as source-specific microbial source tracking (MST) markers and viral fecal indicators, have been used as possible surrogates to better approximate pathogen abundance and human health risks in recreational waters. The parformance of these alternative indicators has been mixed, with some promise of viral indicators better approximating viral pathogens than bacterial fecal indicators, and FIB generally more closely associated with bacterial and protozoal pathogen presence than human MST markers. Many of the assays to detect and quantify fecal indicators and pathogens are polymerase chain reaction-based assays, which detect and quantify nucleic acid [deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA)] sequences specific to a target of interest Recent advances in DNA and RNA sequencing technologies may push the field toward metabarcoding approaches, where multiple targets can be detected and quantified simultaneously. Metabarcoding is currently more applicable to bacterial and protozoal assessments than viral assessments based on a lack of universal metabarcoding markers for viruses. Innovative technologies, such as biosensors and nanotechnologies, may provide more sensitive and accurate tools to detect and quantify pathogens. When a specific pathogen is of concern for a recreational water body, a practical approach in estimating the likelihood of human health outcomes is the application of quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs). Quantitative microbial risk assessments can be used to model the likelihood of pathogen-specific human health outcomes from recreational exposure as a function of a surrogate indicator. Inputs for QMRAs include the ratio between the indicator to be monitored and the pathogen of interest, the concentration of the indicator, the amount of water ingested, and the likelihood of the health outcome based on the estimated amount of pathogen consumed. There are numerous unknowns about the behavior and survival of fecal indicators and pathogens in environmental waters. Developing accurate models to predict pathogen concentrations from fecal indicators in recreational waters will require a better understanding of these unknowns. Current methods and technologies for detecting and quantifying fecal indicators and pathogens are limited due to the rare and patchy nature of pathogens. Technological advances may help improve sensitivity for detecting and quantifying pathogens.

AB  - Although nitrogen stable isotope ratio (delta N-15) in macroalgae is widely used as a bioindicator of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs to the coastal zone, recent studies suggest the possible role of macroalgae metabolism in delta N-15 variability. Simultaneous determinations of delta N-15 of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) along the land sea continuum, inter-species variability of delta N-15 and its sensitivity to environmental factors are necessary to confirm the efficiency of macroalgae delta N-15 in monitoring nitrogen origin in mixed-use watersheds. In this study, delta N-15 of annual and perennial macroalgae (Ulva sp., Enterommpha sp., Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus serratus) are compared to delta N-15-DIN along the Charente Estuary, after characterizing delta N-15 of the three main DIN sources (i.e. cultivated area, pasture, sewage treatment plant outlet). During late winter and spring, when human activities produce high DIN inputs, DIN sources exhibit distinct delta N-15 signals in nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+): cultivated area (+6.5 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand and +9.0 +/- 11.0 parts per thousand), pasture (+9.2 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand and +12.4 parts per thousand) and sewage treatment plant discharge (+16.9 +/- 8.7 parts per thousand and +25.4 +/- 5.9 parts per thousand). While sources show distinct delta N-15 NO3- in this multiple source catchment, the overall mixture of NO3- sources generally >95% DIN leads to low variations of delta N-15 NO3- at the mouth of the estuary (+7.7 to +/- 8.4 parts per thousand). Even if estuarine delta N-15 NO3- values are not significantly different from pristine continental and oceanic site (+7.3 parts per thousand and +/- 7.4 parts per thousand), macroalgae delta N-15 values are generally higher at the mouth of the estuary. This highlights high anthropogenic DIN inputs in the estuary, and enhanced contribution of N-15-depleted NH4+ in oceanic waters. Although seasonal variations in delta N-15 NO3- are low, the same temporal trends in macroalgae delta N-15 values at estuarine and oceanic sites, and inter-species differences in delta N-15 values, suggest that macroalgae delta N-15 values might be modified by the metabolic response of macroalgae to environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, light, DIN concentrations). Differences between annual and perennial macroalgae indicate both a higher integration time of perennial compared to annual macroalgae and the possible role of passive versus active uptake mechanisms. Further studies are required to characterize the sensitivity of macroalgae fractionation to variable environmental conditions and uptake mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil microbial biomass (SMB) measurements are often used in soil biological analysis; however, their interpretation can be problematic. In this review, both the limitations and benefits of indirect (both CHCl3 fumigation incubation and fumigation extraction, and substrate-induced respiration) SMB measurements are outlined, along with their value and interpretation as attributes or indicators to assess some soil quality (SQ) functions (e.g., enhance plant growth, maintain aggregation, regulate energy) for mainly humid, temperate soils, with specific emphasis on research conducted in eastern Canada and New Zealand. Indirect SMB methods are subject to limitations analogous to "soil test" procedures (e.g., soil sampling and handling, water content, storage prior to treatment), and also the difficulties with establishing an acceptable "control" and fraction (i.e., k value) of SMB mineralized or extracted. In many cases, such limitations present a need for some degree of standardization (e.g., pre-conditions of 7- to 10-d incubation at 25 degrees C and -0.001 MPa water potential) prior to SMB measurement. However, for SQ assessment, where "comparative" rather than "absolute" values of SMB are often of interest use of commonly derived k values seem appropriate for surface soils.
   Soil ecological factors govern SMB and often underlie much of the spatial and temporal variation in SMB. Plant species composition, mainly through net primary productivity and litter quality, can: affect SMB measurements along with trophic cascades in soil, where interactions among soil organisms can influence microbial activity. Benefits of SMB measurements relate mainly to the assessment of both soil C turnover and management induced changes in organic matter. The combination of SMB and delta(13)C to elucidate the transformations and fate of organic C in cropping and soil management systems has also shown that both temporal and spatial redistribution of C inputs, and soil type (i.e., particle size distribution) are dominant factors in turnover and nutrient flow through the SMB.
   For SQ assessment, SMB is not a useful indicator for the function of soil as a "medium for plant growth" in regard to plant productivity for intensively farmed temperate soils. For the function of soil to "maintain aggregation", where SMB is one agent only of a multi-faceted process, the relationship between SMB and soil aggregation is not always present and tends to be site-specific. In regard to the "regulate energy" soil function, SMB is related to some degree with decomposition and mineralization processes. The main role of SMB for SQ assessment is to serve within a minimum data set of other indicators (e.g., macroorganic C) to monitor soil organic C storage and change.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. National Natural Parks (NNP) - protected areas where anthropogenic and natural landscapes are combined in the same territory. In addition, the main functions of such objects are significantly competitive, which requires monitoring of changes in existing landscapes. It is necessary to define the local objects which, being the most sensitive, at the same time have small plasticity, therefore, are capable to react quickly and adequately to any changes. That is what we call indicative.
   Analysis of recent research and publications. Many researchers of the USA, Great Britain, Germany, Australia conduct landscape monitoring using remote sensing data and GIS technologies. For example, D. Keith, S. Rodoreda, L. Holman, R. Noss, U. Walz, and others. The National Inventory of Landscapes in Sweden studies development of modern landscape monitoring in countries of Europe. Landscape Monitoring of Terrestrial Ecosystems, studied by researches R. Kennedy, J. Jons, K. Jones and others allow using data of satellite for selection of plant contours using Gis-technology. Landscape monitoring of the territory of NNP "Slobozhanskiy" has never been carried out.
   The aim of the study is to choose satellite images, taking into account the area of the study, the choice of optimal methods of their processing for the compilation of a database of landscape structure facies for landscape monitoring based on long-term observations on the ground, comparing their results with geodata. We have determined wetlands, as landscape indicators.
   Presentation of the main material of the study. Comprehensive analysis of remote sensing data carried out by the authors, allowed us to make sure that vegetation cover is the most indicative, except for the contours of wetlands, which are clearly identified and easily compared in multi-spectral images. It is reliably determined by the characteristic features combine with the corresponding spectral ranges and the image structure. In addition, changes in vegetation allows you to visually determine changes in landscape groupings and the speed of these changes.
   Summary. The indicative features of landscape monitoring are wetlands, and there are two direct indicators: the contours of wetlands and the change in the aspect of vegetation. The monitoring method is a multi-spectral analysis of images obtained by processing combinations of spectral channels, which showed the ability to determine the changes in the selection, taking into account reflectivity of the surface. Limitations of the method are the following: there is no established method of meticulous analysis of changes in the structure of vegetation, which is observed visually, but is not reflected instrumentally; inability to take into account random features of the territory conditions and space scanning at a certain point, which is interesting for the study. Finally, the types of monitoring objects, indicative signs of changes and ways to track them according to high-precision and generally available satellite information are determined.

AB  - Although potential enzyme activity measurements have a long history of use as an indicator of microbial activity, current methods do not provide accurate estimates of in situ activity. In the field, diffusion rates typically limit the rate at which enzymes can pair with substrates. However, the common laboratory practice of creating soil slurries removes all diffusion constraints. In addition, temperature strongly affects in situ enzyme activities, but is rarely considered in enzyme assays. To address these limitations, we developed a new protocol to measure the moisture and temperature sensitivity of enzyme activities. We incorporated sensitivity data obtained using this protocol into a model to estimate the effects of temperature and moisture on in situ beta-glucosidase enzyme activity, recognizing that other factors such as substrate concentrations and diffusion constraints also affect in situ enzyme activities.
   Soil samples were collected from the Boston-Area Climate Experiment every two weeks over a 10-week period to track enzyme dynamics as field temperature and moisture changed. Precipitation inputs to an old-field were manipulated to produce drought (50% ambient precipitation), ambient, and wet (150% ambient precipitation) treatments. Temperature sensitivity of beta-glucosidase was determined by assaying for the enzyme in soil slurries at three different temperatures (15, 25 and 35 degrees C). Moisture sensitivity was determined by exposing soils to different moisture levels in the lab and adding substrate to homogenized dry or moist soils instead of slurries. Temperature sensitivity was calculated as Q(10) and moisture sensitivity was calculated using a linear regression for each field treatment at each sample collection date.
   Moisture sensitivity varied significantly among the five sample dates and treatments, whereas temperature sensitivity remained stable. At almost every time point, beta-glucosidase activity responded more strongly to increased moisture in soils of drought plots than in soils of ambient and wet plots. We estimated in situ beta-glucosidase activity in the fall using the temperature and moisture sensitivities. Estimates that used only temperature or only moisture sensitivity suggested that ambient plots had the highest activity, followed by wet and then drought plots. Estimates based on both temperature and moisture suggested that beta-glucosidase activity responded primarily to changes in temperature, except when soils were dry, with water potentials below -1 MPa. These results demonstrate that low soil moisture can strongly limit in situ enzyme activity in soils, negating any positive effect of warming. This study provides a template for parsing out the role of specific abiotic drivers on in situ enzyme activities, which could lead to the explicit incorporation of enzymes in biogeochemical models, improving upon the ability of current models to predict rates of biogeochemical processes in dynamic environments.

AB  - The assessment of environmental benefits resulting from biomass burning is a complex issue. The most reliable is when there is the possibility of empirical emission assessment using various fuels in energy installations. If no specific emission data is available, it should be estimated using appropriate indicators.
   There is still considerable uncertainty in the assessment of the impact of pollutant emissions accompanying the combustion of biomass on air quality on a local scale. This is caused not only by the lack of data on the amount of biomass burned but also by the lack of emission factors that would characterize real combustion. In this context, it is extremely important to expand knowledge about environmental aspects resulting from the use of energy biomass.
   The aim of the work was to compare and assess emission factors of toxic exhaust components obtained on the basis of direct measurements and indicators estimated using the index method, calculated on the basis of appropriate fixed-point indicators available in the literature. The work uses a commercially available automatic pellet boiler with a capacity of 10 kW. Combustion tests were carried out for five different materials, including wood pellets, energy plant pellets and agricultural waste. The emission factors were determined for CO, NOx and SO2 with reference to the unit of mass of fuel and calorific value of fuel.
   The CO, NOx, SO2 emission indices determined using the index method were burdened with a large error. In the case of CO and NOx emission indicators, this resulted from the course of the combustion process, which for the biofuels tested did not always run equally smoothly and without problems, which affected the obtained boiler power. During the conducted combustion tests, when the boiler reached its rated power and maximum load, the CO emission indices determined using the index method were much higher than those determined empirically. On the other hand, the NOx emission factors determined using the index method were lower than those determined empirically. It follows that setting emission indicators using biomass fuels may be subject to a very large error and not to inform about the actual emissions from low-capacity boilers installed in individual households.
   Because the combustion process is very sensitive to the conditions in which it occurs, and their slight change may cause major changes in emission factors, it can not be considered that the emission factors obtained in the conducted research can be an undisputable source of information about emissions from this type of installations. Further emission tests are required, taking into account different types of equipment, a wide range of their models and technologies as well as various biomass fuels. The results of this research will allow the development of more accurate drift rates for biomass fuels and for more precise estimation of emission factors.

AB  - Understory plants could can act as indicators of temperate forest sustainability, health and conservation status due to their importance in ecosystem function. Harvesting impacts on understory plant diversity depends on their intensity. Variable retention has been proposed to mitigate the harmful effects of timber harvesting, but its effectiveness remains unknown in southern Patagonian Nothofagus pumilio forests. The objectives of this study were to: (i) define a baseline of understory plant diversity in old-growth forests along a site quality gradient and under canopy gaps; (ii) evaluate stands with three different variable retention treatments compared to old-growth forests; and (iii) assess temporal changes during 4 years after harvesting (YAH). A 61 ha N. pumilio forest was selected. Understory plant (Dicotyledonae, Monocotyledonae and Pteridophyta) richness, cover (including woody debris and bare forest floor) and above-ground dry biomass were characterized in summer for 5 years. Before harvesting, baseline samples were conducted along a site quality gradient and outside/inside canopy gaps. Analyzed treatments include a control of old-growth forest (OGF) and three different harvesting treatments with variable retention: (i) dispersed retention (DR) of 30 m(2) ha(-1) (20-30% retention); (ii) aggregated retention (AR) with one aggregate per hectare and clear-cuts (28% retention); and (iii) combined dispersed and aggregated retention (DAR) with one aggregate per hectare and dispersed retention of 10-15 m(2) ha(-1) (40-50% retention). Data analyses included parametric and permutational ANOVAs, multivariate classification and ordinations. Before harvesting, 31 plant species were found, where richness, cover and biomass were directly related to site quality. The presence of canopy gaps did not have a significant impact on the measured variables. After harvesting, 20 new species appeared from adjacent associated environments (two from N. antarctica forests and 18 from grasslands and peatlands). At the stand level, understory values were higher in AR > DR > DAR > OGF. Most (81-95%) plant richness at baseline conditions was conserved in all treatments, where inside the aggregates understory remained similar to OGF. Combination of aggregated and dispersed retention (DAR) better limited exotic species introduction and protected sensitive species, improving conservation in harvested stands. Changes in understory variables were observed after the first YAH in all treatments; greater changes were observed in the harvested areas than in aggregates. Changes stabilized at the fourth YAH. As a conclusion, the location of retention aggregates should be selected to preserve species understory diversity of more speciose and diverse habitats or particularly uncommon stands. Implementation of different kinds (patterns and levels) of retention for improvement of biodiversity conservation in harvested forests should be included in timber and forest management planning.

AB  - Chattian mixed carbonate-siliciclastic deposits from two palaeogeographic units of Southern Alps, the Lessini Shelf and Venetian foreland basin of northeast Italy, are studied with respect to facies distributions and controlling ecological factors on dominant biogenic components. These ramp depositional systems are located in the western Southern Alps on the Lessini Shelf, and in the eastern Southern Alps in the Venetian foreland basin. The successions show an extensive geographic distribution of at least 150 km x 40 km at the southern margin of the Southern Alps. Palaeoenvironments are inferred following microfacies characteristics and floral and faunal indicators, especially those of coralline red algae and larger foraminifera. An inner- to middle homoclinal ramp morphology is reconstructed based on facies distributions and taxonomic and coralline algal growth-form proxy data.
   The distribution along depositional strike shows variation from thinner, carbonate dominated sequence in the west (Monti Berici and Monti Lessini) to a more variable, mixed carbonate-siliciclastic dominated environment to the east (Vittorio Veneto, Alpago). Facies character and occurrence are controlled by local hydrodynamic conditions and varying water turbidity of the studied ramp depositional system. The general facies succession shows a transgressive sequence from the proximal inner- to proximal middle ramp. A shoal belt of trough cross-bedded sandstones occurs in a proximal inner ramp position in all of the studied areas. In a gentle-dipping homoclinal ramp, most benthic organisms inhabited the relatively quite environments off these shoals in a distal inner ramp setting. Basinward environments (proximal middle ramp) constitute areas of maximal carbonate production and consist primarily of larger foraminiferal facies and rhodolith pavements. Larger foraminifera, represented by two larger foraminiferal assemblages, are most diversified in the shallower settings (near the fair-weather wave base, distal inner/proximal middle ramp), whereas coralline algae predominate in deeper areas (proximal middle ramp) constructing extensive rhodolith pavements. Rhodolith pavements are distinguished with respect to rhodolith shape, size, growth-forms and coralline algal taxonomic composition. Larger foraminifera are interpreted with respect to shell structures, shell architectures and comparable Recent counterparts.
   The analysed benthic communities thrived in a mesotrophic regime within trophic gradients constrained by fluvial influence. Coralline algal dominance and a moderately diverse larger foraminiferal assemblage suggest a tropical/warm temperate transition. The considerable stability imposed on sediments by the rhodolith pavement must also have significantly contributed to the maintenance of a middle ramp profile bulge. This study will contribute to a better understanding of Oligocene carbonates which have received less attention than their Eocene or Miocene counterparts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Soil Water-Atmosphere-Plants (SWAP) land surface model was developed at the Water Problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It is used to obtain scenario predictions of the change in the climatic values of plant water availability (the index of water availability averaged over the climatic period of similar to 30 years), as well as the changes in the variability in the annual values of the water availability of vegetation upon a possible climate change in the 21st century, for several large river basins of the world that are characterized by different natural conditions. In this respect, the ratio of actual to potential annual transpiration serves as an indicator of the water availability in the territory. The objects of geographical study include 11 river basins; they are explored within the framework of the ISI-MIP international project and are located on different continents and in different environments: the Rhine, Tagus, Ganges, Lena, Upper Yellow, Upper Yangtze, Niger, Mackenzie, Upper Mississippi, Upper Amazon, and Darling. The meteorological characteristics obtained with the use of five atmosphere-ocean general circulation models for four RCP scenarios of climate change are used as forcing data in calculations with the SWAP model. It is shown that only five of the 11 selected river basins are characterized by a lack of moisture: the basins of the Tagus, Ganges, Niger, Upper Mississippi, and Darling. The basin territories of the other rivers have a humid or semihumid character of moistening that will persist, even with climate change, until the end of the 21st century. For the five indicated basins, the change in their water availability due to possible climate change is analyzed in more detail. The changes in both the average (climatic) value of their annual water availability and the degree of water availability variation for certain years are studied based on the construction of an integral function of the water availability distribution for the climatic periods considered in this work (a historical period and prognostic periods). It is shown for the studied arid and semiarid basins that a small degree of their water availability either will stay at the present level or will decrease even more by the end of the 21st century. Thus, the tendency of possible climate changes in the 21st century in arid and semiarid regions will further aggravate a serious problem of food security, which involves the agricultural industry and the related water industry. This problem will require an accelerated transition of the interaction of humans with Nature to the principles of green farming, which is based on nature-based technologies for the use of natural resources that rationalize the consumption of water, soil, energy, and other resources of our planet.

AB  - Most previous Black Sea palynology studies have used pollen-spore assemblages as proxies for climate and landscape changes, and dinocyst assemblages as proxies for surface water salinity. However, there are few data on within-region variations in these assemblages using large sets of surface samples and a full suite of palynomorphs, including terrigenous pollen + spores, freshwater algal spores, and organic remains of marine microplankton, micro- and meiobenthos. Here we fill this knowledge gap, using results from a palynological study of 43 surface samples from water depths of 71-905 mbsl on the Ukrainian Shelf and adjoining continental slope, NW Black Sea. The palynology samples were collected in conjunction with water and sediment chemistry data, grain-size, micropaleontological and meiobenthos data from the EU-FP6 project HERMES "Hotspot Ecosystems Research on the Margins of European Seas". This dataset uniquely covers shelf and upper slope areas east and west of the Odessa-Sinop Fault Zone (OSFZ) that delimits areas of lower and higher hydrocarbon gas contents, respectively.
   The new data show that on the wide shelf with a shallow (ca. 80 m) oxycline, pollen assemblages differ from classical models for marine pollen transport. On the Ukrainian Shelf, pollen concentrations are extraordinarily high far offshore and the grains are often pyrite-infilled. These features apparently reflect high pollen preservation potential in low oxygen sediments, probably enhanced by cross-shelf transport of land-derived particulate organic matter. The new data have important consequences for accurate modelling of carbon burial and storage in epicontinental seas, and they provide a baseline for evaluating marine pollen concentrations expected to reflect the early Neolithic farming on the Ukrainian shelf. Furthermore, although large concentrations of dinocysts comprise more than half of the total Non-Pollen Palynomorphs (NPP), the high pollen concentrations skew the P:D index (pollen:dinocyst ratio) commonly used to evaluate changes in paleo-shoreline (proxy sea-level) positions. Despite the discharge of several large rivers to the Ukrainian Shelf, there are negligible traces of freshwater algae in the HERMES samples except at Sta. 15 where Pediastrum is abundant. Overall, palynomorphs of terrestrial origin make up about half (52%) of the acid-resistant organic-walled particles on the outer NW Black Sea Shelf and adjacent slope.
   The abundances of the major micro- and meiobenthic palynomorph groups show the same trends east and west of the OSFZ as the micropaleontological data reported for the HERMES samples taken at the same sites. The combined microzooplankton and zoobenthos surface assemblage data provide an important new baseline for evaluating historical and past changes in biodiversity and aquatic foodweb structure in the now polluted NW Black Sea. Comparison can also be made with foodweb reconstructions for Permian black shales.

AB  - We studied changes in the understory vegetation in two Danish forests (212 permanent plots in a 330 ha area) over a period of 23 years from 1993 to 2016. Changes were analyzed in relation to a shift in forest management towards close-to-nature silviculture, local natural disturbance (caused by storms), nitrogen deposition, and climatic change.
   The composition of the forests has gradually changed over time and have more deciduous forest stands, fewer coniferous stands and fewer open areas in 2016 compared to 1993.
   A total of 260 plant species was recorded in 212 plots surveyed four times between 1993 and 2016. Each plot consisted of two nested quadrats of 1 and 25 m(2), respectively. The number of species found per survey was steady in the first three surveys, but decreased from 2005 to 2016: 1993: 172; 1998: 169; 2005: 175; and 2016: 147.
   The abundance of individual species changed over the years: 32 species became significantly more abundant (winner species) and 24 species became significantly less abundant (loser species). Among the winners were ancient-forest species, forest species in general, broad-leaved tree species and stress-tolerant species. The loser species were mainly ruderals and light-demanding species.
   The mean number of species per plot increased during the study and, at the same time, plots became more homogenous indicating a narrower ecological space in terms of species composition. An analysis of Ellenberg Indicator values showed that mean L (light) and T (temperature) values per plot decreased during the study period while Ellenberg M (moisture) showed a small increase and Ellenberg R (reaction of soil) and N (nitrogen) showed no significant change during the study period.
   We conclude that changes in the understory vegetation were mainly caused by a general darkening of the forests. This is partly driven by a switch in forestry management practice from high forestry to close-to-nature silviculture, and partly by recovery after a severe storm in 1981. On average, the tree crowns became denser, and the cover of overstory increased. Consequently, the light availability for understory vegetation is significantly lower. No change in Ellenberg Indicator Values related to effects of climate warming or nitrogen deposition could be detected in this study.
   The benefits of close-to-nature forest management are discussed in relation to biodiversity protection, where it seems to promote at least plant species characteristic of old-growth forest stands. However, close-to-nature forest management does not necessarily create suitable conditions for other organism groups and is not a general quick-fix for biodiversity protection as such.

AB  - Defining appropriate management and conservation strategies to maximize tidal marsh resilience to sea level rise requires a clear understanding of the causes of marsh degradation. While sea level rise is a well-known threat to tidal marshes, current and past management practices on marshes can also greatly influence present-day marsh condition, resilience and future persistence. Using point-intercept analysis of maps and imagery, we assessed the past and current landcover and elevation of Delaware Estuary tidal marshes in New Jersey, USA. We estimated the historic extent of tidal marsh impoundment for agriculture and determined current marsh vegetation composition and elevation in areas that were and were not historically impounded. We estimate that more than half of all tidal marsh in the 36,539 ha study area had been historically impounded. A small fraction of this area remains impounded at present (7.6%). While tidal flow has since returned to formerly diked areas, marsh recovery has been incomplete. Overall 21.6% (4048.8 ha) of formerly impounded marsh has not revegetated, becoming open water after impoundment breaches. Marsh loss as a result of impoundment is also responsible for the loss of 23 km of adjacent shoreline beaches. Conversely, only 0.5% of marsh that was never impounded has converted to open water since 1931. This difference is likely due to dramatic elevation deficits caused by impoundment. Marsh elevation of current and formerly impounded areas (derived from LiDAR and validated with RTK GPS) is significantly lower than the elevation of marsh areas that were never impounded. Supporting this finding, the frequency of high marsh vegetation (an indicator of higher elevation)in vegetated formerly impounded areas is half that of areas that were never impounded. Marsh edge erosion and creek expansion have added an additional estimated 3836 ha to the amount of tidal marsh loss since 1931. Marsh transgression inland into forest and agricultural areas has resulted in estimated gains in marsh area of 2815 ha, offsetting a considerable proportion of losses. Given our results, we recommend the following management actions to maximize tidal marsh persistence in the Delaware Estuary: (1) Beneficial use of sediment to offset marsh elevation deficits resulting from historic impoundment, (2) Strategic land protection to maximize the potential for inland marsh migration, (3) Tidal flow restoration to remaining impounded areas in combination with the beneficial use of sediment to address elevation deficits. Determining the impacts to tidal marshes from past management practices makes it possible parse the relative contribution of relative sea level rise and site-level management, resulting in more targeted conservation strategies.

AB  - Wind energy generation is increasing globally, and associated environmental impacts must be considered. The risk of seabirds colliding with offshore wind turbines is influenced by flight height, and flight height data usually come from observers on boats, making estimates in daylight in fine weather. GPS tracking provides an alternative and generates flight height information in a range of conditions, but the raw data have associated error. Here, we present a novel analytical solution for accommodating GPS error. We use Bayesian state-space models to describe the flight height distributions and the error in altitude measured by GPS for lesser black-backed gulls and great skuas, tracked throughout the breeding season. We also examine how location and light levels influence flight height. Lesser black-backed gulls flew lower by night than by day, indicating that this species would be less likely to encounter turbine blades at night, when birds' ability to detect and avoid them might be reduced. Gulls flew highest over land and lowest near the coast. For great skuas, no significant relationships were found between flight height, time of day and location. We consider four collision risk windows', corresponding to the airspace swept by rotor blades for different offshore wind turbine designs. We found the highest proportion of birds at risk for a 22-250 m turbine (up to 9% for great skuas and 34% for lesser black-backed gulls) and the lowest for a 30-258m turbine. Our results suggest lesser black-backed gulls are at greater risk of collision than great skuas, especially by day.Synthesis and applications. Our novel modelling approach is an effective way of resolving the error associated with GPS tracking data. We demonstrate its use on GPS measurements of altitude, generating important information on how breeding seabirds use their environment. This approach and the associated data also provide information to improve avian collision risk assessments for offshore wind farms. Our modelling approach could be applied to other GPS data sets to help manage the ecological needs of seabirds and other species at a time when the pressures on the marine environment are growing.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau has many endorheic lakes which are an important part of the Asia Water Tower. In recent decades, the warming rate of the Tibetan Plateau is two times higher than the global average, and precipitation also has obvious increase. As the largest cryosphere system in the middle and low latitudes, the temperature and precipitation changes in the Tibetan Plateau have profound impacts on the lakes in the region. Before 1990, low temperature caused negative balance of lake water storage by suppressing melting water. In 1990-2000, increase of lake water stoage was promoted by temperature increase. After 2000, precipitation is the dominant factor causing the increase of lake water storage, but the continuous temperature rise in 2005-2013 strengthened evaporation and weakened the increase of lake water storage. Glaciers have different impacts on lake water storage. During the period of 2000-2013, glacier melting water contribution to lake water increase in the central and northwest parts of the Tibetan Plateau is up to 50% and 100%, respectively. Changes in water quantity and salinity are the results of lake water budget under climate change, which are important indicators and their temporal and spatial characteristics may reflect the influence of the westerly and Indian monsoon on land surface water cycle. The trend of the lake water storage in different parts of the Tibetan Plateau from 1970s to 2013 is consistent with that of precipitation in the westerly and Indian monsoon-controlled areas. It is found that with the increase of lake water storage, the salinity of lakes generally decreases in the Serling Co area. The physical and chemical properties of lake water are important factors affecting lake ecosystems, and their changes under different climatic conditions have profound impacts on the composition and trend of lake ecosystems. Increase in water temperature promotes the transmission efficiency of food chain, which leads to high ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton and low ratio of phytoplankton to total phosphorus. Decrease in lake salinity increases the biodiversity and makes lake ecosystem structure relatively complex. In lakes with salinity of about 3-5 or 25-28 g/L, zooplankton species composition is the most sensitive to salinity change. Based on the analyses of the relationships among lake area, water level, water quantity, water physicochemical parameters and climate changes in the Tibetan Plateau, this paper reviews the research progress on lakes as a response to climate change in the region, and puts forward the main objectives and tasks of the lake research in the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition Program.

AB  - Three suites of synthetic chars, produced from honey mesquite, cordgrass and loblolly pine under controlled combustion conditions, served as model materials for diverse natural chars originating from combustion of angiosperm/gymnosperm and woody/non-woody plants. The lignin oxidation products (LOPs), quantified using the alkaline cupric oxide (CuO) oxidation method, were used to study the impact of combustion on lignins and their commonly used parameters.
   Our results show that combustion can greatly decrease the yield of the eight major lignin phenols (vanillyl, syringyl and cinnamyl phenols) with no lignin phenols detected in any synthetic char produced at >= 400 degrees C. With increasing combustion temperature, the value of the syringyl/vanillyl phenols ratio (S/V) of angiosperm char initially increased but then declined dramatically when the temperature reached 200-250 degrees C. The pattern of change may relate to the thermal alteration of the plant cell ultrastructure. The cinnamyl/vanillyl phenols ratio value (C/V) of a non-woody plant, cordgrass, also showed a similar two-stage change with increasing combustion temperature. Combustion duration also caused a similar effect on the yield and signatures of lignin phenols, showing that the combustion severity (temperature and/or duration) has great influence on LOP yield and signature. The acid/aldehyde ratio of vanillyl phenols [(Ad/Al)(v)] and syringyl phenols [(Ad/Al)(s)] increased with increasing combustion temperature and duration and reached a maximum value at 300350 degrees C, regardless of plant species. The highly elevated acid/aldehyde ratio value reached in some cases exceeded the reported values of humic and fulvic acids extracted from soils and sediments. Furthermore, the ratio of 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid to vanillyl phenols (3,5Bd/V), a soil humification indicator, increased significantly during combustion at 250-350 degrees C in char samples from all the plant species. Our results imply that changes in LOP signatures in chars can serve as potential indicators of their formation temperature.
   Simulations using a two end member mixing model showed that different char samples, with different degrees of lignin alteration, could have a substantial effect on the biomarker signatures of soil organic matter (SOM). The shifts in lignin signatures in SOM vary widely, depending on the SOM characteristics (e.g. soil litter vs. mineral soil) and the proportion of char in the mixture. Overall, the input of high temperature char tends to dilute the lignin signal in SOM and may lead to underestimation of vascular plant OM input to environmental matrices. Our observations demonstrate that, in addition to photochemical degradation, thermal alteration is an important abiotic lignin degradation process. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drinking water governance is challenging with different perceptions and priorities among stakeholders in different countries. To make provision for drinking water protection in agricultural areas, governance systems need to be mapped for bottlenecks to be identified and solutions highlighted. To address this a system thinking approach was used in an explanatory network analysis of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) that were created during face to face interviews with stakeholder representative groups (individuals, policy developers, researchers, and regulators). Two exercises were designed and facilitated to obtain stakeholder maps on A) the water governance framework from stakeholders' own perspective with a ranking of actors in terms of their perceived importance and B) a list of importance factors and how these were connected for the provision of good drinking water quality supplies in agricultural areas. Causal relationships were subsequently drawn around each subject allowing mapping. A graph theory Hierarchy Index (h) approach examined if stakeholder groups preferred top down hierarchical governance or a more inclusive democratic governance approach. Finally, an auto-associative neural network method was deployed on group maps for examination during steady-state conditions for three scenarios to be explored i.e. changing "Farmers knowledge", "best management practice (BMP) uptake" and "Farmers behaviour and belief" to the highest level of influence and seeing how the system reacted. Results of Exercise A showed that all stakeholder representative groups had a different perception of the water governance framework. Most stakeholder groups had a democratic point of view regarding water governance structures and the ranking and importance of the actors within the framework. Results of Exercise B demonstrated that most of the groups have similar opinions regarding the highest ranked factors affecting drinking water quality and the possible environmental ecological policy options. In this second exercise, only one representative group showed a democratic outlook whereas all others had a hierarchal outlook. Scenario testing of policy options enabled bottlenecks and possible solutions to be identified. By boosting "Farmers behaviour and belief" to the highest possible level, resulted in a large increase in other factors - a scenario where farmers could benefit from the outcome. This would be achieved by enhancing farmers' willingness and intention to participate and implement BMPs. Better results would be achieved if farmers believed in the method and could benefit from the outcome. Also keeping "Farmers knowledge" at the highest point had a positive influence on the other factors. This can be achieved by enhancing farmers training and knowledge transfer by local and national actors. This method is widely applicable and should be considered for more integrated and participatory approaches to drinking water governance. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background
   Iguacu National Park (INP) is known worldwide due to Iguacu Waterfalls, being considered a World Natural Heritage by UNESCO. The INP is one of the last large forested extensions of inland Brazil that provides protection to the Atlantic Forest, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. However, its Natural Heritage status has been threatened by the construction and operation of the Baixo Iguacu dam, agricultural and urban impacts on its boundaries and the increasing interest of the Brazilian government in re-opening of the "Colono road", an old illegal road that crossed the interior of the park. Indeed, since benthic macroinvertebrates have been widely used for the environmental assessment of streams, records and abundance of their taxa under different seasonal periods may provide an additional dataset for biomonitoring of hydrographic systems in the face of current anthropogenic impacts on the INP boundaries and other similar streams on forest edges.
   New information
   In this study, we improved the sampling design of benthic macroinvertebrates and provided seasonal records covering distinct precipitation/temperature periods between 2016 and 2017 of a stream on the eastern edge of the Iguacu National Park, Brazil. The records total 2,840 individuals distributed in 88 different taxa. The most abundant taxa were the Diptera subfamilies, Chironominae (n = 1,487) and Tanypodinae (n = 256), besides the Heterelmis genus (n = 152, Elmidae; Coleoptera). Diptera was the richest order in number of families (n = 8), while Leptophlebiidae (Ephemeroptera) was the richest taxonomic family in number of genera (n = 11). Aegla (Crustacea) and the Insecta genera, Heterelmis, Hexacylloepus, Noelmis, Phylloicus and Thraulodes, were recorded through all samplings. Twenty-five genera of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) and Odonata were recorded during intermediate precipitation/temperature periods. Twenty-one of them were recorded in May 2016, with five genera standing out in abundance (Hydrosmilodon, Anacroneuria, Argia, Coryphaeschna, Americabaetis) and four (Needhamella, Tikuna, Simothraulopsis, Neocordulia) in December 2016. Four general taxa were exclusive of the lower precipitation/temperature period (August 2016), standing out in abundance were the Oxystigma (Odonata) and Corydalus (Megaloptera) genera. In March 2017 (higher precipitation/temperature period), four exclusive taxa were recorded, amongst them, the Chimarra (Trichoptera) genus. Furthermore, seasonal records demonstrated higher occurrences and abundance of macroinvertebrates during the intermediate and lower precipitation/temperature periods, besides a varied taxa composition throughout the year, with the presence of both sensitive and tolerant groups to environmental impacts. Our findings suggest that the number and composition of the local-stream macrobenthic fauna were influenced by the seasonal climatic regime. These changes should be considered in the limnological monitoring developed on the hydrographic systems of INP eastern edges to improve the assessment of environmental quality under different local seasonal conditions.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to study the sources of natural radioactive elements entering drinking water and their areal distribution, as well as the possibility of using carbonate sediments of drinking water (scale) in geochemical and environmental studies. In the Republic of Bashkortostan (Russia), these studies are favoured by different geological structures within the area (mountainous area, foredeep and platform) and variety of rocks of different age and composition (volcanic, igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic), which determines the diversity of the microelement profile of the area.
   The aim of the research is to assess the radioactive elements content and spatial distribution in anthropogenic carbonate sediments (drinking water scale).
   Object of the research. The data on U and Th content in 467 samples of carbonate deposits (scale) from 267 settlements of the Republic of Bashkortostan was analysed. Samples were taken from various utensils (enamelled and electric kettles, pots, boilers), which is used for boiling water from centralized and individual (wells, streams) water sources.
   Methods. The method of instrumental neutron activation analysis based on the research nuclear reactor IRT-T TPU was used to analyse the uranium and thorium content. Data processing was carried out using software packages Statistica 8.0 and Microsoft Excel. The spatial distribution of natural radioactive elements was mapped using ArcGIS 10.2 in the Geostatistical Analyst module using the inverse distance method.
   Result. The data obtained allow speaking about uneven distribution of natural radioactive elements (U, Th) in anthropogenic carbonate deposits on the territory of the Republic of Bashkortostan. The average level of the studied chemical elements is characterized by low values of both uranium and thorium. Variations of their content in the studied formations are determined by the combined impact of natural and anthropogenic factors. The regularities of U distribution in scale samples correspond to the geological structure of the territory. Within the platform part, uranium distribution is more uniform than in the mountainous part of the Republic, which reflects the comparative homogeneity of geological and tectonic conditions. According to the results of mapping, four zones of high uranium content in samples of anthropogenic carbonate deposits were identified: Trans-Uralian, Uralian, Western and Southern. In Th spatial distribution there was no clear correlation with the features of the geological structure and metallogeny of the territory. There are three zones: Northern, Central and South-Eastern. Negative anomalies of Th content geographically coinciding with large mining centers are noted. Th/U ratio is characterized by a low value for the whole territory of Bashkortostan - 0,002. At the same time, positive anomalies of this indicator were recorded in the Northern and South-Eastern parts of the Republic, where they are mainly determined by geological component.

AB  - With water shortages increasing worldwide, several Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) models have been developed for assessing the potential impacts of water consumption (deprivation) on ecosystems and human health. Each model uses different water scarcity concepts, measurement scales, and indicators, resulting in distinct characterization factors (CFs) available for the same region over time. However, to date, no previous work has compared water scarcity models to identify those more suitable for countries outside of Europe, considering national hydrological divisions and environmental conditions. Furthermore, no previous studies have investigated the sensitiveness of background hydrological data, applied to calculate water scarcity CFs, in regions that historically experience water scarcity, such as the Brazilian semiarid region. This is important because global hydrological data may present high uncertainty and indicate low scarcity in regions that suffer with water scarcity issues. Therefore, this work initially evaluated midpoint models for water scarcity and recommended the most appropriate models for application at the Brazilian hydrographic division level, defined by the Brazilian Water Agency (ANA). A critical review of twelve midpoint models was performed based on four main criteria: (i) indicator broadness; (ii) scientific robustness; (iii) availability of CFs for Brazil; and (iv) regionalization potential of CFs for ANA geopolitical hydrographic divisions, considering the availability of national data. Each criterion was given a score of 1 to 5 for each analyzed model and a recommendation was made based on the final score, obtained by averaging the scores of each criterion. Results showed that the best-rated models were those that adopted the monthly Water Stress Index (WSI) and the AWARE index. Both models were robust, presented CFs at a monthly scale, and could be partially regionalized by applying national monitoring data available in national databases. Nonetheless, none of these models applied a broad water scarcity concept that encompassed both physical and economic water scarcities, nor presented CFs for the Brazilian hydrographic divisions. Furthermore, a case study was performed, comparing the CFs provided by AWARE and WSI with the regionalized values, which were calculated using national hydrological data. This case study focused on the S5o Francisco watershed and on the Rio Verde Grande, a smaller watershed belonging to the Sao Francisco, known for its historical water scarcity problems. The results of this case study showed that a finer regionalization scale and the use of local data allow to represent better the local water scarcity for sub-regions in comparison with the original watershed level, especially for semiarid regions. The approach proposed in this study for evaluating life cycle impact models at country level is new and may be applied in other studies, aiming to indicate models for specific world regions.

AB  - A detailed organic geochemical study; utilising petrography, biomarker hydrocarbon analysis and high temperature GC analysis of extractable wax hydrocarbon constituents was performed on four marginally oil window-mature source rocks from the Shahejie Formation (Eocene), Damintun depression in eastern China. The main maceral components in the source rocks were vitrinite, liptinite and exinite, with vitrinite being more abundant (> 50 vol.%) in organic-lean samples whose TOC contents were between 1 and 2 wt.%. Large differences in pristane/phytane ratios suggested that the organic-rich samples were deposited in a less oxic depositional environment than that for the organic-lean rocks. The distribution of extractable wax hydrocarbons, determined by high temperature GC, showed a marked difference between these two sample types. The organic-rich samples contained high molecular weight hydrocarbons (HMWHCs) dominated by macrocrystalline n-alkanes (n-C-23-n-C-37, typically maximising at n-C-29), while the organic-lean samples contained lower amounts of extractable wax hydrocarbons but were relatively rich in microcrystalline components (> n-C-35). In all source rocks (Es3 and Es4), a noticeable odd-over-even predominance (OEP) of n-alkane chain lengths (up to n-C-65) was evident, consistent with a direct biological origin for the long n-alkyl chains. They were most probably formed during diagenesis from decarboxylation of predominantly even-carbon-numbered aliphatic acids originating from higher plant or lacustrine algal sources and/or were directly biosynthesised in hydrocarbon form. At least two other homologous series of branched/cyclic HMWHCs were observed, one of which was confirmed as a series of branched alkanes (probably methyl-branched). The carbon number distribution patterns of HMWHCs may be primarily controlled by thermal maturity and biogenic source input as well as being influenced by diagenetic reactions governed by depositional environmental conditions, as shown previously [Carlson, R.M.K., Teerman, S.C., Moldowan, J.M., Jacobson, S.R., Chan, E.I., Dorrough, K.S., Seetoo, W.C., Mertani, B., 1993.

Our study indicates for the first time that Es3 source rocks as well as Es4 facies contain HMWHCs. The distributions of extractable wax hydrocarbons suggest that both Es4 and Es3 members may potentially serve as important parent source rocks for generating waxy petroleum in this region, (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nowadays, Tunisia faces challenging environmental and energy issues which relate mainly to the implementation of an appropriate solid waste management system capable of dealing with the high production of biowaste on the one hand, and the increased need for water and energy resources on the other. Therefore, the current study is intended to develop a closed cycle technical concept treating mainly food waste (FW) through combined biological processes. In this approach, FW anaerobic digestion (AD) was destined to provide a valuable input material for FW in vessel-composting by exploiting the produced digestates. To this end, the gathered AD-effluents of three systems (D1, D2, D3) were entirely analyzed to select, as a further step, the most suitable one to be subject of the suggested post-treatment. Hence, several physiochemical parameters were examined as key performance indicators. It mainly consisted of moisture content, pH, C:N ratio and heavy metals contents. The current findings depicted that the generated digestates were characterized by a high moisture content which inspired its utilization as an unconventional moisturizing agent (MA) aiming to reduce the fresh water consumption during the composting process. Thus, two experimental setups were carried out to evaluate the effect of the selected digestate on FW-in-vessel composting process performance, as a non-standard MA inserted to A2, comparing to the unamended one (A1) which was moistened by fresh water. In fact, basing on the above-mentioned criteria, the relatively high C:N ratio (of around 15), as well as the relatively significant rate of the required macro- and micro-nutrients promoted the exploitation of biochar-rich digestate (D3) as not only an efficient unconventional MA, but also as a composting process booster. Furthermore, the results revealed that the addition of D3 improved significantly the composting process performance in terms of steering parameters including the attained temperature, MC and pH. When it comes to the maturity and stability assessment, the decreased profiles of C:N ratio, the nitrification index (NI), as well as the respiration activity (AT4) ascertained the fulfilment of the required conditions for both A1 and A2 to produce stable and mature end-products. However, regarding the compost quality, the examined concentrations of heavy metals met the requirement set by German standards and attested that both A1 and A2 generated highly-qualified products, rated as class B and A, respectively. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to mention that even the AD-effluents which were classified as an "inappropriate substrate" to be inserted to the composters, met the required criteria to be applied directly to land as a highly-qualified liquid biofertilizer. This latter ascertained, additionally, the efficiency and feasibility of the suggested closed cycle for a sustainable FW management.

AB  - Agricultural practice is one of the most important factors leading to biodiversity loss. EU policies addressing this problem involve the provision of incentives for agri-environmental measures (AEM) and setting of targets for AEM on the national scale (e.g. for the amount of organic farming according to the German sustainability strategy), as well as monitoring their success. For AEM to most efficiently target, implement and monitor, they require comparable evaluation of results, describing their quantitative effects on biodiversity and nature conservation. However, there is a dearth of regional data about species and habitats, parts of biodiversity that are relevant for nature conservation. Thus, quantitative analyses are not typically feasible. Furthermore, impacts of agricultural practices on biodiversity cannot be analysed and evaluated merely from individual cases. Comparisons with average or maximum achievements on different spatial scales (benchmarking) are needed. However, meaningful state and pressure indicators are lacking for modelling the nature conservation value of agricultural fields and the consequences of changing pressures from agricultural practice.
   In this paper we present a model for evaluating the nature conservation value of field habitats based on projected field flora species richness. We propose a combination of an existing evaluation scale for habitat types, as the basis of the model setup, with field flora species richness. These are combined to obtain differentiated conservation values of field habitats as a measure of agricultural effects. We defined the field flora species richness as the total number of species on a homogenously managed field minus the cultivated crop. Indicators of the model are farming practices and site conditions. Based on an extensive literature review, these indicators were analysed regarding their influence on the flora species richness. Influences of the farming practices were reflected by the crop type, which was used as key indicator. As an outcome, the influence of conventional farming, organic farming and nature conservation oriented management on flora species richness was quantified. Additionally, we integrated the diversity of crop types and (semi-) natural habitats of the surrounding landscape into the model, in order to consider potential effects of landscape heterogeneity on field flora species richness.
   The model was applied in a case study at the NUTS 3-regional level (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics), using the example of the AEM organic farming. In a scenario, we evaluated the possible effects of a complete conversion to organic farming on the assumed flora species richness. The results reveal that the modelling approach can be used to test for the effects of (i) conversion between organic and conventional farming, (ii) changes in crop rotations, and (iii) targeted positioning of organic farming or botanical management agreements in comparison to the spatially untargeted offering of payments.

AB  - Groundwater plays a dominant role in the eco-environmental protection of arid and semi-arid regions. Understanding the sources and mechanisms of groundwater recharge, the interactions between groundwater and surface water and the hydrogeochemical evolution and transport processes of groundwater in the Longdong Loess Basin, Northwest China, is of importance for water resources management in this ecologically sensitive area. In this study, 71 groundwater samples (mainly distributed at the Dongzhi Tableland and along the Malian River) and 8 surface water samples from the Malian River were collected, and analysis of the aquifer system and hydrological conditions, together with hydrogeochemical and isotopic techniques were used to investigate groundwater sources, residence time and their associated recharge processes. Results show that the middle and lower reaches of the Malian River receive water mainly from groundwater discharge on both sides of valley, while the source of the Malian River mainly comes from local precipitation. Groundwater of the Dongzhi Tableland is of a HCO3-Ca-Na type with low salinity. The reverse hydrogeochemical simulation suggests that the dissolution of carbonate minerals and cation exchange between Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ are the main water-rock interactions in the groundwater system of the Dongzhi Tableland. The delta O-18 (from -11.70 parts per thousand to -8.52 parts per thousand) and delta H-2 (from -86.15 parts per thousand to -65.75 parts per thousand) values of groundwater are lower than the annual weighted average value of precipitation but closer to summer-autumn precipitation and soil water in the unsaturated zone, suggesting that possible recharge comes from the summer-autumn monsoonal heavy precipitation in the recent past (<= 220 a). The corrected C-14 ages of groundwater range from 3,000 to 25,000 a old, indicating that groundwater was mainly from precipitation during the humid and cold Late Pleistocene and Holocene periods. Groundwater flows deeper from the groundwater table and from the center to the east, south and west of the Dongzhi Tableland with estimated migration rate of 1.29-1.43 m/a. The oldest groundwater in the Quaternary Loess Aquifer in the Dongzhi Tableland is approximately 32,000 a old with poor renewability. Based on the delta O-18 temperature indicator of groundwater, we speculate that temperature of the Last Glacial Maximum in the Longdong Loess Basin was 2.4 degrees C-6.0 degrees C colder than the present. The results could provide us the valuable information on groundwater recharge and evolution under thick loess layer, which would be significative for the scientific water resources management in semi-arid regions.

AB  - Continental atmospheric relative humidity (RH) is a key climate parameter. Combined with atmospheric temperature, it allows us to estimate the concentration of atmospheric water vapor, which is one of the main components of the global water cycle and the most important gas contributing to the natural greenhouse effect. However, there is a lack of proxies suitable for reconstructing, in a quantitative way, past changes of continental atmospheric humidity. This reduces the possibility of making model-data comparisons necessary for the implementation of climate models. Over the past 10 years, analytical developments have enabled a few laboratories to reach sufficient precision for measuring the triple oxygen isotopes, expressed by the O-17-excess (O-17-excess = ln (delta O-17+1)-0.528 x ln (delta O-18+1)), in water, water vapor and minerals. The O-17-excess represents an alternative to deuterium-excess for investigating relative humidity conditions that prevail during water evaporation. Phytoliths are micrometric amorphous silica particles that form continuously in living plants. Phytolith morphological assemblages from soils and sediments are commonly used as past vegetation and hydrous stress indicators. In the present study, we examine whether changes in atmospheric RH imprint the O-17-excess of phytoliths in a measurable way and whether this imprint offers a potential for reconstructing past RH. For that purpose, we first monitored the O-17-excess evolution of soil water, grass leaf water and grass phytoliths in response to changes in RH (from 40 to 100 %) in a growth chamber experiment where transpiration reached a steady state. Decreasing RH from 80 to 40% decreases the O-17-excess of phytoliths by 4.1 per meg/% as a result of kinetic fractionation of the leaf water subject to evaporation. In order to model with accuracy the triple oxygen isotope fractionation in play in plant water and in phytoliths we recommend direct and continuous measurements of the triple isotope composition of water vapor. Then, we measured the O-17-excess of 57 phytolith assemblages collected from top soils along a RH and vegetation transect in inter-tropical West and Central Africa. Although scattered, the O-17-excess of phytoliths decreases with RH by 3.4 per meg/%. The similarity of the trends observed in the growth chamber and nature supports that RH is an important control of O-17-excess of phytoliths in the natural environment. However, other parameters such as changes in the triple isotope composition of the soil water or phytolith origin in the plant may come into play. Assessment of these parameters through additional growth chambers experiments and field campaigns will bring us closer to an accurate proxy of changes in relative humidity.

AB  - Solar heating and cooling (SHC) systems are currently under rapid development and deployment due to their potential to reduce the use of fossil fuel resources and to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector - a sector which is responsible for 40% of the world energy use. Absorption chiller technology (traditionally powered by natural gas in large buildings), can easily be retrofitted to run on solar energy. However, numerous non-intuitive design choices must be analyzed to achieve the best techno-economic performance of these systems. To date, there has been little research into the optimal configurations among the long list of potential solar-driven absorption chiller systems. To address this lack of knowledge, this paper presents a systematic simulation-based, multi-objective optimization of three common, commercially available lithium bromide-water absorption chillers - single-effect, double-effect and triple-effect - powered by evacuated tube collectors (ETCs), evacuated flat plate collectors (EFPCs), and concentrating parabolic trough collectors (PTCs), respectively. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study of its kind that compares the optimized designs of the most promising configurations of solar-assisted absorption chillers against a common set of energy, economic, and environmental metrics from a holistic perspective. A simulation model of these three configurations is developed using TRNSYS 17. A combined energy, economic, and environmental analysis of the modeled systems is conducted to calculate the primary energy use as well as the levelized total annual cost of each plant, which are considered as two conflicting objective functions. By coupling TRNSYS and MATLAB, a multi-objective optimization model is formulated using a genetic algorithm to simultaneously minimize these objectives, thereby determining a set of optimal Pareto solutions corresponding to each SHC configuration. The performance of the proposed systems at their optimal designs is then compared to that of a reference conventional system. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to assess the influence of fuel cost, capital cost of innovative components, and the annual interest rate on the Pareto front of optimal solutions. Overall, the optimization results reveal that of the proposed configurations, the SHC double effect chiller has the best trade-off between the energetic, economic and environmental performance of the system, having a total cost of similar to 0.7-0.9 M$ per year and reducing the annual primary energy use and CO2 emissions by 44.5-53.8% and 49.1-58.2% respectively (relative to the reference conventional system). With the high capital cost associated with these systems, government subsidies and incentives are still required in order for them to achieve satisfactory payback times and become cost-competitive with conventional HVAC systems.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;A number of studies have explored how the body size and extremities of frogs vary in response to the changing environmental conditions across different geographical gradients, but the outcomes remain controversial. Here, we studied the morphological variations of the plateau brown frog (Rana kukunoris) along an elevation gradient (~1800-3500 m) on the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to understand how environmental and biological factors affect them, and to assess whether these variations help to improve thermoregulation. Although we found that male and female frogs showed different variations in body size and extremities along the elevational gradient, both of them showed a significant decrease in the ratio of extremities to body size with increasing elevation. The decreasing ratio implies a gain of thermoregulatory benefits based on the ecogeographical rules. Moreover, the morphological variations were found to be strongly related to both environmental and biological factors. These results suggest that ecogeographical adaptation in frogs may be more complicated than other terrestrial vertebrate species. Most importantly, the adaptation should be viewed as a result of both environmental and biological factors, while it may also appear as an interactive change between body size and extremities.<br>Several anurans have broad elevational and latitudinal distribution ranges; distinct species and populations may face various environmental and selection stresses. Due to their environmental sensitivity, adaptation is critical for the long-term persistence of anurans. Previous studies have tried to identify the ecogeographical pattern and its mechanism in anurans, suggesting different patterns, but the related explanatory mechanisms are yet to be generally supported and are suggested to be complicated. To explore the elusive mechanisms, we studied the morphological variation of the plateau brown frog (Rana kukunoris) along an elevational gradient on the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Using body size, extremity length, and the ratio between them (extremities/body size) as testing indicators, we examined potential ecogeographical adaptations and investigated how environmental and biological factors could shape the morphological development in R. kukunoris. We found that males and females showed different variations in body size and extremities along the elevational gradient, whereas both of them showed a decreasing extremities/body size ratio along elevation. Together with the strong correlations between environmental and biological factors and the morphometrics, we identified ecogeographical adaptation and a sexual difference in the selective pressures on the extremities and body size of the plateau brown frog. Our results imply that geographic variations in anuran morphological traits should be understood as an outcome of environmental and biological factors. Furthermore, ecogeographical adaptation in anurans can manifest as an interactive change between body size and extremities.

AB  - To be an effective indicator of mineralization in lake sediment surveys within the Canadian Shield, it is desirable that an element migrate in solution or adsorbed on suspensates. Given the low relief and disorganized drainage patterns of this region, dispersal in clastic form in drainage systems is limited and gives rise to erratic distributions. The purpose of this study was to discover whether Au shows significant hydromorphic mobility, which would justify the increasing use that is being made of this element in lake sediments as an indicator for gold mineralization.
   Waters and lake sediments were collected from Napier Lake, Ontario; PAP Lake, Saskatchewan; and Foster Lake, Manitoba, all of which contain Au-quartz vein mineralization and lie within the glaciated boreal forest zone of the Canadian Shield. In all three areas, profundal lake sediments downdrainage of mineralization contain Au concentrations higher than regional mean concentrations. Significant dissolution and transport of Au was found under oxidizing conditions associated with waters with pH that varied from acid to alkaline. Waters from drill holes penetrating mineralization contain up to 401 ng L-1 Au (note; 1 ng L-1 is equivalent to 1 part per trillion, 10(-12)). Surface waters overlying or near mineralization collected from bop, seeps, ponds and streams contain up to 13 ng L-1. The content of Au in lake waters is lower, with a maximum of 1.1 ng L-1. There is also a detectable quantity of Au present in suspensates. Two samples of particulates (> 1 mum) filtered from lake water have Au equivalent to 0.17 ng L-1 and 0.039 ng L-1. While the contents of Au present in solution or as suspensates in lake and stream water are relatively small, they are sufficient, if precipitated, to generate anomalies in lake sediments. Thus for Reservoir Lake, in the Foster Lake area, water from the principal stream entering the lake carries 0. 3 ng L-1 Au. This provides an annual flux which far exceeds that required to generate the 7.3 ppb Au contained in profundal sediments of this lake; a content that is anomalous relative to the regional median content of < 1 ppb Au for lake sediments.
   Hydrogeochemical prospecting involving analysis for Au is one method for tracing the source of anomalous Au in lake sediments. Collection of 1 L samples without field treatment, followed by extraction of Au into MIBK, then analysis by graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry, permits detection levels for Au of 0.5 ng L-1. This is below the contents of Au found in some waters from mineralized areas. A detection limit of 0.3 ng L-1 was obtained using larger water samples.

AB  - Riverine retention decreases loads of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in running water. It is an important process in nutrient cycling in watersheds. However, temporal riverine nutrient retention capacity varies due to changes in hydrological, ecological, and nutrient inputs into the watershed. Quantitative information of seasonal riverine N and P retention is critical for developing strategies to combat diffuse source pollution and eutrophication in riverine and coastal systems. This study examined seasonal variation of riverine total N (TN) and total P (TP) retention in the ChangLe River, an agricultural drainage river in east China.
   Water quality, hydrological parameters, and hydrophyte coverage were monitored along the ChangLe River monthly during 2004-2006. Nutrient export loads (including chemical fertilizer, livestock, and domestic sources) entering the river from the catchment area were computed using an export coefficient model based on estimated nutrient sources. Riverine TN and TP retention loads (RNRL and RPRL) were estimated using mass balance calculations. Temporal variations in riverine nutrient retention were analyzed statistically.
   Estimated annual riverine retention loads ranged from 1,538 to 2,127 t year(-1) for RNRL and from 79.4 to 90.4 t year(-1) for RPRL. Monthly retention loads varied from 6.4 to 300.8 t month(-1) for RNRL and from 1.4 to 15.3 t month(-1) for RPRL. Both RNRL and RPRL increased with river flow, water temperature, hydrophyte coverage, monthly sunshine hours, and total TN and TP inputs. Dissolved oxygen concentration and the pH level of the river water decreased with RNRL and RPRL. Riverine nutrient retention ratios (retention as a percentage of total input) were only related to hydrophyte coverage and monthly sunshine hours. Monthly variations in RNRL and RPRL were functions of TN and TP loads.
   Riverine nutrient retention capacity varied with environmental conditions. Annual RNRL and RPRL accounted for 30.3-48.3% and 52.5-71.2%, respectively, of total input TN and TP loads in the ChangLe River. Monthly riverine retention ratios were 3.5-88.7% for TN and 20.5-92.6% for TP. Hydrophyte growth and coverage on the river bed is the main cause for seasonal variation in riverine nutrient retention capacity. The total input TN and TP loads were the best indicators of RNRL and RPRL, respectively.
   High riverine nutrient retention capacity during summer due to hydrophytic growth is favorable to the avoidance of algal bloom in both river systems and coastal water in southeast China. Policies should be developed to strictly control nutrient applications on agricultural lands. Strategies for promoting hydrophyte growth in rivers are desirable for water quality management.

AB  - The article discusses modern consumption practices from the unity of economic, social and environmental aspects perspective. This unity is a condition for sustainable development, but in modern society economic indicators dominate and ecology is on the second place. Such circumstance is a consequence of the socio-economic system, known as a "consumer society". The article is focused on the identification of environmentally-based consumer behaviour models in modern society. The goal of the research is analysing the prosumerist model of consumption as an alternative to consumerism from an environmental position. The study is based on the concepts of sustainable development and consumer society, and also the idea of prosumerism as a new practice of production and consumption. The work used the method of involved observation, comparative analysis, and descriptive method. The scientific novelty of the results is the justification of prosumerism as an environmentally oriented model of consumer behaviour.
   The consumer society is characterized by mass production, increasing of free time, individual consumption, and a change in employment patterns in favour of the goods and services production. The growth of the individual wants and the expansion of production lead to consumption resources increasing. The consumer model cares about neither resource conservation nor future generations. The environment and natural wealth are considered as a manufacturing resource.
   In response to the negative effects of consumerism the concepts of conscious consumption, ethical and creative consumerism, highlighting the moral and aesthetic foundations of consumption are formed. The author thinks that in these conceptions the consumer has a passive role because he is not involved in the creation of the product. An alternative to uncontrolled consumption may become a prosumerism as a model of behaviour based on active consumer involvement in the production process. The prosumers' activity promotes resource conservation, the use of attainable materials, the creation products"on-demand". Since the producer is both a consumer and prosumer, the product a priori is important to the creator because of uniqueness and sense of personal involvement. As examples of successful prosumersist practices two projects wherein urban communities act as prosumers were sort. The first project concerns the citizens' involvement in solving urban problems and city management. The second one takes place in Norway and relates to attracting consumers to electricity production. The result of this project was the optimization of energy consumption. Both projects demonstrate social and environmental effects.
   The author comes to the conclusion: in order prosumerism will become a stable model of consumer behaviour, personal interest of consumers is necessary based on the possession or access to the means of production. In this case, prosumer activities can have not only economic results, but also social effects: public involvement in solving problems, including environmental ones, communities development, and increased civil responsibility.

AB  - The cyanobacterium Microcystis, which occurs as colonies of different sizes under natural conditions, can produce toxic microcystins (MCs). To monitor the toxicity and assess the risk of Microcystis blooms in Lake Taihu, it is important to investigate the relationship between MC production and Microcystis colony size. In this study, we classified Microcystis collected from Zhushan Bay of Lake Taihu during blooms into four classes with size of <50 mu m, 50-100 mu m, 100-270 mu m and >270 mu m and studied their differences in MC production and genetic structure. The results showed that colonies with size of <50, 50-100, 100-270 and >270 mu m produced 12.2 +/- 11.2%, 19.5 +/- 7.9%, 61.3 +/- 12.6%, and 7.0 +/- 9.6% of total MC, respectively. The proportion of cell density of colonies with size of 50-100, 100-270 and >270 mu m was positively correlated with MC concentration during blooms, while that of colonies with size of <50 mu m was negatively correlated. The MC cell quota tended to be higher during blooms in colonies with larger size except that of colonies with size of 100-270 mu m was higher than that of colonies with size of >270 mu m from June 11 to September 16. Colonies with size of <50 mu m showed the highest proportion of the less toxic MC congener MC-RR, and colonies with size of >100 mu m showed higher proportion of the most toxic MC congener MC-LR than colonies with size of <100 mu m. Real-time PCR indicated that larger colonies had higher proportion of potential toxic genotype. Principal component analysis of PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile showed that cpcBA and mcyJ genotype compositions were different between colonies with size of <50 mu m and colonies with size of >50 mu m, and cpcBA genotype composition was also different among colonies with size of 50-100 mu m, 100-270 mu m and >270 mu m. These results indicated that MC cell quota and congener composition were different in Microcystis colonies with different sizes in Lake Taihu during blooms, and the differences in MC production in colonies with different size resulted chiefly from the difference in their genotype composition. Therefore, the authorities of water quality monitoring and drinking water supply service in Lake Taihu should be alert that the toxicity of Microcystis colony with different size was different during blooms, and the high abundance of colonies larger than 50 mu m could be an indicator of relatively high bloom toxicity.

AB  - The radioactive selenium isotope Se-79 can be a component of radioactive waste produced in nuclear power plants The accidental release of Se-79 in the environment from power plants or nuclear waste repositories and subsequent transfer of Se-79 into soils plants and food chain are relevant concerns in Europe In environmental risk assessment models the ability of plants to take up Se is often characterized by means of soil to-plant transfer factors (IF) However these recommendations take little or no account of the variability in plant Se accumulation among plant species and differences in Se distribution between plant parts Also such factors as soil type form of Se climatic conditions as well as the chemical form in which Se is present in the soil are not taken into consideration
   This paper reviews the current knowledge on Se uptake by plants and compiles published data on the transfer of Se from soils and nutrient solutions into plants The data were categorized according to the form of Se supply i e when added as either selenate or selenite to nutrient solutions or soils or whether plant Se accumulation was studied on soil containing only natural-occurring Se (native Se)
   Plant Se accumulation can vary more than two orders of magnitudes at a given soil Se concentration for a specific form of soil Se (i e native soil Se Se added as selenate or as selenite) among different plant taxa Differences observed in the transfer of Se from soil into plants appear to result primarily from differences in the solubility of Se species in soil and only to a minor degree from differences in plant uptake efficiency among these species
   Values of the TF for Se were found to lie between 0 01 and 100 with few exceptions Transfer factor values derived from studies in which Se was added to soil as selenate or selenite were generally found to be one or more orders of magnitude higher for a given plant species and plant part than TF values derived for native Se Situations where radioactive Se has been accidentally released into the environment may be better represented by TF values for experimentally added Se than by TF values computed for native soil Se
   The uncertainty in selecting a TF value for modeling Se transfer from soil into plants can be substantially reduced by identifying the predominant Se form in the soil the plant species and the target plant parts The large variability in TF values suggests that It is still Important to understand the complexity of the soil-plant system when selecting TF values to assess risks arising from the transfer of accidentally released Se-79 from soil into plants Published by Elsevier B V

AB  - Crop management has the potential to either enhance or degrade soil quality, which in turn impacts on crop production and the environment. Few studies have investigated how crop management affects soil quality over different landscape positions. The objective of the present study was to investigate how 12 years of annual cropping system (ACS) and conservation reserve program (CRP) practices impacted soil quality indicators at summit, backslope and footslope landscape positions of a claypan soil in north-central Missouri. Claypan soils are particularly poorly drained because of a restrictive high-clay subsoil layer and are vulnerable to high water erosion. Three replicates of four management systems were established in 1991 in a randomized complete block design, with landscape position as a split-block treatment. The management systems were investigated: (1) annual cropping system 1 (ACS1) was a mulch tillage (typically >= 30% of soil covered with residue after tillage operations) corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation system, (2) annual cropping system 2 (ACS2) was a no-till corn-soybean rotation system, (3) annual cropping system 3 (ACS3) was a no-till corn-soybean-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation system, with a cover crop following wheat, (4) CRP was a continuous cool-season grass and legume system. In 2002, soil cores (at depths of 0-7.5, 7.5-15 and 15-30 cm) were collected by landscape position and analyzed for physical, chemical and biological soil quality properties. No interactions were observed between landscape and crop management. Relative to management effects, soil organic carbon (SOC) significantly increased with 12 years of CRP management, but not with the other management systems. At the 0-7.5-cm soil depth in the CRP system, SOC increased over this period by 33% and soil total nitrogen storage increased by 34%. Soil aggregate stability was approximately 40% higher in the no-till management systems (ACS2 and ACS3) than in the tilled system (ACS1). Soil aggregation under CRP management was more than double that of the three grain-cropping systems. Soil bulk density at the shallow sampling depth was greater in ACS3 than in ACS1 and ACS2. In contrast to studies on other soil types, these results indicate only minor changes to claypan soil quality after 12 years of no-till management. The landscape had minor effects on the soil properties. Of note, SOC was significantly lower in the 7.5-15-cm soil depth at the footslope compared with the other landscape positions. We attribute this to wetter and more humid conditions at this position and extended periods of high microbial activity and SOC mineralization. We conclude that claypan soils degraded by historical cropping practices will benefit most from the adoption of CRP or CRP-like management.

AB  - Skeletal deformities are well described in cultured fish. This can be induced by a variety of factors including unfavorable biotic/abiotic conditions. However, in the natural environment their frequency is relatively low. The strong correlation of fish skeletal deformities with pollution and other environmental disturbances underlines the importance of their study and their use as an indicator of pollution. This study attempt to diagnose skeletal deformities associated with Gobiidae collected from Bizerta lagoon, which are exposed to several types of pollutants. Our study relates to the three most abundant species of gobies in the Bizerta lagoon, which are Gobius niger (Linnaeus, 1758), G. paganellus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Zosterisessor ophiocephalus (Pallas, 1811). Fish were collected from January to June 2005, with a small trawl. The prospected depths ranged from 0.5 to 4 m. 1,342 gobies were captured. Among them, 887 belonged to G. niger, 141 to G. paganellus and 314 to Z. ophiocephalus. Individual body weight, standard length and total length were measured. Samples were X-ray radiographed in order to identify possible skeletal anomalies. In order to know the degree of deformity, the depth of the curve (PC), which corresponds to the distance between the tangent with the apical vertebra and the line, which passes at the basis of the two vertebrae that limits the curve, was measured. Then, we calculated the ratio (PC/LS) x 100, which represents the curve degree. Five types of vertebral anomalies were observed: abdominal kyphosis, caudal kyphosis, lordosis, scoliosis and vertebral column compression. The incidence of these deformations ranged from 21.3% to 37.5%, which are considered as high values comparatively to those obtained in recent works carried out on the gobies from Tagus and Sado estuaries in Portugal and from Karin Sea in the eastern Adriatic. Our study revealed that the percentage, the degree and the types of deformities were strongly related to species. Indeed, the percentages of deformed individuals did not show significant differences between Z ophiocephalus (25.2%) and G. niger (21.3 %) (p > 0.05). On the other hand, G. paganellus showed significantly higher values for both deformity incidences (37.6 %) and deformity degree than those of Z. ophiocephalus and G. niger. Moreover, in Z. ophiocephalus and G. niger a compression of vertebrae was observed especially in the caudal region. This was absent from G. paganellus individuals. Concerning the difference related to sex, in G. paganellus the percentage of deformed females is significantly higher than that of males (p < 0.05). In Z ophiocephalus and G. niger the rate of deformation was not sex-related. These results showed that the three gobiid species seem to react differentially to the environmental stress, which could be one of the causes implied in the incidence of this type of anomaly.

AB  - Since the first North Sea Conference (1984, Bremen), all countries bordering the North Sea made commitments to reduce discharge of hazardous substances into the North Sea. From Belgium and The Netherlands, large reductions (upto 90%) in heavy metal emissions from land-based sources have been reported between 1985 and 2000. Recently, some studies in the Western Scheldt estuary (WS) have shown that total metal concentration in the water, sediments and suspended particles have decreased compared to levels in the 70s. However, data on aquatic organisms is still very limited and it is therefore difficult to confirm whether the reductions in pollution input and generally improving water quality in the WS have a corresponding impact on the levels of heavy metals in aquatic organisms. The current study measured metal concentrations in the soft tissues of mussels, Mytilus edulis (known to be good indicators of environmental metal pollution) during the period 1996-2002. Spatial (salinity and pollution gradients), temporal and seasonal variations were also studied. Results showed a down-stream decreasing trend for the metals studied (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) during all sampling campaigns. There was also a significant seasonal effect on tissue metal concentrations, with a peak observed around spring in both WS and the nearby less polluted Eastern Scheldt (ES). On temporal trends, a clear drop of metals in mussels was observed in the early 80s coinciding with the start of the efforts to reduce chemical pollution input into the North Sea. Since those early reductions, metal concentrations in mussels generally remained unchanged upto mid 90s. However, in recent times metal concentration in mussels have increased significantly, for example Cd in 2002 was almost 10 times the values in 1983 and similar to levels seen during the peak in the 70s. Other metals also increased in the 90s also reaching levels seen in the 70s. As there is no indication of recent increase in metal input into the estuary, we suggest that increased metal concentrations observed in mussels in recent years especially in the upper estuary are most likely a result of changes in physical and chemical speciation and metal bioavailability. Such changes may be caused by changes in some water quality parameters in the estuary (i.e. increased dissolved oxygen, concentration of organic matter), resulting in conditions that favour releases of sediment-bound metals into the water column. The relationship between metal content and season showed very similar annual profiles in the polluted WS and less polluted ES. Thus, seasonal variations in metal concentrations appear to be largely controlled by biological processes, while total body burdens are dependent on environmental levels and bioavailability.

AB  - The scale of human induced land degradation is very high in northern Ethiopia. However, there are only a few studies of land degradation in Ethiopia which provide an integrated assessment of the driving forces and consequences. A pilot study was made in Adwa district (Tigray) with the objective of evaluating the factors related to environmental degradation,and assessing the effects of agricultural activities on the natural resources. Environmental data, a digital terrain model, vegetation, geomorphological, and erosion maps of the study area were integrated with socio-economic variables using a geographical information system (GIS). The classification of the data used in the integration, and the information extracted using the GIS gave three main groups of Tabias and four main groups of variables. The relationship among the Tabias (smallest administrative units), groups of Tabias and environmental variables were quantified using various statistical, multivariate numerical methods and fuzzy set analysis. The application of fuzzy set theory showed that each group of Tabia, recognized as a rural subsystem (RS) was associated with a group of variables. Analysis of variance showed that the three RSs were significantly different in most of the environmental variables considered. Human and livestock population densities, geomorphology, altitude and some natural and anthropogenic vegetation types were highly discriminatory. Percentage cover of evergreen scrub, bushlands and severe badlands are considered key indicators of the scale of environmental degradation. Results of the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) indicated that human pressure had more impact on the physiognomy of the vegetation than on its floristic composition. The Evergreen scrub vegetation type appeared to be expanding with increasing human influence signifying a decrease in biomass of vegetation as a result of collecting wood for fuel and other domestic uses. Bushland appeared to be expanding with the same trend. Woodland, which was abundant in one of the RSs, is considered to be the natural physiognomic vegetation type in the area and efforts to maintain it and/or recover it elsewhere in the study area are recommended. Food production in the area did not match population growth. The expected crop yield under good soil and rainfall conditions was low by any standard. The per capita energy obtained from the grain harvested in the farm plots ranged from 428 to 4347 cal per person per day (the average is far below the basic minimum required for mere subsistence) suggesting that there is a need for substantial supplementary income from off-farm activities and/or other sources. This study indicated that regional and site specific approaches and interaction with the people at all stages of the research, program development and implementation are required for sustainable rehabilitation.

AB  - An ecological risk assessment is described for determining the adaptation potential of the approximately 11000 Swiss Forest Inventory points (FIP) to a hypothetically changing climate. The core of the study is a spatially explicit forest community model that generates estimates of the potential natural vegetation for the entire potential forest area of Switzerland under today's as well as under altered climate regimes, The model is based on the Bayes formula. The probabilities of the communities occurring along ecological gradients are derived from empirical data featuring the relationships between quasi-natural vegetation types and measured site variables, Bioclimatological input variables are the quotient between July temperature and annual precipitation (model version A) or mean annual temperature (model version B). Other site variables include aspect, acidity of top soil and, to account for continentality, geographical region. Climate change scenarios are defined as follows: 'Moderate climate change' implies an increase of the mean annual temperature of 1 degrees C to 1.4 degrees C depending on the region (model version B) or an increase of the July temperature of 1.5 degrees C (model version A). 'Strong climate change' implies an increase of the mean annual temperature of 2 degrees C to 2.8 degrees C (model version B) or an increase of the July temperature of 3.0 degrees C (model version A).
   The simulation experiment showed that the geographical distribution of 15 potential natural forest types (distinguished on the basis of floristic affinities) varies considerably with changing temperature. Under moderate warming 30-55% of the FIP change their potential natural vegetation type, whereas under strong climate change the values increase to 55-89% depending on the model version used. in the ecological risk assessment the existing tree species composition on any FIP was compared with the expected tree species composition under today's as well as under altered climate regimes. A major finding indicated that, under the current climate conditions, approximately 25-30% (depending on the model version used) of all FIP must be considered as poorly adapted, i.e. less than 20% of the actual basal area consists of tree species that are expected as dominating taxa. This definition applies for trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than or equal to 12 cm. Moderate warming increases the percentage of poorly adapted FIP by 5-10% (relative to all FIP considered), strong warming leads to a 10-30% increase of poorly adapted FIP (relative to all FIP considered). If trees with a DBH < 12cm are considered, the percentage of FIP that have to be classified as poorly adapted is reduced significantly. There are strong regional differences as exhibited in risk maps of 10 km X 10 km resolution.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematode infections of cattle remain a constraint on the efficient raising of cattle on pasture throughout the world. Most of the common genera of parasites found in cattle stimulate an effective level of protective immunity in most animals within the herd after the animals have been on pasture for several months. In contrast, cattle remain susceptible to infection by Ostertagia for many months, and immunity that actually reduces the development of newly acquired larvae is usually not evident until the animals are more than 2 years old. This prolonged susceptibility to reinfection is a major reason that this parasite remains the most economically important GI nematode in temperate regions of the world. Although, animals remain susceptible to reinfection for a prolonged period of time, there are a number of manifestations of the immune response that result in an enhanced level of herd immunity. These include a delay in the development time of the parasites, an increase in the number of larvae that undergo an inhibition in development, morphological changes in the worms, stunting of newly acquired worms, and most importantly a reduction in the number of eggs produced by the female worms. The overall result of these manifestations of immunity is a reduction in parasite transmission within the cattle herd.
   The immune mechanisms responsible for these different types of functional immunity remain to be defined. In general, CI nematode infections in mammals elicit very strong Th2-like responses characterized by high levels of Interleukin 4 (IL4), high levels of IgG1 and IgE antibodies, and large numbers of mast cells. In cattle, the most extensively studied GI nematode, in regards to host immune responses, is Ostertagia ostertagi. In Ostertagia infections, antigens are presented to the host in the draining lymph nodes very soon after infection, and within the first 3-4 days of infection these cells have left the nodes, entered the peripheral circulation, and have homed to tissues immediately surrounding the parasite where they become established. The immune response seen in the abomasum is in many ways are similar to that seen other mammalian hosts, with high levels of expression of IL4 in the draining lymph nodes and in lymphocytes isolated from the mucosa. But unlike a number of other systems, lymphocyte populations taken from Ostertagia infected cattle seem to be up-regulated for a number of other cytokines, most notably Interferon-(IFN-(), implying that in Ostertagia infections, the immune response elicit is not simply a stereotypic Th2 response. In addition, effector cell populations in the tissues surrounding the parasites, are not typical, inferring the Ostertagia has evolved means to suppress or evade protective immune mechanisms.
   Studies have also demonstrated that the number of nematode eggs/gram (EPG) in feces of pastured cattle is strongly influenced by host genetics and that the heritability of this trait is approxiamately 0.30. In addition, EPG values are not < < normally > > distributed and a small percentage of a herd is responsible for the majority of parasite transmission. This suggests that genetic management of a small percentage of the herd can considerably reduce overall parasite transmission. A selective breeding program has been initiated to identify the host genes controlling resistance/susceptibility to the parasites. The best indicator of the number of Cooperia infecting a host is the EPG value, while Ostertagia is best measured by serum pepsinogen levels, weight gain, and measures of anemia. Other phenotypic measures are either not significantly associated with parasite numbers or are very weakly correlated.
   In addition, calves can be separated into three types: (1) Type I which never demonstrates high EPG values. (2) Type II which shows rises in EPC values through the first 2 months on pasture which then fall and remain at levels associated with Type I calves, and (3) Type III calves which maintain high EPG levels. The approximate percentage of these calves is 25:50:25 respectively. Because these cattle are segregating for traits involved in resistance and susceptibility to GI nematodes, this resource population is being used to effectively detect the genomic locations of these Economic Trait Loci (ETL). For relational analysis between phenotype and genome location, over 80,000 genotypes have been generated by PCR amplification, and marker genotypes have been scored to produce inheritance data. The marker allele inheritance data is currently being statistically analyzed to detect patterns of co-segregation between allele haplotype and EPG phenotypes. Statistical power of this genome-wide scan has been strengthened by including genotypic data from the historic pedigree. In our herd, paternal half-sib families range from 5-13 progeny/sire, and extensive marker genotypes are available from ancestors of the population most of which are paternally descended from a single founding sire.
   Once ETL have been identified the next will be to refine ETL map resolution in attempt to discover the genes underlying disease phenotypes. Accurate identification of genes controlling resistance will offer the producer several alternatives for disease control. For a non-organic producer, the small percentage of susceptible animals can be targeted for drug administration. This approach would reduce both the cost of anthelmintics used and the odds for selection of drug resistant mutants, because the selective agent (drug) would not be applied over the entire parasite population. A second treatment option would be based on correcting a heritable immunologic condition. In this case, susceptible animals could be the targets for immunotherapy involving vaccines of immunomodulation. A final option would be genetic selection to remove susceptible animals from the herd. Producers with a high degree of risk for parasite-induced production losses, such as organic producers of producers in geographic areas with environmental conditions favorable to high rates of transmission would benefit the most from this strategy. In contrast, producers at low risk could take a more conservative approach and select against susceptibility when other factors were equal. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The oxytocin system plays a role in stress responses and behavior modulation. However, the effects of oxytocin signaling on stress adaptation remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated the roles of oxytocin signaling as a biomarker under stress conditions in the peripheral tissues (the gills) and central nervous system (the brain). All the environmental stressors downregulated the expression of oxytocin receptors in the gills, and the alteration of the expression of oxytocin receptors was also found in the brain after the acidic (AC) and high-ammonia (HA) treatments. The number of oxytocin neurons was increased after double-deionized (DI) treatment. By transgenic line, Tg(oxtl:EGFP), we also investigated the projections of oxytocin neurons and found oxytocin axon innervations in various nuclei that might regulate the anxiety levels and aggressiveness of adult zebrafish under different environmental stresses. The oxytocin system integrates physiological responses and behavioral outcomes to ensure environmental adaptation in adult zebrafish. Our study provides insight into oxytocin signaling as a stress indicator upon environmental stressors.

AB  - Multi-element analyses determine the content of 17 trace elements (Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Cd, Cs, Ba, Pb, U) and 14 rare earth elements (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Yb, Lu, Y) in whey samples from cow and goat milk by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma-sector field mass spectrometry. A total of 261 milk whey samples were collected from four locations in the Veneto region of northeastern (NE) Italy. These samples contain a wide range concentration of 17 trace elements (0.06-1530 mu g kg(-1)) and 14 rare earth elements (0.16-28.2 mu g kg(-1)) in whey samples, but do not reach toxic concentrations. Elemental fingerprinting of trace and rare earth elements in cow and goat milk whey provide information on the dairy quality and, as they reflect the local environmental conditions, result in an excellent indicator of their geographical origin.

AB  - The AHP method(Analytic Hierarchy Process), as a part of the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) process, is one of the most used methods worldwide for dealing with the complexity of transport project evaluation. A level crossing (LC) is a place where road and rail cross. Therefore, LC is a place where there is a high risk of accidents. The aim of this study is to develop an AHP model for evaluating the alternatives for the reconstruction of LC in a congested urban environment through the weighting of various interdisciplinary criteria and sub-criteria. The AHP model considers six criteria:safety, traffic indicators of the functional efficiency, costs, social benefits, ecology, the time required for reconstruction of LC and their 15 sub-criteria. The model has been tested on LC Sokolska, located in the city of Zagreb, Croatia. Three possible alternatives were proposed to suit the location and the traffic conditions. The alternatives were evaluated according to the developed AHP model and the Expert Choice software package. Asensitivity analysis was performed to confirm the acceptability of the optimal solution.

AB  - In the last years, JIP-test became to be a tool widely applied to assess the performance of photosynthetic apparatus of plants growing under environmental stresses. The objective of our work was to check whether JIP-test can help to predict winter survival in plants. An experiment with outdoor vertical garden was conducted in June 2015 on a south-oriented wall in Lublin city, Poland. Plants were cultivated in pockets made of polyester felt and irrigated by automatic controlled system. After winter period (2015/2016) only 16 species and cultivars from 23 initially planted taxa substantiated successful survival. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were performed twice in 2015 and six times in 2016. Survival rate of examined species did not show any significant correlation with performance indices of PSII (PIABS and PItotal) and parameters related to quantum yields. On the other hand, changes of some parameters related to specific energy fluxes per active reaction centres were found to be connected, to some extent, to plants winter survival. These changes could play a key role in plants ability to survive winter conditions.

AB  - Cover crops are used in Mediterranean agrosystems to reduce soil degradation and restore soil function. We carried out an experiment to test the effects of two cover crops (Brachypodium distachyon and Trifolium subterraneum, mulched or incorporated) and two bare soil controls (fertilised and unfertilised) on soil properties, biodiversity, and soil natural suppressiveness against Pratylenchus neglectus in pot microcosms. Cover crop performance, weed infestation, litter decomposition rates, soil properties, and the response of soil biota (nematode indicators, mesofauna feeding activity, enzymatic activity, and mycorrhizal spores) were measured. A shortterm suppressiveness experiment was performed to determine P. neglectus colonisation of wheat roots after each treatment. Trifolium subterraneum incorporation significantly enhanced the fungal-mediated decomposition channel and decomposition rates, but enzymatic activities and mycorrhizal spore abundances did not respond to the experimental treatments. Cover crops were effective at controlling weeds, but did not increase soil suppressiveness against P. neglectus. Brachypodium distachyon cover cropping increased root infection.

AB  - The potential for using benthic algae to identify areas around the lake littoral that are potentially influenced by diffuse inputs of nutrients is considered through research based around Ennerdale Water in NW England. This is an oligotrophic lake with a highly sensitive population of Margalifera margalifera in the outflow river. Water chemistry, algal biomass, diatoms and macroalgae were studied at six points around the perimeter of the lake. Evidence of higher concentrations of dissolved nutrients along with alterations in the diatom and, to a lesser extent, macroalgae assemblages was found in the north-west corner of the lake. Algal biomass gave a more ambiguous signal, with local variations in biomass masked by stronger seasonal signals that determined the quantity of algae present at a site on any given date. These results demonstrate the potential for using benthic algae to generate more focussed data on the condition of a lake than is possible with the whole-lake assessments on which classifications are based.

AB  - The present paper contributes to assessing the resilience of a complex barrier island environment, namely of the Ria Formosa multi-inlet system in southern Portugal. The long-term morphologic evolution of four study areas during the last 60 years (1947 to 2014) is analysed based on aerial photographs, including the environments of oceanic and backbarrier beaches, dunes and salt marshes. The results show that each study area responded to external drivers (inlet stabilisation works, storms, etc.) differently, evolving in distinct patterns during the study period. All four study areas appear resilient to external pressures and/or forcing conditions, since they are either transforming (Barreta and Culatra islands), or adapting (Cabanas island and Cacela peninsula) or remaining stable at a near-equilibrium state (Tavira island). Based on the analysis of the multi-decadal evolution of the sites, four resilient barrier states are identified, related to the maturity and growth of the barrier. In the next stages, the research will focus on the relation between medium to short-term changes, aiming at understanding the response and feedbacks of the environments to specific drivers of change and relating them to resilience indicators.

AB  - The given research presents the classification of fire extinguishing and explosion suppression compositions. The effect on the combustion reaction is possible with the help of physical and chemical methods of gas mixture components concentration reducing, cooling the combustion zone and slowing down of chain reactions with the help of a phlegmatizing or inhibiting substances, of which the most universal and perspective are powder materials. In view of the high toxicity and environmental hazard of inhibitors (halides), the most promising search and development of effective powder compositions based on chlorides and substances with pronounced endothermic properties (easy-boiling, easy-decomposing, easy-melting) causing a sharp cooling of the combustion zone. The general laws of the effectiveness of extinguishing powders from their composition was considered in the scope of literature. There are proposed only some unsystematic series of dependence of the studied mineral compounds. Therefore, a necessary condition for solving the problems of developing effective flame arresters is to find common indicators and properties of substances that can become criteria for their phlegmatizing ability.

AB  - This work aims to identify wetland water sources for environmental flow assessment of three wetlands located in the area of Miguel Ibanez (Segovia, Spain), known as Fuente Santa, Balsa de la Ermita and San Pedro ponds. These are remnants of wetland systems that were larger in the past. The methodology used involved four seasonal field campaigns conducted in 2012 at eight main and three additional surface water or groundwater sampling points. The interpretation of the physico-chemical and isotopic data obtained, and daily monitoring of changes in the water level of the Fuente Santa pond over 5 months provided an initial understanding of the environmental flows needed to sustain these wetlands in appropriate conditions. The arsenic values provided an additional auxiliary tool, although a single dominant cause of its presence in these three ponds could not be identified. The results show that the interactions between the wetlands and groundwater are hydrogeologically different despite their proximity to one another. These findings will enable the improved management and conservation of these wetlands.

AB  - The import risks confronting oil consumers are influenced by transport conditions, oil prices, geopolitics, etc. This paper constructs an evaluation framework for oil import security from a perspective of supply chain process, and builds a two-phase DEA-like model to evaluate oil import security. China is taken as an example to measure its oil import security during 1993-2011 and to identify the main risk factors in different periods. Results indicate that China's oil import risks have kept rising since 1993 and face multiple potential threats from each stage of oil import supply chain, among which the threat from external dependence has become the biggest challenge. Under different economic situations and changing energy environment, the risk factors affecting China's oil import security switched among different stages of the supply chain, showing a phase-transitioning characteristic from import over-dependence to increasing external supply pressure. The threat of external supply has become a new risk since the pressure of decreasing availability of external resource rose. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article critically assesses the inferences of the role institutionalization in the representations and self-perception of women executives in Romania, as a first phase in reconstructing social reality. The target of the research is to surprise the manner they interpret the factors and constraints which influence a successful career. We shall reach this target by analyzing the research based on the method of sociological investigation on a national quota sampling on women executives in the public and private field in the context of discrimination and the gender role in these two scopes, the stress resulted in the dynamics occupational environment - family environment. More particular, we shall analyze the factors which prevent and those which enable the careers of women executives, and afterwards we shall compare their interpretations with those in the specialty literature. The results show that women executives in Romania base upon the help of their family and endeavour in order to keep in balance the family life and values with those of the career, under the conditions of a traditional functional model, which capitalizes family as central indicator of life success.

AB  - Ballast water contains organisms which can survive the ship's journey and become established in the recipient water body when discharged. Phytoplankton species can become invasive and might be harmful by producing toxins or anoxic conditions following their blooms. Different technologies exist to treat ballast water in order to reduce the spread of invasive species. The effectiveness of a UV-based ballast water treatment system was tested in an incubation experiment over 20 days. After an initial decline in cell numbers, re-growth could be observed of certain phytoplankton taxa, namely the diatoms Thalassiosira, Skeletonema, Chaetoceros, Pseudo-nitzschia, and Nitzschia (order represents rank of abundance). The conclusion of this study is that a variety of taxa are able to survive UV-treatment. These may include harmful and potential invasive phytoplankton species. Long-term incubation experiments should be considered when testing the effectiveness of UV-based treatment systems. The dominant re-growing phytoplankton group was Thalassiosira which could be a suitable indicator organism for testing the efficiency of UV-units.

AB  - The rare and endangered plant Primulina tabacum is a calciphilous perennial herb found only at the entrances of a small number of karst cave drainages in southern China. In a conservation effort, we identified potentially suitable habitats and reintroduced P. tabacum plantlets (propagated in vitro) to one historical and two new cave entrances. The transplanted seedlings survived (10%) at only one new location where a moss, Gymnostomiella longinervis Broth, existed. Our field observations indicate that it is probably impossible for this rare plant to naturally recolonize the places where it went extinct because the habitats have changed. Transplanted P. tabacum grew slower than wild P. tabacum. The transplanted P. tabacum performed especially well under the cover of the nursing moss. Positive interactions between species, i.e., nurse plant effects, are important for reintroduction of success. Although light and soil conditions also appeared to be critical for transplantation success, the presence of moss should be considered as a useful and convenient indicator of suitable habitat for P. tabacum. This study case suggests that the use of new propagation methods and nurse plants can facilitate the reintroduction of rare and endangered herbs.

AB  - The paper considers the role of modality in the rational reconstruction of standpoints and arguments. The paper examines in what conditions modal markers can act as argumentative indicators and what kind of cues they provide for the reconstruction of argument. The paper critically re-examines Toulmin's hypothesis that the meaning of the modals can be analyzed in terms of a field-invariant argumentative force and field-dependent criteria in the light of the Theory of Relative Modality developed within linguistic semantics, showing how this theory can provide a more adequate model for exploiting the modals as indicators. The resulting picture confirms Toulmin's intuition only in part: on the one hand the modals are always relational in nature and dependent on a contextual conversational background of propositions; on the other hand only epistemic-doxastic modals directly express a speech-act level inferential relation between a set of premises and a standpoint. Other modalities express relations (e. g. causal or final relations) better seen as part of the content of the argument whose argumentative relevance depends on the argumentation scheme employed. Thus non-epistemic modals function as argumentative indicators only indirectly.

AB  - The level of the acid DNase activity in the hemocytes and digestive gland of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis after exposure to model marine pollutants, a detergent, gasoline and a copper salt, as well as to unknown environmental mixture at selected sampling sites, was investigated. The specific enzyme activity in unexposed mussels from mariculture area was higher in hemocytes than in digestive gland. Concentration and time effect patterns of DNase activity revealed tissue- and pollutant-specific responses to model marine pollutants. Since in some cases the pollutant effect could not be detected by measurement of acid DNase in single tissue only, digestive gland/hemocyte (Hep[Hem) ratio was introduced. The Hep/Hem ratio enabled the detection of pollutant effect at the significance level. Field investigations indicated that the digestive gland is a suitable tissue for discrimination of polluted areas from maricultured area. Additionally, the Hep/Hem ratio enabled differentiation within a group of polluted sampling sites that differ in the type of pollutants and/or environmental conditions. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Annual concentrations of SO2 and PM have decreased in Krakow since early 1970s by 70-80%. At present, both pollutants still show the same seasonal pattern as in the 1970s, with maximum in winter and minimum in summer. PM10 is the most abundant air pollutant reaching permanently the levels far behind the allowed values. Since 2001, an increasing concentration trend has been observed, while the concentrations of SO2 usually stay below the allowed limits. The concentrations of NO2 and O-3 have been measured since 1992. The allowed values of NO2 are exceeded only in the high-traffic site (about 10 times per year) while the levels of O-3 are usually within the allowed limits. Studies concerning plant and animal contamination with heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Fe, Zn, Cu) show that cadmium is at present the main danger. In spite of a significant improvement of aerosanitary conditions in Krakow after 1990, negative long-term effects of air pollution on human health can be still observed, especially in children.

TI  - Empowerment of women: A theoretical overview
T2  - MAN IN INDIA
LA  - English
AB  - The very notion of women empowerment is the outcome of the recent past period and it has been assumed by all concerned that this sort of thinking pattern has got a solid basis on which the various endeavours for development strategies of the human society in its totalistic background would flourish in their fullest contents. Women empowerment procedures, if conducted properly, would do a great deal in abolishing the gender discrimination-the root-cause of various misunderstandings. The paper tries to throw discernible light on the nature and extent of the women empowerment in its diversified facets. Various indicators of women empowerment have been categorically discussed here along with its three basic dimensions. The author by way of thorough discussions on this issue, has explored the diversified patterns of male domination and has also shown how these have made complicated contraints in the life of the womenfolk. The concrete examples of the ill-fated conditions of the womenfolk drawn from the different social settings support his views. He advocates for gradual increase of women's access to the social and institutional processes along with other related extents to let them free from all sorts of artificial limitations for the cause of the human society as a whole.

AB  - We hypothesise that differences in people's attitudes and personality traits lead them to attribute varying importance to environmental considerations, safety, comfort, convenience and flexibility. Differences in personality traits call be revealed not only in the individuals' choice of transport, but also in other actions of their everyday lives-such as how much they recycle, whether they take precautions or avoid dangerous pursuits. Conditioning on a set of exogenous individual characteristics, we use indicators of attitudes and personality traits to form latent variables for inclusion in an, otherwise standard, discrete mode choice model. With a sample of Swedish commuters, we find that both attitudes towards flexibility and comfort, as well as being pro-environmentally inclined, influence the individual's choice of mode. Although modal time and cost still are important, it follows that there are other ways, apart from economic incentives, to attract individuals to the, from society's perspective, desirable public modes of transport. Our results should provide useful information to policy-makers and transportation planners developing sustainable transportation systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ostracod assemblages have been studied in the sedimentary units of the lower Liassic of Quercy (SW France), at the Carixian-Domerian boundary (Pliensbachian). Ogmoconchella transversa was found to decrease in frequency towards the base of the Domerian while at the same time the O. pseudospina population increased. It is also noteworthy that the occurrence of small-sized species coincides with dominance of species of the Ogmoconcha amalthei group. This large-sized species makes up half or more of the ostracod assemblages in the periods of environmental disturbance indicated by sequence stratigraphy. The biocoenotic indices (number of taxa, faunal turnover and equitability) seem to confirm environmental disturbance at these levels. Correspondence analysis (CA) distinguishes such samples from those in which Ogmoconchella and Polycope species are more common. The appearance or development in the Domerian of species that were rare or absent throughout the Carixian indicates a change of environmental conditions. The opportunism of species of the Ogmoconcha amalthei group can be used to determine periods of disturbance in sedimentary units. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to determine if the physical and chemical criterias of organic matter are in phase with the evolutive state expressed both by the soil morphology and by the present vegetation, forms of organic matter are identified and then quantified in the humus of 2 different series of alluvial soils (Fluviosols). One series is situated on mainly calcareous alluvia and the other on alluvia principally constituted of orthogneiss (figs I and 2; table I). A first fractionation, using the method of water sieving, is undertaken to separate and to estimate the particulate plant material from the best humified plant material. The latter is then selectively chemically extracted (fig 3; table III). Results show that the amount (stock in carbon and nitrogen) of organic matter is a better indicator (table II) than its quality, which virtually does not change in a calcareous environment and only slowly in acid conditions (tables IV and V). As compared with the vegetation dynamic, the slow humus evolution in these soils seems to reveal in less than 100 years a shift in the soil-vegetation relationship.

AB  - Stable isotope ratios of pedogenic carbonate and organic matter were measured in a prairie-transition-forest soil biosequence near Ames, Iowa to determine the vegetation succession. The modern vegetation is dominated by non-native C3 plants which have been introduced by agricultural practices. The delta-C-13 values of soil organic matter from the prairie and forest endmembers indicate C4 and C3 dominated ecosystems, respectively, during the accumulation of soil organic matter. Pedogenic carbonate from all soils, including rare pedogenic carbonate from the forested soil, has an average delta-C-12 of -2.0 parts-per-thousand, indicating that the carbonate formed under a C4 vegetation. These results indicate that the ecosystem was a C4-dominated prairie and therefore suggest a recent arrival of forests and other C3 plants in the area. This study also implies that the primary features of the transitional Lester soil series, which has soil properties intermediate between Alfisols and Molisolls, formed under prairie conditions and were overprinted by an invading forest.

AB  - Developing and refining fire proxies is paramount for reliable reconstructions and the inferences that they gain about fire in the Earth System. Burned phytolith index is an important tool for fire reconstruction. However, the source of the darkened color which appears on burned phytoliths is controversial and requires additional study to understand the relationship between phytolith characteristics and fire activity. By simulating burning of six grass species under open conditions, we extracted phytoliths from the ashes using a microwave digestion method. Then, we measured the carbon content of the ashed phytolith and the unburned phytolith (from modern plant). Next, we measured the carbon content of burned phytolith when treated with bleach. Our results show that the carbon contents of ashed phytoliths are higher than phytoliths extracted from plants, and ashed phytoliths after bleaching. The increased carbon content probably resulted from adsorption of black carbon by phytoliths exposed to open flames. We conclude that phytolith- related carbon might be a potential indicator of paleofire using soils and sediments.

AB  - The dried root ofAstragalus membranaceusis a well-known herbal medicine, and it is useful in treating chronic diseases and weakness, as well as for improving overall health and vitality. Astragalosides, which are root quality indicators ofA. membranaceus, are natural triterpenoid saponins that are used in the treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Currently, there is an urgent need to improve their production because of their low quantity in plants and the difficulty of chemical synthesis. In this study, yeast extract was added to facilitate elicitation inAgrobacterium-mediated hairy root cultures, thereby enhancing astragaloside production inA. membranaceus. Results showed that yeast extract could stimulate astragaloside content effectively in the hairy roots ofA. membranaceus. Moreover, astragaloside accumulation was positively correlated with the upregulation of mevalonate biosynthetic gene expression in the presence of yeast extract. Our study demonstrated that pretreatment with yeast extract (3.65 mM) for 72 h serves as an effective strategy to enhance astragaloside levels inA. membranaceushairy root cultures. Thus, these optimal conditions can provide valuable information for the improvement of astragaloside industrial production inA. membranaceus.

AB  - To enhance flexibility and sustainability, human-robot collaboration is becoming a major feature of next-generation robots. The safety assessment strategy is the first and crucial issue that needs to be considered due to the removal of the safety barrier. This paper determined the set of safety indicators and established an assessment model based on the latest safety-related ISO standards and manufacturing conditions. A dynamic modified SSM (speed and separation monitoring) method is presented for ensuring the safety of human-robot collaboration while maintaining productivity as high as possible. A prototype system including dynamic risk assessment and safe motion control is developed based on the virtual model of the robot and human skeleton point data from the vision sensor. The real-time risk status of the working robot can be known and the risk field around the robot which is visualized in an augmented reality environment so as to ensure safe human-robot collaboration. This system is experimentally validated on a human-robot collaboration cell using an industrial robot with six degrees of freedom.

AB  - Triticonazole and prothioconazole are widely used systemic agricultural triazole fungicides both with a chiral center. In this work, the enantioselective degradation of triticonazole and prothioconazole in three types of soils were investigated under native conditions using reversed phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with a Chiralcel OD-RH column. The results indicated that the enantioselective degradation was observed with S-triticonazole and R-prothioconazole preferentially degraded and the degradation rate was fast with a half-life within 6 days. It was also found that the presence of earthworms can accelerate the degradation and further enhance degradation enantioselectivity of triticonazole and prothioconazole in soils. Moreover, the enantioselective of triticonazole and prothioconazole in earthworms were studied. The results showed that the bioaccumulation was enantioselective with R-triticonazole and S-prothioconazole preferentially accumulated, which was similar to the soil. Our findings suggest that the enantioselective toxicity and potential effects of the metabolites should be considered for more accurate assessment of ecological risks of triticonazole and prothioconazole to target and non-target species.

AB  - Leaf traits are frequently measured in ecology to provide a 'common currency' for predicting how anthropogenic pressures impact ecosystem function. Here, we test whether leaf traits consistently respond to experimental treatments across 27 globally distributed grassland sites across 4 continents. We find that specific leaf area (leaf area per unit mass)-a commonly measured morphological trait inferring shifts between plant growth strategies-did not respond to up to four years of soil nutrient additions. Leaf nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations increased in response to the addition of each respective soil nutrient. We found few significant changes in leaf traits when vertebrate herbivores were excluded in the short-term. Leaf nitrogen and potassium concentrations were positively correlated with species turnover, suggesting that interspecific trait variation was a significant predictor of leaf nitrogen and potassium, but not of leaf phosphorus concentration. Climatic conditions and pretreatment soil nutrient levels also accounted for significant amounts of variation in the leaf traits measured. Overall, we find that leaf morphological traits, such as specific leaf area, are not appropriate indicators of plant response to anthropogenic perturbations in grasslands.

AB  - Bees have the potential to be used as indicators of environmental quality. The parameters typically analyzed in this context include species diversity, colony condition and foraging behavior. Bees explore the area around their nests, whose size and location vary based on the flight ranges and nesting preferences of the respective species. The environment around the nest must contain appropriate resources, which are collected by bees during foraging. Therefore, the internal nest environment is connected to the external environment via foraging. Until early 2000, direct observations and/or video recording of the foraging activity of social bees were the predominant techniques for studying foraging behavior, and paint marks or labels were used to distinguish individuals. Although these techniques are still used, radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has been used for bee monitoring and can automatically count the inbound and outbound movements of bees from the nest and perform individual recognition. Here, we review the applications of RFID technology in bee research and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of RFID compared with those of other techniques.

AB  - Healthcare practitioners are generally forced to adapt their actions to cope with the complexity of daily conditions, taking advantage of their inherent potential for resilient performance. Following the principles of Resilience Engineering, this article details the application of the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM), for a semi-quantitative risk analysis of patients pathway. The analysis adopts a holistic perspective on the complexity of everyday work in order to manage emergent behaviours, mainly related to iatrogenic disease associated with neuro-anesthesia treatment.
   Enhancing the traditional FRAM approach, the paper presents a structured systemic analysis for a case study in the neurosurgery peri-operative patients pathway. A multi-layer semi-quantitative framework is used as a basis for a novel decision support tool: the Variability Impact Matrix (VIM). The VIM aids to prioritize corrective measures and the need for functional performance indicators. A combination of social and technical perspectives is confirmed being necessary to cope with complex work environments, such as healthcare practices.

AB  - This study aims to determine the composition of surfactants in the sea surface microlayer (SML), underlying water (ULW) and atmospheric particles (AP). Surfactants were determined colorimetrically as methylene blue active substances (MBAS) and disulphine blue active substances (DBAS) for anionic and cationic surfactants, respectively. The concentration of dissolved inorganic nutrients (DIN) in ULW was determined so as to indicate the influence of ULW to the surfactants in SML. The results showed that the concentration of MBAS and DBAS in SML at both stations ranged between 0.05 and 0.31 mu mol L-1, and between 0.19 and 0.59 mu mol L-1, respectively. Surfactants in ULW influence the concentration of surfactants in SML (r = 0.65, p < 0.01, n = 36). The station influenced by anthropogenic sources showed a higher concentration of surfactants in ULW, SML and AP. This finding suggests fine mode atmospheric particles (FMAP) are the main carrier for anionic surfactants as MBAS in the coastal ecosystem. Anionic surfactants as MBAS were found as better indicator of anthropogenic sources than cationic ones.

AB  - This study intends to empirically verify Jacobs' urban vitality theory, which was based on the observations of her New York City neighborhood in the mid-20th century. To examine the relationship between the residential built environment and walking activity, we used telephone survey data consisting of 1823 valid samples from across Seoul, a city characterized by a high population density and a well-established public transportation system. Respondents were asked questions about their residential location, their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and their walking activities. This study then used geographic information systems to measure objective indicators of built environment variables within 500-meter buffer areas based on the home addresses of the respondents. Then, this study constructed multilevel regression models with walking activity as the dependent variable. Our results indicated that walking activity is associated with Jacobs' six conditions for urban vitality, including land use mix, density, block size, building age, accessibility, and border vacuums.

AB  - The occurrence, distribution, and ecological risk assessment of 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated in the Dongjin River water system from December 2010 to October 2012. Among the detected PAHs, the mean concentration of acenaphthylene was the highest. Other PAHs were detected at very low concentrations. The detection frequencies and concentrations of the 15 PAHs were generally higher in the winter season, indicating low water flow conditions and low temperature. The results of a survey of the origin of the PAHs using the Phe/Ant ratio and Fla/Pyr ratio clearly indicated a pyrogenic source. The risk quotient (RQ) values for the 15 PAHs in the Dongjin River water system were below 0.01-0.1, indicating little risk to the relevant sensitive aquatic organisms, including green algae and daphnids, by the target compounds. In particular, the RQ values of most of PAHs exceeded 0.1 for fish in all of the seasons at most of the sampling sites, which indicated that the fish were exposed to medium risk.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been adopted in various monitoring applications. However, due to the high power consumption of catalytic gas sensors, which enable reliable gas detection, there is a lack of real WSN deployments aimed at the monitoring of combustible gases. This work reports on the evaluation of a WSN deployed in a real operational boiler facility. The WSN consists of nine battery-powered wireless sensor nodes (with an onboard catalytic sensor) controlled by a network coordinator. In this safety critical environment our objective is twofold: (i) guarantee precise and fast sensor response, and (ii) deliver the sensed data from the sensor nodes to the network coordinator safely in case of methane leakage. We first describe the deployment of the WSN and then evaluate the catalytic sensor response under various conditions. Besides, we evaluate the wireless links using the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and link quality indicator (LQI) metrics. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that during 5 months of deployment the sensor nodes have been discharged for 22-27%. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes a modeling study of near-field and far-field dilution of discharged effluents from a deep sea outfall system in Antalya Bay of Turkey. Initial dilution and wastewater plume behavior were simulated by Visual Plumes-UM3 model whereas Brooks dispersion model and first order bacterial decay formulations were used to simulate far-field dilution. The input data sets were collected by detailed field and lab investigations for effluent discharges (flow rate, total and fecal coliform concentration) and ambient environment (oceanographic and current measurements). Geostatistical methods and GIS were used to visualize results of the bacteriological sampling study. Site specific bacterial inactivation rates were determined by both in-situ and lab-scale experiments. Total dilution values and bacteria concentrations were predicted. Good agreement between predicted and measured total and fecal coliform concentrations were obtained for homogeneous and density stratified ambient conditions. Discussion on wastewater dilution mechanisms was presented with recommendations for similar future studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A distinct lack of historical and current data on the status of organic pollutant contaminants within the South African marine environment is evident. This has highlighted the need for more current organic pollutant assessments. Reference mussels and SPMDs were transplanted at five South African harbour sites to assess organic bioaccumulation in brown mussels (Perna perna) and semi-permeable membrane devices (SPMDs). Spatial patterns of PAH and PCB contaminants were determined by GC-MS and GC-ECD after appropriate sample preparation. Significant (p < 0.05) spatial differences were observed between the sites. Results indicate no correlations between the passive device and the transplanted mussels; however the SPMDs provided complementary information on the presence of dioxin-like PCBs within the environment not detected by the mussel. The results indicate that information provided by both the mussels and SPMDs allow for a more in depth scrutiny of environmental conditions as a result of anthropogenic influence.

AB  - The paper presents the comparison of species diversity and evenness indices calculated for coexisting communities of aphids and ants. In six study areas, localised in Upper Silesia (Poland), representing acidophilous oak-forest (Molinio caeruleae - Quercetum roboris), moist meadow (Molinietum caeruleae) and xerothermic grassland (Sileno-Phleetum) the community structure of aphids and ants (species number and abundance) was determined. The number of ant nests and aphid colonies was determined by searching the squares of 25 m(2) during vegetation seasons in 2006 and 2007. This provided the base to calculate the Shannon's diversity index and evenness index of both groups. Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed significant correlation only in the case of the number of species of both groups in a particular study area. It showed no significant correlation of values of diversity and evenness indices; however, considerable differences of values between both groups in various habitat types were recorded. The results are discussed with reference to the habitat history and maintenance, also reflecting the mutualistic relationship between ants and aphids.

AB  - Superior vision is needed for piloting aircraft in military and civilian environments, Although visual evaluations of potential pilots typically are conducted with no limit on viewing time, aviation and related occupations require superior vision under time-limited viewing conditions, and assessment of this capability is needed, The purpose of this study was to evaluate time-limited visual resolution in pilot trainees. A forced-choice letter recognition task was used to measure visual acuity (VA) and small letter contrast sensitivity (SLCS) in 37 trainees who had satisfied all vision requirements for pilot training. VA and SLCS were highly correlated (r = 0.76), indicating that the two tests measure similar aspects of visual resolution, However, although VA scores were distributed across 0.16 log units (two lines of letters on a VA chart), SLCS scores varied across 0.35 log units, which is nearly four lines on the SLCS chart, The variation in SLCS performance could be explained, in part, by subtle refractive error in pilot trainees, The results exemplify differences in performance among visually qualified trainees, and underscore the need for proper refractive correction, SLCS is a useful screening test for identifying subtle changes in vision that herald the need for optical or medical intervention.

AB  - The relationship between diatom (Bacillariophyceae) taxa preserved in surface lake sediments and measured limnological and environmental variables in 22 lakes near Yellowknife (N.W.T.) was explored using multivariate statistical methods. The study sites are distributed along a latitudinal gradient that includes a strong vegetational gradient of boreal forests in the south to arctic tundra conditions in the north. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that lakewater concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) each accounted for independent and statistically significant proportions of variation in the distribution of diatom taxa. Weighted-averaging (WA) models were developed to infer DIC and DOC from the relative abundances of the 76 most common diatom taxa. These models can now be used to infer past DIC and DOC concentrations from diatom assemblages preserved in sediment cores of lakes in the Yellowknife area, which may provide quantitative estimates of changes in lakewater chemistry related to past vegetational shifts at treeline.

AB  - This paper considers large-scale variation in both species composition and alpha diversity of wire-worm assemblages (Coleoptera, Elateridae) of oak forests along a latitudinal gradient in Central Russia.  The study is based on original data equal in both sample size and collecting technique.  Changes in assemblage characteristics are analysed in terms of species and/or community responses to macroclimatic parameters as well as to local habitat conditions.  Species composition based on presence/absence data is found to be the best indicator of macro-environmental changes caused by climate.  The species abundances are affected by both climatic trends and local habitat characteristics.  There is little evidence for a strong effect of the environmental factors upon the quantitative assemblage parameters such as species richness, total abundance, and various alpha diversity indices.  Species diversity does not depend on the age of the habitat and the level of disturbance.  The patterns observed suggest that species and community responses to the environment may play a significant role in explaining variation amongst isolated continental communities in addition to or instead of theories of island biogeography and interspecific competition.

AB  - As waste treatment facilities become old, their operation and maintenance costs could increase, which translates to higher treatment costs and environmental burden. This study applies the concept of eco-efficiency to evaluate waste treatment facilities considering the various conditions of waste treatment operations based on the case of Korea. In Korea, waste treatment methods were largely divided into five categories, and facilities for each treatment method were chosen based on their size, location, and waste properties for data collection. The method for evaluating the facilities' eco-efficiencies were developed using the concepts of environmental and economic performances. The results of the eco-efficiency evaluation showed that landfills were most environmentally efficient, followed by the organic waste biogasification facilities, food waste recycling facilities, incineration facilities, and, lastly, combustible waste-to-fuel facilities. The results of the eco-efficiency evaluation were further reviewed in terms of three factors which assess the status of existing facilities as well as to identify the environmental and economic indicators which significantly affect the eco-efficiency of waste treatment facilities by treatment method and propose strategic policies for promoting better waste treatment operations.

AB  - In the past decades, the bioremediation process based on denitrification by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria was extensively studied for different engineering approaches. Besides the fact that only non-pathogenic and non-biofilm forming bacteria must be used, it is very important to isolate bacteria or a group of bacteria in nature with the capacity to remove completely nitrate without accumulation of nitrogen oxides or ammonia as intermediates. In this article, the denitrification capacity of 43 bacterial strains isolated from slightly alkaline and calcite soils along the Danube River were investigated by artificial neural network (ANN) modelling. According to the obtained results, an ANN model was developed for the prediction of denitrification capacity of bacterial soil strains based on six signification denitrification indicators: biomass and N2 gas production, nitrate and nitrite concentration as well as nitrite and ammonia formation. The ANN model showed a reasonably good predictive capability of the outputs (overall R2 for prediction was 0.958). In addition, the experimental verification of the ANN in laboratory testing indicated that the ANN could predict the denitrification capacity of soil bacteria during the denitrification process in laboratory conditions.

AB  - The main objective of sustainability is to bring together economic growth with the care of the social environment and the protection of the environment. However, in a condition of uncertainty, enterprises need tools that help both decision making and the definition of their strategies. This article aims to broaden the discussion on the sustainable development of companies and propose solutions based on Fuzzy Logic. To reach this objective, the background and concepts on the Fuzzy Logic are presented. The interest lies in showing the origins of this logic and describing the history of the mathematics of uncertainty. In this way we show the conceptual bases that can contribute to the sustainable development of companies. Based on a bibliometric study, the existing research gaps are identified and a proposal is presented for the sustainable development of companies based on Fuzzy Logic. The results demonstrate the utility of the algorithm used in decision making. It is considered that this contribution will serve to encourage future studies on the application of algorithms to sustainability, a field that can be investigated in depth.

AB  - Green architecture is one of the most important ways to achieve sustainability in architecture. The purpose of this study is to present a model of driving force, pressure, state, impact and response in green architecture. The nine indicators can be studied in this field that were used in the green building process. These indicators are greening index, daily energy consumption index, water resources index, biodiversity index, carbon dioxide reduction index, waste reduction index, basin water index, sewage and wastes improvement index and indoor index. Thermal and air pollution and citizens' costs are among the drivers of green architecture in cities. The costs of people's lives are known as pressure, environmental conditions of cities as the State, the impact of green architecture on cleaning air and reducing wastes, as the impact and the response of urban authorities to the expansion of the green roofs uses and the greening of urban space and buildings as the response. Therefore, there is a lot of driving forces on the use of green architecture in urban spaces in the model, which will lead to appropriate responses from the urban authorities.

AB  - The informal trade activity has been for a long time a characteristic element of the Latin America countries 'trade. A lot of researchers have dedicated time and efforts to the study of this phenomenon that instead of decreasing every day is stronger. To know the perception consumers of the informal business area, have about a group of factors that characterize this trade, is going to be a starting point for subsequent analysis, that can lead into politics around the best management of the informality business in urban areas. For this research was selected the business area located at 3 de Julio Avenue, from Santo Domingo city, Ecuador. In this area that covers not only this Avenue but also several streets that crosses it. All of them crowded with informal sellers. Factors taken into account for the characterization of the informal activity become indicators oriented ones to the commercial aspects specifically (business indicators), others to the relative part of the conditions of the area (socio-environmental indicators). These indicators were quantified, observing a positive attitude in view of the business aspect, but without taking into consideration the socio-environmental aspect.

AB  - The aim of this study was to clarify the potential of soil enzyme activities as indicators of pesticide contamination, and to compare this to using the functional diversity of bacterial communities via Biolog (R) Ecoplates. The individual effects of the pure active ingredients (i.e. not the commercial formulations) of ten pesticides on various soil enzyme activities were recorded under laboratory conditions at different incubation times (i.e. 0, 2, 6 and 12 months). Results clearly showed that response patterns of soil enzyme activities differed in their sensitivities to pesticide addition over time (i.e. stimulation, inhibition or no effect). Results suggested that phenol oxidase activity could be used as an early indicator of pesticide contamination, and arylamidase and beta-glucosidase could be used to evaluate soil resilience after pesticide disturbances. We concluded that the functional diversity of bacterial communities was less efficient than soil enzyme activities as an indicator of pesticide contamination.

AB  - This use of nutrient and microbial metrics were examined as potential indicators of change in microbial community structure and nutrient dynamics across landscape-scale nutrient and seasonal moisture gradients in the Carbono Project forest soils in Costa Rica. Previous studies showed a decrease in net primary productivity occurred in these forests during the warmer years. In this study, differences were found in soil microbial community structure and function and nutrient dynamics across seasons and soil types. Most critically, when the soil moisture decreased in the dry season, there was a significant decrease in fungal contribution, carbon biomass development, and efficiency of carbon utilization in the soils. The implications are that should these forests continue to become warmer or the dry season lengthen, it could have measurable impacts on the soil biomass development and soil ecosystem health. The metrics from this study appear to have potential use for monitoring forest soil conditions.

AB  - Archaeological investigations of the lower Pleistocene deposits at Dmanisi (Lesser Caucasus, Georgia) have yielded an assemblage of hominin and faunal remains within a well-dated context. Although abundant vertebrate fossils have been recovered, paleobotanical studies have been limited. To address this, phytolith analysis has been conducted on two sections in order to reconstruct the distribution and evolution of vegetation throughout the entire sedimentary sequence. Large concentrations of phytoliths were recovered and analysed, permitting the reconstruction of climatic indices. The environmental data obtained from these phytolith assemblages are consistent with other palaeoecological data (i.e. geological, faunal and other archaeobotanical records). When considered together, they indicate an environment in which grasses were well-represented. In addition, the climatically important water stress indices derived from Dmanisi's phytolith assemblages suggest a period of increased aridity in the middle part of the stratigraphic sequence, which is contemporaneous with human occupations of the site.

AB  - Most nurseries measure and document records of the environmental conditions and growth variables of seedling crops. The usefulness of this operationally collected data for crop scheduling and predicting seedling height has not been studied. We used operational 10 years' data (information of growing measures of seedling batches, daily mean temperature and photoperiod, weekly monitored electrical conductivity and water content of growing medium) of commercially grown first-year container Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karsten) seedling batches to predict height development of seedling batches. Our data did not support the idea that the termination of height growth could be predicted accurately on the basis of photoperiod and temperature sum in operational seedling production. The best indicator for the final height was the sowing date. Although the measured variables, especially average weekly nitrogen given, correlated with the final height of seedlings, these variables did not give any additional explanation to sowing date. Within seedling batches the germling height (height of seedling at the age of 5-6 weeks) did not predict well the final height of seedlings.

AB  - The ultimate objective is to utilize fuzzy logic in developing environmental indicators for quantifying the environmental performance of industrial activities. Three types of indicators have been introduced in the current study. The first one is Kuwait-AQI, which is an air quality index that represents the air pollution conditions in Kuwait. The index considers five pollutants; O-3, PM10, CO, SO2 and NO2, and indicates the pollutant of maximum sub-index value. The second indicator is a fuzzy-based air quality index (Fuzzy-AQI), which is a useful tool that accounts for all pollutant's concentrations rather than having one pollutant dominating the value of the index. The third indicator is a fuzzy air quality performance indicator (FAQPI), which has been proposed as an effective tool for monitoring the environmental performance of process industries. The effectiveness of the proposed indicators is illustrated by examples based on air pollution measurements recorded by three fixed monitoring stations in Kuwait. Furthermore, a simulated industrial air pollution case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the indicators in tracking the environmental performance of an industrial activity as a result of implementing air pollution control projects.

AB  - The river Rhine at Rheinfelden is forming the border between Switzerland (Canton of Aargau) and Germany (State of Baden-Wurttemberg). Thus it was difficult and time-consuming to attain water regulations and building permit for the new Rhine hydroelectric power plant at Rheinfelden. Furthermore the project is located in a densely populated and intensively used landscape. Finally it was the first large hydro-electric power plant, which was subjected to the legally prescribed environmental impact assessment in new form. The actual water regulations procedure went on from the end of 1983 to the end of 1989. The granting procedure of the building permit including the second part of environmental impact assessment dragged on, so that the permit was not given before autumn 1998. The new concessions of 1990 made it a condition for the owner (KWR) to start reconstructing the power plant within 10 years and to go on-stream within 14 years. Owing to delays in preparatory operations the time limit to start building was extended halfway through the year 2003. The reconstruction of the weir as the first building stage started just in time. The power station building on the Swiss part of the river Rhine is under construction at the moment. The completion is intended for 2010.

AB  - A new species of Polygordiidae, Polygordius jouinae sp. Nov., along with its distribution, habitat, and reproduction is described. Polygordius jouinae sp. nov, the first North American Polygordius, is a dominant member of macrofaunal communities on the inner continental shelf, and in bays and harbours from Massachusetts to southern New jersey. It is distinguished from most other Polygordius species by its non-inflated, heavily ciliated pygidium, absence of pygidial glands, and a corneal (rather than rounded) prostomium. The 18S SSU rDNA from P. jouinae sp. nov. was sequenced and represents the first named Polygordius species with a DNA reference in GenBank. Spearman rank correlation of sediment grain size with density of P. jouinae sp. nov at a New jersey site showed that density was significantly (P < 0.05; N = 92) positively correlated with the proportion of medium to very coarse sand and negatively correlated with the fine sand fractions. Ecologically, P. jouinae sp. nov. is an important macrofaunal species given its widespread distribution and its fidelity for coarse sand habitats. Thus, Its relative abundance may be useful as an indicator of changing sedimentary conditions.

AB  - Conditional stability constants for the Cu-sensitive fluorescent dye Phen Green (TM) SK (PGSK) were determined for complexes containing both Cu(I) and Cu(II). Experimental conditions were optimized to minimize oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II). A binding constant of 10(11.38) for PGSK and Cu(I) was determined using chloride as the competing ligand and an iterative procedure involving equilibrium. calculations to fit experimental data. The new constant was tested by evaluating PGSK fluorescence in the presence of the strong Cu(I)-ligand neocuproine and thiourea. There was good agreement between experimental data and changes in fluorescence predicted by calculations using the new constant and published constants for the competing ligands. Using EDTA to buffer the free ion concentration of Cu2+, the conditional stability constant of PGSK with Cu(II) was measured to be 10(9.8). Both of these new constants are significantly higher than previously published values. Finally PGSK was used to examine the kinetics of Cu(I) dissociation from the biologically important ligand glutathione. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Epilithic diatom assemblages from neotropical streams draining into Golfo Dulce (Costa. Rica) were studied to determine how diatoms were related to measured environmental conditions. Twenty-three sites, affected by different land use practices, were selected and monitored for 21 months. Water chemistry was characterized by moderate specific conductivity (100-300 mu S/cm), neutral to alkaline pH and moderate to high values of soluble reactive phosphor-us (10-70 mu g/L). Anthropogenic impact was reflected in lower oxygen saturation, elevated nitrogen compounds and measured sediment load. A diverse diatom flora of 212 taxa was found. Patterns in the diatom distribution in relation to environmental variables, as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis, showed that riparian shading, pH, conductivity, current velocity and turbidity were the most important measured factors in determining species composition. The relationship between conductivity and pH was sufficiently strong to develop weighted-averaging regression and calibration models. Optima and tolerances of the most common diatom taxa are presented.

AB  - A microcosm (MS-3) with a multispecies soil system is introduced as an experimental tool for direct toxicity assessment of contaminated soils. The capacity of MS-3 to determine soil ecotoxicity potential was evaluated using samples from three sites contaminated with organic and/or inorganic compounds. Soils were toxic to soil-dwelling organisms (earthworm, plants, and microorganisms) and to aquatic organisms (algae and RTG-2 cell fish). As expected, responses varied substantially among different soils and organisms. The application of this evaluation system provided complementary information to the chemical characterization. For soils containing metals the toxic response was lower than predicted from total metal concentrations. For hydrocarbons, the toxicity response agreed with estimated values. The induction of EROD activity suggested the presence of dioxin-like compounds, which had not been addressed in the chemical characterization. The proposed multispecies system affords the measurement of 11 endpoints covering three soil and three aquatic taxonomic groups, reproduces soil conditions and gradients, and appears as an excellent complementary tool to chemical analysis for characterization of contaminated sites.

AB  - With a length of 1500 km, Ares Vallis is one of the largest martian outflow channels, and is inferred to have been formed by cataclysmic floods of water conveyed from source areas, which are marked by chaotic terrain, to Chryse Planitia. Near its downstream outlet (similar to 14 degreesN, 28 degreesW), the floor of Ares widens to 100 km from its average 25 km width. This area of widened channel floor is marked by a complex of irregular terraces, elongated depressions, linear ridges, sinuous ridges, and other indicators of highly irregular dissection of a formerly continuous surface. Thermokarst processes, following either glacial or alluvial histories, seem best to explain these relationships. Various indicators of fluctuating discharge for water and sediment, pending of debris, and prolonged flow suggest the emplacement of ice-rich debris in the anomalous reach of Ares Vallis. Post-flood or post-glacial thawing of the ice-rich sediments would then generate the thermokarst landscape. These processes, which are consistent with other indicators of anomalously warm climatic conditions, imply a profound change from the modern martian environment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A leaching test procedure for granular waste materials has been developed by a Nordic expert group. The Dutch leaching test procedure, especially the column test, was chosen as a starting point, as it best fullfilled the requirements for a leaching test. Furthermore, critical test parameters in the performance of the leaching tests are discussed. The following test procedure is recommended as a Nordic leaching test procedure for granular waste materials, especially ashes and slags from energy production: (1) a column test to L/S 1-2, which gives information on the composition and variations in first leachates that appears in a landfill; (2) a batch leaching test with two or possibly three leaching steps (L/S 2, L/S 10 cumulative and possible L/S 50 cumulative), which gives a rough estimate of the leached amounts and the leaching behaviour on a landfill, and also an estimate of the long-term leaching. This test is also recommended for routine testing and for small waste amounts; (3) especially for screening: an availability test (L/S 200) which gives information on the totally leachable amounts in extreme test conditions.

AB  - Most hydrocarbons have a group of molecules known as biomarkers capable of remaining stable during the aggressive conditions under which they formed. The objective of this paper is analyze key biomarkers of the four samples of crude oil extracted from the Del Mosquito reservoir in the Austral Basin in Southern Argentina, which allows the characterization of their precursor organic matter, the lithology and depositional environment of source rock and the thermal evolution. Biomarker profiles were analyzed by GC / MS from aliphatic and aromatic fractions after separation by column chromatography. Specific parameters such as Pr/Ph,Pr/n-C-17,Fi/n-C-18,T-24/T-23,T-26/T-25 and H-29/H-30 indicate that the crude oil from the Del Mosquito seems to have been generated from type II-III organic matter (mixed), associated with a siliclastic source rock in marine sedimentation environment with moderate oxygen concentration, and in the oil generation window. The results show correlation with the Springhill geological formation, defined for the Austral Basin.

AB  - In this work, the Modified Nonpoint Pollution Index (MPNPI) was calculated in the Area of Protection of Flora and Fauna, Pico de Tancitaro, Michoacan, for three years with different precipitation conditions 2004, 2007 and 2014; this area accommodates 16 basins of the region, within these, 10 localities are representing the physical-geographic typology of the state of Michoacan. MPNPI index calculation requires four indicators: land use (LCI), runoff (ROI), distance (DI) and annual precipitation (API). The results indicate that basins categorized as ranging from medium to very high diffuse contamination potential (nonpoint source pollution potential), with spatial coincidence during the three considered years, are Chuanito, Chondo and Cutio to the northwest; San Francisco and Huandiestacato to the north; Apo and Cuenca Rodada to the west; which in turn cross physical-geographical localities XLIV, XVII and LX; such conjunction allows to delimit spaces with homogeneous environmental characteristics within the basin which, in turn, helps to prioritize units that need to implement mitigation measures against diffuse pollution of aquatic systems.

AB  - Thermal storage facilities ensure a heat reservoir for optimally tackling dynamic characteristics of district heating systems: heat and electricity demand evolution, changes of energy prices, intermittent nature of renewable sources, extreme wheatear conditions, malfunctions in the systems. The present review paper explores the implementation of thermal energy storage in district heating and cooling systems. Both short-term and long-term storages are considered highlighting their potential in combination with district heating. Connections of sensible, latent (phase change material) and chemical heat storage are analyzed taking into account the research maturity of each type technology. The transition of current energy systems towards next generation district heating, and sustainable multi energy networks is considered. Performance assessment by using proper thermodynamic indicators and costs are investigated. Further addressed topics include the use of heat capacity of the network and the buildings connected to the system to store energy. The main issues currently limiting the diffusion of daily and seasonal thermal storage and the main research paths are discussed.

AB  - Scarce knowledge is available concerning the diatom ecology of hypersaline environments and their potential to use as bioindicators. The aim of this study was to characterize and quantify diatom assemblages from Vermelha Lagoon associated with environmental parameters in order to establish environmental quality bioindicators for hypersaline environments. Species distribution displayed a weak relationship with environmental parameters analyzed in DCA analyses. The cluster analyses evidenced the presence of four diatom groups in the lagoon: Group I - located on the south margin of the lagoon, represented by N. arenaria; Group II - located in the north, the central sector and near the communication channel with Araruama Lagoon, dominated by F. interposita. The Group III - distributed in the shallowest regions, where primary productivity is high. Species H. acutiuscula and C. placentula in this group reached high relative abundance values. Group IV is characterized by increased salinity and lipids values, characterizing hypertrophic sediment conditions. These stations were located in the Saltpan water catchment and were characterized by a decreased number of species and the dominance of A. robusta.

AB  - Mollusks and crustaceans are important in making energy available to upper trophic levels, besides, they are indicators of aquatic ecosystems condition. Diversity and abundance were determined by diurnal samples in lotic and lentic systems in 3 zones: delta 1 and 2 floodplain (PD) and fluvial highlands (MF) of the Usumacinta river basin during hydrological periods of minimum flooding, transition and maximum flooding. A total of 236,250 organisms was collected, which belong to 35 and 13 species of mollusks and crustaceans, with 99% and 1% of the total abundance, respectively. The 85% of the abundance of mollusks was represented by Melanoides tuberculata and Tarebia granifera (invasive species), whereas the 67% of the crustaceans was represented by Macrobrachium sp. and Penaeus duorarum. The highest diversity for mollusks was in zone PD2 (H' = 2.4); in lotic (H' = 2.9) and min-1 season (H' = 2.2). Regarding the crustaceans, the highest diversity was in PD1 (H' = 2.2), in lotic (H' = 65 2.0) and in max-1 season (H' = 2.1). The diversity varied due to habitat heterogeneity and marine influence recorded.

AB  - The development of the different technologies included in the Industry 4.0 paradigm opens the door to an intensive monitoring of machine-tools. A data acquisition platform for both 2D and 3D analysis of machine performance under real factory conditions is presented in this study. The platform is composed of: 1) a data acquisition system that processes the information collected from the control memory and any other sensor integrated in the machine; 2) a remote server that stores the collected data; and, 3) a set of 2D and 3D interfaces both of which permit real-time calculation of KPIs and analysis of a specific machining process in a 3D virtual environment using Oculus Rift and Oculus Touch to detect anomalies in the machining process. This platform has been validated in a gantry milling machine machining large casting components. The results of this study demonstrate the detection of three types of anomalies in the machining process and the extent to which the immersive 3D environment makes it easier for the process engineer, especially in the case of junior process engineers, to detect them.

AB  - Covariation of individual responses to different fear-eliciting situations is expected to manifest in general "fearfulness syndrome." We tested for the existence of such a syndrome in wild-caught captive greenfinches. We assessed the propensity to give distress calls at handling, latency to feed at the presence of a predator image, and changes in locomotor activity in response to distress calls of conspecifics. Additionally, we measured the frequency of flapping flight movements against cage bars and tendency to damage tail feathers in captivity as indicators of the ability of birds to cope with captive conditions. As a proxy of neuroendocrine activity (an expected covariate of fearfulness), we measured the amount of stress hormone corticosterone deposited into feathers grown during captivity. All the behavioral traits were individually repeatable in time, but there were no correlations between them. Lack of the behavioral syndrome for fearfulness was also revealed by structural equation modelling. The findings of this experiment challenge the concept of a single internal variable responsible for fearfulness and support the proposed multidimensional nature of fear responses.

AB  - In estuarine systems, naturally occurring soluble S2- is an indicator of anaerobic decomposition by the SO42- reduction pathway and can, at high concentrations, be detrimental to plant communities. Depth distributions of soluble S2- in marsh pore water are typically measured using either equilibrium dialysis samplers (peepers) or pore water extractors (sippers). The former technique provides concentrations equilibrated over one or more weeks at centimeter-scale resolution, while the latter allows rapid sampling and analysis but with a coarser vertical resolution (5-10 cm). We report on a novel technology for documenting marsh pore water S2- concentrations based on reactive synthetic Fe oxides and image analysis, which allows rapid sampling but still captures small-scale spatial resolution. During the last few years, this new technology associated with synthetic Fe oxides known as IRIS (Indicator of Reduction In Soils) has been developed to aid in documenting reducing conditions in wetland soils. Our recent work has shown that IRIS technology can be used to document and measure H2S levels in marsh soil pore water. The data obtained can provide detailed, quantitative information on S2- concentrations with millimeter-scale spatial resolution.

AB  - Blue crabs from a contaminated estuary (Hackensack Meadowlands-HM) and a cleaner reference site (Tuckerton-TK) were analyzed for Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn in muscle and hepatopancreas. Crabs from each site were taken into the laboratory and fed food from the other site, or in another experiment, transplanted to the other site for eight weeks. All crabs were analyzed for metals. Overall, tissue concentrations reflected environmental conditions. Tissue differences were found for Cu, Pb and Zn (all higher in hepatopancreas), and Hg (higher in muscle). HM muscle had more Hg than TK muscle, but did not decrease after transplanting or consuming clean food. HM crabs lost Cu, Pb and Zn in hepatopancreas after being fed clean food or transplanted. TK crabs increased Hg in muscle and Cr and Zn in hepatopancreas after transplantation or being fed contaminated (HM) food. Concentrations were variable, suggesting that blue crabs may not be fully reliable bioindicators of polluted systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies were conducted to evaluate Bacillus atrophaeus spores' production by solid-state fermentation (SSF) using sugarcane bagasse as support and soybean molasses as substrate at lab-scale in column bioreactors (forced aeration), plastic bags and Erlenmeyer flasks (aeration by diffusion). Different moisture contents (84%, 86% and 88%; 89%, 91% and 93%) and aeration rates (30mL/min, 45mL/min, 60mL/min and 90mL/min) were studied. The best condition for spore production (3.3x10(10) CFU.g(-1)dry matter) in column bioreactor was 80% of initial humidity and no aeration. In Erlenmeyer flasks and plastic bags the best sporulation production reached 1.7 up to 4.7x10(10) CFU.g(-1)dry matter with 88-93% of initial moisture. The aeration rate had no significant effect on the spore yield. The initial moisture had a significant effect depending on the bioreactor type. Sporulation kinetic's assay was carried out and it showed the possibility to reduce the time of spore formation in two days.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) balance has been identified as a principal agri-environmental indicator. In addition to national N balances, calculation of N balances for different agricultural regions is also recommended. In this study, national and regional net N balances for Finland were calculated. The net N balance is the result of deducting the NH3-N losses from manure and fertilisers from the gross N balance. The N balance calculation was based on data for Finnish Rural Centres and calculated per cultivated hectare. The main data inputs for the calculations were agricultural and environmental statistics, coefficients of manure excretion and crop N concentrations. Finnish national net N balance decreased from 90 kg ha(-1) in 1990 to 50 kg ha(-1) in 2005. The decrease in regional N balances was of the same magnitude. The main reason for the lower N balances was reduced use of mineral N fertilisers. Variation in the N balances was due to yield levels varying according to growing season conditions. The Rural Centres with intensive animal production tended to generate the highest N balances.

AB  - Biodiesel fuel, a promising alternative diesel fuel produced by a catalytic transesterification of vegetable oils, has become more attractive recently because of its environmental concerns and the fact that it is made from renewable resources. In this work, the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol has been studied in a heterogeneous system, using alumina loaded with potassium iodide as a solid base catalyst. After loading KI of 35 wt.% on alumina followed by calcination at 773 K for 3 h, the catalyst gave the highest basicity and the best catalytic activity for this reaction. The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, IR, SEM and the Hammett indicator method. Moreover, the dependence of the conversion of soybean oil on the reaction variables such as the catalyst loading, the molar ratio of methanol to oil and the reaction time was studied. The conversion of 96% was achieved under the optimum reaction conditions. Besides, a correlation of the catalyst activity for the transesterification reaction with its basicity was proposed.

AB  - Comparison of funerary treatment and skeletal biology can be very informative about the interplay of social status and meanings and actual life conditions in ancient communities, but such comparison is rarely done, due in part to the disciplinary separation of bioanthropology and social archaeology in many archaeological traditions. In this paper, we analyze relations between skeletal pathologies and grave goods in a sample of 94 individuals from Pontecagnano (Salerno, Italy, seventh-third centuries BC). The results show that the relationship between health, activity, and social status as expressed in grave goods was complex. Some biological indicators considered typical of "stress" or biological status (enamel hypoplasia, cribra orbitalia, adult stature) bore no relation to social status. Other indicators, particularly those of activity and stress in adult life (trauma, Schmorl's nodes, periostitis), covaried with grave assemblage and help to outline a possible division of labor. As this analysis shows, when skeletal and archaeological data are used in conjunction, the result is a deeper picture of the social and economic life of the community than can be obtained from either source.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a widely studied element which is integral to many vital body functions. In ruminant nutrition, however, the degree of naturally occurring P deficiency in grazing cattle, the lack of uniformity in response to P supplementation, and even suggested P requirements have generated a great deal of confusion in the United States and around the world. Much of the confusion arises because animals have the ability to draw on skeletal P reserves when dietary P levels are inadequate. The mechanisms that control skeletal P withdrawal, the conditions that trigger withdrawal, and the rate and extent of withdrawal without affecting animal performance seem to be poorly understood. Another area of confusion involves the detrimental effect of P deficiency on feed intake which makes it unclear in many situations whether animal responses to P supplementation are due to P per se or simply to increased feed intake. This review attempts to discuss these and other important problems concerning the P nutrition of grazing cattle. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - There has been growing interest and substantial improvement in thermal processes for enhancing the heat transfer rate in food industry applications. The replacement of conventional heat transfer fluids with nanofluids is now being considered as a novel and emerging solution to the heat transfer problem of the food processing sector. This review covers state-of-the-art methods for production and application of these nanofluids with emphasis on the decontamination of liquid foods. The review also discusses the influence of processing conditions such as temperature and nanoparticle concentration on the thermal and viscous characteristics of the developed nanofluids. Further, the effect of these developed nanofluids on the quality attributes of food materials has also been reviewed and analyzed. Based on the current technological status, certain knowledge gaps in nanofluid research have been identified, including controlled (shape and size) and systematic experimental studies, stability of nanofluids with increasing thermal cycles, increasing the compatibility of base fluid to nanomaterials, and toxicity and environmental impact assessment.

AB  - A review and analysis of changes in mechanical properties of basalt fibers (BF) and basalt composite materials under effects of aggressive environments in reference to foreign and Russian scientific literature has been carried out. The changes in the physical and mechanical properties of the fiberglass (FG) and basalt plastic (BP) have been compared. The analysis shows that BF is a good alternative to fiberglass for elaboration of composite materials for various purposes. In the most aggressive alkaline environments, BP resistance is higher as compared with that of FG. If required, BF resistance to chemically active media could be increased by midifying its composition and applying protective layers and heat treatment of fibers. For extended use of BP as an effective structural material under various climatic conditions, including in the Arctic, long-term tests of 10 or more years are advisable and relevant, with control of changes in their mechanical parameters and an analysis of processes of climatic aging developing in BP.

AB  - This research presents a methodology for measuring acoustic comfort using a soft-sensing approach to support decision-making for buildings renovation. The soft-sensor provides a measurement system for evaluating indoor acoustic quality of buildings (housing, schools, offices, etc.) in relation to the external noise level. The metric is represented by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which quantitatively express the acoustic comfort. Information regarding the current condition of the building ("As-is" KPI) is provided as a normalised value for the simplified quantification of acoustic performance. The knowledge of the "As-is" KPI allows the design team to compare it with the new KPIs obtained from renovation scenarios ("What - if" KPI). A case study is presented to demonstrate the exploitability of the methodology. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed to establish how the accuracy of the KPI measurement impacts on the decision-making process. The methodology shows promising results in the identification of the best retrofit strategy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the following article, a method of modeling urban environment exposed to road noise pollution for the purpose of noise nuisance assessment has been proposed. In order to accomplish it, GIS technology has been applied to divide the area under study into hexagonal fields. The presented case shows an area of urban environment exposed to noise pollution by means of object feature mapping, in each of the adopted elements. An acoustic and non-acoustic analysis of spatial distribution of the researched object features with the application of the adopted assessment indicators has been conducted. In particular, as assessment indicators, the following have been used: landscape entropy (H), L-Aeq (noise_sr), Simpson's diversity index (SIDI), area and length of transportation network (R-a, R-l), buildings (GSI) and number of stories (FSI), predominance of land cover (LIPI), equality of class distribution (SIEI), and geodiversity index (G(d)). The statistical analysis of the validity of the aforementioned indices has also been carried out. For the purpose of noise annoyance assessment modeling, the application of statistically relevant assessment indicators has been proposed with the special use of the neural network method.

AB  - The biological properties of the soil are important because they are closely related to soil physico-chemical properties and plants' health. Thus, the diversity of species, their number and their functions are indicators sensitive to changes in soil properties due to agricultural practices. From a biological point of view, improving the physical and chemical properties of the soil creates favourable conditions for the activity of the microorganisms and for the growth of the plant roots. Soil breathing is one of the soil's properties, determined by the plant roots' activity and microorganisms living in the soil, an activity that is appreciated by the carbon dioxide production (CO2 emission) from the organisms that live in the soil. The research calls into question the soil breathing process under two crops, wheat and corn, following the impact of various soil technological processes on this respiration potential, on experimental variations such as conventional tillage, superficial tilling, disc harrowing and no tillage soil. From research in the field, soil breathing rates vary significantly between major plant biomasses, suggesting that the type of vegetation influences the rate of soil respiration.

AB  - In this study, an offshoot of studies undertaken by the Washington State Department of Ecology (WDOE), the density and diversity of foraminiferal assemblages in Commencement and Elliott bays, two heavily industrialized embayments in Puget Sound, Washington (U.S.A) were compared and correlated with concentrations of metal pollutants and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Samples used in this study were collected by the WDOE between 1998 and 2014, allowing comparison over a temporal range encompassing the beginnings of environmental remediation in both bays. The composition of the foraminiferal assemblages is typical of polluted estuaries globally, with the major taxa being Elphidiella hannai, Cribroelphidium excavatum, Bucella frigida and Eg-gerella advena. Foraminiferal density and diversity showed negative correlations with pollutants, however, these correlations were significant for only a few pollutants, and trends could not be attributed to any single one. Both embayments showed increasing diversity over time, and both had high proportions of calcareous tests that displayed signs of dissolution, indicating corrosive conditions in the water. In Elliott Bay the percentage of partially dissolved tests increased over time, suggesting remediation efforts have not been successful in all areas.

AB  - This study evaluated the jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) as a potential remediator of sulfentrazone in the soil. The experiment was conducted under field conditions in a complete randomised block design. The treatments consisted of soils with and without herbicide application as well as the absence and presence of C. ensiformis cultivation associated with incorporation into the soil or the removal of shoots of C. ensiformis. Sorghum was planted as a bioindicator to evaluate the remediation efficiency of jack bean. Sulfentrazone application in areas without C. ensiformis cultivation decreased plants stands, productivity, and height of sorghum compared to treatments where C. ensiformis was cultivated. Sorghum cultivated in succession to C. ensiformis in areas contaminated with sulfentrazone resulted in dry matter production, plants numbers, productivity, and height of sorghum equivalent to uncontaminated areas. The results of this research indicate that the use of jack bean for the bioremediation of sulfentrazone treated soils would provide greater security in the planting of susceptible species in areas where this herbicide has been applied. The cultivation of C. ensiformis in contaminated areas may reduce the risk of environmental impacts caused by sulfentrazone.

AB  - Metals bioaccumulated in aquatic organisms are considered to be a good indicator of bioavailable metal contamination levels in freshwaters. However, bioaccumulation depends on the metal, the species, and the water chemistry that influences metal bioavailability. In the laboratory, a kinetic model was used to describe waterborne Pb bioacctimulated in Gammarus pulex. Uptake and elimination rate constants were successfully determined and the effect of Ca2+ on Pb uptake was integrated into the model. Thereafter, accumulated Pb concentrations in organisms were predicted with the model and compared with those measured in native populations from the Seine watershed (France). The predictions had a good agreement with the bioaccumulation levels observed in native gammarids and particularly when the effect of calcium was considered. To conclude, kinetic parameters experimentally derived for Pb in G. pulex are applicable in environmental conditions. Moreover, the consideration of the water's chemistry is crucial for a reliable interpretation of bioaccumulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) are recognised as potential threats to groundwater or other water environments subject to discharged effluents. In this study, the microbiological and nutrient removal properties of three different pilot-scale sand filters (SFs) were followed over a one-year period. Moreover, a separate phosphorus removal unit was tested for six months. For the best treatment system, the average log removals were 2.2-3.5 for pathogenic human noro- and adenoviruses and 43-5.2 and 4.6-5.4 for indicator viruses and bacteria, respectively. The system that effectively removed microbes was also efficient at removing nutrients. However, the poorest treatment system yielded substantially lower removals. The remarkable differences noted between the studied SFs highlights the importance of construction materials and the careful planning of the filters. Moreover, seasonal conditions appear to have a clear effect on purification efficiencies, emphasising the vulnerability of these systems especially in cold climates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The electrospray ionization, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance, Raman and CD spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical methods are used. The competitive formation of the variety of epoxides, strongly depending of the reaction conditions. Thus, the products of interaction of matrix-analyte matrixes under the UV-MALDI-MS experiment are comprehensively examinated. Nonetheless, that for heptachlor (HA) is known an epoxide, existing in two isomeric forms, i.e. A and B (exoand endo-one), the study on the mechanism of the epoxidation of HA, showed formation of new epoxides C-F and an intermediate (I), characterizing with high stability, decreasing in the raw F > A > C > B > I > D > E. The epoxide D appeared enantiomer of the insecticide oxychlodran. The reported results on the pesticides, their metabolites and decomposition reactivity products contributed significantly to the field of analytical chemistry, providing possibility for elaboration of highly selective protocols for assessment of environmental contaminant issues.

AB  - The ability to fully control sexual maturation and spawning and to produce large numbers of high quality seeds on demand' (i.e. all year long) is a primary requirement for the successful development of aquaculture. This relies on optimal broodstock management practices based on extensive knowledge of the nutritional and environmental requirements of fish in captivity. However, for many established, emerging and new farmed fish species, such knowledge is limited or not available yet. The level of domestication also plays an essential role as stocks with improved traits in farming conditions are selected. Importantly, reliable indicators of egg quality are still lacking and hatcheries still rely on wild harvested broodstocks in many farmed fish species. These key challenges must be addressed urgently to ensure the sustainable development of the European fish farming sector. This review gives an overview of methods to assess egg/sperm quality and many of the most important factors affecting gamete production and quality, including broodstock nutrition, environmental and spawning induction protocols, genetic management, gamete preservation and new reproductive strategies.

AB  - Inverted microscopy is widespread employed for the analysis of phytoplankton composition within water quality monitoring networks. However, the analysis at the lowest taxonomical level is not always required for ecological status assessment. In addition, inverted microscopy can underestimate the small phytoplankton, and not always distinguish photoautotrophic from heterotrophic cells. In this study, as alternative tools, epifluorescence microscopy and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) were employed to characterize phytoplankton communities within waters of different trophic condition. Epifluorescence microscopy confirmed its effectiveness to count the small phytoplankton. Furthermore, significant correlations between nutrients of anthropogenic origin and nanoplankton abundances were found. However, this technique resulted very time-consuming. HPLC together with the CHEMTAX program was more appropriate than inverted microscopy, in terms of cost-effectiveness. Also, the main variability patterns observed in the phytoplankton community structure by HPLC coincided with previous findings in the study area. Nevertheless, a rapid screening at the inverted microscope is recommended. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The presence of copper in water environment may have detrimental effects on aquatic organisms, including algae, where different enzymatic systems can be affected. Algae acid phosphatase plays important roles in metabolic processes such as decomposition of organic phosphate, autophagic digestive process, recycling cellular materials and zygote formation during reproduction. This work describes an in vitro activation effect of copper on the acid phosphatase of the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (formely Selenastrum capricornutum) under preincubation condition. Apparent Michaelis constant values of 1.21 and 0.37 mM, and activation energy values of 26.8 and 13.6 kJ mol(-1) were determined in the absence and in the presence of 0.2 mM Cu2+, respectively. The dissociation constant value for Cu2+ binding to the enzyme was determined to be 22.04 mu M. The decrease of the apparent Michaelis constant (Km) and activation energy values in the presence of Cu2+ correlates well with its activating effect on the acid phosphatase activity. This propriety could be used as a sensitive bioindicator for copper in environmental samples.

AB  - Pesticides such as Dichlovos (DDVP) and Deltamethrin (DTM) are commonly used in agricultural production. To evaluate the toxicity of commercial formulations of DDVP, mixed or not with DTM, were realized tests for acute toxicity in fish species Danio rerio and Hyphessobrycon bifasciatus. To the mixture, we used the highest concentrations of pesticides tested, which caused no lethality. The results showed that on the concentrations used, the pesticide DDVP promotes the "all or nothing effect, i.e. 100% of animals dying or 100% survive. In the case of the mixture, the results demonstrated the occurrence of 100% lethality at concentrations of pesticides that did not produce lethal effect if administered alone, indicating a synergistic effect of the pesticide mixture. These data suggest that the use of mixtures of these pesticides may represent an important factor. Finally, the toxicity effect showed on the two species was similar, suggesting that the Hyphessobrycon bifasciatus fish may be used for environmental assessments in Brazilian conditions.

AB  - Biodegradation of chlorobenzenes was assessed at an anoxic aquifer by combining hydrogeochemistry and stable isotope analyses. In situ microcosm analysis evidenced microbial assimilation of chlorobenzene (MCB) derived carbon and laboratory investigations asserted mineralization of MCB at low rates. Sequential dehalogenation of chlorinated benzenes may affect the isotope signature of single chlorobenzene species due to simultaneous depletion and enrichment of C-13, which complicates the evaluation of degradation. Therefore, the compound-specific isotope analysis was interpreted based on an isotope balance. The enrichment of the cumulative isotope composition of all chlorobenzenes indicated in situ biodegradation. Additionally. the relationship between hydrogeochemistry and degradation activity was investigated by principal component analysis underlining variable hydrogeochemical conditions associated with degradation activity at the plume scale. Although the complexity of the field site did not allow straightforward assessment of natural attenuation processes. the application of an integrative approach appeared relevant to characterize the in situ biodegradation potential.

AB  - The oxygen isotopic composition of scelactinian corals has been shown to be a reliable indicator of the surface ocean and atmospheric conditions and variabilities. In the equatorial Indian Ocean coral records track the movement of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and strongly respond to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variabilities of the equatorial Pacific. Corals from the Arabian Sea seem to respond both to the Indian monsoon precipitation as well as to ENSO. However, those from the extreme northern Red Sea appear to be controlled by the Middle East climate. The characteristic behaviour of coral oxygen isotopes in this region of the Indian Ocean reveals the nature of the large-scale forcings. It appears that the ENSO influences the equatorial Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) through an atmospheric teleconnection, which in turn, interacts with the sub-tropics through changes in land-ocean temperature gradients that enhance the wind strength. The effect of this interaction is manifested in the northern Arabian Sea coral oxygen isotopes more during the northeast, than during the southwest monsoon.

AB  - This paper presents environmental profiles of various Procter & Gamble (P&G) laundry detergents in the UK over a time period from 1988 to 2001 using Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). Detergent formulations studied are regular powder (RP), compact powder (CP), powder tablet (PT), dilute liquid (DL), compact liquid (CL) and liquid unit-dose (LT). The functional unit of the present study is 1 wash under representative conditions of formulation, packaging, wash habits and sewage treatment infrastructure for the respective years. The analysis shows considerable environmental improvements on most indicators within the powder and liquid category between 1988 and 2001. Key drivers behind these environmental improvements were reduced wash temperature and dosage. Reduced wash temperature was made possible through innovative technologies, improved formula design and washing machine improvements. Innovative manufacturing processes and improved formula design allowed for dosage reduction. Combining market share data for the different detergent formulations with corresponding LCA results leads to an environmental fingerprint of an "average" wash with P & G laundry detergents ("wash equivalent"). The evolution of wash equivalents over time clearly demonstrates a continuous improvement for all LCA indicators between 1988 and 2001.

AB  - 1. Scope for growth (SfG) is an integrative physiological indicator reflecting the net energy gain of an organism. It correlates well with growth and reproduction. An experiment was set up to test whether SfG also reflects the capacity to cope with environmental stress.
   2. Five groups of Daphnia magna were fed different algal rations to induce different SfG. On day 21, SfG was measured. Thereafter, each ration group was subdivided into a control and a saltwater treatment in which salinity was raised to 0.7%.
   3. In the first part of the experiment, mortality was dependent on ration only for the first 6 days. Afterwards, mortality rates did not differ between the rations. SfG increased hyperbolically with increasing ration. Growth and reproduction correlated with SfG. In the second part of the experiment, mortality rates were higher in the salt-stressed groups, but did not differ between rations in either group. Reproduction correlated with SfG in the freshwater group but not in the saltwater group.
   4. The results indicate that differences in SfG do not imply different capacities to cope with future stress.

AB  - A study was undertaken to compare two enrichment broths and to test a new plate medium, Rambach agar, for their suitability to detect Salmonella from marine recreational waters. The study shows that under conditions of low levels of fecal contamination, Salmonella spp was isolated more efficiently using NR10(10)/43 broth. While at higher levels of fecal contamination NR10/43 broth effectively limits the growth of accompanying flora. For the highest level of fecal contamination Rambach apr was less selective than Hektoen enteric agar but Rambach agar was shown to be better than Hektoen apr for the recovery of Salmonella strains from low contaminated waters. On Rambach apr the distinct color of salmonellas, seen in red, enhanced correct identification. Biochemical and serological confirmation of Salmonella isolates was performed using the API Z System and Oxoid Salmonella Rapid Latext test. The combination of enrichment broths (24 h at 42-degrees-C), isolation (24 h at 37-degrees-C) and identification systems described above (2 h or 1 min) allowed the detection of Salmonella from marine waters, with low or high levels of fecal contamination, in 48 h.

AB  - We prepared a pH-sensitive indicator film incorporating beetroot extract (BTE, 0, 1, 2, and 3%, w/w) encapsulated in pectin from watermelon peel (WMP) to monitor quality changes of chilled beef during storage. The results showed that a low BTE content (up to 2%) led to a reduction of oxygen permeability (OP) and water vapor permeability (WVP) and an improvement of mechanical properties. The light transmittance of WMP/BTE films decreased and the thermal stability improved with increasing BTE content. Therefore, a film containing 2% BTE (WMP/BTE2) exhibited the best performance. The release of BTE from the WMP film was controlled by diffusion. In addition to good color stability at natural conditions, the WMP/BTE2 film displayed a colorimetric response at a wide range (3-10) of pH values. The color of the WMP/BTE2 film changed from pink (day 0) to brown (day 8) which was associated with the spoilage of the chilled beef. The above results indicate that WMP/BTE2 has great potential in monitoring the quality of chilled beef.

AB  - As a significant part of grid code compliance verification, harmonic adaptability (HA) capability on-site testing is indispensable for offshore wind turbines. Although the HA remote testing method having no restrictions of harsh environment and resulting access limitation is regarded as an alternative to the existing testing method, the application scope and condition are not indicated explicitly, which enormously reduces its practicability in real testing. This article investigates the feasibility of the HA remote testing method. Based on the analysis of its working principle and a comprehensive caparison, two dominating factors affecting the feasibility are identified: the capacity of the applied active power filter and the power transmission capability of submarine cable. An assessment method comprising two indicators, i.e., the maximum resonance amplitude that can be suppressed and the feasible testing distance, is developed for the feasibility study. The application scope of the HA remote testing method is obtained with the proposed corresponding algorithm for the derived indicators. Extensive simulation results show that the HA remote testing method is viable and promising within the specified scope.

AB  - The concentrations of nitrite and thiocyanate in saliva can be used as the biomarkers of the progression of periodontitis disease and environmental tobacco smoke exposure, respectively. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to detect these two indicators in saliva. Herein, the three-dimensional single-layered paper-based microfluidic analytical devices (3D sl-mu PADs) were, for the first time, fabricated by the spraying technique for the colorimetric detection of nitrite and thiocyanate at the same time. The conditions for 3D sl-mu PADs fabrication were optimized in order to well control the penetration depth of the lacquer in a paper substrate. Then, the developed 3D sl-mu PADs were utilized to simultaneously detect nitrite and thiocyanate and the limits of detection are 0.0096 and 0.074 mM, respectively. What is more, the mu PADs exhibited good specificity, good repeatability, and acceptable recoveries in artificial saliva. Therefore, the developed 3D sl-mu PADs show a great potential to determine nitrite and thiocyanate for the assessment of the human health.

AB  - In this paper the authors discuss the realization of a Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) network infrastructure to be employed for monitoring activities within the marine environment. In particular, transmission ranges as well as the assessment of parameters like Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) are analyzed in the specific context of an aquaculture industrial plant, setting up a transmission channel from an offshore monitoring structure provided with a LoRaWAN transmitter, to an ashore receiving device composed of two LoRaWAN Gateways. A theoretical analysis about the feasibility of the transmission is provided. The performances of the system are then measured with different network parameters (in particular the Spreading Factor-SF) as well as with two different heights for the transmitting antenna. Test results prove that efficient data transmission can be achieved at a distance of 8.33 km even using worst case network settings: this suggests the effectiveness of the system even in harsher environmental conditions, thus entailing a lower quality of the transmission channel, or for larger transmission ranges.

AB  - Geospatial sciences play crucial roles in and have effects on the socioeconomic, political and security fortunes of states. Earth observation, remote sensing and geoscientific ground investigation increasingly occupy vantage positions in the legal order of states, particularly in evidential terms and in the verification of facts under international law. How then do these aspects of space law and space sciences affect contemporary Africa and the commercial fortunes, as well as international relations among some African states? What impact do they have in relation to: (a) international boundaries disputes and demarcation activities; (b) management and the preservation of the African heritage; (c) disaster and conservation management? The paper will test the hypothesis that it is crucial for the development of the continent especially in the areas mentioned above that states should sustain and increase investment in the following areas: archaeological prospection, condition assessment of heritage assets; Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis of spatial settlement patterns in modern landscapes and assessment of natural or human-induced threats to conservation.

AB  - An organic compound known as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is formed from reducing sugars in honey and various processed foods in acidic environments when they are heated through the Maillard reaction. In addition to processing, storage conditions affect the formation HMF, and HMF has become a suitable indicator of honey quality. HMF is easily absorbed from food through the gastrointestinal tract and, upon being metabolized into different derivatives, is excreted via urine. In addition to exerting detrimental effects (mutagenic, genotoxic, organotoxic and enzyme inhibitory), HMF, which is converted to a non-excretable, genotoxic compound called 5-sulfoxymethylfurfural, is beneficial to human health by providing antioxidative,anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypoxic, anti-sickling, and anti-hyperuricemic effects. Therefore, HMF is a neo-forming contaminant that draws great attention from scientists. This review compiles updated information regarding HMF formation, detection procedures, mitigation strategies and effects of HMF on honey bees and human health.

AB  - This article provides an introduction to the Special Issue dedicated to "Solution-oriented Global Environmental Assessments: Opportunities and Challenges". In the follow-up to the Paris climate agreement and the adoption and early implementation of the global Sustainable Development Goals involving many synergies and trade-offs, the need to shift the focus from environmental problem analysis towards the exploration of specific solution options can be observed in international environmental governance debates. To remain policy-relevant, credible and legitimate, global environmental assessments (GEAs) must carefully adapt to a rapidly evolving governance landscape. This Special Issue sheds light on the potential utility and implications of increased solution-orientation of GEAs. It builds on the research project "The Future of Global Environmental Assessment Making" that was jointly initiated in 2013 by UN Environment and the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change. The article collection includes research on the coevolution of GEAs and the increasingly solution-oriented governance context; conditions of success for contemporary GEAs; the treatment of divergent viewpoints, stakes and stakeholders in solution-oriented GEAs; knowledge aggregation; and the enhanced measurement of GEA effectiveness in the emerging governance landscape.

AB  - Fast and nondestructive assessment of leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) is critical for crop growth diagnosis and nitrogen management guidance. In the last decade, multispectral LiDAR (MSL) systems have promoted developments in the earth and ecological sciences with the additional spectral information. With more wavelengths than MSL, the hyperspectral LiDAR (HSL) system provides greater possibilities for remote sensing crop physiological conditions. This study compared the performance of ASD FieldSpec Pro FR, MSL, and HSL for estimating rice (Oryza sativa) LNC. Spectral reflectance and biochemical composition were determined in rice leaves of different cultivars (Yongyou 4949 and Yangliangyou 6) throughout two growing seasons (2014-2015). Results demonstrated that HSL provided the best indicator for predicting rice LNC, yielding a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.74 and a root mean square error of 2.80 mg/g with a support vector machine, similar to the performance of ASD (R-2 = 0.73). Estimation of rice LNC could be significantly improved with the finer spectral resolution of HSL compared with MSL (R-2 = 0.56).

AB  - Understanding soil erosion by water is essential for a range of research areas but the predictive skill of prognostic models has been repeatedly questioned because of scale limitations of empirical data and the high variability of soil loss across space and time scales. Improved understanding of the underlying processes and their interactions are needed to infer scaling properties of soil loss and better inform predictive methods. This study uses data from multiple environments to highlight temporal-scale dependency of soil loss: erosion variability decreases at larger scales but the reduction rate varies with environment. The reduction of variability of the geomorphic response is attributed to a 'compensation effect': temporal alternation of events that exhibit either source-limited or transport-limited regimes. The rate of reduction is related to environment stochasticity and a novel index is derived to reflect the level of variability of intra-and inter-event hydrometeorologic conditions. A higher stochasticity index implies a larger reduction of soil loss variability (enhanced predictability at the aggregated temporal scales) with respect to the mean hydrologic forcing, offering a promising indicator for estimating the degree of uncertainty of erosion assessments.

AB  - Evidence points to the role of the physical environment on patient wellbeing, but its specific contribution is not clear. Two experimental studies were conducted. First, we investigated the inferences people make about the physical environment given information about the social environment, and vice versa. In six conditions, participants were exposed to information about an inadequate, neutral, or good hospital physical environment; or about a negative, neutral, or positive hospital social environment. Results showed that people associate the quality of hospitals' physical and social environments, and the corresponding expected well-being. Study 2 sought to disentangle the independent effect of the physical and social dimensions. Levels of quality of the physical and social environments were crossed in a 3 x 3 between-subjects design. Results showed that both dimensions have a specific significant effect. In particular, the physical environment seems unable to improve satisfaction when its quality is high but is able to reduce satisfaction when its quality is low.

AB  - The dynamics of the endangered population of the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) in the Azov Sea is currently unknown. It can be, however, estimated by stranding analysis. In 1999-2014, the porpoise stranding rates were regularly monitored at the southern coast of the Azov Sea, particularly at the uninhabited abraded coast of the Tarkhan Cape. Specifically, the general trends and annual fluctuations in strandings were compared to the catch reports of the Azov anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), an important prey for porpoises. It was observed that the fluctuations in stranding rates closely correlated with the population dynamics of the anchovy stock. A cosine function, based on the data from 1999-2012, correctly predicted maximum strandings in 2013 and their substantial decline in 2014. The function worked particularly well, when possible biases affecting carcass preservation, such as discovery rate and drift conditions, were reduced. In certain environments and over established time periods, the cetacean stranding rate can be an indicator of population trends. The use of stranding rates as such indicator may be verified by external factors, including the dynamics of prey stocks.

AB  - The composition of the rhizosphere microbiome is a result of interactions between plant roots, soil, and environmental conditions. The impact of genetic variation in plant species on the composition of the root-associated microbiota remains poorly understood. This study assessed the abundances and structures of nitrogen-transforming (ammonia-oxidizing) archaea and bacteria as well as nitrogen-fixing bacteria driven by genetic modification of their maize host plants. The data show that significant changes in the abundances (revealed by quantitative PCR) of ammonia-oxidizing bacterial and archaeal communities occurred as a result of the maize host being genetically modified. In contrast, the structures of the total communities (determined by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) were mainly driven by factors such as soil type and season and not by plant genotype. Thus, the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing bacterial and archaeal communities but not structures of those communities were revealed to be responsive to changes in maize genotype, allowing the suggestion that community abundances should be explored as candidate bioindicators for monitoring the possible impacts of cultivation of genetically modified plants.

AB  - The production of first generation biofuels, such as sunflower-based biodiesel, is potentially an option for diversifying the energy matrix in several South American countries. However, biofuels present environmental challenges, especially concerning the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study, using a life-cycle approach, evaluates the GHG emissions and energy balance of the future nationwide production of sunflower-based biodiesel in Chile. Direct land use change is included in the analysis. The overall findings indicate that sunflower biodiesel, under the most likely production conditions, will have better environmental performance than fossil diesel in terms of both indicators. The agricultural stage is associated to key factors such as land use change, and nitrogen fertilizers. These factors contribute significantly to GHG emissions or energy demand in the biodiesel life cycle. The sensitivity analysis shows that no GHG emission saving could occur if nitrogen fertilizers rate exceeds 330 kg N/ha. In order to reduce the environmental impacts of this biofuel, improvement measures are suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new solid base catalyst containing Ca12Al14O33 and CaO was prepared by chemical synthesis method and was used in the transesterification of rapeseed oil with methanol to produce biodiesel. The catalyst was characterized by Hammett indicators, X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), separately. The effect of various factors was investigated to optimize the reaction conditions. The results showed that the ME (methyl ester) content reached 90% after reacting for 3 h at 65 degrees C, with a methanol/oil molar ratio of 15:1, the amount of catalyst of 6 wt.% and the stirring rate of 270 rpm. Moreover, the catalyst could be used repeatedly for at least 7 cycles with the ME content over 87%, due to its high stability. In particular, this solid base catalyst can be separated from reaction system effectively and easily, as it is insoluble in both methanol and methyl esters, which may provide significant benefits for developing an environmentally benign and continuous process for synthesizing biodiesel.

AB  - Coal and carbonaceous shale samples were collected from two boreholes (BH 94 and BH 120) in Awgu formation of Middle Benue Trough, Nigeria. Source rock potentials of the samples were studied using biomarkers and carbon isotopic composition. Biomarkers in the aliphatic fractions in the samples were studied using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The Carbon isotope analysis of individual n-alkanes in the aliphatic fraction was performed using Gas Chromatography-Combustion-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (GC-IRMS). The abundance of hopanes, homohopanes (C-31-C-35), and C-29 steranes in the samples indicate terrestrial plant, phytoplankton and cyanobacteria contributions to the organic matter that formed the coal. High (Pr/Ph) ratio (3.04-11.07) and isotopic distribution of individual alkanes showed that the samples consisted of mixed terrestrial/marine organic matter deposited under oxic condition in lacustrine-fluvial/deltaic depositional environment. The maturity parameters derived from biomarker distributions showed that the samples are in the main phase of oil window. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, interactions between bacteria possessing either released or cell-associated enzymes for polymer degradation were investigated. For this, a co-culture of Aeromonas hydrophila strain AH-1N as an enzyme-releasing bacterium and of Flavobacterium sp. strain 4D9 as a bacterium with cell-associated enzymes was set up with chitin embedded into agarose beads to account for natural conditions, under which polymers are usually embedded in organic aggregates. In single cultures, strain AH-1N grew with embedded chitin, while strain 4D9 did not. In co-cultures, strain 4D9 grew and outcompeted strain AH-1N in the biofilm fraction. Experiments with cell-free culture supernatants containing the chitinolytic enzymes of strain AH-1N revealed that growth of strain 4D9 in the co-culture was based on intercepting N-acetylglucosamine from chitin degradation. For this, strain 4D9 had to actively integrate into the biofilm of strain AH-1N. This study shows that bacteria using different chitin degradation mechanisms can coexist by formation of a mixed-species biofilm.

AB  - A time-domain topological sensitivity (TS) approach is developed for elastic-wave imaging of media of arbitrary geometry. The TS, which quantifies the sensitivity of the misfit cost functional to the creation at a specified location of an infinitesimal hole, is expressed in terms of the time convolution of the free field and a supplementary adjoint field as a function of that specified location. Following previous studies performed under (mostly) static or time-harmonic conditions, the TS field is here considered as a natural and computationally efficient approach for defining a defect indicator function. This study emphasizes the implementation and exploitation of TS fields using standard displacement-based FEM approaches, a straightforward task once the correct sensitivity formulation is available. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments on 3D and 2D elastodynamic and acoustic configurations is reported, allowing to assess and highlight many features of the proposed TS-based fast qualitative identification such as its ability to identify multiple defects and its robustness against data noise.

AB  - Background: The work. environment of an organization has to do with a set of permanent qualities that are experienced by its members. Aim To assess The work environment perception of faculty members of a Medical School in two different periods (2005 and 2007). Material and methods: A standardized survey was applied to faculty members and Department chairs of the academic units of our Medical School. The survey used the Likert scale from 1 to 5 and included 59 items, distributed in 8 factors Additionally, there were two groups of statements, indicating the priorities for the school and for the academic departments. Results: In the study performed in year 2005, the survey was answered by a total of 399 faculty members (68%) and in Year 2007, it was answered by 408 members (68016). The global climate perception were 66016 and 68016 in 2005 and 2007, respectively (ns). Among the dimensions evaluated, communications (p = 0,62) and physical conditions (p = 0,008) improved in the two years period. Conclusions: The applied instrument was stable and useful for knowing the requirements of the faculty members and for improving the organizational climate (Rev Med Chile 2009; 137: 1427-36).

AB  - The bees of subtribe Euglossina are an important component of neotropical fauna and have greater species diversity in tropical forests than in spits. They play an important role in the pollination of several plant species and are considered good indicators of environmental conditions. From February 2005 to January 2006, a total of 429 specimens belonging to three genera [Euglossa (Latreille), Eulaema (Lepeletier) and Eufriesea (Cockerell)] and 14 species were collected. Eulaema cingulata (Fabricius) (24.5%), Euglossa cordata (L.) (20.5%) and Eufriesea nigrescens (Friese) (19.8%) were the most abundant species, representing 64.8% of all bees collected. Rainfall was the environmental variable with the greatest relative influence on species composition, particularly for some species of Eufriesea. Euglossa cordata and Eg. gaianii Dressler nested in trap nests, suggesting they are resident species. The larger number of individuals and greater richness of species compared with data available in the literature may result from the great variety of plant species found in the areas adjacent to the collection site.

AB  - How can the evolution of multi-specific pastures, as affected by the farming practices, be described, understood and predicted ? A number of experimental lay-outs on permanent pastures at medium altitudes provided some useful data for answering these questions. On five experimental lay-outs, the same tools were compared that are used to characterize the evolution of the fertility and of the vegetation. The variation of the grazing value index and of the number of species were explained by the fertility gradients, combined or not with gradients of perturbation, but only in a descriptive way. The mean values of certain specific characteristics and the abundance of the various functional types of grasses were good indicators of the environmental and management conditions. Moreover they reacted quite rapidly to the changeing management methods and helped to understand the workings of the plant community; they could also be useful for discussing the forage system.

AB  - The reduction of pathogens and indicator organisms through secondary effluent filtration was investigated at six full-scale treatment facilities, ranging in capacity from 0.04 to 1 m(3)/s (1 to 25 mgd). Grab samples were assayed for pathogens (cultivable enteric viruses, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium) and indicator organisms (coliforms, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, and coliphages) quarterly under peak flow conditions from each facility over the course of 1 calendar year. Log(10) removals resulting from filtration averaged 0.3 to 0.8 log(10) for cultivable enteric viruses, 0.4 to 1.5 log(10) for protozoan parasites, 0.01 to 3.7 log(10) for indicator bacteria, and 0.3 to 1.1 log(10) for coliphages. In addition to filter design (cloth, monomedium shallow- or deep-bed, or dual-media filters), differences in reduction of pathogens and indicators could be attributed to the combined effects of hydraulic loading rates, chemical addition practices, backwashing and postbackwashing operating strategies, and the effectiveness of upstream biological treatment and sedimentation.

AB  - This paper describes the development of artificial neural network (ANN) based carbon monoxide (CO) persistence (ANNCOP) models to forecast 8-h average CO concentration using 1-h maximum predicted CO data for the critical (winter) period (November-March). The models have been developed for three 8-h groupings of 10 P.M. to 6 A.M. to 2 P.M. and 2-10 P.M. at two air quality control regions (AQCRs) in Delhi city, representing an urban intersection and an arterial road consisting heterogeneous traffic flows. The result indicates that time grouping of 2-10 PM is dominantly affected by inversion conditions and peak traffic flow. The ANNCOP model corresponding to this grouping predicts the 8-h average CO concentrations within the accuracy range of 68-71%. The CO persistence values derived from ANNCOP model are comparable with the persistence values as suggested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USA. This work demonstrates that ANN based model is capable of describing winter period CO persistence phenomena.

AB  - Background: There are indications that the occurrence of metabolic diseases in children may be conditioned by factors experienced already in the utero. Aim of the study: The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the studies that examined the effects of stress experienced by a pregnant woman on the child's adiposity rates in postnatal life. Methods: The review includes 20 articles published before March 2020 in Scopus and Medline databases with the use of following keyword combinations: /maternal or mother/, /prenatal or pregnant/, /stress or distress/ and /BMI, body mass index or overweight or obesity or body composition/. Results: The results of the research were inconsistent. Nevertheless, most articles confirmed the positive association of prenatal stress with fatness indicators in children. The review raised a question of the role of the methods applied for stress measurement (objective vs. subjective indicators) and adiposity assessment, as well as the time of prenatal exposition to stress. Conclusion: Most studies have proved that prenatal stress is related to the children adiposity in postnatal life.

AB  - Tetracycline (TC) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. In this study, a ratiometric fluorescence (FL) probe was developed to detect TC in water samples using waste printing paper extract as a FL indicator. For this ratiometric probe, the emission of printing paper extract at 436 nm gradually decreased and the emission of a mixed solution at 538 nm significantly increased with the sequential addition of TC upon excitation at 390 nm, coupled with a marked FL colour change from bright blue to faint yellow. Therefore, a ratiometric F-538/F-436 FL probe was created for TC detection by simply mixing the printing paper extraction and TC. Under the optimized conditions, a linear range from 1 to 100 mu M and a detection limit of 0.48 mu M (S/N = 3) for TC were obtained. Importantly, the FL probe can be easily prepared with rapid response, high sensitivity, and good selectivity.

AB  - The research aimed to make a more complex assessment of the current breed status of a new sheep population with very good milk production skills. The population concerned represented the result of research activity to form a new breed with superior skills in milk production. The biological material was represented by a significant number of 1200 females and 58 breeding rams. This herd is part of the living stock and is registered in the Genealogical Register. The data processing was done by methods accepted by the experimental technique. From the data processing, it results that the actual size of the new type population is placed at the level that allows the application of a sustained selection program. For this indicator, the average values show that the new population is evolving very well in other areas, where the pedoclimatic conditions are slightly different from those in the training area. The average value of the actual size varies depending on the holding and the area, from the minimum of 105.88 for the populations outside the training area to 115.16 for the analyzed herd in the training area.

AB  - In this study, components, concentrations, distribution characteristics and sources of low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) in seawater of the Changjiang Estuary and its adjacent East China Sea were investigated in March 2015. Lactic, acetic and formic acids were identified with their concentration range of 0-16.7, 0-42.7 and 0-6.7 mu mol.L-1, respectively. In the surface seawater, high concentrations of LMWOAs appeared in the sea area close to the estuary and along the coast. LMWOAs were important fractions of dissolved organic carbon and acetic acid was dominant component of LMWOAs. Riverine, terrestrial input, phytoplankton and sediment release were important sources for the LMWOAs, and human activities were considered as dominant sources for them in sampling period. The consistency of regions with high concentrations of LMWOAs, eutrophication, seasonal hypoxia and frequent red tide occurrence suggested LMWOAs as potential indicators for evaluating pollution status in coastal areas.

KW  - CIVIL CONFLICT
AB  - Is it possible to reverse the resource curse through institutional reform? Evidence suggests that there is a negative relationship between abundance of natural resources and economic growth, political stability, democracy, and peace. However, evidence illustrating how institutional reform can reverse this situation is scarce. In this paper, we exploit a component of an institutional reform that modified the allocation rule of oil royalties in Colombia and evaluate a set of effects of this reform on the living standards of Colombian households. Using international variations in the price of oil for identification, we find that the reform had important effects on several household welfare indicators. We find positive impacts on important dimensions, such as reductions in multidimensional poverty and improvements on income, employment, housing conditions, health, and education, among others. Results are mixed or null in other outcomes, such as formality or employment in the service sector. Importantly, we find no effects on monetary poverty but larger income effects for rich and urban households. We test for the different channels boosting these effects and provide tentative evidence that supports the role of fiscal and administrative capacity mechanisms. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Online product reviews are an important driver of customers' purchasing behavior. Fake reviews seriously mislead consumers, challenging the fairness of the online shopping environment. Although the detection of fake reviews has progressed, several problems remain. First, fake comment recognition ignores the correlation between time and the semantics of the comment texts, which is always hidden in the context of the reviews. Second, the impact of multi-source information on fake comment recognition is not considered, as it constitutes a complex, high-dimensional, heterogeneous relationship between reviewers, reviews, stores and commodities. To overcome these problems, the present paper proposes a dynamic knowledge graph-based method for fake-review detection. Based on the characteristics of online product reviews, it first extracts four types of entities using a developed neural network model called sentence vector/twin-word embedding conditioned bidirectional long short-term memory. Time series related features are then added to the knowledge graph construction process, forming dynamic graph networks. To enhance the fake-review detection, four indicators are newly defined for determining the relationships among the four types of nodes. In experimental evaluations, our method surpassed the state-of-the-art results.

AB  - Pastoral areas around the world, including South Africa, are resource poor and external development interventions to improve conditions have largely been unsuccessful. It has been advocated that the focus should shift from external stakeholders to local pastoralists by incorporating the latter's landscape ethno-ecological knowledge (LEEK) in future management and policy planning. Through the use of participatory methodologies, this study gazed through the lens of Namaqualand herders in South Africa to reflect their specific local needs and what they consider important in their grazing landscape. It highlights that individual pastoralists' LEEK and management strategies vary but that all are able to read the signs in the rangeland through various plant, animal and soil indicators. As such, pastoralists systematically plan their grazing routes based on the temporal palatability of plants to allow their animals access to a diverse and nutritious diet. The braiding of LEEK into modern science would provide development agencies with the necessary insight into pastoral systems and a platform for planning and policy development.

AB  - Ergosterol is a sterol found ubiquitously in cell membranes of filamentous fungi. Although concentrations in different fungal species span the range of 2.6 to 42 mu g/mL of dry mass, many studies have shown a strong correlation between soil ergosterol content and fungal biomass. The analysis of ergosterol in soil therefore could be an effective tool for monitoring changes in fungal biomass under different environmental conditions. Stir Bar Sorptive Extraction (SBSE) is a new sample preparation method to extract and concentrate organic analytes from liquid samples. SBSE was here demonstrated to be a simple, fast, and cost effective method for the quantitative analysis of ergosterol from field-collected soils. Using this method we observed that soil ergosterol as a measure of fungal biomass proved to be a sensitive indicator of soil microbial dynamics that were altered by changes in plant detrital inputs to soils in a long-term field experiment.

AB  - In economic science, economic growth represented a prime topic because by solving the problems in this area it was hoped to achieve the strengthening of the state and increase of its wealth and welfare. All this led to the establishment in the economic field, of an important segment of research, namely, the theory of economic growth that is required to develop rules for optimal use of limited resources, as well as means of achieving nation's welfare. As in other sectors of the national economy, a series of indicators are present in agriculture that directs the economic growth of the sector, but that can not be monitored in order to ensure a stable economic growth. The state can control such factors as the volume of investments in agriculture, subsidies, customs duties on agricultural products and bank interest, while parameters of external agricultural markets and climatic natural conditions can neither be controlled nor directed by the authorities. But in spite of this, there are a number of important factors by which the state can contribute to the economic growth of the agricultural sector and the country as a whole.

AB  - The membrane electro-bioreactor (MEBR) is a novel technology, it treats wastewater by combining membrane filtration, electrokinetic phenomena, and biological processes in one reactor. This paper aims to deal with hard biodegradation and high concentration phenol wastewater. Investigating the influence factors such as initial concentration, voltage, pH value, temperature and mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) toward phenol degradation process in electrocatalytic process and membrane bioreactor (MBR), and then apply the optimum conditions in the MEBR system. Results of continuous flow experiments demonstrated that MEBR increased the quality of the treated wastewater than conventional MBR. The above technics followed the zero-order reaction kinetics. The removal efficiency of MEBR was about 11.1% higher for phenol than the sum of the two individual processes. With the help of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS), this qualitative analysis looks at the degradation products of phenol generated in MEBR, through which 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-benzoquinone was confirmed as the main degradation product.

AB  - The species richness of epiphytic lichens is continuously decreasing by degradation and loss of habitat. Considering that taxonomic identification of all species is time and resource consuming, rapid assessment methods to extrapolate the total number of species are needed for practical conservation. This paper describes an alternative method using the correlation between lichens growth forms and species richness. The study was conducted in 406 forest stands located in Central Spain, covering a wide range of mediterranean-climate ecosystem regions, management intensity levels, canopy cover conditions, and tree sizes. The presence/absence of epiphytic lichens was determined in 6090 trees, which were dominated by oak species (Quercus ilex, Q, faginea, and Q. pyrenaica). In all type of forests, the diversity of growth forms was positively correlated with the total epiphytic lichen richness. In all cases, species richness increased in non-managed forest stands with dense canopies. Thus, we propose the use of lichen growth forms as a helpful surrogate of species richness to detect potentially conservation priority areas in the Mediterranean region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The relevant data include normal alkane and acyclic isoprenoids distributions, terpane and sterane aliphatic biomarkers and distribution of the aromatic biomarkers naphthalenes, phenanthrenes, dibenzothiophene and methyldibenzothiophenes. The Kurdistan's oils characterized by low Pr/Ph ratio (<1.0), a relatively high C-35 homohopane index, high C-27 regular steranes abundance, the presence of tricyclic terpanes and relatively high dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene ratios. These data indicated that the oils were derived from a carbonate source rock contain a mixture of aquatic (algal and bacterial) organic matter with a minor terrigenous organic matter contribution that were deposited in a marine environment under highly reducing conditions and generated at low maturity. The biomarker characteristics also suggest that the oils were derived from the Upper Jurassic-Early Cretaceous age Chia Gara carbonates.

AB  - Epiphytaceans occur in Late Jurassic shallow-marine reef limestones at several localities in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. These calcified dendritic microfossils are well-preserved in sparry calcite as sub-millimetric radial clusters of narrow well-defined filaments, 10-30 pm in diameter that show dichotomous branching and consist of dense dark micrite, locally with tubiform structure. Epiphytaceans are widely interpreted as photosynthetic algae or bacteria, but their precise affinities remain elusive and the group may be heterogeneous. These Late Jurassic examples most closely resemble Cambrian Tubomorphophyton and Late Devonian Paraepiphyton. We interpret them to be calcified cyanobacterial sheaths. Post-Devonian records of epiphytaceans are extremely scarce. The Kimmeridgian-Tithonian specimens reported here represent one of the youngest known occurrences of epiphytaceans. Their highly sporadic geological distribution resembles that of marine calcified cyanobacteria, which show Phanerozoic abundance peaks in the Early Paleozoic, Late Devonian-Mississippian, and Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous. We propose that Kimmeridgian-Tithonian epiphytacean cyanobacteria reflect environmental conditions that favored bioinduced calcification, in particular elevated seawater carbonate saturation state.

AB  - A techno-economic analysis for use of brewer's spent grains (BSG) on a biorefinery concept for the Brazilian case is presented. Four scenarios based on different levels of heat and mass integration for the production of xylitol, lactic acid, activated carbon and phenolic acids are shown. A simulation procedure using the software Aspen Plus and experimental yields was used. Such procedure served as basis for the techno-economic and environmental assessment according to the Brazilian conditions. Full mass integration on water and full energy integration was the configuration with the best economic and environmental performance. For this case, the obtained economic margin was 62.25%, the potential environmental impact was 0.012 PEI/kg products, and the carbon footprint of the processing stage represented 0.96 kg CO2-e/kg of BSG. This result served as basis to draw recommendations on the technological, economic and environmental feasibility for implementation of such type of biorefinery in Brazil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A simple, convenient and accurate reductimetric titration method has been developed for the determination of nitrite employing iron(II) as a reductant in buffer medium of pH 1.5-2.0 and in presence of 0.06 M sodium oxalate, using methylene blue as a redox indicator. Nitrite in the range of 3.0-12.0 mg has been determined with an accuracy of +/- 0.6 % by the method. The precision of the method has been I determined by computing the pooled standard deviation and 95 % confidence limits. In this procedure, nitrite ion is reduced to nitric oxide (NO) by iron(II) in one electron reduction step. The redox reaction has been explained based on the formal redox potential of iron system (iron(III)/iron(II) couple) observed in buffer-oxalate medium. The nature of the species expected to be formed between iron(111) and oxalate under the optimum titration conditions of the medium (pH range.1.5-2.0 oxalate concentration about 0.06 M) have been proposed using a computer programming known as SIMUL. The interference due to diverse ions has been studied.

AB  - Plant communities of semidesert, mountain steppe and alpine vegetation are described in terms of distribution and edaphic conditions along an elevation gradient from the Great Lake Basin to the Central Mongolian Altai in Western Mongolia. References to the Russian classification terminology of corresponding vegetation belts are included. Two new associations and further subassociations are also introduced. The impact of grazing on the presented communities is analysed in a comparable approach along the elevation gradient of decreasing aridity. While no obvious grazing response was detectable in the semidesert vegetation, mountainous vegetation revealed grazing-mediated communities characterised by survivors of the original associations and grazing indicators, by grazing-induced xerophytisation of the vegetation cover and an increasing spatial extent of grazing impact with rising elevations. Evolutionary history reflecting the adaptation of arid and semi-arid ecosystems to grazing and the effective adaptation of management practices to the phenology patterns of vegetation are proposed as important factors of limited grazing impact on arid semidesert vegetation of the study area.

AB  - The sustainable use of land constitutes a growing concern for different managements and inappropriate agricultural practices. Despite the expansion of scientific knowledge on soil it appears that the use of indicators to estimate their quality, independently does not allow a proper evaluation for the diagnosis of imbalances in production systems. This research aimed to diagnose changes on important physical and microbiological indicators in a dystrophic Red-Yellow (Oxissol) under extensive grazing conditions and native vegetation in the Brazilian Pantanal. The results showed significant deterioration in physical and microbiological environment anthropized with average reductions in indicators of 51.62%, 10.30%, 16.36%, for microbial carbon, basal respiration, percentage of wet aggregates, respectively, and increases for soil density, soil resistance to penetration, metabolic quotient of 184.68%, 142.18%, 88.31%, respectively. By inserting these results in a Qualigram allowed to obtain a quantitative index of soil quality under extensive grazing equal to -0.0814. Based on this index has qualified sustainable management of cumulative effects on pasture as a "system under collapse" compared to the native environment.

AB  - The effect of synthetic water-soluble polymers on the reactions of hydroquinone or 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine periodate oxidation with hydrogen peroxide is studied. A polymer solution was introduced into the reaction and a change in its rate was detected by photometry. Possible reasons for the effect of polymers are discussed, the role of the positive and negative charges of the polymeric chain and the nature of the indicator reaction are considered. The possibility of determining polyelectrolytes by their accelerating and inhibiting effect is demonstrated, including that, under the conditions of polyelectrolyte complex formation, and also by binding with a metal ion catalyzing the indicator reaction. Procedures are proposed for the simple and rapid determination of 3,6-ionene, polyanetholesulfonic acid, polyhexamethyleneguanidine (similar to 10(-5) to 10(-4) M, in terms of the monomer), polyethyleneimine and chitosans (similar to 10(-7)-10(-6) M in terms of the monomer) in aqueous solutions, and also of polyethyleneimine by carrying out the indicator reaction on a silica surface (4 x 10(-6) to 0.7 M in terms of the monomer).

AB  - Dilution and autodepuration processes in an estuary of strong tidal regimen affected by sewage from a wastewater treatment plant have been studied and identified. To differentiate between both processes, three evaluations were made during different seasons. Two tests were developed in parallel during each evaluation: characterization of the estuary and microcosm trials. In both tests, the evolution of diverse microbiological and physicochemical parameters were examined. From the microbiological results, T-90 for the faecal coliform (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS) bacterial groups were obtained. In the estuary, dilution was identified as the most important microorganism reduction process, with T-90 of 12.2-40.8 and 11.7-53.5 minutes for FC and FS, respectively. In the microcosm trials, salinity was the main autodepuration factor, with T-90 of 3.1-42.6 and 4.6-54.8 hours for FC and FS, respectively. The FC group proved to be the most sensitive bacteria to autodepuration processes and FS the most adaptable to the adverse conditions of the aquatic environment.

AB  - Multi-source data consisting of 1999 Landsat satellite imagery; topographic descriptors derived from DEMs, and GIS-based vegetation inventory information have been used to generate a detailed landcover classification map to quantify and analyze the spatial distribution and configuration of grizzly bear habitat within the Alberta Yellowhead Ecosystem study area. The map is needed as part of a larger ecosystem assessment to help determine if bear movement and habitat use patterns are affected by changing landscape conditions and human activities. An Integrated Decision Tree Approach (IDTA) was developed that incorporated unsupervised (K-means) clustering, empirically-derived DEM- and GIS-based decision rules (proximity; slopes, etc.), and maximum likelihood supervised classification of forest and vegetation classes based on field sampling. This approach was based on an earlier finding, using a 1998 Landsat image in this area, that different classifiers performed at different levels of success in various classes. The map produced with the IDTA method was determined to be approximately 80% accurate (kappa = 0.783) using 494 randomly sampled points unambiguously identified on available digital orthophotography.

AB  - Commercial forest plantations have become a competitive alternative to harvesting natural forests in many parts of the world, especially in the tropics and sub-tropics. More research about tree farm site selection is needed, and one of the major considerations of site selection is the site's productivity. The purpose of this research was to explore the soil factors that are indicators of site productivity.
   A study was conducted in a dry tropical region of western Venezuela on Gmelina arborea, Eucalyptus urophylla, and Eucalyptus grandis plantations to identify the soil properties that provide optimum growing conditions for these species. Results of a multiple regression analysis indicated that soil texture was a significant predictor of tree growth for all three species. All species grew best in soils with clay loam textures. Excessive soil moisture was inversely correlated with tree growth in Eucalyptus grandis. As commercial forestry companies in western Venezuela expand their land holdings through new acquisitions, this knowledge will improve their ability to select land parcels that are economically optimal for plantation purposes.

AB  - The paper examines how a re-engineering approach can benefit irrigation management and canal operations and, hence, how the current, acute challenges to water management (e.g. competition, multiple users and protection of the environment) can be addressed. By comparing the irrigation and the industrial sectors, a re-engineering process includes re-thinking all the processes involved in irrigation management. Commonly held assumptions are questioned, re-validated or rejected depending on local conditions. As an example, the implicit assumption of homogeneity (service-physical charactcristics-...) should be screened and rejected unless proved to be true.
   It is argued here that a strengthening of the notion of service should be a key aspect of reengineering for irrigation management. For canal operations, the approach should focus on an improved physical assessment of the infrastructure. It is proposed, to that end, to use an approach based on sensitivity indicators, which allows a better understanding of the canal behaviour under expected or unexpected perturbations. Finally, it is proposed that the service-operations interface be redesigned to include more appropriate allocation of operational effort targeting the most demanding areas.

AB  - In order to study the long-term effect of climatic conditions on organic matter decomposition, the difference in the mass loss rate of organic substrates was examined along the altitudinal temperature gradient (1500-2400 m) of Mt. Fuji, Japan. Two standard substrates, cellulose filter paper and wood chips of beech (Fagus crenata), were placed in the L and FH layers at each altitude. The mass loss rates tended to be smaller with increasing altitude and were significantly correlated with the annual mean air temperature in a log-linear fashion. The temperature dependence of the mass loss rates was much larger than that of microbial respiration. The initial increase in ergosterol content (an indicator of fungal biomass) of organic substrates was mon rapid at low altitudes than at higher altitudes. The effects of fungal biomass and freezing temperatures on the temperature dependence of decomposition were examined using a simple simulation model, The results suggest that the effects of temperature increase on decomposition could be much larger than these estimated from the temperature-microbial respiration curves.

AB  - A combined strontium isotopic (Sr-87/Sr-86) and paleontological method is newly applied to a modern lagoon in Egypt's Nile River delta to test its applicability as a paleosalinity proxy. Analyses of 22 surficial samples collected throughout the lagoon include 81 Sr isotopic analyses of mollusks, foraminifera, ostracods, barnacles, bryozoans, serpulid worm tubes, pore water, and gypsum crystals. Two salinity groups are distinguished in each sample: a lower salinity group (similar to 1 ppt) mixed with a higher salinity group (similar to 3-10 ppt) that, respectively, are interpreted as the modern biocoenosis and an older relict fauna. The relict fauna denotes higher salinity conditions in the lagoon prior to closure of the Aswan High Dam (1964), and the modern fauna records freshening of the lagoon. Recent decreased salinity is a response to regulated Nile River flow and increased discharge into Manzala of fresh water via canals and drains. Quantification of this short-term salinity change holds promise for study of modern lagoons in other world settings, and may provide paleoclimatic information for older lagoon sequences in the Nile River delta and the geologic record.

AB  - Featured Application A potential application of the proposed topic considers the opportunity of agro-industrial waste valorization to reduce its environmental impact. The designed approach opens the possibility of improving specific indicators of the wastewaters from hemp-retting processing. The present investigation focuses on a possible alternative to reduce grape pomace's negative impact on the environment by exploiting its capacities for wastewater remediation. Therefore, three directions are followed: (1) the characterization of white grape byproducts' antioxidant and antiradical properties; (2) the determination of organophosphorus compound concentration that might be present in the samples; and (3) the evaluation of the possible use for wastewater remediation. The grape pomace was used for obtaining different extracts considering different extraction conditions. The hydroalcoholic extracts have an increased amount of total phenolic content. The lyophilized hydroalcoholic extract showed high total phenolic content (159.52 mg/100 g) and low organophosphorus content (0.257 +/- 0.015 nmol). The lowest DPPH antiradical-scavenging activities were obtained for the extracts in ethanol obtained from refrigerated pomace (0.055) and for dried pomace (0.045).

AB  - The occurrence of hydrological drought, caused by rainfall deficiency, poses a threat to forest areas-not only due to the danger of fire, but as a result of changes in habitat conditions. It is predicted that more frequent periods of drought and high temperatures will reduce the stability of forests and increase their susceptibility to industrial pollution, pressure from insect pests, fungal pathogens, and fires. The main aim of this study was to investigate the current streamflow droughts in the catchment area of the Narewka River as an indicator of hydrological droughts in the Bialowieza Primeval Forest for the period 1951-2020. The research presented in this paper shows that low flows of surface waters have appeared as an indicator of hydrological droughts almost every year since 1983. The analysis of the trend over the past 70 years shows that the aggregated annual volumes of low flows and the number of days with low flows are increasing significantly. This indicates a significant and relatively permanent change in the seasonal structure of the river runoff in the event of low summer flow.

AB  - center dot This study presents research on the components of grounding systems, against corrosion, in the field of construction, focusing this research on the coppery joints. This protection or grounding system consists of a direct electrical connection, without the use of protections, from part of the electrical circuit to a grounding with one or more electrodes buried in the ground. Thus, this study was conducted analyzing how the level of condition varied according to the aggressive environments to which they were subjected, the type of jointing of the electrodes and their component materials. For the realization of this objective, different laboratory tests were completed to know in a practical way the internal level of corrosion of the samples. The evolution of electrical resistance in each witness was studied and a metallographic analysis was performed to directly observe through the microscope the effect of corrosion on the coppery joints. It has been possible to analyze the corrosion behavior of flange joints in grounding systems taking into account their component materials of each type of component material taking into account different environments where they may be installed.

AB  - Damage detection of civil engineering structures needs to consider the effect of normal environmental variations on structural dynamic properties. This study develops a novel structural damage detection method using factor analysis in the sparse Bayesian learning framework. The unknown changing environmental factors that affect the structural dynamic properties are treated as latent variables in the model. The automatic relevance determination prior is adopted for the factor loading matrix for model selection. All variables and parameters, including the factor loading matrix, error vector and latent variables, are solved using the iterative expectation-maximization technique. The variables are then used to reconstruct structural responses. The Euclidean norm of the error vector is calculated as the damage indicator to detect possible damage when limited vibration data are available. Two laboratory-tested examples are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that the number of underlying environmental factors and structural damage can be accurately identified, even though the changing environmental data are unavailable. The proposed method has the advantages of online monitoring and automatic identification of underlying environmental factors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Small mammals such as rodents can to carry zoonotic pathogens. Currently, there is impaired knowledge on zoonotic pathogens in rodents and insectivores in the Netherlands. This limits opportunities for preventive measures and complicates risk-assessments for zoonotic transmission to humans.Leptospiraspp. andToxoplasma gondiiare present on a list of prioritized emerging pathogens in the Netherlands and were therefore the focus of this study. Both pathogens have the ability to survive under moist environmental conditions. In total, a group of 379 small mammals (rodents & insectivores) were tested on pathogenicLeptospiraspp., and 312 onT. gondii. Rodents and insectivores were trapped at various sites, but mostly on pig and dairy farms throughout the country. Over five percent of the animals (5.3%,n = 379) tested positive forLeptospiraDNA, and five of the animals (1.6%,n = 312) tested were positive forT. gondiiDNA. The animals positive forT.gondiiwere all brown rats and the ones forLeptospiraspp. were various species. Our results show that insectivores and rodents might be used as an indicator for the environmental contamination and/or the contamination in wildlife forLeptospiraspp.

AB  - Growing metropolitan areas bring rapid urbanization and air pollution problems. As diseases and mortality rates increase because of the air pollution problem, it becomes a necessity to estimate the air pollution density and inform the public to protect the health. Air pollution problem displays contextual characteristics such as meteorological conditions, industrial and technological developments, traffic problem etc. that change from country to country and also from city to city. In this study, we determined PM10 as the target pollutant and designed a new deep learning based air quality forecasting model, namely DFS (Deep Flexible Sequential). Our study uses real world hourly data from Istanbul, Turkey between 2014 and 2018 to forecast the air pollution 4, 12, and 24 hours before. DFS model is a hybrid & flexible deep model including Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The proposed model also is capable of generalization with standard and flexible Dropout layers. Through flexible Dropout layer, the model also obtains flexibility to adapt changing window sizes in sequential modelling. Moreover, this model can be applied to other air pollution time series data problems with small modifications on parameters by taking into account the nature of the data set.

AB  - Technologies for route planning, automated vehicle localization, and real-time vehicle monitoring (maintenance indicators, consumption, etc.) have been developed, as well as tools for reducing the fuel consumption and gas emission. Transport companies and insurance companies use vehicle sensors for monitoring the speed, driving time, and other variables (hard braking, lateral acceleration, etc.), but these are insufficient for indicating the safety margin under all operating conditions. For example, when driving in a curve, the safety margin will be more or less away from the vehicle yaw limits depending on several factors like the speed, the mass distribution or the road friction coefficient, which can change abruptly. Herein, we propose a methodology and define an objective metric for monitoring the safety level during driving, providing a tool for driver evaluation from a safety standpoint. The methodology evaluates the driver behaviour during driving and is based on the fundamentals of the safety controls implemented in existing vehicles. This methodology can be applied to classify the driver skills and reduced the crashes between vehicles, even, avoid hazardous situations by the interaction between vehicle and environment, thus improved the road safety.

AB  - Bat remains are useful for palaeoecological reconstructions, they provide independent information on palaeoenvironment and are good indicators for hypogean microclimates. Nine taxa of Chiroptera divided into three families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae and Miniopteridae) and four genera (Rhinolophus, Myotis, Plecotus and Miniopterus) were discovered in three fossil assemblages from the Grotta dei Pipistrelli, in Sicily, a key region for an understanding of Quaternary climates and environments. Bat remains were deposited during three distinct timespans: one late Pleistocene, MIS 2, around the Last Glacial Maximum, and two Holocene, both referable to the Atlantic chronozone. The presence of yearlings, adult and old individuals suggests hibernating colonies, but the cave was also utilized as a nursery. The diversity of taxa indicates a composite landscape with prevailing vegetation cover and relatively warm climatic conditions. The percentage variations of the frequencies of the recognized taxa suggest a progressive increase of open spaces in the middle Holocene. (C) 2019 Academie des sciences.

   The aim of the conducted research was to assess efficiency of sewage treatment in rural areas in a sewage treatment plant with a sequencing batch reactor (SBR).
   Materials and methods
   Assessment of effectiveness of wastewater disposal in a treatment plant was carried out using elements of reliability theory. Research covered a period from March 2014 to December 2015. The content of pollution indicators in treated wastewater was compared with limit values included in the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of November 18, 2014. Reliability analysis was performed for the following pollution indicators: BOD5, CODCr and total suspended solids. Reliability coefficient RF was assumed as a basis for reliability calculations. Next, technological treatment efficiency index (P-so) was calculated.
   Results and conclusions
   An analysis of treated wastewater in relation to three tested parameters proved that the treatment plant works properly. Limit values of examined indicators - included in the Regulation (Dz. U. 2014 poz. 1800) - have not been exceeded. Also, all the analysed parameters have shown high percentage of pollutant reduction, ranging between 96% for CODCr and 99% for BOD5. Obtained values of reliability indicators for the analysed treatment plant confirm its good condition.

AB  - Can different courtyards influence the quality of life of the local residents in different ways? This study focuses on the comparison of the courtyards in closed urban blocks from the 19th century, the courtyards in the socialist open prefab housing estates and the courtyards in the post-socialist housing development. The analysed courtyards are located in the Central European city of Brno, Czech Republic. The study analyses the satisfaction of the residents living around the courtyards with the social and environmental qualities of the courtyards. The satisfaction which subjectively reflects the quality of life was expressed by the residents in a questionnaire survey. The social parameters of the residents' communities were verified by the demographic data to identify the different demographic conditions. The results imply that a considerable impact on the quality of life should be ascribed to the courtyards in closed urban blocks. The research generated a secondary result too: the analysed buildings and courtyards in the socialist housing estates don't belong to the socially declining areas.

AB  - Fluctuations of environmental factors in intertidal habitats can disrupt the trophic balance of mixotrophic cnidarians. We investigated the effect of tidal environments (subtidal, tidal pools and emerged areas) on fatty acid (FA) content of Zoanthus sociatus and Siderastrea stellata. Effect on photophysiology was also accessed as an autotrophy proxy. There was a general tendency of a lower percentage of zooplankton-associated FAs in colonies from emerged areas or tidal pools when compared with colonies from the subtidal environment. Moreover, tidal environment significantly affected the photophysiology of both species. Colonies from the subtidal generally showed lower values of a, ETRmax and E-k when compared with their conspecifics from tidal pools or emerged areas. However, the absence of consistent patterns in F-v/F-m and in dinoflagellate-associated FAs, suggest that these corals are well adapted to intertidal conditions. This suggests that intertidal pressures may disturb the trophic balance, mainly by affecting heterotrophy of these species.

AB  - Domestic pigs and Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) share several important viral and bacterial pathogens. Therefore, direct and indirect contacts between domestic pigs and wild boar present a risk of pathogen spillover and can lead to long-term perpetuation of infection. Biological indicators could be a powerful tool to understand and characterize contacts between wild boar and domestic pigs. Here, faecal Escherichia coli and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) were explored as potential biological indicators under experimental conditions. The data gained in our pilot study suggest that faecal E. coli can be used as biological indicator of contact between wild boar and domestic pig. For HEV, faecal transmission was also confirmed. However, molecular studies on full-genome basis did not reveal markers that would allow tracing of transmission direction. Based on these promising results, future field studies will especially target the practicability of E. coli microbiome molecular typing as surrogate of contacts at the wildlife-livestock interface.

AB  - Recently, various researches have focused on the environmental condition assessment of oxbow lakes along rivers. In this study we investigated the bed morphology, conductivity and the changes of macro- and microelements in the oxbow, named Kacsa-to, that was formed by the 45th cutoff on Tisza River, then the results were plotted using GIS softwares. Our aim was to examine the specific electric conductivity and its spatial pattern at the end of the spring flood at 2013. We analyzed water samples collected by a stratified sampling system so as to conclude the extent of overturning. The inflow from the flood resulted lower conductivity values at the extensive SE part than at the distant NW part. Initially the fresh water supply from the flood does not reach the distant parts; thus, the overturning takes place more slowly so the water body replacement of the oxbow occurs constantly. Our results show that at the beginning of the flood the oxbow could be divided into two distinct heterogeneous parts. Based on the conductivity values at time of the measurement, we found that the overturning is not yet complete.

AB  - Salinity-related stratification in marine environments is one of the main drivers for the development of persistent anoxia and euxinia. It therefore plays a vital role in the sedimentary preservation of organic matter and has also been associated with Oceanic Anoxic Events during several mass extinctions in Earth's history.
   Here we present a novel molecular proxy using relative abundances of methyltrimethyltridecylchromans (MTTCs) as indicators of riverine freshwater incursions into Middle to Late Devonian paleoreefs exposed to conditions of prevailing anoxia, photic zone euxinia and water column stratification. This paper aims at re-instigating a discussion about the origin of these compounds to potentially broaden their utilization as paleoproxies, adding freshwater stratification to the general salinity reconstructions. The co-variation of MTTC abundance profiles and delta C-13 values with other biomarker parameters in the sediments studied here indicate a link of MTTCs to terrigenous input, pointing towards a previously suggested early diagenetic formation of these compounds from phytol with higher plant-derived alkylphenols.

AB  - Rallids are good biological models to monitor anthropogenic changes to wetlands. The distribution of the Rallidae was mapped up during a survey of all major wetlands across Algeria and nest site selection, phenology, and breeding parameters of the Purple Swamp-Hen Porphyrio porphyrio were monitored at two distinct sites under contrasting conditions. Data were collected at Boussedra, an unprotected freshwater marsh during the years 2005 and 2008, and at Lake Tonga, a protected freshwater marsh during 2009. The onset of egg-laying was found to occur earlier (mid-February) than was recorded previously (end-March). There was much variation in the egg laying patterns and in the clutch sizes which dropped significantly from 5.8 +/- A 0.9 (Boussedra 2009) to 3.4 +/- A 0.9 (Boussedra 2008) and 3.9 +/- A 1.0 (Tonga 2009). This study, the first investigation of the ecology and conservation of the Purple Swamp-Hen in North Africa, suggests a decline in breeding success associated with steady habitat loss and ineffective enforcement of legislation.

AB  - Seawater desalination plants, especially those in Saudi Arabia, require the disposal of useless posttreatment brine-generally about 50% of the volume of seawater processed by such plants designed to make freshwater. This article focuses on the sustainability of the brine disposal process. A proper decision about the brine disposal method must take into account technical, environmental, and economic constraints. Brine disposal by submerged pipes is considered here; the case of desalination plants in Saudi Arabia on the Red Sea shore is considered as an example. The central concept is the available head at the discharge point. Higher values of the available head ensure larger jet dispersion lengths and better conditions for submarine brine dilution. We assessed the quality of the dilution process by calculating the Froude number of the brine discharge jet, whose optimum values are between 20 to 25. Using the Froude number allows us to find the optimum pipe length and the optimum depth of the discharge point for a sustainable brine disposal. Comments concerning the cost of the submerged pipes are presented.

AB  - An integrated methodology for eutrophication assessment, which integrates both water quality indicators (causative factors) and ecological response indicators (effect factors), is described. It is then applied to rank the eutrophication status of the years 2007 and 2008 in the southwest Bohai Sea. The assessment model identified that north Bohai Bay and west Laizhou Bay were the two areas with the most serious eutrophication problems in the southwest Bohai Sea. In addition, compared to that in the west Laizhou Bay, the eutrophication conditions in the north Bohai Bay was more serious in both years. Eutrophication problems such as harmful algal blooms (HABs) and low dissolved oxygen (DO) events in north Bohai Bay were frequent. The integrated method outmatched the currently used Chinese nutrient index method by definitely identifying areas with the most serious eutrophication problems, while the nutrient index method gave ambiguous results between the two years. Inclusion of both causative factors and effect factors, combining concentration, spatial coverage and frequency of indicators, as well as use of multi-season monitoring datasets in the methodology result in a more accurate, representative and useful assessment.

AB  - The importance of the phenological development of weeds has been frequently ignored when analyzing plant-herbicide tolerance or resistance, what may result on divergences between theoretical research and practical data application. Thus, this work was carried out to evaluate the biological response of Bengal dayflower (Commelina benghalensis), comparatively to alexandergrass (Brachiaria plantaginea), to the application of different rates of glyphosate, at six phenological stages. Two experiments were developed under greenhouse conditions, with Bengal dayflower and alexandergrass plants being submitted to a 9 x 6 factorial scheme, where nine treatments were the glyphosate rates and six, the weed phenological stages, varying between unfolding of the first true leaf and the beginning of flowering. Using dose-response curves and polynomial regressions, it could be concluded that the Bengal dayflower phenological stages significantly contribute to the species' degree of glyphosate-tolerance, since, compared to alexandergrass, Bengal dayflower plants became four times more tolerant to glyphosate at every ten units of phenological development at the BBCH scale. These considerations have an important practical applicability, justifying chemical control measurements at the initial growth stages of Bengal dayflower.

AB  - Models explaining behavioural syndromes often focus on state-dependency, linking behavioural variation to individual differences in other phenotypic features. Empirical studies are, however, rare. Here, we tested for a size and growth-dependent stable behavioural syndrome in the juvenile-stages of a solitary apex predator ( pike, Esox lucius), shown as repeatable foraging behaviour across risk. Pike swimming activity, latency to prey attack, number of successful and unsuccessful prey attacks was measured during the presence/absence of visual contact with a competitor or predator. Foraging behaviour across risks was considered an appropriate indicator of boldness in this solitary predator where a trade-off between foraging behaviour and threat avoidance has been reported. Support was found for a behavioural syndrome, where the rank order differences in the foraging behaviour between individuals were maintained across time and risk situation. However, individual behaviour was independent of body size and growth in conditions of high food availability, showing no evidence to support the state-dependent personality hypothesis. The importance of a combination of spatial and temporal environmental variation for generating growth differences is highlighted.

AB  - In the light of the agricultural development, microbiological products have increasing significance, since it is possible to improve soil fertility and tolerance of cultivated crops, and the use of chemical fertilizer can be reduced.
   The efficiency of natural foliar fertilizers was examined in a three-year long analysis (2006-2008) in the southern production area of Hajduszoboszlo on meadow chernozem soil. During the examinations, the primary question was whether the foliar fertilizers Natur Vita (Chlorella vulgaris and Spirulina platensis), Natur Plasma (Chlorella spp.), and Amalgerol Premium (alginate, mannitol, laminarin etc.) provide further yield increase on top of basic fertilisation in maize population and stubble field treatments. The efficiency of products was tested in hybrid seed production, and the examinations were extended to potato production, too.
   During the statistical evaluation of the research results, it was established that the use of the tested foliar fertilizers improve the vital conditions of the hybrid seed production. Depending on the applied treatment, foliar fertilizers provide further yield increase on top of basic fertilization, and their combined use does not result in significantly higher yield than in the case of applying products individually.

AB  - Adequate nutrient supply is one of the main abiotic factors of acceptable plant production. According to the requirements of sustainable agriculture the plant-cultivation applies adequate tools and matters in the given environmental capability beside the environmental protection in such a manner that it would give a profit for the agriculture. Application of chemicals, such as fertilizers may cause some problem for the environment. Abiotic stress, such as toxic elements, unconformable nutrient supply, may affect the operation of photosynthetic mechanisms. Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters make it possible to evaluate the plant's photosynthetic performance and the extent of its tolerance to environmental stress. The aim of work was to investigate the relationship between different nutrient supply and some chlorophyll-fluorescence parameters in the case of corn and sunflower. Plants were grown in hydroponic condition applying different nutrient solutions, and the parameters of in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence were detected with a PAM-2001 modulated light fluorometer. Sensibility of fluorescence parameters were different in altered amount and type of nutrient solution. Relative fluorescence decrease (RFD), as a vitality index of stress response was also calculated in the case of all treatments and plants.

AB  - A comparison was made of the radial oxygen loss (ROL) from the roots of three Typha species, Typha latifolia L., Typha orientalis Presl and Typha angustifolia L., which resemble each other in morphology. ROLs were evaluated in the laboratory for seedlings of T. orientalis and T. angustifolia in order to compare them with the ROL value for T. latifolia obtained in our previous study. Measurements were conducted using the highly oxygen-sensitive anthraquinone radical anion as an oxygen indicator, which enabled us to simulate the natural conditions in which the oxygen released from the root is immediately consumed by the soil. Among the three Typha species, the ROL was the highest in T. angustifolia, followed by T. latifolia and T. orientalis. Illumination significantly enhances the ROL of T. orientalis, and this effect was also observed for T. latifolia in our previous study, whereas it did not affect the ROL of T. angustifolia. These results indicate that ROL differs significantly between species, even among members of the same genus that are similar in morphology.

KW  - SURFACE FORMS
AB  - Late Ordovician sedimentary environments promoting the development of ripple marks in shallow shelf carbonate deposits of northern Estonia are analysed. Ripple marks are described using different parameters (wavelength, height, and wave and asymmetry indexes). Rippled bedding is exposed in a large area in the uppermost Keila Stage, on the upper boundary of micritic-peloidal limestones (Paaskula Member of the Kahula Formation). Beds with ripples are overlain by organodetrital limestones (Saue Member of the Kahula Formation) transitional to grainstones or mud mounds of the Vasalemma Formation. The content of peloids in the Paaskula Member is relatively high and their size (0.04-0.06 mm) corresponds to the grain size of sediments capable of forming ripple marks. Weakly asymmetrical sinusoidal ripple marks are oriented in a north-south direction and have likely been formed in the shallow-water zone of the shoal at some distance from the shore. The wave-current origin of the studied ripples can be inferred from ripple indexes. Ripples were subjected to some erosion and in the shallowing-upwards conditions a rocky bottom with the Trypanites ichnofacies evolved. The rippled surface terminates a small-scale cycle (parasequence) of the depositional sequence.

AB  - Maternal allocation of antioxidants to egg yolk has been shown to affect early embryonic development and nestling survival. In environments with high levels of anthropogenic pollution, antioxidants (such as carotenoids) are important to protect the body from elevated oxidative stress. Thus, female allocation of antioxidants to yolk may be traded off against self-maintenance. Here we investigate maternal reproductive investment with respect to yolk carotenoid content and composition in relation to subsequent female condition and carotenoid status in urban and rural great tits Parus major. We found no differences between the urban and rural populations in total yolk carotenoids, egg mass, clutch size, hatching success, or female carotenoid status. Interestingly, however, rural eggs contained more zeaxanthin, a more potent antioxidant than lutein, which suggests that rural embryos have better antioxidant protection than urban embryos. Whether rural females actively transfer more zeaxanthin to the yolk or whether it passively reflects differences in dietary access or uptake needs to be further investigated. This highlights the importance of carotenoid identity and composition in future studies of carotenoid physiology, ecology, and signaling.

AB  - Field studies were conducted during 2003 and 2004 from early June to the end of August, at 20 sites of lower or higher elevation within north-central Pennsylvania, using seedlings of black cherry (Prunus serotina, Ehrh.) and ramets of hybrid poplar (Populus inaxitnowizii x trichocarpa). A linear model was developed to estimate the influence of local environmental conditions on stomatal conductance. The most significant factors explaining stomatal variance were tree species, air temperature, leaf vapor pressure deficit, elevation, and time of day. Overall, environmental factors explained less than 35% of the variation in stomatal conductance. Ozone did not affect gas exchange rates in either poplar or cherry. Ozone-induced foliar injury was positively correlated with cumulative ozone exposures, expressed as SUM40. Overall, the amount of foliar injury was better correlated to a flux-based approach rather than to an exposure-based approach. More severe foliar injuries were observed on plants growing at higher elevations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soils at abandoned brick production sites are inherently low in fertility and have poor physical conditions. In order to develop efficient soil management practices for rapid restoration of these seriously degraded soils, a field experiment was conducted on an abandoned brick production site in Shaoxing county, Zhejiang province, southeast China. Amelioration methods, including tillage, fertilization and green manure (GM) cropping, were compared for their effects on improving selected soil quality indicators. Both fertilization and tillage improved chemical, biological and physical properties of the soils. Deep tillage significantly decreased soil bulk density and significantly increased infiltration rate. Use of organic manure and chemical fertilization increased soil nutrients and microbial biomass. Application of organic manure significantly increased levels of organic C and N and the formation of water-stable aggregates, as compared with application of chemical fertilizers. Deep tillage combined with application of organic manure and green manure cropping was the most efficient method for increasing quality of the soil. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The majority of clinically relevant injuries to the developing brain are increasingly being recognized as the result of a combination of least two insults. Evidence from epidemiologic and clinical studies suggests that many of these insults do not cause injury in and of themselves. Rather, they act as predisposing factors (pre-conditioning cytotoxic factors, such as chronic ethanol consumption), increasing the susceptibility to a second, injury-producing (precipitating), unfavorable event (such as hypoxia-ischemia). In this study we make use of primary neuronal cultures to test, in a reproducible system, this two-hit hypothesis. We show that, when administered in combination, low levels of two clinically important environmental insults, hypoxia and ethanol, despite having minimal effects on their own, can act synergistically produce a significant degree of neuronal injury. We further show that one indicator of apoptotic cell death, activated caspase 3, undetectable in neurons subjected to low levels of either insult alone, is detectable when they are administered together.

AB  - For more than hundred years it has been debated whether blockfields in mountain summit areas can be used to delimit the vertical extent of Pleistocene ice sheets. In this study the relationship between blockfields, developed in quartzites and sandstones on the Varanger Peninsula, northern Norway, and glacially derived features have been evaluated. Erratics and circular ablation moraines are superimposed on the blockfields and lateral meltwater channels are eroded into them. Glacial striations and other signs of glacial sculpturing are restricted to low-lying areas with channelled ice flow. Relative ages of the blockfields and the features in them are inferred, and the first measurements of in-situ produced cosmogenic nuclides from the Varanger Peninsula are reported. We conclude that the blockfields have survived underneath at least one thick, cold-based ice sheet. Thus, these blockfields cannot be used as indicators of ice-free conditions as previously suggested for southern Norway. Our results have implications for the potential for land surface preservation beneath ice sheets and for glacial reconstructions in northern Fennoscandia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxygen isotopic compositions of silicates in eclogites and whiteschists from the Kokchetav massif were analyzed by whole-grain CO2-laser fluorination methods. Systematic analyses yield extremely low delta(18)O for eclogites, as low as -3.9parts per thousand for garnet; these values are comparable with those reported for the Dabie-Sulu UHP eclogites. Oxygen isotopic compositions are heterogeneous in samples of eclogite, even on an outcrop scale. Schists have rather uniform oxygen isotope values compared to eclogites, and low delta(18)O is not observed. Isotope thermometry indicates that both eclogites and schists achieved high-temperature isotopic equilibration at 500-800 degreesC. This implies that retrograde metamorphic recrystallization barely modified the peak-metamorphic oxygen isotopic signatures. A possible geological environment to account for the low-delta(18)O basaltic protolith is a continental rift, most likely subjected to the conditions of a cold climate. After the basalt interacted with low delta(18)O meteoric water, it was tectonically inserted into the surrounding sedimentary units prior to, or during subduction and UHP metamorphism.

AB  - Air quality monitoring is currently ensured by captors measuring few physicochemical parameters, then they cannot evaluate unforeseen compounds and the interaction effects of pollutants. On the contrary, the use of bioindicators can answer these problems. Among them, plants are used in two ways:
   1) Passive bioindicators: trees, lichens and mosses are used to determine the distribution and even the contaminants long-term effects on vast zones and, possibly, the concentrations of pollutants to which they were exposed.
   2) Active bioindicators: tobacco and mosses make available the defective zones in plants and enable determination of deposition fluxes.
   Moreover, techniques based on biomarkers identification should increase the answer's sensitivity. However, the plants present the disadvantage of being unable to provide a response in a time lapse comparable with that of the on-line analysers. Lastly, the development of tools using animal cells should allow, in the near future, to measure the total polluting load under conditions close to those of the routine techniques. Then, the real impact of the contaminant on public health could be approached.

AB  - The importance of euendolithic microbial communities as a palaeontological tool for the reconstruction of ancient sedimentary basin history has been widely acknowledged (Golubic et al. 1975, 1984, Vogel et al. 1995, 1996). This tool can be improved by better knowledge of the relationship between modem microendoliths (rock-penetrating microorganisms) and the environmental conditions they thrive in.
   The aim of a long-term study conducted on Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas, was to point out factors that control occurrence, distribution and composition of microbial euendolithic populations. The experimental design and first results are published in Radtke 1993, Kiene et al. 1995, Vogel et al. 1996, Gektidis 1997. This paper deals with one aspect of microendolithic development: the progress and change of community structure in time. Microendolithic biocoenoses are excellent bathymetric indicators (Golubic 1975, Gektidis 1997). However their potential use as indicators for different water depths is influenced by the continuous growth of the endolithic communities themselves and the surrounding benthic microflora. This process will have to be taken into consideration when, following a uniformitarian approach, fossil basins are to be reconstructed by analyzing the fossil microendolithic ichno-communities.

AB  - Glacial refugia are centers of high biodiversity. Therefore, knowledge on their locations and reactions of associated populations and landscapes to climatic changes is crucial for conservation management. We here investigated the biogeography of a butterfly species linked to open forest habitats. Using mitochondrial and nuclear markers in combination with Bayesian simulations, we analyzed the location and age of potential glacial refugia of the species. We identified five putative refugia in Europe. Considering the ecological needs of our study species, tree density within these refugial areas, in contrast to earlier assumptions, must have exceeded the level of individually scattered trees. Our results also provide evidence that especially the refuge areas in the Carpathians were previously underestimated regarding their age: the refugia in the Southern Carpathians presented suitable conditions throughout several glacial cycles, probably since the Mindel or Riss cycles. Additionally, our analyses provided support for a forest refugium near the Tatra Mountains persisting the last glacial maximum. Our results underline the usefulness of this and probably other butterfly species as indicators of forest refugia.

AB  - A 3D multi-scale approach is presented to investigate the mechanical behavior of a macroscopic specimen consisting of a granular assembly, as a boundary value problem. The core of this approach is a multi-scale coupling, wherein the finite element method is used to solve a boundary value problem and a micromechanically based model is employed as constitutive relationship used at a representative volume element scale. This approach provides a convenient way to link the macroscopic observations with intrinsic microscopic mechanisms. The plane strain triaxial loading condition is selected to simulate the occurrence of strain localization. A series of tests are performed, wherein distinct failure patterns are observed and analyzed. A system of shear band naturally appears in a homogeneous setting specimen. By defining the shear band area, microstructural mechanisms are separately investigated inside and outside the shear band. The normalized second-order work introduced as an indicator of instability occurrence is analyzed not only on the macroscale but also on the micro scale.

AB  - To understand the degradation behavior of Carbon/Carbon(C/C) composite in LEO radiation environment, groups of 2D-C/C composites samples were exposed to ground-based Low Earth Orbit(LEO) simulating facilities. The LEO radiating environment covers part of Van Allen inner belt, which contains atomic oxygen(AO) and highenergy proton radiating regions. These two kinds of radiating sources were arranged for simulating the real LEO radiating conditions regarding to the first orbit movement speed of serving space shuttles. Changes of microstructure, mass loss, surface roughness, chemical construction and thermal physical properties after environmental assessment were analyzed and compared to understand the damage behavior of LEO radiation on C/C composite. It was found that AO is the main factor of mass loss in LEO radiating particles. The charged highenergy protons have an aggravating damage ability with energetic AO, damage situations of degree in orbit down process is more serious than in orbit rising process. The LEO radiation damage mechanisms of C/C composite are revealed and expounded either.

AB  - Estuaries are impacted by multiple anthropogenic stressors from eutrophication to climate change. Long-term observational datasets allow the determination of trends in estuarine indicators and the prediction of future conditions. Here, a dataset of water quality and demersal fish community composition in a Long Island Sound embayment (Norwalk Harbor, Connecticut) from 1987 to 2016 was examined. Mean water column water temperature increased, dissolved oxygen decreased, and salinity increased over the study period, with simultaneous changes in the demersal fish community. Fish abundance declined overall, with declines in CPUE observed across multiple species including the commercially important winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus). As fish can serve as effective indicators of estuarine health, these changes suggest a negative shift in the health of this Long Island Sound embayment. Climate change presents an increasing threat to estuaries and the ecosystem services they provide, especially when coupled with other anthropogenic stressors. Management actions are needed at multiple spatial scales, from local to global, to combat these threats to estuarine health.

AB  - Water samples were examined for total viable count and pollution indicator bacteria (total coliform, fecal coliform, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis). Salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, nutrients and Chlorophyll-a were examined to assess the physico-chemical condition of water. Statistically, insignificant seasonal variation was found in bacterial populations. Average abundances (CFU/ml) of the different heterotrophic bacteria of surface waters were: total viable count (2.1 x 10(6)), total coliforms (1.3 x10(6)), fecal coliforms (1.5 x 10(4)), Escherichia coli (1.1x10(4)) and Streptococcus faecalis (0.4x10(4)). Spatially, the higher bacterial population was recorded in creek and shore regions with high concentration of nutrients. Significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) was observed between bacterial population and the nutrient concentration which suggest that elevated nutrient load favors the bacterial growth. However, bacterial populations showed positive correlations with biological oxygen demand, and negative relationship (p < 0.05) with salinity, indicating the dominating influence of anthropogenic activities in the coastal area.

AB  - Coastal zones located in populated and rapidly developing areas face high risks of natural and anthropogenic disasters. In this study, a framework was developed to determine the indicators of vulnerability to natural and anthropogenic disasters in Chuwei and Tamsui, two northern Taiwanese fishing villages in the coastal zone of the Tamsui River. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine the vulnerability indices of the locations, with experts evaluating the weights assigned to a range of criteria, namely hydrological data (such as sea surface temperature and sea level), stakeholder perceptions, and fishery data. These two villages have a considerably homogenous exposure (0.202) to hydrological conditions. However, Tamsui had a lower vulnerability value (0.317) than Chuwei (0.348), indicating that Tamsui faced fewer effects from natural and anthropogenic change than did Chuwei. In addition, vulnerability was most heavily influenced by the adaptive capacity of these two villages (Tamsui = 0.276; Chuwei = 0.112). This study suggests that both climate change and human factors (e.g., overfishing and pollution) cause decreases in marine resources, thus affecting the livelihoods of stakeholders.

AB  - Human disturbance is an important stress factor with potentially strong impact on breeding activity in animals. The consequences can be extinction of the breeding population, because disturbed animals might desert their breeding area and find no suitable substitute area. In this study, we investigated the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on a breeding population of Mediterranean storm petrels. Seabirds are increasingly used as bio-indicators for sea environmental parameters, because they are very sensitive to changing conditions. Burrowing or cave-nesting species may be particularly susceptible to human disturbance because their direct contact with humans is usually minimal or absent. First, we compared two different populations (exposed or not exposed to human disturbance) for their individual stress response to a standardized stressor (handling and keeping in a cloth bag). Second, we compared the two sub-colonies for their population-level stress response. Third, we tested experimentally whether sub-colonies of storm petrels exposed to tourism have physiological adaptations to anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - Seven species of tropical seagrass found at seagrass bed located in Johor, Malaysia were analysed for As, Cu and Cd accumulation. The species were identified as Enhalus acoroides, Halophila minor, Halophila spinulosa, Halophila ovalis, Thalassia hemprichii, Halodule uninervis and Cymodocea serrulata. Seagrass plant is rapidly becoming one of the methods to determine the overall health condition of aquatic environment. Each seagrass samples were collected and divided into three parts i.e roots, rhizomes and leaves. Samples were grinded, digested and the correlation between each part was analysed using SPSS version 16. Each part of seagrass tissues have the ability to assimilate metals for example the concentration of As, Cu and Cd in tropical seagrass were in the range of 5-48, 6-60 and 10-69 mu g/gDW, respectively. Halophila minor and Halophila ovalis indicates positive correlations to translocate metals ( As, Cu and Cd) in plants parts (leaves-rhizomes, rhizomes-roots and roots-leaves). Seagrass can accumulate metals depending on pollution that occur, seasonal variation and internal capabilities to translocate metals. The seagrass species especially Halophila ovalis and Halophila minor can act as bioindicator for metal pollution.

AB  - We evaluated the response of a rotifer community to environmental changes in five shallow lakes in the middle reach of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River in summer and autumn 2010. These five lakes differed in trophic status and rotifer community structure. Twenty-nine rotifer species were collected, of which Keratella cochlearis, Polyarthra dolichoptera, and Trichocerca elongate were dominant. The mean density, Shannon-Wiener diversity, and equitability among the five lakes differed significantly (P < 0.05). The mean rotifer density was positively correlated with trophic state. The diversity was higher in lakes with high macrophyte coverage. The composition of rotifer species was closely associated with the trophic gradient. Five environmental variables, Secchi depth, conductivity, TN, NH4-N, and TP, significantly affected the composition of rotifer species. Keratella quadrata, Brachionus calyciflorus, and B. forficula were more common in eutrophic conditions. Our results suggest that eutrophication has a significant influence on the rotifer community structure and highlight the potential for using rotifer community structure as an indicator of trophic status in subtropical lakes.

AB  - A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of two home composts with low and high gaseous emissions of the composting process is presented. The study focused on the gaseous emissions of the composting process. Gaseous emissions of methane, nitrous oxides, ammonia and volatic organic compounds of the composting process were experimentally measured in field real trials. The results showed that the differences in gaseous emissions between the two home composts were 4.5, 5.8 and 52 for methane, nitrous oxides and ammonia, respectively. Higher emissions of nitrous oxides and methane affected significantly the category of global warming potential, while higher emissions of ammonia affected mainly the categories of acidification potential, eutrophication potential and photochemical oxidation. The differences found in the compost emissions were attributable to the composting production management (quality and composition of waste stream, frequency mixing of waste, humidity and temperature monitoring, among others) as well as weather conditions (temperature and humidity).

AB  - An F-2:4 population derived from the cross between salt-tolerant variety 'Gharib' (indica) and salt-sensitive variety Sepidroud (indica) was used to determine the germination traits. The seeds were treated with 80mm NaCl (salt stress), and 11 traits were determined as indicators for salt-tolerant including germination rate, germination percentage, radicle length, plumule length, coleoptile length, plumule fresh and dry weight, radicle fresh and dry weight and coleoptile fresh and dry weight. A linkage map of 2475.7cM with an average interval of 10.48cM was constructed using 105 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and 131 SSR markers. As many as that 17 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected related to germination traits under salt stress condition; some of them are being reported for first time. Also, overlapping of QTLs related to salt tolerance was observed in this study. The identification of genomic regions associated with salt-tolerant and its components under salt stress will be useful for marker-based approaches to improve salt-tolerant for farmers in salt-prone rice environments.

AB  - The determination of organochlorine pesticides in water samples, which are harmful to humans, is very important for environmental risk assessment. Based on the excellent adsorption properties of graphene, an SPE coupled with GC-MS method for the monitoring of organochlorines (four hexachlorcyclohexanes and four dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes) was developed. Owing to the hydrophobic interaction and - stacking interaction between the analytes and graphene, the analytes quantitatively adsorbed onto the graphene-based SPE cartridge were eluted by ethyl acetate for analysis. Several parameters influencing the analytical performance, such as the kind of elution, sample volume, reusability of the cartridge, have been investigated in detail. Under the optimal conditions, detection of limits of 1.95-9.38 ng/L, recoveries of 83.9-107.3% at two spiked concentration levels (0.1 and 10 ng/mL) and RSDs in the range of 2.9-7.4% for real water samples were obtained for all the analytes. This work reveals the great potential of graphene in sample preparation procedures.

AB  - A week was spent in August 2011 exploring a selection of wooded ravines for ancient woodland indicator species of mollusc. The site selection was based on ravines where botanical survey has suggested ancient woodland conditions. A total of 36 mollusc species were found across the eight study sites. The majority of species found are natives, with only 2 non-native species recorded at these sites - the mollusc fauna appears to be virtually pristine at present. Four of the six ancient woodland indicators already known from the Island were encountered: Limax cinereoniger, Zenobiella subrufescens, Acicula fusca, Leiostyla anglica. The first is the most significant discovery as it had not been reported since it was originally added to the Island's list over 100 years previously. Two species Spermodea lamellata and Vertigo substriata were not found. Snails in particular were often found in notably low numbers, often just one specimen of a species. The survey was very much an initial exploration, and more detailed investigation is clearly needed in order to find overlooked species and to clarify the pattern of occurrence at site level.

AB  - The present study analyzes the influence of the increase in the steam generation parameters and the use of condensing/extraction turbines with the electrification of the drive of the preparing and extraction plant on the efficiency of cogeneration systems in sugar and alcohol mills. The capacity of producing and exporting electric energy, the efficiency of the production cycle, and the fuel consumption at the present operating conditions and after the proposed changes were determined by carrying out simulations on the cogeneration systems of three different mills with coupled distilleries. Also, investment values, operation and maintenance costs, the price of electric energy sale and carbon credits were included in the economic analysis for each of the alternatives. The results indicate that the use of condensing/extraction steam turbines with high efficiencies specially in the ranges of 66 bar @ 520 degrees C and 82 bar @ 540 degrees C brings overall electricity generation improvements and are economically feasible in most of the studied cases. Further, through UN's Clean Development Mechanism these cogen projects can be registered to earn carbon credits (at around U$ 5/CER (certified emission reduction)) making these projects commercially viable as the revenue is bolstered by 5-10%.

AB  - Background: Physical hyperactivity has often been described in anorexia nervosa (AN) patients but up until now in-depth research has been scarce. Experience sampling methodology (ESM), a structured diary technique assessing momentary mental state at random times during the day, may be useful in studying hyperactivity in AN.
   Methods: In two single case reports, ESM was used to investigate the variation across time of the urge to move in relation to potentially relevant eliciting conditions such as positive and negative emotions, weight preoccupation and attractiveness.
   Results: Frequency distribution of the involved variables indicated substantial individual differences between patients. While both patients' tendency to be hyperactive was positively related to their weight preoccupation and negative emotions, in only one patient, the urge to move turned out to be significantly related to (the absence of) positive emotions.
   Conclusions: ESM can be useful to test whether general theories of psychopathology apply to specific patients, and it may be conceived as an individually tailored approach to self-monitoring. As such, it may guide the clinician to devise therapeutic interventions in particular patients.

AB  - The size, density and biomass of coral reef fish in 4 fully closed marine protected areas (MPAs) with different ages were studied over a 17 yr period. Space-for-time substitution samples were available for d period of 4 yr before, and 36 yr after the closure. Both the height of the size structure graph (which is a value of overall abundance-biomass) and the assemblage biomass graph are convex polynomials with a maximum biomass of 1200 kg ha(-1) at 22 yr. This suggests that full recovery of coral reef fish assemblages in terms of abundance-biomass is considerably longer than generally believed. Beyond 25 yr, there can be a small loss in biomass, which we suggest is due to reduced net primary production associated with the increased abundance of calcifying algae attributable to intense grazing. Size spectra slopes were variable at all times, changed quickly, and were probably influenced by local environmental conditions, which made concise predictions for equilibrium coral reef size structure rather difficult.

AB  - Diatom assemblages were employed to study temporal changes of Siberian river runoff on the Laptev Sea shelf. Using a correlation between freshwater diatoms (%) in core-top sediments and summer surface water salinities from the inner Kara Sea, salinity conditions were reconstructed for a site northeast of the Lena River Delta (present water depth 32 m) since 9 calendar years (cal) ka. The reconstruction indicate a strong, near-coastal, and river-influenced environment at the site until about 8.6 cal ka. Corroborated by comparison with other proxy records from further to the east, surface salinities increased from 9 to 14 until about 7.4 cal ka, owing to ongoing global sea level rise and synchronous southward shift of the coastline. Although riverine water became less influential at the site since then, salinities still varied between 12.5 and 15, particularly during the last 3.5 kyr. These more recent salinity fluctuations agree well with reconstructions from just north of the Lena Delta, emphasizing the strong linkage between shelf hydrography and riverine discharge patterns in Arctic Siberia.

AB  - Flocs/aggregates can comprise a significant proportion of the total volume of suspended sediment in the fluvial environment. In situ measurement of the effective size distribution is frequently precluded on grounds of the cost of appropriate equipment or adverse field conditions. An assessment of the potential for using an alternative and simpler strategy involving collection of bottle samples and subsequent analysis of the samples has been undertaken. A field-portable, laser-backscatter particle size analyser has been used to assess the representativeness of measurements made on-site immediately after sample collection, and subsequently in the laboratory after settling and resuspension. On-site measurements of bottle samples were broadly representative of the in situ effective size distribution. Flocculation occurred within settled samples together with a concomitant increase in the volume mean particle size upon resuspension. The magnitude of this increase was, in general, positively related to settling time. Following resuspension, flee break-up during continuous stirring caused mean particle size to decline towards the initial on-site value.

LA  - English
AB  - Two discrete simulation models were developed, one representing a typical job shop (JS) manufacturing system (process layout) and the other representing group technology (GT) manufacturing system (cellular layout).  Hypothetical data generated by FORTRAN program and MICRO-CRAFT layout package were used to validate the two models. Simulation were performed using SLAM II.  The two layouts were compared with one another under controlled experimental conditions using various combinations of four operating variables: batch size, demand rate, ratio of setup time to   process time, and transporter speed.  Six indicators of systems performance were used  in the study. These were: average time in system, products completed, jobs in process, average machine utilization, average queue length, and average waiting time.
   The study found that for environment as set for the models, GT system outperformed JS system as expected. However, using large batch size (more than 75) in Experiment 1 changing batch size) allowed JS system to perform as well as GT system. Certain (specific changes in batch size also allowed to establish optimum results in both systems. No individual change of demand rate (Experiment 2), ratio of setup time to process time (Experiment 3) , or transporter speed (Experiment 4) allowed JS system to outperform GT system.

AB  - After decades of inadequate responses to scientists' warnings about global environmental threats, leading analysts of the science-policy interface are seeking an important shift of research focus. This switch is from continued modeling and diagnoses of biogeochemical conditions in favor of enhanced efforts to understand the many socio-political obstacles to achieving just transformations towards sustainability, and how to overcome them. We discuss why this shift continues to prove elusive. We argue that rarely analyzed mutually reinforcing power structures, interests, needs, and norms within the institutions of global environmental change science obstruct rethinking and reform. The blockage created by these countervailing forces are shielded from scrutiny and change through retreats behind shields of neutrality and objectivity, stoked and legitimated by fears of losing scientific authority. These responses are maladaptive, however, since transparency and reflexivity are essential for rethinking and reform, even in contexts marked by anti-environmentalism. We therefore urge greater openness, self-critique, and power-sharing across research communities, to create spaces and support for conversations, diverse knowledges, and decisions conducive to sustainability transformations.

AB  - The diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) currently depends on the presence of pain and radiographic imaging findings, which generally do not present until later stages of the disease when the condition is difficult to treat. Therefore, earlier detection of OA pathology is needed for improved disease management. Ex vivo cartilage studies indicate that changes in the mechanical function of cartilage occur as degeneration progresses during OA. Thus, measurement of the in vivo cartilage mechanical response may serve as an earlier indicator of OA pathology. Though mechanical characterization is classically performed during loading, the unloading (recovery) response of cartilage may also enable determination of mechanical response. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to validate the use of the recovery response for mechanical characterization of cartilage in a controlled, ex vivo environment. To do so, confined compression creep and recovery tests were conducted on cartilage explants (N = 10), and the resulting mechanical properties from both the creep and recovery phases were compared. No statistically significant differences were found in the mechanical properties between the two phases, reinforcing the hypothesis that unloading (recovery) may be a good surrogate for loading.

AB  - The increasing penetration of unconventional gas and liquefied natural gas poses an operational challenge on existing regional gas networks for gas quality problems. A new dynamic model for natural gas pipeline network with multiple supplies is presented with a special emphasis on gas interchangeability control. Wobbe index serves as gas interchangeability indicator and is calculated by equations derived from rigorous composition-based partial differential equations. Disjunctive formulation is applied to represent different modes of gas blending due to gas reversal, and the disjunctive model is then reformulated as a nonsmooth model with min/max and absolute value functions, which is solved by a gradient-based nonlinear program solver after smooth approximation. Moreover, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to tune the penalty parameters in order to focus on different penalty terms while keeping the model well-conditioned. The developed model and strategy are first tested with a small pipeline network model and then extended to a large model. The results show that the model can effectively manage gas interchangeability issues in pipeline networks within reasonable CPU time.

AB  - The changes in the hydro-chemical properties of a near shore waters of Alappuzha, southwest coast of India, where the mud banks and coastal upwelling are co-existent, are presented based on two time-series measurements taken during 2014 and 2016. The meteorological data show that the wind speed was significantly high during 2014 as compared to that during 2016 (p < 0.01). As a result, the shoreward propagation and persistence of hypoxic upwelling waters were more prominent in the mud banks during 2014, even though the coastal upwelling was generally more intense during 2016. This indicates that irrespective of the intensity of upwelling, the incursion of hypoxic waters towards the shallow coastal environment is dependent on the local meteorological conditions such as winds. The coastal upwelling generally increased the concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll a but marked increase in the nitrate levels during 2014 favoring a massive diatom bloom (Fragelaria oceanica) is noteworthy, as it is an indicator of the abundance of Indian oil sardines (Sardinella longiceps), the popular mud bank fishery.

AB  - The general goal of this study is to analyze the transitions produced during a divorce process using the Theory of transitions of Alaf Ibraim Meleis. Our specific goals are two:1) Identify the elements that characterize the experience of the divorce transition, and 2) examine if this experience is healthy for the person or not. A qualitative phenomenological case study was conducted in a person who was experiencing a divorce process. To collect the data, a conversation was conducted in a climate of trust that began with the question: "Are you living through a period of changes?". Free narration and the expression of concerns and feelings were favored. Data processing was done through content analysis of the transcribed conversation, identifying the nature, conditions and indicators of the divorce transition.
   It is suggested that nursing professionals can and should perform interventions aimed at providing security, self-esteem and confidence to the person experiencing a divorce process. This research concludes that the theory of transitions offers a holistic perspective of the persons experiencing a transition in their lives. It is proposed that the Theory guides the nurse to promote healthy responses to the transition in people.

AB  - A variety of recent studies provide a skeptical view on the predictability of stock returns. Empirical evidence shows that most prediction models suffer from a loss of information, model uncertainty, and structural instability by relying on low-dimensional information sets. In this study, we evaluate the predictive ability of various lately refined forecasting strategies, which handle these issues by incorporating information from many potential predictor variables simultaneously. We investigate whether forecasting strategies that (i) combine information and (ii) combine individual forecasts are useful to predict US stock returns, that is, the market excess return, size, value, and the momentum premium. Our results show that methods combining information have remarkable in-sample predictive ability. However, the out-of-sample performance suffers from highly volatile forecast errors. Forecast combinations face a better bias-efficiency trade-off, yielding a consistently superior forecast performance for the market excess return and the size premium even after the 1970s.

AB  - Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) has been recognized as a powerful microscopy technique to examine environments in living systems. The fluorescence lifetime does not depend on the photobleaching and optical conditions, which allows us to obtain quantitative information on intracellular environments by analyzing the fluorescence lifetime. A variety of exogenous fluorophores have been applied in FLIM measurements to examine cellular processes. Information on the correlation between the fluorescence lifetime and the physiological parameters is essential to elucidate the cellular environments from the fluorescence lifetime measurements of exogenous fluorophores. In this review, exogenous fluorophores used for lifetime-based sensing are summarized, with the expectation that it becomes a basis for selecting the fluorophore used to investigate the intracellular environment with FLIM. Experimental results of the intracellular sensing of pH, metal ions, oxygen, viscosity, and other physiological parameters on the basis of the FLIM measurements are described along with a brief explanation of the mechanism of the change in the fluorescence lifetime.

AB  - Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is susceptible to abiotic stresses. High salinity is a common abiotic stress condition that adversely affects plant growth. Altered ion and water homeostasis changes due to NaCl stress, lead to molecular damage. growth arrest and even death. As a consequence of salt stress effects, secondary stresses such as oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species may occur. Reactive oxygen species can alter cellular metabolism through oxidative damage of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids causing lipid peroxidation, protein denaturing and DNA mutation. In recent years, several selective and sensitive assays have been developed to evaluate the effects of environmental stress on vegetal organisms RAP) is one of them and developed for DNA analysis. In this study, cotton seedlings were used as bioindicator of salinity stress in the range of 50-400 mM. Effects of salinity stress were determined by comparing RAPD profiles of normal and treated cotton seedlings include variations in band intensities as well as gains or losses of band numbers. The DNA polymorphisms detected by RAPD analysis could be used as an investigation tool and useful biomarker assay for observing environmental stresses such as high salinity on vegetal organisms.

AB  - Vegetation of deciduous forests in the Stiavnicke vrchy Mts (Central Slovakia) was studied using the standard Zurich-Montpellier approach. The numerical classification and ordination technique were applied to determine the main forest vegetation types and to find the responsible environmental drivers related to their distribution patterns, respectively. The data set including 198 releves collected by authors in 1997-2009 and 185 releves excerpted from literature was used to analysis. Numerical classification resulted in delimitation of fourteen vegetation types representing eleven associations with two variants and two communities within the Quercetea roboripetraeae and Querco-Fagetea classes. The major environmental gradients in variation of forest species composition were associated with moisture and nutrient content following the average Ellenberg indicator values. Along the moisture gradient, vegetation types were ordered from subxerophilous oak forests turn mesophilous mixed oak-hornbeam, beech and ravine forests to hygrophilous riparian alder forest. The results confirmed important role of soil nutrients and moisture by determination of forest vegetation in subcontinental part of Central Europe. Special attention was given to the discussion of floristical characteristics, site conditions and syntaxonomy.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of different humidity and temperature regime on physiological indicators of the pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivar 'Pinochio', Experiments were conducted at the Lithuanian Institute of Horticulture's phytotron complex in 2007. The pea was grown in a greenhouse until organogenesis stages III-IV. The plants were grown under different temperature (+21/16 degrees C and +30/23 degrees C day/night) and humidity (40-45% and <10% normal/dryish) regime. Analyses were made after a 10-day exposure and after a 7-day regeneration period in the greenhouse. Different combinations of temperature and humidity regime exerted a significant influence on plant physiological processes. Peas grown in dryish Substratum under +30 degrees C accumulated the highest content of chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids in leaves. The moisture deficit in substratum inhibited the growth of assimilating leaf area and dry biomass. The greatest photosynthetic productivity and relative growth rate were determined for pea plants under high temperature and normal substratum humidity.

AB  - Sequential extraction procedures (SEPs) are commonly used for fractionation of solid element forms in sediments and soils. Many SEPs have been developed and, despite numerous criticisms, they remain very useful. This paper reviews extractants used in various schemes, with their advantages and disadvantages, and compares the use of SEPs with the single-step extraction with a strong complexing agent. The single-step leaching with a strong complexing agent (after optimisation of extraction conditions in accordance with local specificities) is able to release mobile and potentially mobile metal forms associated with specific sediment phases. With respect to the published experiments, it can be stated that the extraction with a strong complexing agent could well be used for the screening of sediment pollution. This is an economical and time-saving test supplementary to the recommended and attested IRMM (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements) extraction protocol and can also be used as a rapid alarming indicator of element mobility changes in sedimentary systems. Usually, such information on stream sediment pollution is sufficient for decision making in environmental protection.

AB  - Red deer bone collagen from Rochedane in the Jura (France) was analysed for carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition. The specimens range in C-14 age from about 13 000 to 8000 yr BP (uncalibrated), and cover the Late-Glacial and Early Holocene, a time period during which climatic conditions shifted from periglacial to temperate. The carbon isotopic compositions of red deer collagen suggest changes in the vegetation cover around the site that are consistent with other palaeoenvironmental indicators, such as the palynological record in the Jura. The nitrogen isotopic compositions exhibit a large range of around 6parts per thousand interpreted as reflecting changes in the intensity of N cycling coeval to vegetation changes. Red deer bone collagen appears thus as a valuable proxy for reconstructing palaeoenvironmental changes in continental western Europe during the Late-Glacial and Holocene.

AB  - Analytical data are presented for concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn in sediments and aquatic bryophytes from the Ave river basin, Portugal.  The relative abundance of aquatic bryophytes species was investigated.  Fontinalis antipyretica was the most abundant.  Natural background levels were determined for both plants and the fine fraction of sediments (< 63-mu-m) collected at uncontaminated sites.  Contamination factors at each site were then calculated as the ratio between metal concentrations and background levels.  The highest values were found in the Selho river for Cr and in the Este river for Cd, Cu and Zn.  Leather tanning, metal plating and textile industries are the main sources of toxic metal contamination in these streams.  Differences in contamination factors for plants and sediments are probably related to the hydraulic conditions in the streams.  Rapidly flowing waters enhance the metal uptake by plants and the quiescent waters, upstream from weirs, allow the deposition of fine particles and promote metal accumulation in the sediments.  Metal pollution indexes calculated as weighted averages of the individual metal contamination factors nevertheless showed a good correlation between mosses and sediments.

AB  - With a steadily increasing population, the demand for crops to feed the world population and satisfy the energy needs is also increasing. The diminishing land resources and changing environmental conditions, specifically global warming, have further exacerbated these problems. Developing heat-tolerant crops that maintain yield under stress is one way to keep pace with future demands. Heat stress tolerance is a complex trait; hence it is vital to identify major contributors to heat stress tolerance and develop molecular markers to breed for them. The present communication reviews the recent progress made in this direction in oilseed crops soybean and peanuts, where heat-induced membrane lipid unsaturation was identified as an indicator of heat tolerance and the heat-induced changes in the expression pattern of the fatty acid desaturase gene as a marker to select for this trait. The further efforts underway and the future research needed in this direction are discussed.

AB  - With its rapid economic development in the last 40 years, China?s environmental pollution has begun to seriously affect its citizens? lives as well as domestic business expansion. The problems of water pollution, increasing population, acceleration of urbanization, and strong GDP growth have made this critical issue increasingly more prominent. Recent related literature has mostly focused on economic production development and water pollution separately without systematically considering the relevant links between the former and sewage treatment capacity. Therefore, based on data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2017, this paper uses a modified undesirable dynamic network Slacks-Based Measure (SBM) model to look into each province?s economic production stage efficiency and sewage treatment stage efficiency. The research findings show big differences in input and output efficiencies for each region from 2011 to 2017 and a distinct mismatch between economic production stage efficiency and sewage treatment stage efficiency, with the former higher and the latter lower. Lastly, sewage treatment stage efficiency is a major drag on overall efficiency. Each province should thus follow the key indicators to improve efficiency according to local conditions.

AB  - The realization of really working, on-line system for evaluation of pollution of water processes requires to represent the complexity of such phenomenon. The multi-layered structure of distributed information systems under different responsibilities identify some problems for developing of an adequate decision support system (DSS) working on-line. The aim of this research is to develop the interoperable infrastructure of multi-dimensional data warehouses working on-line for integration of monitoring data, enabling the conditions for more adequate decisions. The design approach includes the constructions of the knowledge base with some layers of representation, including the domain specific ontology, which are needful for evaluation of impacts of water pollution. The results are integrated with the structures of the ISMA database, EuroWaterNet, Water Resource Management Information System - WRMIS, following the requirements of EU Water Framework Directive (2004). The presented results on integration of information sources and collaboration workflows help in searching of suitable indicators for revealing the situations of water pollution from wastewater bodies and can help to retrieve the main objects which influence the monitoring of effluxes in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - A more efficient use of natural resources is considered a necessary condition for their sustainable use. When firms use resources circularly they aim to contribute to using resources more eco-efficiently, and thus in a more sustainable way than when adopting more linear systems. Eco-efficiency in linear systems can be determined by aggregating each individual instance of resource use. However, in circular systems this approach is problematic, as it cannot capture the dynamics of resource use that unfurl between firms that contribute to eco-efficiency. In other words, we argue that in circular systems, eco-efficiency overall is more than the sum of the eco-efficiencies of individual firms. Moreover, we counterintuitively suggest that within circular economy systems, selecting only highly eco-efficient firms can actually reduce rather than increase the degree of eco-efficiency overall. Using a lens of multi-level selection theory, we build our argument through a series of numerical examples, and in conclusion show how the assessment and management of resources must be moved from the individual to the group level.

AB  - Droughts are one of the costliest natural disasters. Reliable drought monitoring and prediction are valuable for drought relief management. This study monitors and predicts droughts in Xinjiang, an arid area in China, based on the three drought indicators, i.e., the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSMI) and the Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI). Results indicate that although these three indicators could capture severe historical drought events in the study area, the spatial coverage, persistence and severity of the droughts would vary regarding different indicators. The MSDI could best describe the overall drought conditions by incorporating the characteristics of the SPI and SSMI. For the drought prediction, the predictive skill of all indicators gradually decayed with the increasing lead time. Specifically, the SPI only showed the predictive skill at a 1-month lead time, the MSDI performed best in capturing droughts at 1- to 2-month lead times and the SSMI was accurate up to a 3-month lead time owing to its high persistence. These findings might provide scientific support for the local drought management.

AB  - Changes in apple (Malus domestica Bork.) peel PSII photochemical process during fruit development under high solar radiation field conditions were analysed by the JIP-test to increase understanding on energy dissipation and susceptibility to photooxidative damage. Fruits growing exposed (E), non-exposed (NE) or suddenly exposed (SU) to high solar radiation were evaluated at three developmental stages. Chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence transient (OJIP), were affected by high solar radiation and development. Minimum fluorescence, maximum fluorescence, maximum quantum yield of photochemistry, and specific fluxes per cross section decreased in E and SU fruits. JIP parameters were a sensitive indicator of high solar radiation stress in apple peel. Peroxidative damage was observed in E fruits at each stage of development and in SU fruits at early and mid-stages. By delineating the photochemical events induced by solar radiation in apple fruits at different developmental stages, our findings might help to increase understanding on susceptibility of apple to photooxidation damage depending on the light environment and developmental stage they are exposed to.

AB  - Water management of strawberry cultivation is one the main problems of for crop production in Colombia causing fruit loss or malformation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the use of thermographic images as a tool to detect water stress in strawberry cultivation, using the crop water stress index method (CWSI). Plants of two strawberry varieties (Fragaria x ananassa Duch) were irrigated withoptimum and slight hydric deficit conditions, in a high tunnel system at the Savannah of Bogota. Environmental variables (temperature, relative humidity, PAR radiation and vapor pressure deficit) and physiological variables (canopy temperature, substrate moisture content and stomata conductance) were monitored for five months, in order to validate the hydric status of the crop through the use of CWSI. It was concluded that using thermographic images is a valid tool to detect hydric stress in protected small crops, given its high correlation with other methods and is one of the most complete monitoring methods for water management, since it relates to physiological characteristics of the crop with environmental variables that affect it.

AB  - To investigate the seasonal heterogeneity of the periphytic ciliate communities, a 1-year baseline survey was conducted in the Karnaphuli River estuary, northern Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. A total of 54 ciliate species were recorded, including seven common and 14 dominant species. Maximum species number was in autumn whereas maximum abundance was in winter; the minimum for both occurred in summer. Multivariate analyses, i.e., canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) and principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA), revealed a clear seasonal heterogeneity of community structure and environmental variables. Multivariate correlation analysis (RELATE) demonstrated that the community structure of the periphytic ciliate communities was significantly correlated with environmental variables, and best matching analysis (BIOENV) indicated that heterogeneity of community patterns was mainly driven by water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids and nutrients. Species richness and diversity peaked in autumn whereas species evenness peaked in summer. These results suggest that environmental conditions shape periphytic ciliate community structure, which is a potentially useful bio-indicator of estuarine water quality.

AB  - The functional diversity of phytoplankton communities was studied in two tropical estuaries subjected to anthropogenic pressure, despite one being environmentally protected. We applied functional diversity indices, analysed the dominant morphology traits and explored morphology-based functional groups. The less disturbed estuary showed slightly higher diversity and functional redundancy, during a wet season (on average 1.3 higher). Functional groups including nuisance species were more abundant in the heavily disturbed estuary. During a dry season, results for both systems were similar. Overall, abundance and functional diversity were higher in the upstream areas, associated with the river runoff containing freshwater species and essential nutrients for algae development. In both systems, diatoms were dominant (> 75% of the community), however, the group included small and larger individuals, and freshwater to cosmopolitan species. This dominance and the change in traits were associated with sufficient nutrient supply, low light conditions, ressuspension and salinity changes, also associated with river runoff. Overall, the different functional diversity approaches enabled us to improve our understanding of the changes occurring in both systems.

AB  - Published and original data on the contents of 50 elements in carbonaceous sediments from seas (Black, Baltic, and Caspian) and fertile oceanic shelves (shelves of Namibia, Peru, Chile, and California) are generalized. The comparison of these results with the average composition of ancient carbonaceous shales reveals both similarities and differences in the distribution of indicator trace elements (Re, Hg, Se, Ag, Cd, Tl, U, Mo, As, Ni, and Zn). Correlation coefficients were analyzed to determine the characteristic element associations. It is established that oceanic carbonaceous sediments are closer in composition to carbonaceous shales than their marine analogues, which is related to the differences in sedimentation conditions, including hydrological, hydrochemical, and biogeochemical factors. The role of anoxic environment in the accumulation of chalcophile elements in sediments is estimated. The comparison of the contents of some mobile trace elements in oceanic water and carbonaceous sediments of modern oceans demonstrates that the water composition affects the composition of carbonaceous sediments and can be used for deciphering the composition of ancient ocean water.

AB  - This paper presents a context-aware, multi-agent system called "Confidence" that helps elderly people remain independent longer by detecting falls and unusual movement, which may indicate a health problem. The system combines state-of-the-art sensor technologies and four groups of agents providing a reliable, robust, flexible monitoring system. It can call for help in case of an emergency, and issue warnings if unusual behavior is detected. The first group gathers data from the location and inertial sensors and suppresses noise. The second group reconstructs the position and activity of a person and detects the context. The third group assesses the person's condition in the environment and reacts to critical situations such as falls. The fourth group detects unusual behavior as an indicator of a potential health problem. The system was successfully tested on a scenario consisting of events that were difficult to recognize as falls, as well as in a scenario consisting of normal days and days when the person was ill. It was also demonstrated live several times, with excellent performance in complex situations.

AB  - Since the 90s an increasing number of assessment methods using operational tools like indicators have been proposed for environmental issues linked to pesticides, among them, groundwater contamination by pesticide transfer. To our knowledge none of these indicators address preferential flow, an important process determining pesticide leaching. The objective of this study is twofold: (i) to develop a new groundwater sub indicator for an existing indicator, I-Phy (former Ipest), that explicitly take preferential flow into account, and (ii) to test the possibility of developing an indicator by means of data-mining methods using simulations of a mechanistic model. The groundwater sub indicator developed is in the form of decision trees based on fuzzy inference systems. It was derived through neuro-adaptive learning on data sets from simulations running the process-based MACRO model. Unlike the previous version, the new indicator considers preferential flow, climatic differences and differences in soil texture with depth. Other benefits are less dependency on expert knowledge and the possibility to integrate a broad range of conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Differences in soil and habitat conditions, depending on the type of soil on which shrubby species of willow Salix L. are being grown for energy purposes, are reflected in weed infestation species diversity and the distinctiveness of these crops, and require an individual program of control and reduction of the abundance of competitive herbaceous vegetation. Our study aimed at determining soil parameters that have the greatest effect on weed infestation structure in a plantation of basket willow (Salix L.) coppice. The following chemical soil properties were taken into account as environmental variables: soil pH, soil moisture content, and humus, total nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus content. Field research was carried out at five plantations of fast-growing basket willow (Salix viminalis L.) hybrids of the genotypes jorr, sprint, and turbo situated on disposal sites of sandy silts and sewage sludge-fertilized silts as well as fallow post-farmland and grassland. Obtained research results indicate soil reaction and soil moisture as factors that have the biggest effect on diversity of competitive herbaceous vegetation accompanying energy willow coppices.

AB  - Tree-rings have frequently been used for dating of trees and to determine annual growth increments and forest dynamics, but little is known in tropical conditions about their utilization for environmental monitoring. This paper presents the results of Araucaria columnaris tree-ring characterization by wood anatomy and X-ray densitometric analysis and the determination of Pb concentration. Core samples from twelve araucaria trees were extracted from two sites exposed to air pollution due to intense traffic of vehicles and industrial activities. The tree-rings distinctly presented radial variation in early-latewood thickness and density, and characteristics of juvenile and mature wood. Anatomical and X-ray densitometric analysis were useful to delimit the tree-ring boundaries and to date the tree-rings, as well as to prove the annual formation. The lead concentration in annual araucaria tree-rings, analyzed with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, indicated the seasonal presence of the heavy metal in the environment during the 30 years studied, although the Pb did not affect tree growth.

AB  - The coal seam No. 207 was a subject of palynological and petrographic studies. According to the results of the vitrinite random reflectance measurements supplemented by moisture and calorific value determinations, the rank of this coal is matching the boundary between sub-bituminous and bituminous coals. The aim was to reconstruct the environmental conditions during the biochemical stage of seam formation, as well as the facies development throughout the seam profile. The maceral (incident and fluorescence mode) and microlithotype compositions (incident light) supplemented by palynological analyses, show that there were two main facies developments. In the authors opinion, they correspond with a phase of ombrogenous, raised bog marked by the presence of crassidurite with Densosporites variabilis and a wet-forest swamp phase represented by vitrite and clarite with more diverse spore assemblage including densospores. Other minor but distinctive sediments, a cannel layer and a reeds facies, both occurring in the lower part of the seam. Above the tonstein horizon, a dry forest type of sedimentation is recognized.

AB  - Arabis alpina is a perennial Brassicacea closely related to Arabidopsis thatiana. Leaves from plants were collected in bulk from three different places in Switzerland (two in the Jura Mountains, Chasseral and Pichoux and one in the Alps, Schilthorn). The population "sensus lato" growing in Chasseral (Jura) showed more cadmium (Cd) accumulation in leaves than the two others. Interestingly, the soil of Chasseral contains more total and NaNO3 extractable Cd, indicating that Cd accumulation in A. alpina is mainly related to the soil Cd content. These observations were only partly confirmed by physico-chemical parameters of the soils. Global RAPD analyses showed that alpine and Jura plants exhibit genetic divergence which likely not influence plant cadmium uptake as judged by in vitro culture experiments. Interestingly, MRP3 and Nramp4 were differentially regulated in the three population tested. As shown after hydroponic culture in the presence of 10 mu M CdCl2, A. alpina is not a Cd hyper-tolerant plant, unlike Thlaspi caerulescens ecotypes or A. halleri, but rather a Cd bio-indicator plant.

AB  - Nutrient concentrations and other environmental factors were measured in the Daechung Reservoir for 25 weeks from spring until autumn in 1999. The high irradiance after heavy rainfall provided optimal meteorological conditions for bloom formation during summer, therefore, rain would also appear to forecast imminent bloom. The bloom formation was largely governed by cyanobacteria, in particular, Microcystis spp. and Anabaena spp. Phycocyanin showed higher correlation with cyanobacteria (r = 0.744, P < 0.001) compared to chlorophyll- a (r = 0.599, P < 0.01). Therefore, phycocyanin was more accurate and useful than chlorophyll-a in quantitatively measuring cyanobacterial blooms. The atomic N:P ratio of the particulate form also showed a high correlation with cyanobacteria (r = 0.541, P < 0.01), increasing from 4.3 to 14.6 during bloom formation, while that of the dissolved form decreased from 25.5 to 8.7. These results indicated that the algae assimilated N significantly without comparable P uptake during the blooming season, which was in sharp contrast to the excessive storage of P during the spring.

AB  - Redox responses of Escherichia coli based on the anaerobic metabolism of glucose to hydrogen are characteristic of the culture. Four unique E. coli strains and one resistant strain were monitored in a multichannel electrochemical analyzer. The redox measurements and absorbance as well as their kinetics, observed during culture growth, were compared to differentiate strains and to correlate with phenotypes. Mixed cultures of two strains to simulate the emergence of a resistant population yielded two peak potentials. On increasing or decreasing the initial cell concentration of one strain or the other, the respective potential peak was moved forward or backward in the time-scale, thereby allowing peak identification. The electrochemical bioassay system, calibrated by known cultures, was used to evaluate various environmental stress factors: culture media without nutrients or substrates, extended culturing under impoverished conditions, freezing, cooling, or heating cultures to lethal temperatures for different periods of time, and exposing cultures to increasing doses of a phenolic toxicant. This system appears to be responsive to the stress factors in a quantitative and reproducible manner, and hence may find use in environmental risk assessments.

T2  - OPHELIA
LA  - English
AB  - Variability of light scattering (turbidity) and chlorophyll fluorescence in the Black Sea was studied with a submersible fluorometer in 1989 and 1991. Diurnal changes in fluorescence occurred within the layer of oxygen and hydrogen sulfite co-existence (C-layer) at the depth of the daily mean secondary fluorescence maximum, far below the light intensity level necessary for phytoplankton photosynthesis. A harmonic function maximal at night approximated these changes. There was no diurnal rhythm of fluorescence at depth levels adjacent to the secondary maximum, or in the variability of turbidity measured together with fluorescence. The maxima of chlorophyll fluorescence and water turbidity differed from each other in depth, shape, and fine structure within the C-layer. These findings support the idea that the phototrophs Chlorobium phaeobacteroides and C. phaeovibrioides are carriers of fluorescing bacteriochlorophyll e in the Black Sea and indicate that the bacteria might be photosynthetically active under ambient light intensity close to zero. Bacteriochlorophyll fluorescence appears to be a useful indicator of minor perturbations inside C-layers of anoxic basins since it belongs to obligate organisms strongly dependent on environmental conditions.

AB  - The stochastic characteristics of river-delta systems pose large uncertainties for the environmental management of deltas. This study explored the use of two sets of individually repeated physical modelling experiments, to tentatively investigate the deterministic and non-deterministic responses of lacustrine deltaic channels to upstream water inflow. Results indicated that the single-main channel length increased positively with discharge, and was inevitably accompanied by the non-positive changing of both the fluctuation characteristics of the relative position of the bifurcating node for different-order branching channels, and the average period of all the geometrical indicators of higher-order branching channels in the middle delta; the major non-deterministic highlights were the positive and negative correlations of average period and average value for the relative position of the bifurcating node and the branching channel length, respectively, in the upper delta under the low-discharge conditions. These findings refresh our understanding of bifurcation instability and lay the foundation for stochastic modelling of lacustrine-delta morphology.

AB  - Gallium-Nitride (GaN) transistor suits for high switching frequency condition to build high power density converters. However, it suffers from crosstalk problem especially in bridge-structure applications, that is, the fast voltage changing of the switching node causes a positive or negative voltage spike on the gate-source voltage of GaN transistor, which results in false turn-on and gate breakdown of the transistor, respectively. Rather than specially designing the gate driver, this letter proposes an idea of using a gate-drive power supply (GDPS) with decayed negative output to solve the crosstalk problem. With the proposed GDPS, a negative driving voltage is provided when the positive voltage spike appears to avoid false turn-on, and then the negative driving voltage naturally decays to zero before the negative voltage spike appears to avoid gate breakdown. Such a GDPS is realized by a simple forward-flyback topology, and the commercial gate-drive ICs can be cooperated with it conveniently. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the major contributors for economic growths of Uttar Pradesh (UP) state. The state being predominately agrarian, the agricultural growth in UP is indisputably critical in determining the growth rate of the State. Although, the intent of any government is always the overall spatial development, the pace of development in various regions generally differ remarkably due to historic, topographical, ecological atmospheric conditions including various other factors. Uttar Pradesh being a very large state, wide disparities is likely to be presented in development and the rate of growth in different areas of the state. Owing to this, in the present study spatial and temporal differences in the development in agricultural growth in Uttar Pradesh has been envisaged. The analysis has been carried out by taking into account various agricultural indicators for the time period 2015-16. Using these indicators, the composite indices of development of agriculture for Uttar Pradesh state are constructed. An attempt has been made to categorize the districts into five categories namely highly developed, developed, developing, less developed and least developed districts.

AB  - The species structure of land snail communities inhabiting the meadow herb layer has been studied in the periods of relatively high emissions from the Middle Ural Copper Smelter (2006-2008) and after their almost complete reduction (2015-2017). No snails were found in the impact zone during these periods. In the background and buffer zones, their species richness during the second period decreased by a factor of two, and their abundance, by a factor of up to three, which was due to weather fluctuations (drought in 2016). The impact of drought was more distinct in the buffer zone, but two species (Discus ruderatus and Vitrina pellucida) appeared there and increased in abundance during the second period. The processes of recovery in land snail communities may be explained by normalization of soil pH and calcium content and also by an increase in the proportion of graminoids in the herb layer, which provided for stabilization of microclimatic conditions.

AB  - In the fields of forestry and horticulture, it is necessary to have forecasts about the growth of trees. This process is affected by a lot of external factors like weather, light conditions, other objects, etc. There are several already existing methods for this purpose, but these can give only rough estimations. This paper presents a novel solution, based on the simulation of the growth of the tree. During this process, the application takes into account the environment of the tree and the properties of the species, which parameters are all easily configurable. The presented application can simulate not just one, but a group of trees parallel, estimating their effects to each other (shadows, etc.). The result of the simulation is a three dimensional model of the tree(s) at any time of the growth process. The distortion effects of these external factors are well visible on this model, giving a realistic estimation about the integration of the tree(s) into the given environment. The simulation has high computational demand; therefore, the most computationally intensive steps of the simulation are implemented on graphics accelerators using the CUDA framework.

AB  - This study explores the mediation effect of transformational leadership in the relationship between leaders' personality characteristics and effectiveness. Data from 210 students in a managerial role, and from 3,766 students in a subordinate role, were obtained during a fourmonth-long Management Simulation Game and analysed using multilevel structural equation modelling. Transforniational leadership mediated the effect of leaders' agreeableness and conscientiousness on group performance, perceived leader effectiveness, and leadership emergence. Extraversion, openness to experience and neuroticism were not linked to transformational leadership or any indicator of leader effectiveness. Intelligence predicted neither transformational leadership, nor group performance and leadership emergence. Along with other studies, this study emphasizes conscientiousness as the personality characteristic that influences leadership and leaders' effectiveness in various cultures and situations. Agreeableness may be an important leader trait in specific conditions and its influence may be moderated by context. The results must be interpreted with the knowledge that they were obtained in a simulation game environment on a sample of students.

AB  - As an attempt to define and characterize the elements required for the ERE systems optimal driving programs (objective of reaching future) in this paper are presented the results made the connection ENE-ECO in order to optimize the operating mode of the oil processing companies installations, depending on environmental and energy indicators. Strong companies in the field, studies (and even started applying) modern methods based on mathematical modeling and neural networks for the correlations between energy indicators and the environment on the one hand, and processing parameters on the other. In order to structure such an optimization methods, the paper presents a mathematical model and calculation program for determining energy and environmental indicators, depending on processing parameters, which become tools of own conception, applicable to any production installation. The study of these models, enable to identify the specific conditions, that must be satisfied for that economic processes to friendly coexist for long term with the environment, namely, to have an minimal impact, meaning that the resulting residues from the economic activity of the organization to be as less harmful as possible for the environment.

AB  - The discoloration/degradation of aqueous solutions of synthetic textile dyes for cold dyeing (Dark Blue, Orange and Strong Red) was accomplished by an oxidative photochemical process in heterogeneous phase using UV light or direct sunlight, hydrogen peroxide and commercial steel wool for domestic use as a Fe source. Solutions (1 g L-1) were conveniently characterized by its Color index. The effect of the concentration of the oxidant added and the mass of steel wool in the system were evaluated, and the optimal conditions for each dye discoloration/degradation were determined. Discoloration percentages higher than 85% were achieved both when the reaction was assisted by radiation UV (germicidal lamps) as when the system was exposed to direct sunlight. The final degradation of the discolored samples was determined by measuring the decrease in the absorption band at 254 nm as an indicator of the rupture of aromatic rings. The photodegradation processes presented in this work, carried out in the presence of zero-valent iron (commercial steel wool), constitutes an example of an environmentally benign technology.

AB  - Rapid urbanization and industrialization, uncontrolled population growth, indiscriminate waste discharge and poor infrastructure are problems that African cities are facing. This paper describes an exemplary case study from Jimma, south-west Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted along the Awetu-Kito drainage system in Jimma town to assess the level of pollution from urban dwellers and related activities. The study indicates that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) norms for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO) and orthophosphates are not met downstream of the major industrial and institutional activities. Small-scale industries, Jimma University and residential areas contributed 50, 15 and 23% pollution load on the river, respectively. It can be concluded that the pollution effect in Jimma town is mainly as a result of the growing (uncontrolled) industrial activities and not to discharge of household wastewater. Given the same trends of urbanization and population growth, similar development (socio-economic) indicators and similar climatic conditions, the key findings for Jimma are transferable to other mid-sized African cities.

AB  - The Longmenshan fault that ruptured during the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan (China) earthquake was drilled to a depth of 1200 m, and fault rocks including those in the 2008 earthquake slip zone were recovered at a depth of 575-595 m. We report laboratory strength measurements and microstructural observations from samples of slip zone fault rocks at deformation conditions expected for coseismic slip at borehole depths. Results indicate that the Longmenshan fault at this locality is extremely weak at seismic slip rates. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that graphite was formed along localized slip zones in the experimental products, similar to the occurrence of graphite in the natural principal slip zone of the 2008 Wenchuan rupture. We surmise that graphitization occurred due to frictional heating of carbonaceous minerals. Because graphitization was associated with strong dynamic weakening in the experiments, we further infer that the Longmenshan fault was extremely weak at borehole depths during the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, and that enrichment of graphite along localized slip zones could be used as an indicator of transient frictional heating during seismic slip in the upper crust.

AB  - Green analytical methods employing flow analysis with simple natural reagent extracts have been exploited. Various formats of flow based analysis systems including a single line FIA, a simple lab on chip with webcam camera detector, and a newly developed simple lab on chip system with reflective absorption detection and the simple extracts from some available local plants including butterfly pea flower, orchid flower, and beet root were investigated and shown to be useful as alternative self indicator reagents for acidity assay. Various tea drinks were explored to be used for chromogenic reagents in iron determination. The benefit of a flow based system, which allows standards and samples to go through the analysis process in exactly the same conditions, makes it possible to employ simple natural extracts with minimal or no pretreatment or purification. The combinations of non-synthetic natural reagents with minimal processed extracts and the low volume requirement flow based systems create some unique green chemical analyses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

KW  - PARTICIPATION
KW  - TIME
AB  - This paper presents the results of an analysis of deliberative norms in the framework for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in roads planning in Sweden. The more specific question is how this framework has responded to the shift towards more deliberative approaches to planning and decision making, advocated in planning theory and policy literature over the last decade. The analysis, which compares the current framework and guidance with an earlier iteration, identifies a shift towards deliberation; deliberative norms are present, and even dominate recent guidance. However, an instrumental norm permeates both the former and the current guidance, suggesting that even as a language of consultation is replaced by one of deliberation, the intention remains to secure and legitimise a smooth development pathway. Evidence from interviews with professionals working in the Swedish EIA system highlights the difficulties of navigating these uncertainties in practice. By opening up critical analysis of deliberative norms as they shape the conditions for practice, this study contributes to the continuous development of planning practice, by supporting a more normatively reflexive approach to framework-design.

AB  - Indices ranking the quality of life in cities based on climatic, environmental and urban conditions have a long tradition in the hedonic literature. In this paper we propose an alternative set of indices based on subjective well-being (SWB) data linked to regional level amenities. SWB indicators provide a direct, self-reported evaluation of life satisfaction and can be used to rank quality of life among different locations in the absence of data on housing prices and wages. Using SWB data in Ireland, we show how to rank quality of life in regions in three different ways: 1) using a simple unconditional average of SWB across locations, 2) conditionally, controlling for personal characteristics of individuals and the environmental amenities in their area and 3) weighting the environmental endowments in each location by the marginal rate of substitution between income and the amenity. The results show a very high correlation between the three indices and suggest that variation in SWB across locations is not random, but is driven to a large extent by the endowment of location-specific amenities across locations.

AB  - Fifteen raptor species (Falconiformes and Strigiformes) breed and other two may breed in Torres del Paine National Park (Chilean Patagonia), the highest raptor species richness documented in Chile. Accounts for each raptor species in Torres del Paine are provided, including information on weight, habitat, diet, residence, conservation, and miscellaneous observations in the Park. We compare raptor species richness in Torres del Paine with well studied localities in central and northern Chile, and speculate on causes for the higher raptor diversity observed in the Park. Raptor macroniches in Torres del Paine are assessed, describing primarily their use of two major habitat types and nine food resources. We examine food-niche relationships for a subset of four mammal-eating raptors, in light of their different ecologies and body sizes. A monitoring program for raptors in Torres del Paine is proposed, under the rationale that these indicator species may help foresee impending disruptions of basic ecosystem processes that determine the relatively pristine conditions still prevailing in the Park.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE YORKSHIRE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
LA  - English
AB  - A sequence of disturbed and undisturbed samples from a borehole drilled at Warham, near Stiffkey in north Norfolk, is described and sub-divided into three lithofacies on the basis of sedimentary structures, particle size distribution, calcium carbonate content, selected heavy mineral composition and indicator lithologies. These properties are used to determine the environment of deposition and establish correlation with glaciogenic deposits elsewhere. The basal sands and gravels (Lithofacies A) overlie the Chalk bedrock and are interpreted as having formed by a braided River Stiffkey that flowed northward through the site in pre-Late Devensian periglacial conditions. Lithofacies B consists of >8 m of laminated sands, silts and clays that were formed in a proglacial lake created by the obstruction of the River Stiffkey when the Late Devensian (Dimlington Stadial) glaciation reached the north Norfolk coast. These sediments are covered by gravelly sands (Lithofacies C), which were deposited as an ice-marginal river deposit as part of the Late Devensian end moraine-ridge complex. Finally, the lake drained and the sediments were dissected as the diverted River Stiffkey adopted a new course to the north-east and the lower, incised section of the present Stiffkey valley was formed.

AB  - Environmental accounting techniques are intended to capture important environmental costs and benefits that are often overlooked in standard accounting practices. Environmental accounting methods themselves often ignore or inadequately represent large but highly uncertain environmental costs and costs conditioned by specific prior events. Use of a predictive Bayesian model is demonstrated for the assessment of such highly uncertain environmental and contingent costs. The predictive Bayesian approach presented generates probability distributions for the quantity of interest (rather than parameters thereof). A spreadsheet implementation of a previously proposed predictive Bayesian model, extended to represent contingent costs, is described and used to evaluate whether a firm should undertake an accelerated phase-out of its PCB containing transformers. Variability and uncertainty (due to lack of information) in transformer accident frequency and severity are assessed simultaneously using a combination of historical accident data, engineering model-based cost estimates, and subjective judgement. Model results are compared using several different risk measures. Use of the model for incorporation of environmental risk management into a company's overall risk management strategy is discussed.

AB  - We have shown recently that oxidative stress by chronic hyperglycemia damages the pancreatic beta-cells of GK rats, a model of non-obese type 2 diabetes, which may worsen diabetic condition and suggested the administration of antioxidants as a supportive therapy. To determine if natural antioxidant alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) has beneficial effects on the glycemic control of type 2 diabetes, GK rats were fed a diet containing 0, 20 or 500 mg/kg diet alpha-tocopherol. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test revealed a significant increment of insulin secretion at 30 min and a significant decrement of blood glucose levels at 30 and 120 min after glucose loading in the GK rats fed with high alpha-tocopherol diet. The levels of glycated hemoglobin Ale, an indicator of glycemic control, were also reduced. Vitamin E supplementation clearly ameliorated diabetic control of GK rats, suggesting the importance of not only dietary supplementation of natural antioxidants but also other antioxidative intervention as a supportive therapy of type 2 diabetic patients, (C) 2000 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

KW  - CLONES
AB  - We examined the relationships between biomass or growth rates and leaf characteristics of 2-year-old trees of two clones of Populus. Leaf characteristics were total plant leaf area or leaf weight, mean size (or weight) of fully expanded terminal leaves, and foliar concentrations and contents of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, total chlorophyll, and total available carbohydrates. Sample trees (n = 156) were chosen from two irrigation regimes and several fertilization treatments to provide a wide range of environmental conditions and growth rates for each clone. Total plant leaf area or weight was strongly correlated with total aboveground biomass (r = 0.98-0.99); however, mean size (area or weight) of the fully expanded terminal leaves was also quite strongly correlated with biomass (r = 0.64-0.72), height growth (r = 0.54-0.72), and diameter growth (r = 0.53-0.73). With one exception (correlation between foliar K concentration and height growth of one clone, r = 0.67), leaf size characteristics were more strongly correlated with biomass or growth than were concentrations or contents of foliar chemicals. Since size of the terminal leaves is easy to measure, it may be useful as a simple indicator of potential productivity.

AB  - Precision irrigation management of wine grape requires a reliable method to easily quantify and monitor vine water status to allow effective manipulation of plant water stress in response to water demand, cultivar management and producer objective. Mild to moderate water stress is desirable in wine grape in determined phenological periods for controlling vine vigor and optimizing fruit yield and quality according to producer preferences and objectives. The traditional leaf temperature based crop water stress index (CWSI) for monitoring plant water status has not been widely used for irrigated crops in general partly because of the need to know well-watered and non-transpiring leaf temperatures under identical environmental conditions. In this study, leaf temperature of vines irrigated at rates of 35, 70 or 100% of estimated evapotranspiration demand (ETc) under warm, semiarid field conditions in southwestern Idaho USA was monitored from berry development through fruit harvest in 2013 and 2014. Neural network (NN) models were developed based on meteorological measurements to predict well-watered leaf temperature of wine grape cultivars 'Syrah' and 'Malbec' (Vitis vinifera L). Input variables for the cultivar specific NN models with lowest mean squared error were 15-min average values for air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and wind speed collected within 90 min of solar noon (13:00 and 15:00 MDT). Correlation coefficients between NN predicted and measured well-watered leaf temperature were 0.93 and 0.89 for 'Syrah' and 'Malbec', respectively. Mean squared error and mean average error for the NN models were 1.07 and 0.82 degrees C for 'Syrah' and 1.30, and 0.98 degrees C for 'Malbec', respectively. The NN models predicted well-watered leaf temperature with significantly less variability than traditional multiple linear regression using the same input variables. Non-transpiring leaf temperature was estimated as air temperature plus 15 degrees C based on maximum temperatures measured for vines irrigated at 35% (ETc). Daily mean CWSI calculated using NN estimated well-watered leaf temperatures between 13:00 and 15:00 MDT and air temperature plus 15 degrees C for non-transpiring leaf temperature consistently differentiated between deficit irrigation amounts, irrigation events, and rainfall. The methodology used to calculate a daily CWSI for wine grape in this study provided a daily indicator of vine water status that could be automated for use as a decision-support tool in a precision irrigation system.

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of dietary crude protein concentration on ammonia (NH3) and greenhouse gas (GHG; nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide) emissions from fresh dairy cow manure incubated in a controlled environment (experiment 1) and from manure-amended soil (experiment 2). Manure was prepared from feces and urine collected from lactating Holstein cows fed diets with 16.7% (DM basis; HCP) or 14.8% CP (LCP). High-CP manure had higher N content and proportion of NH3- and urea-N in total manure N than LCP manure (DM basis: 4.4 vs. 2.8% and 51.4 vs. 30.5%, respectively). In experiment 1, NH3 emitting potential (EP) was greater for HCP compared with LCP manure (9.20 vs. 4.88 mg/m(2) per min, respectively). The 122-h cumulative NH3 emission tended to be decreased 47% (P = 0.09) using LCP compared with HCP manure. The EP and cumulative emissions of GHG were not different between HCP and LCP manure. In experiment 2, urine and feces from cows fed LCP or HCP diets were mixed and immediately applied to lysimeters (61 x 61 x 61cm; Hagerstown silt loam; fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) at 277 kg of N/ha application rate. The average NH3 EP (1.53 vs. 1.03 mg/m(2) per min, respectively) and the area under the EP curve were greater for lysimeters amended with HCP than with LCP manure. The largest difference in the NH3 EP occurred approximately 24 11 after manure application (approximately 3.5 times greater for HCP than LCP manure). The 100-h cumulative NH3 emission was 98% greater for HCP compared with LCP manure (7,415 vs. 3,745 mg/m(2), respectively). The EP of methane was increased and that of carbon dioxide tended to be increased by LCP compared with HOP manure. The cumulative methane emission was not different between treatments, whereas the cumulative carbon dioxide emission was increased with manure from the LCP diet. Nitrous oxide emissions were low in this experiment and did not differ between treatments. In the conditions of these experiments, fresh manure from dairy cows fed a LCP diet had substantially lower NH3 EP, compared with manure from cows fed a HOP diet. The LCP manure increased soil methane EP due to a larger mass of manure added to meet plant N requirements compared with HOP manure. These results represent effects of dietary protein on NH3 and GHG EP of manure in controlled laboratory conditions and do not account for environmental factors affecting gaseous emissions from manure on the farm.

AB  - This paper describes the approach used to establish an in-lake concentration goal for total phosphorus in the total maximum daily load (TMDL) process carried out by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for Lake Okeechobee. In order to specify the in-lake phosphorus goal, the first consideration was to identify the most suitable indicator of "imbalance in flora or fauna" pursuant to Subsection 62-302.530(48)(b) of the Florida Administrative Code (FAC). Blooms of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) were previously identified as one of the most serious symptoms of cultural eutrophication in this lake, and there existed a large data set relating total phosphorus to chlorophyll a, which can be used to index the occurrence of blooms. We evaluated the occurrence of samples with chlorophyll a in excess of 40 mug.L-1 (moderate bloom) and 60 mug.L-1 (severe bloom) as a function of total phosphorus concentrations in order to specify the lake phosphorus goal. A cross-tabulation procedure was used to identify a range of total phosphorus corresponding to a rapid increase in bloom frequency. Near-shore and pelagic data sets were sorted by total phosphorus and each was sub-divided into ten intervals of approximately equal sample size. When total phosphorus averaged below 30 mug.L-1, the probability of moderate blooms was below 3% and the probability of severe blooms was near 1% in the near-shore region. When total phosphorus averaged between 35 and 45 mug.L-1, frequencies were between 15 and 35% for moderate blooms and between 2 and 5% for severe blooms, respectively. Pelagic bloom frequencies also increased with increasing phosphorus, but the response was considerably muted relative to that observed in the near-shore area. To ensure an acceptable level of risk in terms of algal bloom occurrence, a total phosphorus goal of 40 mug.L-1 was selected by the FDEP. Mass-balance modeling results (Walker 2000) indicate that an average external phosphorus load of 140 metric tons y(-1) (compared to a 1973 to 1999 mean of 498 metric tons y(-1)) would provide a long-term aver-age phosphorus concentration in the take's pelagic zone of 40 mug.L-1. Based on our empirical model relating bloom frequencies to total phosphorus, it is predicted that under these TMDL loading conditions, bloom frequencies in the near-shore region would be 2 to 9%, as compared to 5 to 33% under present conditions. Successful implementation of the TDML should significantly reduce near-shore bloom frequencies in Lake Okeechobee.

AB  - On-road driving tests are performed to determine the emission of harmful exhaust compounds from vehicles. These primarily include carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particle number. However, there is a lack of indicators that combine the first three substances that are the most important in assessing the environmental aspects of vehicles. The purpose of this article is to indicate the possibility of assessing emissions in real driving conditions from light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles of different categories. In order to do so, a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) and an instrument for measuring the particle number were used. The tests were carried out on routes designed to comply with the requirements and regulations laid down in the European Union legislation. On-road emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particle number have been determined. Factors have been determined as the multiplication of these compounds for each vehicle category in three phases of the test: urban, rural, and motorway. A new way of assessing emissions from vehicles using new factors has been proposed.

AB  - Haloarchaea are known to produce antimicrobial proteins, halocins which are generally stable at extreme conditions suggesting their potential biotechnological applications. Here, we report a halocin-producing haloarchaeon isolated from salt lake and identified as Haloferax larsenii HA4 using partial 16S rDNA sequence and biochemical properties. Whole-cell methanolysate showed ether-linked lipids, which is a characteristic feature of haloarchaea. Strain HA4 was able to grow at pH 60-100 and 15-30% NaCl. The growth response was normal but antimicrobial activity was detected only during the log-phase. Crude halocin HA4 was active in the pH range of pH 20-100 with stability up to 100 degrees C. Cell-free supernatant (CFS) was also stable in different organic solvents and detergents tested. However, halocin activity was reduced after treatment with proteinase K suggesting the proteinaceous nature of the active compound. Concentrated CFS showed the presence of several proteins from 65-66 kDa but bioassay suggested similar to 14 kDa protein as halocin. Crude halocin preparation showed cytocidal activity against indicator strain, H. larsenii HA10 and inhibited the growth of other related strains such as H. larsenii HA3, HA8, HA9 and HA10.

AB  - It has been suggested that, depending on local, environmental, and demographic conditions, the Inca state implemented diverse strategies of landscape appropriation in the middle Calchaqui Valley, Northwest Argentina..One of the direct strategies consisted in the intervention of agricultural infrastructure in areas with no evidence of either local habitational or pukarastyle defensive settlements, which were very popular in the study area during the Regional Development Period (RDP) or Late Intermediate Period (LIP) and which could have become true Inca productive enclaves. Another strategy, of a more symbolic character, suggests that the Inca state appropriated places with a previous history, and that the pukaras acted as territorial milestones associated to a way of occupying the space, interweaving numerous practices and acting as referents of collective memory. In this article, we discuss the possibility that the strategies and ritual ceremonies were used as an expression of the territorial demarcation and annexation to the Inca policy in agricultural areas of the valleys and high gorges of Calchaqui, taking into account the concept of Capacocha.

AB  - False rings are intra-annual bands of high density xylem cells that form in response to an environmental condition that a causes a tree to form two bands of latewood cells during a single growing season. We examined whether precipitation and/or stream flow measurements coincided with false ring formation in adult bald cypress trees (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.). We collected increment cores from bald cypress growing along the Blackwater and Nottoway Rivers in Virginia, U.S.A. The frequency and timing of false rings was quantified for each core. Annual synchronicity of false ring formation occurred, indicating a common environmental trigger. At both sites, false ring formation in bald cypress appeared to be more common during years with late summer precipitation and associated high late summer stream flow. In years when moisture is available late in the growing season, dormant bald cypress trees resume earlywood formation and a false ring is formed. Therefore, false rings in bald cypress wood can serve as a proxy record of seasonal historical stream flow and precipitation.

T2  - POLAR RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - This article examines the implementation of the principles of openness, transparency and public participation in the decision-making regarding the conditions for uranium mining in Greenland from a legal and political perspective. The time frame covers the period from the exploration for minerals before World War II to 2016-2017 when the current Greenlandic authorities prepared a licence for a project of extraction of rare earth elements and uranium in Kvanefjeld. It is shown that the issue of openness, transparency and public participation in Greenland is a longstanding issue and that the current governance does not permit public access to a draft environmental impact assessment report, impairing public participation in decision-making, and preventing the environmental consequences of these activities from being considered as a public concern. It is argued that sovereignty-its consolidation and the accession to it-has impacted the design of governance in Greenland and that the constraints put on the full implementation of the legal principles of openness, transparency and public participation in the governance of uranium mining in Greenland, amongst other factors, point to a current hybrid political and legal order in the context of a political agenda of independence.

AB  - This study investigated the indicators of adaptive capacity along with disturbances in community forest management systems in the East Asian countries, China, Japan and South Korea. Although these countries have centuries-old traditions of community-based forest management, they have been less researched in light of adaptive capacity for resilient social-ecological systems. Recent social and ecological disturbances bring about new challenges and/or opportunities to the capacity of forest related communities to adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Through a systematic review of the community forestry and related adaptive capacity literature in three East Asian countries, this study addressed the role of diverse knowledge systems, such as traditional and Western scientific knowledge, and civic traditions of self-organization in local communities that characterized adaptive capacity of this region. This study extends our understanding of community-based conservation efforts and traditions of this region, and adds to the understandings gleaned from studies of community forestry in the West and sacred forests in other parts of Asia and Africa. Further research on ways to increase adaptive capacity is needed in a site-specific context.

AB  - This study focuses on the degradation of the sulfonamide antibiotics, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfathiazole, using ultraviolet irradiation in various conditions. Different pHs were investigated in combination with the addition of hydrogen peroxide and further oxygen removal. High-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization ion-trap mass spectrometry was used to identify and elucidate degradation products and to establish concentration-time curves. Previously unknown degradation products could be characterized. Reaction rate constants of all compounds and transformation products were determined. The parent sulfonamides decayed according to first-order kinetics, while the concentrations of the transformation products varied with time according to a subsequent reaction of an intermediate product. Quantum efficiencies were analyzed for mechanistic purposes. As example, sulfamethoxazole was added to effluents from a wastewater treatment plant and irradiated. Phototoxicity and environmental hazard were assessed through quantitative structure-activity relationship computations. In addition, the minimal inhibition concentrations were determined for Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis. Conclusions for UV-C irradiation as a fourth purification wastewater treatment stage were derived.

AB  - Determination of the variability in the salivary proteome is a prerequisite for the development of saliva as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in particular physiological states. In this context, it is important that technical variability induced by sample collection and processing is kept at minimum to be able to reproducibly assess variability in states of health and disease. In the current study, the proteome profile in unstimulated and stimulated whole, parotid and sublingual saliva was investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Saliva samples were structurally collected from ten examined and characterized healthy individuals during the exactly same conditions. The results demonstrated that different collection methods provide clear differences in the snapshot of the salivary proteome and also in the relative amount of specific proteins. The variable nature of the salivary proteome suggests that different approaches may have to be adopted when studying its composition or its possible role as an indicator for particular physiological states. The results emphasize the importance of consistency when collecting saliva samples for proteomic analysis.

AB  - Batch drying was performed in the pulsed fluidized bed with various species of biomass particles as an indicator of gas-solid contact efficiency and mass transfer rate under different operating conditions including pulsation duty cycle and particle size distribution. The fluidization of cohesive biomass particles benefited from the shorter opening time of pulsed gas flow and increased peak pressure drop. The presence of fines enhanced gas-solid contact of large and irregular biomass particles, as well as the mass transfer efficiency. A drying model based on two-phase theory was proposed, from which effective diffusivity was calculated for various gas flow rates, temperature and pulsation frequency. Intricate relationship was discovered between pulsation frequency and effective diffusivity, as mass transfer was deeply connected with the hydrodynamics. Effective diffusivity was also found to be proportional to gas flow rate and drying temperature. Operating near the natural frequency of the system also favored drying and mass transfer.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship of microeconomic parameters and subjective job insecurity perceptions with vocational commitment, i.e. commitment towards one's job, occupation and career in a sample of 236 individuals, nested in 47 German administrative districts. Applying a multilevel approach, job insecurity (quantitative and qualitative) and vocational commitment indicators (operationalized via job involvement, occupational commitment and career satisfaction) were measured at the individual level, whereas microeconomic parameters were collected at the level of administrative district. In addition to regional unemployment rates, we included two further economic parameters, namely change in gainful employment (i.e., change in a district's number of gainful workers) and change in economic growth (i.e., change in a district's GDP). It is worth noting that our findings only revealed spillover effects from economic parameters on qualitative (not quantitative) job insecurity on a bivariate level (not after considering controls in multilevel regressions). Cross-level interactions further indicated that environmental economic conditions are important for the relationship between subjective job insecurity perceptions and outcomes.

AB  - After almost 2000 years of local development, including limited trading with neighboring ethnic groups, the societies that occupied the oases of San Pedro de Atacama, Northern Chile, became part of the trade web of the Tiwanaku empire, between 500 and 1000 CE. Archaeological evidence tends to support the idea that the period under the influence of the altiplano (high plane) empire was very affluent. Here we investigate the possibility that this affluence had a positive impact on the health status of the Atacameneans, using the oral health as an indirect indicator of quality of life. Dental decay, dental abscess, dental wear, linear enamel hypoplasia, periodontal disease and dental calculus were analyzed on 371 skeletons from 12 sites from San Pedro de Atacama oases. We believe that if, indeed, there were better biological conditions during the altiplano influence, this could have been caused by the access to a more diversified food intake promoted by the intensification of the trading network established by Tiwanaku in the central-south Andes, of which San Pedro de Atacama became an important node.

AB  - Free cooling systems use phase change materials (PCMs) to store outdoor cold during the night and to supply it to the indoor environment during the day when the need for cooling increases. This work presents a numerical investigation of the performance enhancement of a free cooling system using a latent heat thermal storage (LHTS) unit employing multiple PCMs. The PCM storage system consists of several flat PCM slabs arranged in layers with a passage in between for the heat transfer fluid (HTF). Using the effective heat capacity method, the process of melting and solidification of the PCM is predicted. The energy storage effectiveness (as a new performance parameter for LHTS units) and coefficient of performance (COP) of the system are calculated. These two performance indicators are used to optimize the system. The suitability of both methods for optimization purpose is discussed indicating the superiority of the energy based (COP) method.

AB  - Cresol Red (CR) pH indicator was encapsulated into silica network using the sol-gel process. Transparent monolithic disks of entrapped CR were obtained in the presence of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) or dodecyl dimethyl amino oxide (Genaminox LA,GLA) alkyl hydroxyethyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (HY, R = 12-14) and TX-100 surfactants. UV/VIS spectra showed that the encapsulated CR retains its structure in terms of its response to pH. At the neutral conditions it is found that the HY surfactant is considered as proton donor as favor the cationic form of the indicator, while CTAB surfactant favor the neutral, however GLA surfactant, the anionic form of CR is more favored because GLA has a zwitterionic head. The surfactant GLA with TEOS has shifted the equilibrium to the ionized form of CR due to the electrostatic interaction between the surfactant and the CR anion. Therefore their pH range is dependent on the nature of a surfactant used. It is found that the HY surfactant is more efficient as far as loading of CR is concern and it widened the working pH range.

AB  - Hun-tan norovirus (NoV) causes outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis associated with many ready-to-eat foods, including fresh produce. Effective inactivation procedures must consider virus survival under conditions of produce production and processing. This study aimed to investigate the persistence of NoV in a variety of environments, using murine NoV (MNV) as a surrogate for NoV. MNV was incubated for up to 42 days at room temperature on stainless steel disks, on lettuce, on soil, and in potable water and titers determined by plaque assay. A 1-log reduction of MNV infectivity was observed after 29 days in water, 4 days on lettuce., 12 days on soil, and 15 days on stainless steel disks. MNV survived longer in water than in any of the other environments, indicating that drying may contribute to NoV inactivation. MNV genomes were not significantly reduced for up to 42 days, suggesting that genomic detection is not a reliable indicator of viability. Overall, our findings provide valuable information regarding the potential for NoV transmission in the food supply.

AB  - Quartz grain surface micro textures of 12 samples collected from the beach were examined under scanning electron microscopy to understand the role of coastal processes on their transportation and deposition. The study area has been divided into three sectors on the basis of drainage, geomorphology and nature of the beach and shelf topography. Surface textures of the northern sector display an array of mechanical features like conchoidal fracture, V marks and impact pits, indicating the dominance of mechanical processes. However, silica precipitation in the form of globules indicates an added influence of chemical processes in the Northern sector. The presence of chemical features in northern sector, where energy level is high, corroborates the addition of quartz grains from paleo-sediments, from the nearby Tertiary and Cretaceous formations. Central sector quartz grains display the signatures of chemical and mechanical processes. The presence of step like furrows in southern sector is an indicator of fluvial low energy conditions, and supplements the role of littoral currents in depositing the quartz grains along the coastal region.

AB  - Following upon the expression 'socialism of the skin', used by the playwright Tony Kushner in his essay so named, this article attempts to demonstrate that there is a 'Fascism of the skin'. An intensively consumptive capitalist society commodifies everything in its path, including the body, thus subtly shifting the manner in which the mind itself incorporates the body into its calculations. Evidence is taken from popular culture and from the aestheticization and medicalization of the body to support the hypothesis that alienation as a process and a condition finds ever new means of expression as it becomes incarnated through the commodification and carnivalization of the body. Prior studies of 'Jerry Springer' and Arnold Schwarzenegger are reanalyzed to throw light on this process. The language of the contemporary military adventure in Iraq also provides interesting insights into the nature of accounts of the body and how bodies are accounted for. In these instances, a 'Fascism of the skin' can be recognized, in which the alienation of the body and the mind reworks the individual into a commodity and a function.

AB  - The paper investigates the ameliorative properties of pine cultures in their site conditions on the island of Rab. Pines, as allochthonous and pioneer species, were used to afforest degraded and devastated areas on the island because of their important role in the process of progressive vegetation succession. Twelve sample plots were established in the forest pine cultures. They encompassed various pine cultures (maritime pine, Aleppo pine and black pine) in diverse parent substrates (limestone. reddish-brown quartz sand, Flysch) and different soil types (eutric cambisol, cambisol on limestone, red soil and rendzina). To process the data, the following multivariate analyses were used: Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN), Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Indicator Species Analysis. The research results showed differences among the forest cultures of black pine, Aleppo pine and maritime pine. A relationship was found between the quantitative environmental variables (slope, PH, humus, the C/N ratio, age and the quantity of leaf litter) and the vegetation. As well as the relationship of the species towards qualitative variables (type of pine culture, parent substrate, soil type, exposition). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Driving patterns (i.e., speed, acceleration and choice of gears) influence exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. The aim here is to obtain a better understanding of the variables that affect driving patterns, by determining the extent they are influenced by street characteristics and/or driver-car categories. A data set of over 14,000 driving patterns registered in actual traffic is used. The relationship between driving patterns and recorded variables is analysed. The most complete effect is found for the variables describing the street environment: occurrence and density of junctions controlled by traffic lights, speed limit, street function and type of neighbourhood. A fairly large effect is found for car performance, expressed in terms of the power-to-mass ratio. For elderly drivers, the average speed systematically decreases for all street types and stop time systematically increases on arterials. The results have implications for the assessment of environmental effects through appropriate street categorisation in emission models, as well as the possible reduction of environmental effects through better traffic planning and management, driver education and car design.

AB  - The death kinetics of Escherichia coli O157:H7, E. coli type 1 and total coliforms after irradiation treatment in minced beef were evaluated to analyze the effect of increasing irradiation doses. Irradiation doses ranging from 0.0 kGy to 1.5 kGy were evaluated for reducing numbers of E. coli during frozen storage conditions at -18degreesC for 30 days. D(10)values of E. coli O157:H7, E. coli type 1, and total coliforms were 0.245 kGy, 0.552 kGy and 0.293 kGy, respectively. An irradiation dose of 1.5 kGy was shown to inactivate 10(5) MPN/g of serotype O157:H7 and 10(3) MPN/g of E. coli type 1. This inactivation level might be considered safe for the consumption of minced beef. Finally, E. coli type 1 was found to be a suitable indicator for assessing the impact of irradiation on E. coli O157:H7 serotype. There was no significant change in numbers of bacteria during frozen storage.

AB  - Black alder (Alnus glutinosa Gaertn.) is considered a hygrophilous species. The aim,of the research was to find out if black alder may play a role of a pioneer species in the habitat of Tilio-Carpinetum typicum Traczvk 1962, i.e. fresh oak-linden-hornbeam forest. The investigation was carried out in Bialowieza Forest (East Poland). The vegetation was examined with the Braun-Blanquet (1928) method. Soil diagnosis was based on the analysis of soil profiles and a network of test borings. Ecological differentiation of the phytocoenoses in terms of light, humidity, and fertility factors was analysed by indicator values of vascular plants. Obtained results showed that black alder may play, the role of a pioneer species in the habitat of fresh oak-linden-hornbeam forest (Tilio-Carpinetum typicum). This phenomenon may occur on haplic luvisols underlayed with clay, after clear-cuts bigger than 1 hectare. Secondary plant communities with black alder that develop in such conditions reveal characteristics of wet oak-linden-hornbeam forest (Tilio-Carpinetum stachyetosum Traczyk 1962).

AB  - Zooseston of the Vistula River section almost 340 km long was investigated in the years 1997/98. In 99 samples collected 90 species of rotifers, 16 cladocerans, 9 copepods and other animals belonging to: Harpacticoidea, Oligochaeta, Nematoda, Chironomidae, Odonata, Simulidae, Tardigrada and Coelenterata were found. Multiple regression analysis showed that the number of rotifers is significantly correlated with basic chemical indicators of water trophic state - phosphate, nitrate and nitrite as well as with the number of copepods which are usually predators. The numbers of copepods depends on the availability of possible prey, i.e. rotifers and cladocerans. Multiple regression confirmed known dependence of cladocerans from trophic conditions. Clustering of similarity matrices showed complex structure of sestonic assemblages on rhitral-potamal gradient additionally modified by hydrotechnical constructions. These constructions broke old river continuum. Ordination of sites gave complex pattern not only representing a simple gradient rithral - potamal but also all transient stages caused by hydrotechnical construction (large dam reservoir) or by inflows of polluted waters from the tributaries. Ecological meaning of principal component ordination (PC) for river zooseston assemblages is not simple and might be susceptible of various interpretations.
