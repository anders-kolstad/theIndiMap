AB  - The products of honey bees can be used as indicators and monitors of a variety of environmental pollutants because of the bees' ability to collect materials that reflect their immediate environmental conditions. Human activities produce more waste and administrate the pesticides, the amounts and toxicity of which often exceed the environment's homeostatic capacity to cleanse itself, and this is constantly transforming due to intensive agricultural practices necessary to increase food production as human population grows. The main sources for contamination of honey with heavy metals are represented by placing hives near urban areas with heavy car traffic, or industrialized areas and the use on the entire circuit of production, objects or containers made of materials unsuitable (unacceptable), For that reason regular monitoring of the environment is so important. Honey bees, thanks to their morphological features, and also bee products are regarded as good indicators of environmental pollution by toxic substances, be these heavy metals, radioactive elements or persistent organic pollutants such as pesticides. Consequently it is important to estimate the environmental fate and Eco toxicological effects of these different xenobiotic. Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) have been used as biological indicators of Plant Protection Products (PPPs) in two intensely cultivated in areas of Neamt County, Romania. This area is representative for the pre-mountain and mountain zone of Romania. The stratified sample has been face-to-face interviewed in 2016 regarding the data from the year 2015. The total consumption specific for the honey production was about 628 MJ hive(-1), and the energy output reached 235 MJ hive(-1) determining an energy productivity of 0.030 kg MJ(-1) and an energy use efficiency of 0.37, Specific energy amounted 33.3MJ kg(-1) due to the inefficiency of traveling during the apiaries movements and the inappropriate correlation between the apiaries size and the zonal melliferous potentialln this paper available literature data and information on the morphological features of the honey bee, the utilization of the honey bee and its products as indicators of environmental pollution, and a historical outline of some of the legislation relating to beekeeping have been critically compared and discussed.

AB  - The amphipod fauna was employed to investigate a bottom environmental gradient in the continental shelf adjacent to Santos Bay. The constant flow of less saline water from the estuarine complex of the Santos and Sao Vicente rivers besides the seasonal intrusion of the cold saline South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) bring a highly dynamic water regime to the area. Density, distribution, diversity and functional structure of the communities were studied on a depth gradient from 10 to 100 m on two cruises in contrasting seasons, winter 2005 and summer 2006. Twenty-one sediment samples were taken with a 0.09m(2) box corer. Temperature and salinity were measured at each station and an additional surface sediment sample was obtained with the box corer for granulometric and chemical analyses. Sixty species were collected on each survey and higher density values were found in summer. A priori one-way Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) indicated the existence of three different groups of amphipods related to the depth gradient: the Coastal group, the Mixed Zone group and the Deep Zone group. The Coastal Zone in both cruises was inhabited by a community presenting low diversity and density, besides high dominance of the infaunal tube-dweller Ampelisca paria; the area around 30 m presented the highest values of all the ecological indicators and the species showed several life styles; the outer area, situated between 50 and 100 m depth in the SACW domain, presented a community characterized by lower diversity and high biomass and density values. A season-depth ANOSIM showed the influence of depth and season for the Coastal and Mixed Zone groups whereas no seasonal difference was obtained for the Deep Zone group. The synergistic effect of the SACW and depth in the first place, followed by physical changes in substrate, seem to be the main factors controlling the fauna's distribution. In addition, the estuarine waters from Santos Bay apparently had no effect on the establishment of the environmental gradient observed on the adjacent shelf. Diversity, distribution, functional groups and trophic conditions of superficial sediments are discussed in the light of the main oceanographic processes present on the southern Brazilian shelf.

AB  - Aims: This paper presents a research on the disinfection efficiency of inoculated textile swatches by compressed carbon dioxide, an environmental friendly way to disinfect textiles as opposed to the conventional laundering procedures using water. The disinfection efficiency was determined by using the following microbes inoculated on cotton test fabrics: Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes and Candida albicans.
   Methods and Results: The experiments were performed using the high pressure extraction device with a maximum pressure of 50 MPa and a small extraction vessel of 500 ml. Pure CO2 and CO2 with added disinfection agent or commercial detergent were used. The chosen disinfecting agent was hydrogen peroxide, a widespread disinfecting chemical. It was found that treatment with CO2 for 25 min at 5 MPa and 40 degrees C (313K) and the addition of 4 ml of specific detergent per litre of CO2 assures at least a five log step reduction of Enterobacter aerogenes and C. albicans, whilst treatment at 50 degrees C (323K) with CO2 for 25 min at 5 MPa is sufficient for at least a five log step reduction for Enterococcus faecium. It was also found that a 15-min CO2 treatment at 7 MPa and 20 degrees C (293K) was sufficient for the inactivation of the yeast C. albicans, whilst these conditions were not rigorous enough for the challenge bacteria. On the other hand, the labscale treatment with CO2 for 25 min at pressure 4 and 6 MPa with the addition of detergent or hydrogen peroxide only yields a log step reduction of up to 4 log steps, thus proving the slightly disinfective properties of the CO2 treatment with added agents, but not reaching efficient results as a 5 log step reduction was not reached.
   Conclusions: Addition of heat to the compressed CO2 treatment of textiles inoculated with microorganisms proved more effective than the addition of detergent or disinfectant with compressed CO2 treatment at temperature of 20 degrees C.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: CO2 treatment of textiles is a promising ecological alternative dry-cleaning method for the disinfection of medical textiles.

AB  - Agriculture is deeply interconnected with weather and climate, the main drivers of agriculture production, but also the dominant factors in the overall variability of food production. Agriculture constitutes the principal livelihood of 70% of the world's poor; many of them are hungry and living in vulnerable, climate-sensitive areas. Since the undernourished population reached 1 billion persons in 2009, raising food production by some 70% to meet the needs of a projected world population of 9.1 billion people in 2050 may be one of the greatest challenges of the century. In addition, changes in climatic conditions are already having impacts on agriculture and the use of natural resources for food production. Climate science has much to offer in addressing these challenges, especially with respect to the characterisation of agroclimatic resources and development of climate-responsive food and agriculture policies, programmes and practices. However, as food systems expand into marginal and vulnerable areas, the need for a renewed, holistic focus is becoming evident, taking into account ecological, economic and social perspectives. Climate and agriculture services must therefore consider climate as a resource, understand current and future vulnerabilities and risks, and develop synergies that embrace innovation in climate science in order to facilitate sustainable agriculture and food security. The emerging ability of climate science to provide timely and accurate climate information, together with innovative tools and methods for analysis, presents opportunities for managing current climate risks and for initiating strategic climate-resilient adaptation in agriculture. However, to make effective use of these advancements, action-oriented climate advice should integrate information on different time scales (intra-seasonal, seasonal and long-term) for risk/opportunity management and strategies for optimal and sustainable use of land, water and genetic resources. Strong partnerships and collaboration among international institutions, national hydrometeorological services, agricultural extension agencies, national research institutions, community-based organisations and social networks are a prerequisite for the advancement of action-oriented advice. All of these efforts present key challenges, but offer immense opportunities, for both climate science and agriculture services, with respect to supporting sustainable agriculture and food security.

AB  - Management indicator species (MIS) often are selected because their life history and demographics are thought to reflect a suite of ecosystem conditions that are too difficult or costly to measure directly. The northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) has been proposed as an MIS of temperate rain forest of southeastern Alaska based on previous studies in the Pacific Northwest that demonstrated its habitat is multi-factorial, i.e., an emergent property of old-growth forest. We evaluated the suitability of flying squirrels as MIS in temperate rain forests of Alaska by modeling seasonal (spring, autumn) microhabitat use with stepwise logistic regression (SLR) using either individual habitat variables (n = 26) or multivariate habitat "factors," which were linear combinations of individual habitat variables generated from factor analysis. We compared the efficacy of single variable vs. multivariate factor models in explaining variation in microhabitat use to test the hypothesis that the habitat of flying squirrels in southeastern Alaska was an emergent property of old-growth rain forest. The underlying premise was that if factors were more thorough in explaining microhabitat use, the habitat of flying squirrels was multifactorial; that is, it consisted of multiple late-seral forest attributes occurring coincidentally at usable spatial scales (e.g., home range). SLR models with multivariate factors performed poorer in predicting capture sites than models of individual habitat variables. Two variables, density of large (> 74 cm dbh) trees and understory cover of Vaccinium, explained much of the variation in microhabitat use. We conclude that the habitat of G. sabrinus in southeastern Alaska does not reflect emergent properties of old-growth forest in southeastern Alaska and hypothesize that this pattern may be related to regional ecological differences that facilitate a more general lifestyle than populations in the Pacific Northwest. Furthermore, the effectiveness of Glaucomys sabrinus as an MIS in north temperate rain forest is suspect, illustrating that regional differences in ecology of a species warrant caution when considering the suitability of MIS among geographic areas.

AB  - Establishing habitat in agricultural landscapes of the north central United States is critical to reversing the decline of North America's eastern monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) population. Insecticide use could create population sinks and threaten recovery. Discouraging habitat establishment within a 38-m zone around crop fields is a suggested risk mitigation measure. In Story County, Iowa, United States, this mitigation would discourage habitat establishment in 84% of roadsides and 38% of noncrop land. It is unclear if the conservation benefits from establishing habitat close to crop fields outweigh suppression of population growth owing to insecticide exposure. Consequently, monarch conservation plans require spatially and temporally explicit landscape-scale assessments. Using an agent-based model that incorporates female monarch movement and egg laying, the number and location of eggs laid in Story County were simulated for four habitat scenarios: current condition, maximum new establishment, moderate establishment, and moderate establishment only outside a 38-m no-plant zone around crop fields. A demographic model incorporated mortality from natural causes and insecticide exposure to simulate adult monarch production over 10 years. Assuming no insecticide exposure, simulated adult production increased 24.7% and 9.3%, respectively, with maximum and moderate habitat establishment and no planting restrictions. A 3.5% increase was simulated assuming moderate habitat establishment with a 38-m planting restriction. Impacts on adult production were simulated for six representative insecticides registered for soybean aphid (Aphis glycines) management. Depending on the frequency of insecticide applications over a 10-year period, simulated production increased 8.2%-9.3%, assuming moderate habitat establishment with no planting restrictions. Results suggest that the benefits of establishing habitat close to crop fields outweigh the adverse effects of insecticide spray drift; that is, metapopulation extirpation is not a concern for monarchs. These findings are only applicable to species that move at spatial scales greater than the scale of potential spray-drift impacts. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2021;00:1-14. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background Anthropogenic disturbances are increasingly affecting the vitality of tropical dry forests. The future condition of this important biome will depend on its capability to resist and recover from these disturbances. So far, the temporal stability of dryland forests is rarely studied, even though identifying the important factors associated with the stability of the dryland forests could serve as a basis for forest management and restoration. Methodology In a degraded dry Afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia, we explored remote sensing derived indicators of forest stability, using MODIS satellite derived NDVI time series from 2001 to 2018. Resilience and resistance were measured using the anomalies (remainders) after time series decomposition into seasonality, trend and remainder components. Growth stability was calculated using the integral of the undecomposed NDVI data. These NDVI derived stability indicators were then related to environmental factors of climate, topography, soil, tree species diversity, and local human disturbance, obtained from a systematic grid of field inventory plots, using boosted regression trees in R. Results Resilience and resistance were adequately predicted by these factors with an R-2 of 0.67 and 0.48, respectively, but the model for growth stability was weaker. Precipitation of the wettest month, distance from settlements and slope were the most important factors associated with resilience, explaining 51% of the effect. Altitude, temperature seasonality and humus accumulation were the significant factors associated with the resistance of the forest, explaining 61% of the overall effect. A positive effect of tree diversity on resilience was also important, except that the impact of species evenness declined above a threshold value of 0.70, indicating that perfect evenness reduced the resilience of the forest. Precipitation of the wettest month was the most important factor explaining 43.52% of the growth stability variation. Conclusion A combination of climate, topographic factors and local human disturbance controlled the stability of the dry forest. Also tree diversity is an important stability component that should be considered in the management and restoration programs of such degraded forests. If local disturbances are alleviated the recovery time of dryland forests could be shortened, which is vital to maintain the ecosystem services these forests provide to local communities and global climate change.

AB  - Nutrient resorption efficiency (NuRE), an important plant functional trait, is closely related to plant nutrient utilization and biogeochemical cycling. Under severe aridity and salinity stress, plants developed various strategies to adapt to these adverse conditions after long-term structural and functional evolution in desert ecosystems. However, the impact of arid environment on plant nutrient resorption remains uncertain for desert halophytes. Here we compared the nitrogen and phosphorus resorption efficiency (NRE and PRE) among four desert plant groups (i.e., euhalophytes, secretohalophytes, pseudohalophytes and glycophytes) and analyzed the responses of NuRE to drought and saline indicators within and across the four plant groups. Our results demonstrated that the NRE and PRE of all desert plants were averagely 52.8% and 57.1%, respectively. Pseudohalophytes had significantly higher NRE (59.9%) and glycophytes had significantly lower PRE (53.2%) than the other groups. Besides, the relative resorption efficiencies (NRE - PRE) were significantly lower than zero for euhalophytes, secretohalophytes, and overall plants, but non-significantly different from zero for pseudohalophytes and glycophytes, suggesting that euhalophytes and secretohalophytes were generally P-limited: they tend to resorb more P than N from senescing leaves; but pseudohalophytes and glycophytes were both N- and Plimited: they resorb N and P in a balanced way (the relative resorption hypothesis). NuRE of the three halophytic groups responded to drought and saline stress in a generally consistent way: both NRE and PRE significantly increased with increasing water-stress (lower soil water stress coefficient (Ksoil) and aridity index (AI)) and salinity-stress (higher soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC)), although the relationships between PRE of euhalophytes and these four indicators, and between PRE of the three halophytic groups and soil EC, were nonsignificant. By contrary, NRE of the glycophytes showed a non-significant relation with water stress indicators (Ksoil) and soil EC. Overall, the patterns of NuRE in desert plants with different salt propensity suggest the evolutionary divergence (halophytes vs glycophytes) and convergence (euhalophytes, secretohalophytes, and pseudohalophytes) strategies in response to salinity and water stress. These findings provide a new perspective for understanding the nutrient resorption strategies of desert plants, and may also help better predict the nutrients biogeochemical cycling in desert ecosystem under global climate changes.

AB  - As the majority of Polish population lives in towns, there is a growing need to spend the rest time in natural conditions, explicitly in forest areas. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of natural resources of the Poleski National Park (PNP; eastern Poland) on the development of tourism within its area. We identified the factors with the greatest impact on the tourist attractiveness of PNP areas as well as assessed the level of management of this area in tourist-recreational infrastructure and availability of information about on the Park. Diagnostic survey with the original questionnaire was used as a research tool. The studies were conducted in September and October 2016 in Hadsk, Stary Brus, Urszulin and Sosnowica communes among adult residents divided into three age groups. Likert scale was used for the measurement of the respondents attitude. A sample size was established based the total adult population of four municipalities. The discriminant function was used for statistical calculations. The biggest attractions of the PNP include nature reserves, nature trails and the PNP museum. The Park is considered to be one of the most beautiful ones in Poland, with rich landscape and possible contact with unique fauna and flora. The prestige of the Park was an important factor of the attractiveness in respondents opinion. It is possible to rest actively in PNP what is supported by good management of the studied areas in the tourism-recreation infrastructure. The excellent marking of the hiking trails as well as the location of numerous information boards used by tourists were emphasised by the respondents. It seems that if taking reasonable care to protect natural resources, the PNP may be even to a greater extent subject to more complete spatial-functional management, in particular for the creation of new tourist products. In harmony with nature they determine types and forms of tourism, which can be developed in this region. These tasks fall within the competence and responsibility of the PNP authorities. The priority is to maintain an acceptable level of impact through checks and planned arrangements of indicators of tourist absorbency and capacity of these areas.

AB  - Recruitment processes are critical components of a plant's life cycle. However, in comparison with later stages in the plant life cycle (e.g. competition among adults), relatively little is known about their contribution to the regulation of plant species distribution. Particularly, little is known about the individual contributions of the three main recruitment processes - germination, seedling survival and seedling growth - to community assembly, while quantitative information on these contributions is essential for a more mechanistic understanding of the regulation of plant species distribution and biodiversity.
   Riparian zones along streams provide a globally-relevant case study for evaluating the importance of the different stages of plant recruitment. The natural hydrological gradients of stream riparian zones are currently being restored after a period of world-wide habitat degradation. To identify how recruitment contributes to vegetation patterns and biodiversity in riparian zones, we carried out field experiments at restored lowland streams. We quantified the germination of introduced seeds, and survival and growth of introduced seedlings of 17 riparian plant species across a gradient from the stream channel to upland.
   The hydrological gradient of riparian zones acted as a strong environmental filter on all three recruitment processes, through imposing an abiotic limitation (excess water) at low elevations and a resource limitation (water shortage) at higher elevations. Other variables, suchas soil organic matter content and nutrient availability, only affected recruitment marginally.
   Species-specific patterns of environmental filtering initiated niche segregation along the riparian gradient during all three recruitment processes, but particularly during germination and seedling growth. These recruitment niches appeared strongly related to indicator values for adult distribution optima, suggesting that at least some riparian plant species may have evolutionary adaptations that promote recruitment under favourable hydrological conditions for adult growth and reproduction.
   Our results suggest that strong environmental filtering during germination and seedling growth plays an important role in determining later adult distributions, by forming the spatial template on which all subsequent processes operate. In addition to well-known mechanisms, such as competitive exclusion at the adult stage, environmental filtering during early recruitment stages already strongly affect plant distribution and diversity.

AB  - Long-term subaqueous decomposition patterns of Eve different vascular plant tissues including mangrove leaves and wood (Avicennia germinans), cypress needles and wood (Taxodium distichum), and smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) were followed for a period of 4.0 years, representing the longest litter bag decomposition study to date. All tissues decomposed under identical conditions and final mass losses were 97, 68, 86, 39, and 93%, respectively. Analysis of the lignin component of herbaceous tissues using alkaline CuO oxidation was complicated by the presence of a substantial ester-bound phenol component composed primarily of cinnamyl phenols. To overcome this problem, we introduce a new parameter to represent lignin, Lambda 6.Lambda(6), is comprised only of the six syringyl and vanillyl phenols and was found to be much less sensitive to diagenetic variation than the commonly used parameter Lambda, which includes the cinnamyl phenols. Patterns of change in lignin content were strongly dependent on tissue type, ranging from 77% enrichment in smooth cordgrass to 6% depletion in cypress needles. In contrast, depletion of cutin was extensive (65-99%) in all herbaceous tissues. Despite these differences in the overall reactivity of lignin and cutin, both macromolecules were extensively degraded during the decomposition period.
   The long-term decomposition series also provided very useful information about the compositional parameters which are derived from the specific oxidation products of both lignin and cutin. The relative lability of ester-bound cinnamyl phenols compromised their use in parameters to distinguish woody from herbaceous plant debris. The dimer to monomer ratios of lignin-derived phenols indicated that most inter-monomeric linkages in lignin degraded at similar rates. Acid to aldehyde ratios of vanillyl and syringyl phenols became elevated, particularly during the latter stages of decomposition supporting the use of these parameters as indicators of diagenetic alteration. Given the observation that cutin-derived source indicator parameters were generally more sensitive to diagenetic alteration than those of lignin, we suggest the distributional patterns of cutin-derived acids and their associated positional isomers may be most useful for tissue-specific distinctions complementing the general categorical information obtained from lignin phenol analysis alone.

AB  - Lavandula genus is a considerable medicinal plant in pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. Considering increasing threat of drought in the world, it is important to identify genotypes which can tolerate drought. It is also important to characterize quantity and quality of essential oils, and tolerance indicators of these genotypes against drought stress. Therefore, an experiment was conducted in Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Iran, during 2017 and 2018, to investigate these factors. It was a factorial experiment based on randomized complete block design with two treatments, three genotypes (Lavandula angustifolia cv. Hidcote, Lavandula angustifolia cv. Munstead, and Lavandula stricta), and four levels of drought stress (irrigation regimes) (I-1: 100-90% (control), I-2: 80-70%, I-3: 60-50% and I-4: 30-40% of field capacity) which was done with three repetitions. Drought increased amount of proline in leaves, antioxidant activity, activity of catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide enzymes, malondialdehyde content, total flavonoids, total phenol, total sugar and essential oil percentage. The PCA analysis of different irrigation regimes showed that in the first component, the best traits are antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD, APX, while in the second component, only the trait Catalase is the best trait. The results of PCA analysis in lavender genotypes showed that L. stricta exhibits the most affected physiological changes while trying to adjust to changes in the water status of the environment, under the imposed conditions and shows the highest resistance. But it reduced dry weight of aerial parts, relative water content of leaves, and efficacy of essential oil. Lavandula stricta genotype had the highest amount of essential oil, but the highest dry weight of the aerial parts and essential oil yield were related to L. angustifolia cv. Hidcote and L. angustifolia cv. Munstead genotypes. In all evaluated genotypes, with increasing drought stress, monoterpene compounds were decreased and sesquiterpene compounds were increased. Totally it was shown that drought effect on evaluated traits depends on genotype and nature of traits; this indicates that by choosing drought-tolerant genotypes in breeding programs, high quantity and quality of essential oil, as well as tolerance to drought stress can be achieved.

AB  - Sewage disposal of enterprises of wood-based industries contain toxic phenolic compounds in concentrations that exceed the admissible limit values. There is small data on the methods of their destruction in the literature, consequently, an oxidative method of purification of sewage disposal from the Ufa plywood slab plant using ozone was investigated. The optimum conditions of ozonation were determined by the kinetic curves of phenol decompounding. The highest, purification rate is achieved at pH = 11.5, temperature 23 degrees C and an ozone dose of 5 g/dm(3) at the initial concentration of phenol 0.263 mg/dm(3). It was found that the initial concentration of phenol in sewage disposal substantially affects the oxidation processes. Three samples of wastewater were taken for the study: initial sewage disposal, water purified by the coagulant Al-2(SO4)(3) and water scrubbed by the above mentioned coagulant and flocculant-cationic polyacrylamide of REF FC line. The phenol concentration decreases from 0.263 to 0.034 mg/dm(3) in 40 minutes at the time of ozonizing the initial drain water. The concentration of phenol in the explored sewage disposal after cleaning with a coagulant and ozonization decreases during 30 minutes from 0.09 to 0.031 mg/drn(3). Ozonizing the drain water after cleaning with coagulation and flocculation allows to achieve the required effect in 20 minutes. The concentration of phenol varies from 0.05 to 0.01 mg/dm(3) and chemical oxygen demand (COL)) is reduced by 70%. There was investigated ozonization with the use of catalysts: homogeneous (Fe2+) and heterogeneous (Fe2O3) as well. The best results of phenol disintegration are obtained in homogeneous catalysis, however, the disadvantage of the process is the need to remove the ferric form compounds and keeping up an acidic environment. The effect of COD purification by catalytic drain water ozonation increased by 15% and reached 75% (after the physico-chemical method of cleaning with a coagulant and flocculant). There are given physico-chemical indicators of the quality of the initial sewage disposal and after its purification in the study. The purification method studied allows to reduce the phenol level to the quality target. Provisinal ozonation of sewage increases the efficiency of further biological treatment.

AB  - Study of the most important biological processes (seasonal plant growth and development) is of great importance in the theory and practice of plant growing. The investigations are carried out in southern Karelia (middle taiga subzone, Botanical Garden of Petrozavodsk State University) from May to October 1998-2012 to determine the characteristics of growth and development of Juniperus communis L. under the influence of the major climatic factors. The object of study is plants, growing under the canopy of a pine forest and in the exposed place. The number of individuals in each group is 25. Regardless of the shade density, J. communis shoot growth begins at the same time. on May 26. The peak time of shoot growth of this species is hardly differ. May 31 - June 1. However, the maximum shoot growth of plants under the canopy (0.64 mm) is 78 % higher than in the exposed place. The final time of shoot growth in both studied groups coincides - August 1. The duration of their formation in the shade and in the light is almost the same - 71... 73 days. The effect of air temperature and solar radiation on the intensity of the shoot growth in the exposed place (respectively 68 and 20 %) is significantly higher than in the shade (20 and 7 %). These data, as well as reducing the intensity of plant shoot growth in the exposed place indicate the significant negative impact of increased air temperature and direct solar radiation on J. communis plants. We reveal a significant (3-4 fold) positive influence of air humidity and precipitation on the shoot growth of J. communis under the forest canopy than in the exposed place. The majority of phenophases of J. communis under the full exposure to sunlight begins and ends a few days later than in the shade. The previous studies have demonstrated a high degree of adaptation of plants, "early beginning" and "early finishing" the phenophases. Therefore, this indicator of J. communis plants under the forest canopy is higher than in the exposed place. The optimal conditions for the growth and development of the studied species in the taiga zone are formed only under the forest canopy, in the shade.

AB  - We analyzed nutrient data from a probability Survey of 1392 wadeable streams across the 48 conterminous states of the US and from intensified survey data in 921 streams in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) to examine different methods of setting nutrient criteria and to develop a nutrient stream typology. We Calculated potential nutrient criteria for total P (TP) and total N (TN) by 3 methods (ecoregion population 25(th) percentile of population, least-disturbed reference-site 75(th) percentile, and disturbance modeling) and compared them with existing draft US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) criteria within 14 national nutrient ecoregions. All criteria derived from the methods were highly correlated; however, absolute values within ecoregions differed greatly among approaches. Population 25(th) percentiles of TP were almost always lower from statistically designed survey data than from found data. TN percentiles were more similar than were TP profiles, but they still tended to be lower from survey data than from found data. TP and TN population 25(th) percentiles were lower (often by a factor of 2-6) than reference-site 75(th) percentiles in all ecoregions. This result indicates that population 25(th) percentiles cannot be used as Surrogates for reference-site 75(th) percentiles. Thirty-nine percent of the assessed national stream length exceeded TP criteria and 47%, exceeded TN criteria when compared to nutrient criteria based on EPA Wadeable Stream Assessment reference-site 75(th) percentiles. In the PNW data set, all disturbance regression model estimates of background nutrient concentrations were lower than reference-site 75th percentiles. Regression tree analysis based on PNW reference sites used runoff, elevation, acid neutralizing capacity, forest composition, substrate size, and Omernik level III ecoregion as environmental class predictors to explain 46 to 48% of the total deviance in nutrient concentration. Reference-site nutrient concentrations varied widely among Omernik level III ecoregions in nutrient ecoregion II. Our analysis and the literature suggest that 14 national nutrient ecoregions are too coarse to account for natural variation in stream strongly nutrient concentrations. Setting appropriate national nutrient criteria will require finer-scale typology or classification of sites that better controls for natural variation.

AB  - Addressing growing threats of overexploitation to the world's oceans is especially challenging in the High Seas, where limited data and international jurisdiction make it difficult to determine where and when conservation measures are necessary. Of particular concern are vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs)- special habitats on the seafloor that are highly sensitive to disturbance and slow to recover. To ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of marine resources, regional fisheries management organizations are committed to identifying the locations of VMEs and responding to prevent significant adverse impacts (SAIs). For over 50 years, Cobb Seamount-a shallow underwater volcanic mountain in the Northeast Pacific Ocean- has been commercially fished by multiple nations using various types of gear. Here we have assimilated data from fisheries records and a recent visual survey on the seamount. Our findings show a variety of habitat-forming emergent biological structures widely distributed on Cobb Seamount and generally depth-stratified into high-density assemblages (>= 1 m(-2)). Our spatial analyses show that fishing has also been widely distributed, overlapping the habitat of the biological structures. We found fewer coldwater corals, sponges, and other biological structures in areas with higher recent fishing effort and documented evidence of fishing impacts, such as extensive mats of coral rubble and a high abundance of derelict fishing gear entangled with dead or damaged organisms. Based on the average density of "lost" gear (2,785 +/- 1,003 km(-2)), we can confidently estimate that hundreds of thousands of items of derelict fishing gear are currently entangled with the seafloor of Cobb Seamount and that these pose an ongoing threat to biological structures, the biogenic habitats they create, and the species they support. Such impacts can persist for decades or centuries to come. This study contributes and discusses new information on the condition and distribution of biological structures, VME indicator taxa, physically complex biogenic ecosystems, and human impacts on Cobb Seamount. These data will be necessary to identify the location(s) of potential VMEs and SAIs on this heavily fished seamount in the High Seas.

AB  - Analyzing the habitat requirements of raptors is of crucial importance for wildlife conservation, since their role as bioindicators serves to assess the impact of different factors - anthropogenic, biotic and abiotic, as well as the "stress level" on the entire ecosystem. The Lesser Spotted Eagle is a strongly philopatric and territorial forest-dwelling raptor that tends to prefer foraging in different types of grasslands and avoid arable land. With regard to the micro-habitat selection, the eagle's selectivity was strongly related to the topography and the proximity to open areas and water bodies, avoiding small forest patches. In the nesting stands the eagle definitely selected older and taller trees. The territory selection was related to the preferences for natural grasslands, agricultural mosaic and shrubs as well as the avoidance of large forests and arable land. The mean size of the fragments influenced significantly the selection of a home range by this raptor species, with a strong preference for large patches of grassland biotopes and shrubs, and strict avoidance of large forest tracts. The strongest habitat preferences were related to the habitat heterogeneity, so we observed that the species clearly selected territories of high habitat diversity. We found out that the habitat structure did not affect significantly the eagle's density. Although the habitats of the species vary across its distribution area, in general the species follows the same habitat selection patterns throughout its European range. We would like to emphasize that the conservation of the habitats of this raptor should include not only conservation of nest sites, but also conservation of favourable foraging sites. Inappropriate practices in forest and agriculture management can adversely affect the species' population both at a micro-habitat scale and as macro-habitat features by decreasing the quality of habitats. The significance of old growth trees, structurally diverse stands, share and condition of grasslands as well as landscape diversity must be taken into account in the management and the decision making related to the protection of the Lesser Spotted Eagle.

AB  - Ants play a fundamental role in coffee pest control. Despite this, there is a lack of understanding about how landscape configuration and composition regulate the ecosystem service provided by ants in sun coffee farms within highly fragmented landscapes. We measured whether landscape structure influences ants' ability to regulate coffee berry borer (CBB) in sun coffee farms in Southeastern Brazil. Considering the ecological interactions between ants and CBB at three different stages of pest control (reduction of CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB bean damage), we measured pest control among 10 landscapes that represented a gradual difference in forest and coffee cover. We manipulated ants through exclusion experiments and tested whether interactions between ants and different landscape structure metrics (distance to forest fragments, 2-km-level forest cover, and 300-m-level forest and coffee cover) influenced pest control. The presence of ants reduced CBB presence and CBB damage by up to 40%. We show how pest control service indicators change depending on the landscape level. The probability of CBB presence increased with expanding coffee and forest cover at the 300-m-level but decreased at the 2-km-level. CBB infestation reduced further after 25 m from forest edges, suggesting ants that provide these ecosystem services are adapted to matrix conditions in sun coffee farms. Ants reduced CBB presence, CBB infestation, and CBB damage in landscapes with at least 40% 2-km-level forest cover. Beyond this threshold, there is a turning point for ecological processes involved in pest control. Synthesis and applications. This is the first long-term branch-level exclusion experiment to present strong evidence of ants as efficient providers of pest control in sun coffee farms. We show how landscape structure modulates key ecological processes involved in three different ant-CBB interactions that regulate CBB populations. Forest cover measured at different landscape levels yielded different results for CBB presence, emphasizing the importance of multi-scale studies for landscape management. Considering surrounding forest cover and crop proximity to forest fragments in planning the spatial arrangement of coffee farms can thus both improve pest control as well as contribute to biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Soils play a vital role in the quality of the urban environment and the health of its residents. City soils and street dusts accumulate various contaminants and particularly potentially toxic elements (PTEs) from a variety of human activities. This study investigates the current condition of elemental concentration in the urban soils of Hamedan, the largest and the fastest-growing city in western Iran. Thirty-four composite soil samples were collected from 0 to 10cm topsoil of various land uses in Hamedan city and were analyzed for total concentration of 63 elements by ICP-MS. The possible sources of elemental loadings were verified using multivariate statistical methods (principal component analysis and cluster analysis) and geochemical indices. The spatial variability of the main PTEs was mapped using geographic information system (GIS) technique. The results revealed a concentration for As, Co, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, and V in the soil samples comparable to the background values as well as a range of associations among these elements in a single component suggesting geogenic sources related to geological and pedogenic processes, while the soils mostly presented a moderate to considerable enrichment/contamination of Cd, Zn, Pb, and Sb and moderate enrichment/contamination of Cu, Zn, and Mo. It was found that anthropogenic factors, vehicular traffic in particular, control the concentration of a spectrum of elements that are typical of human activities, i.e., Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Sb, and Zn. Lead and Sb were both the most enriched elements in soils with no correlation with land use highlighting general urban emissions over time and the impact of transport networks directly on soil quality. The highest concentrations of As were recorded in the southern part of the city reflecting the influence of metamorphic rocks. The effect of the geological substrate on the Co and Ni contents was confirmed by their maximum concentrations in the city's marginal areas. However, high spatial variability of urban elements' contents displayed the contribution of various human activities. In particular, the increased concentration of Cd, Sb, and Pb was found to be consistent with the areas where vehicular traffic is heaviest.

AB  - The policy term green infrastructure highlights the need to maintain functional ecosystems as a foundation for sustainable societies. Because forests are the main natural ecosystems in Europe, it is crucial to understand the extent to which forest landscape management delivers functional green infrastructures. We used the steep west-east gradient in forest landscape history, land ownership, and political culture within northern Europe's Baltic Sea Region to assess regional profiles of benefits delivered by forest landscapes. The aim was to support policy-makers and planners with evidence-based knowledge about the current conditions for effective wood production and biodiversity conservation. We developed and modeled four regional-level indicators for sustained yield wood production and four for biodiversity conservation using public spatial data. The western case study regions in Sweden and Latvia had high forest management intensity with balanced forest losses and gains which was spatially correlated, thus indicating an even stand age class distribution at the local scale and therefore long-term sustained yields. In contrast, the eastern case study regions in Belarus and Russia showed spatial segregation of areas with forest losses and gains. Regarding biodiversity conservation indicators, the west-east gradient was reversed. In the Russian, Belarusian, and Latvian case study regions, tree species composition was more natural than in Sweden, and the size of contiguous areas without forest loss was larger. In all four case study regions, 54-85% of the total land base consisted of forest cover, which is above critical fragmentation thresholds for forest landscape fragmentation. The results show that green infrastructures for wood production and biodiversity conservation are inversely related among the four case study regions, and thus rival. While restoration for biodiversity conservation is needed in the west, intensified use of wood and biomass is possible in the east. However, a cautious approach should be applied because intensification of wood production threatens biodiversity. We discuss the barriers and bridges for spatial planning in countries with different types of land ownership and political cultures and stress the need for a landscape approach based on evidence-based collaborative learning processes that include both different academic disciplines and stakeholders that represent different sectors and levels of governance.

AB  - Acetaminophen (paracetamol) (PAR) is one of the most popular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with analgesic and antipyretic properties consumed worldwide and often detected in the aquatic environment. Due to the fact that PAR induces oxidative stress in mammals, the aim of this study was to evaluate if similar effects were observed in oysters Crassostrea gigas, given their economic and ecological importance and world-wide distribution. Oysters were exposed for 1, 4 and 7 days to two different sublethal PAR concentrations (0, 1 and 100 mu g L-1). Cell viability, DNA damage in hemocytes and enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and glutathione S-transferases (GST) were evaluated in oyster gills. In addition, changes at transcriptional level of Cu/Zn superoxide distnutase (SOD), catalase-like (CAT-like), cytochrome P450 genes (CYP30C1, CYP2AU2, CYP3071A1, CYP356A1), glutathione S-transferase isoforms (GST-omega and GST-pi-like), cyclooxygenase (COX), fatty acid binding proteins-like (FABP-like), and caspase genes were evaluated in oyster gills and digestive gland. No changes in cell viability and DNA damage were observed in oysters exposed to both PAR concentrations. Similarly, no significant changes were detected in the major antioxidant enzymes (except for auxiliary enzyme GR) in oyster gills, suggesting that changes in GR activity are enough to counteract a potential oxidative stress in C. gigas gills under these experimental conditions. Furthermore, changes at transcriptional level are concentration and tissue dependent. PAR elicited an inhibition of CYP30C1, CYP3071A1 and FABP-like transcripts highlighting their role in drug metabolism, transport and detoxification of PAR in the gills. GST transcript levels were type, tissue and concentration-dependent. GST-pi-like was down-regulated in oyster gills exposed to the lowest PAR concentration and up-regulated in the digestive gland of oysters exposed to the highest PAR concentration. However, GST-omega transcript levels were lower only in oysters digestive gland exposed to the lowest PAR concentration. Therefore, changes at transcriptional level were more sensitive to assess the exposure to PAR at environmental relevant concentrations.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals are frequently detected in the aquatic environment, and have potentially damaging effects. Effluents from sewage treatment plants (STPs) are major sources of these substances. The use of sequencing batch reactor (SBR) STPs, involving cycling between aerobic and anoxic conditions to promote nitrification and denitrification, is increasing but these have yet to be understood in terms of removal of pharmaceutical residues. This study reports on the development of a laboratory rig to simulate a SBR. The rig was used to investigate the fate of radiolabelled propranolol. This is a commonly prescribed beta blocker, but with unresolved fate in STPs.
   The SBR rig (4.5 L) was operated on an 8 h batch cycle with settled sewage. Effective treatment was demonstrated, with clearly distinct treatment phases and evidence of nitrogen removal. Radiolabelled C-14-propranolol was dosed into both single (closed) and continuous (flow-through) simulations over 13 SBR cycles. Radioactivity in CO2 off-gas, biomass and liquid was monitored, along with the characteristics of the sewage. This allowed apparent rate constants and coefficients for biodegradation and solid:water partitioning to be determined.
   Extrapolation from off-gas radioactivity measurements in the single dose 4-d study suggested that propranolol fell outside the definitions of being readily biodegradable (DegT50 = 9.1 d; 60% biodegradation at 12.0 d). During continuous dosing, 63-72% of propranolol was removed in the rig, but less than 4% of dose recovered as (CO2)-C-14, suggesting that biodegradation was a minor process (K-biol(M) L kg d(-1) = 22 49) and that adsorption onto solids dominated, giving rise to accumulations within biomass during the 17 d solid retention time in the SBR. Estimations of adsorption isotherm coefficients were different depending on which of three generally accepted denominators representing sorption sites was used (mixed liquor suspended solids, reactor COD or mass of waste activated sludge).
   With further development and evaluation, the rig developed for simulating SBR processes has potential to be used for informing better environmental risk assessments for those pharmaceuticals showing ambiguous results in field fate studies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Natural resource managers are developing assessments of selenium (Se) contamination in freshwater ecosystems based on fish tissue concentrations. We evaluated the effects of sample size (i.e., number of fish per site) on the probability of correctly detecting mean whole-body Se values above a range of potential management thresholds. We modeled Se concentrations as gamma distributions with shape and scale parameters fitting an empirical mean-to-variance relationship in data from southwestern West Virginia, USA (63 collections, 382 individuals). We used parametric bootstrapping techniques to calculate statistical power as the probability of detecting true mean concentrations up to 3mg Se/kg above management thresholds ranging from 4 to 8mg Se/kg. Sample sizes required to achieve 80% power varied as a function of management thresholds and Type I error tolerance (). Higher thresholds required more samples than lower thresholds because populations were more heterogeneous at higher mean Se levels. For instance, to assess a management threshold of 4mg Se/kg, a sample of eight fish could detect an increase of approximately 1mg Se/kg with 80% power (given =0.05), but this sample size would be unable to detect such an increase from a management threshold of 8mg Se/kg with more than a coin-flip probability. Increasing decreased sample size requirements to detect above-threshold mean Se concentrations with 80% power. For instance, at an -level of 0.05, an 8-fish sample could detect an increase of approximately 2 units above a threshold of 8mg Se/kg with 80% power, but when was relaxed to 0.2, this sample size was more sensitive to increasing mean Se concentrations, allowing detection of an increase of approximately 1.2 units with equivalent power. Combining individuals into 2- and 4-fish composite samples for laboratory analysis did not decrease power because the reduced number of laboratory samples was compensated for by increased precision of composites for estimating mean conditions. However, low sample sizes (<5 fish) did not achieve 80% power to detect near-threshold values (i.e., <1mg Se/kg) under any scenario we evaluated. This analysis can assist the sampling design and interpretation of Se assessments from fish tissue by accounting for natural variation in stream fish populations.

AB  - Karnataka is one of the south-western Indian states where agrarian distress as a major problem. Crop yields have been stagnant in the last decade, and coupled with increased input costs, this has led to reduced incomes and debts. There is an urgent need to study options to improve the sustainability of farming systems in Karnataka. One adopted strategy to stabilize agriculture in the state is organic farming, which is less dependent on external inputs. In this paper, we assess the sustainability of conventional and organic farming practices using the model TechnoGIN. TechnoGIN calculates inputs and outputs of farming practices, allowing assessment of its impacts on economic and environmental indicators. Data on inputs and yields have been collected in two districts in 2009 from farms with conventional and organic cultivation at the same time. Additional data were collected from literature and experts. Next, the current situation was assessed and projections were made towards 2015 for two scenarios per village, using either conventional or organic practices.
   Modeling results show that for the study site situated in a dry region, Chitradurga, profits with organic farming are higher than in conventional farming, except for rotations that include onion. Input costs are lower resulting in lower financial risks with organic farming. Nutrient balances in organic agriculture were however found to be negative for all crop rotations indicating imbalanced supply of nutrients. This suggests it may not be possible to sustain current yields in the long term with current nutrient applications.
   In the second site situated in a transition zone with intensive cultivation of commercial crops, Mysore, yields and profits are similar in organic farming compared to those under conventional practice, except for commercial crops like cotton and coconut where the profits are lower. The debt risk in case of crop failure appears to be practically similar for both types of farming practices in Mysore. Nutrient balances are generally positive, indicating that NPK supplies are not the main yield limiting factor.
   It is concluded that organic farming can be a sustainable farming practice in Karnataka depending on regional conditions and the crops cultivated. Policies stimulating organic farming should therefore consider the regional differences and farmer's preferences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bryophytes are indicators of climatic, environmental and ecology conditions and are useful in the characterization of the vegetation types. In this study, we analyzed the brioflora of 2-ha plots, one of Restinga Forest (RF) and the other of Lowland Ombrophilous Dense Forest (LF), located in the Nucleo Picinguaba, State Park of Serra do Mar (Rio Paulo state, Brazil) aiming to: a) compare the structure of these communities; b) compare the floristic composition between these areas and with other coastal vegetations of southeastern Brazil; c) verify if the bryophytes of the Atlantic Forest lowlands have phytogeographic patterns wider than those of the montane species. In each plot, the bryophytes samples were collected at ten randomized subplots (10 x 10 m). We found 152 species (87 liverworts, 64 mosses and one hornwort), of which 109 occur in RF (40 exclusives) and 112 in LF (43 exclusives). In terms of species richness and taxonomic diversity, LF was more diverse; however, the Simpson and Shannon index of diversity is higher in RF. The floristic composition, life form and ecological groups of light tolerance were significantly different between these two forests. Canopy opening (RF) and number of rocks (LF) were important environmental variables that influenced bryophyte distribution in the study areas. When evaluated in terms of landscape, the subplots of RF and LR form distinct floristic groups; however, at the regional level, the bryophytes of these two forest types have more similarities among themselves than with other Atlantic Forest areas. Bryophyte community observed in the Restinga Forest of Picinguaba shows more similarity with that of the neighbor Lowland Ombrophilous Dense Forest than with other Restinga or coastal formation, such as mangroves and caxetal. In both forests types studied, the majority of taxa (> 90%) is widely distributed in the world, presenting phytogeographic pattern equal to or wider than the Neotropical. Our results corroborate the idea that the RF of Picinguaba is a unique vegetation formation, presenting elements of ombrophilous and dryer forests. In addition, they reinforce the idea that, for the tropical bryophyte species, the phytogeographic patterns are wider in areas of lower altitudes.

AB  - Geographic information systems and satellite remote sensing information are emerging technologies in land-cover change assessment. They now provide an opportunity to gain insights into land-cover change properties through the spatio-temporal data capture over several decades. The time series of Landsat images covering the 1985-2009 period is used here to explore the impacts of surface mining and reclamation, which constitute a dominant force in land-cover changes in the northwestern regions of the Czech Republic. Advanced quantification of the extent of mining activities is important for assessing how these land-cover changes affect ecosystem services such as croplands. The images employed from 1985, 1988, 1990, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 assist in mapping the extent of surface mines and mine reclamation for large surface mines in a few selected areas of interest. The image processing techniques are based on pixel-by-pixel calculation of the vegetation index, such as NDVI. The NDVI values are classified into the defined classes based on CORINE Land Cover 2000 data in a 3280 km(2) strip of Landsat images. This distribution of NDVI values is used to estimate the land-cover classes in the local areas of interest (184 km(2), 368 km(2), 737 km(2), and 1,474 km(2)). Thus, the approximate land-cover stability of the 3,280 km2 strip during the whole 1985-2009 period is used to explore land-cover disturbances in the local areas of surface mines. In the case of NDVI, it also includes variations, presumably caused by seasonal vegetation effects, and local meteorological conditions. However, the main trends related to mining activities during the long-term period can be clearly understood. As a result, other objectives can be explored in the 1985-2009 period, such as cropland changes to other land use classes, changes of cropland patterns, and their impacts on food security. The presented spatio-temporal modeling based on long time series from 12 satellite images provides considerable experience for processing NDVI in the framework of identification of land-cover classes and also, to a certain degree, cropland variability with its impact on food security.

AB  - At the Earth's surface, Fe(II) often oxidises and forms insoluble Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxides, whose particle size and structure depend on solution composition and temperature during formation and afterwards. Bacterial processes and exposure to reducing environments reduces them again, releasing dissolved iron to the groundwater. During such cycling, the Fe isotopes fractionate to an extent that is expected to depend on temperature. In this study, we report on the use of Fe-oxides as paleoredox indicators, using their structure, morphology and Fe-composition as a clue for formation conditions. In samples taken from similar to 120 m drill cores in granite from SE Sweden, X-ray amorphous, superparamagnetic, nanometre-sized Fe-oxides are confined to fractures of the upper,-,50 m, whereas well-crystalline Fe-oxides, with particle sizes typical for soils, occur down to similar to 110 m. We also identified hematite with a particle size of 100 nm, similar to hematite of hydrothermal origin. The Fe isotope composition of the fine-grained Fe-oxides (-1 parts per thousand < delta Fe-56 < 1 parts per thousand, IRMM-14 referenced) scatter significantly compared to the distribution previously observed for hydrothermal material (-0.26 parts per thousand < delta Fe-56 < 0.12 parts per thousand) and they are dominantly heavier than Fe-bearing silicates from fractures (-0.56 parts per thousand, < delta Fe-56 < -0.35 parts per thousand). This is consistent with formation by low-temperature weathering, where Fe-silicates dissolve, Fe(II) oxidises and Fe(III)-oxides precipitate. The X-ray amorphous, nanometre-sized nature of near-surface Fe-oxides suggests recent formation. The deeper situated, well-crystalline Fe-oxides are more mature and we interpret that they record earlier oxidising events. They exist in fractures that are not significantly altered, indicating formation during periods of oxidation. Our results show that oxygenated water may reach depths of similar to 110 m in fractured granite. The absence of natural, low-temperature Fe-oxides from deeper drill cores suggests that oxygenated waters do not readily penetrate beyond about 100 m and suggests that radioactive waste repositories located at a depth of similar to 500 m should be well-protected from oxygenated waters.

AB  - We assessed the composition of understory vascular plant communities in relation to the mosaic of canopy patch types, and their associated structure and environment, within unmanaged, mature boreal mixedwood forests in western Canada. Within a 30 km(2) area, we sampled patches of four different canopy types: conifer-dominated, broadleaf-dominated, mixed conifer-broadleaf, and canopy gaps (total n = 98). There were significant differences in understory composition among the four patch types (based on multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP)) and these were mainly due to differences in relative abundances of understory species. The understory communities of conifer patches were characterized by low abundances of shade intolerant species while shade-tolerant and evergreen species were indicators (based on an indicator species analysis (ISA)). Understory, communities under gap and broadleaf patches were characterized by higher abundances of grasses and shade intolerant species. Gap, broadleaf, and mixed patches had higher abundances of certain shrub species than did conifer patches. The patch types also differed in terms of their environmental conditions. Conifer patches had drier, cooler soils and the lowest understory light. Broadleaf patches had the warmest soils while understory light during the leaf-off period was similar to that of canopy gaps. Gap patches had the lowest litter cover and PO4- availability and the highest light. Seven environmental variables (soil moisture, soil temperature, total light during the leaf-off period, cover of coarse and fine downed woody material, and availability of NH4+ and Ca2+) were significantly related to understory species composition (in a constrained ordination by means of a distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA): 16.5% of variation in understory community data explained). Even within a single patch type, there was substantial environmental variation that was related to understory species composition. Our study suggests that the mosaic of canopy patches within mixedwood forests supports coexistence of both early and late successional understory plant species in mixedwood stands. Maintaining the mixture of canopy patch types within mixedwood stands will be important for conserving the natural patterns of understory plant composition in boreal mixedwood forests.

AB  - The concentration of monomethyl mercury (MeHg+) and dimethyl mercury (Me2Hg) was determined in surface sea-water samples of the Antarctic and Arctic Ocean as well as of other remote areas (South Atlantic and South Pacific) during expeditions of the German research vessel "Polarstern" A purge and trap/gas chromatographic system, equipped with an atomic fluorescence detector (AFD), was used. For the analysis of MeHg+ conversion into the volatile methylethyl mercury by reaction with tetraethyloborate prior to the purging process was carried out. The detection limit for both methylated mercury compounds was 5 pg Hg/L, which allowed their determination in most ocean water samples even in those of the Antarctic and Arctic Ocean. A north-south concentration profile in the Atlantic Ocean, covering a distance from 51 degrees N to 58 degrees S, was also examined, which resulted in the most extended set of data in the environment for these important heavy metal species. In anthropogenically influenced areas of the North Atlantic from 51 degrees N to about 40 degrees N concentrations of methylated mercury in the range of 100-3000 pg/L were found. The contents of these species were significantly lower in remote areas, represented by a range of <5 pg/L to 150 pg/L. Concentrations of the methylated mercury species were compared with those of substances often used as biomass indicators, e.g. chlorophyll-a and adenosine triphosphate. A positive correlation was found, in general, in remote areas between the contents of methylated mercury and these parameters for bioactivity, demonstrating the biogenic origin of MeHg+ and Me2Hg, respectively. The concentration of MeHg+ normally exceeded that of Me2Hg, except at locations with especially high bioactivities. This result indicates that Me2Hg may be the main primary biogenic product. Oceanographic conditions are very well reflected by concentration profiles of methylated mercury. For example, in biologically very active upwelling regions peak concentrations of Me2Hg and MeHg+ were found, whereas in parts of the Antarctic Ocean, totally covered by ice, the concentration of methylated mercury was determined to be below the detection limit.

KW  - CONTEXT
AB  - Training of highly qualified engineering personnel capable of solving professional tasks in a multilingual international environment is one of the main goals implemented within the framework of the national project known as "Education". Expanding the range of languages taught and modernizing the approaches to teaching foreign languages can change the attitude to linguistic education in technical universities making it multifunctional, relevant to the time and more attractive for both Russian and international students. This article analyzes the methodological system of multilingual training of technical students elaborated by Anna A. Prokhorova and summarizes the results of an empirical study conducted on the basis of one of the leading Russian technical universities. The study aimed at examining the effectiveness of the proposed methodological system. The authors consider the latter to be a compound educational structure of a humanitarian nature, which is aimed at developing a multilingual communicative competence (MCC) among students of engineering specialties as well as their multicultural personality. MCC is interpreted from the perspective of the idea proposed by Konstantin E. Bezukladnikov, who offers to formulate it in terms of `readiness' and `ability'. Thus, the authors give the definition and describe the structural complex of the multilingual communicative competence, which includes basic and complementary components. The authors also stress that a multilingual educational process in a technical university is possible only in specific conditions that promote systematic language learning. In this regard, they suggest the idea of creating the architecture of a multilingual environment that is built on the principles of mobility, integration and digitalization. The methodological system of multilingual training was implemented and its efficiency was verified via experimental work with more than a thousand student participants majoring in various fields of engineering and belonging to dissimilar learning paths. The multilingual skills of the participants were diagnosed through observation, surveys, and modern methods of analyzing multilingual educational activities. The obtained indicators were recorded and discussed. The achieved results proved to be positive due to the introduction of multilingual modules such as facilitative, accelerative, communicative and transferable, presented by the authors. The statistical data analysis performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics program confirms the effectiveness of the implemented system and proves that its integration into the content of technical students' foreign language teaching is really promising.

AB  - The Republic of Belarus is an export- oriented country in the field of trading with agri-food products and occupies rather significant place in the world ranking of the leading countries. In the view of intensive development of world trade, Belarus is increasingly becoming a part of the international labor differentiation. Thus, of the total volume of domestic production, the republic sells about 35 % of agri-food products to foreign markets. However, the further development of foreign trade in Belarus requires improvement of regulatory methods and tools to increase the competitiveness and efficiency of foreign trade in Agro-Industrial Complex and optimize its parameters, as well as adaptation to changing conditions of the internal and external environment. The paper presents the results of studies on selecting perfect ratio of import and export of agricultural products, as well as balance of export-and-import flows and efficiency of foreign economic activity. The main research directions in studying foreign trade are highlighted, the evolution of approaches to the nature and aims of export- and-import operations in the system of world economic relations is analyzed. The main interrelations of their foreign economic activity are shown considering the main market factors that contribute to increase of importance and efficiency of foreign economic activity. The fundamental patterns influencing foreign trade relations in agri-food sector in the context of regional integration are identified, including growth of the role of international division of finished food production process into separate stages and having such stages in different countries, the strengthening of country interaction within the framework of regional trade and economic integration associations, etc. The indicators for assessing foreign trade in the economy of a country are systematized based on the proposed methodological foundations for establishing criteria of application, formed based on their importance in the country's economic system and ensuring identification of advantages and disadvantages that the country obtains as a result of trade with agri-food products in the world and regional markets.

AB  - A first review on occurrence and distribution of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is presented. The literature survey conducted here was initiated by the current Assessment of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP). This first review on the occurrence and environmental profile of PPCPs in the Arctic identified the presence of 110 related substances in the Arctic environment based on the reports from scientific publications, national and regional assessments and surveys, as well as academic research studies (i.e., PhD theses). PPCP residues were reported in virtually all environmental compartments from coastal seawater to high trophic level biota. For Arctic environments, domestic and municipal wastes as well as sewage are identified as primary release sources. However, the absence of modern waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), even in larger settlements in the Arctic, is resulting in relatively high release rates for selected PPCPs into the receiving Arctic (mainly) aquatic environment. Pharmaceuticals are designed with specific biochemical functions as a part of an integrated therapeutically procedure. This biochemical effect may cause unwanted environmental toxicological effects on non-target organisms when the compound is released into the environment. In the Arctic environments, pharmaceutical residues are released into low to very low ambient temperatures mainly into aqueous environments. Low biodegradability and, thus, prolonged residence time must be expected for the majority of the pharmaceuticals entering the aquatic system. The environmental toxicological consequence of the continuous PPCP release is, thus, expected to be different in the Arctic compared to the temperate regions of the globe. Exposure risks for Arctic human populations due to consumption of contaminated local fish and invertebrates or through exposure to resistant microbial communities cannot be excluded. However, the scientific results reported and summarized here, published in 23 relevant papers and reports (see Table S1 and following references), must still be considered as indication only. Comprehensive environmental studies on the fate, environmental toxicology, and distribution profiles of pharmaceuticals applied in high volumes and released into the Nordic environment under cold Northern climate conditions should be given high priority by national and international authorities.

AB  - The mechanisms of plant photosynthetic acclimation to drought remains incomplete. We examined the photosynthetic performance through plant photosystem-fluorescence response to a long-lasting, anomalous summer drought (i.e., lasting for 61 days, with soil water content < 0.1 m(3).rn(-3)) and subsequent post-drought recovery of a native and a non-native desert shrub species (Artemisia ordosica and Salix psammophila, respectively) growing in northwest China. Key indicators to the examination are derived estimates of plant stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration (T-r), water use efficiency (WUE), maximum and actual photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m and Phi(PSII)), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and leaf photosynthesis (P-N) from simultaneous, continuous in situ measurements of gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence. Chlorophyll fluorescence-associated indicator "F-v/F-m" for both species was down regulated in response to deficits in soil water content (SWC), with differential SWC thresholds of 0.07 and 0.08 M-3.m(-3) for A. ordosica and S. psammophila, respectively. The results revealed that both species acclimate to summer drought by a stomatal-regulation mechanism of reducing g(s) and WUE and by a PSII NPQ mechanism of dissipating the excessive light energy, indicative of a water-conservation strategy in the acclimation to drought. In comparison with the non-native species, the native species generally had greater photosynthetic performance under water-deficit conditions demonstrating higher transpiration, net CO2 assimilation, and greater PSII photochemical efficiency. Lower WUE and greater drought resistance and resilience, combined with minor changes in PSII photochemical efficiency are consistent with a well-defined water-conservation response by A. ordosica. The results support the hypothesis that native desert-shrub species can potentially outperform non-native shrub species, due to stronger resistance and faster overall recovery from long-lasting drought. Therefore, with increased drought severity and duration anticipated with future climate change, the native shrub species is suggested to be used in desertification control and ecological restoration for sustainable ecosystem management.

AB  - The Toronto and Region Area of Concern (also known as Toronto Harbour) includes 42km of Lake Ontario coastline and 6 watersheds. Over 4 million people reside within its boundaries which includes the City of Toronto (Ontario, Canada). We sampled eleven sites along the Lake Ontario coastline approximately monthly with 6 cruises from May to early November. Our analyses included standard water quality indicators (total phosphorus, nitrate+nitrite, chlorophyll a) in addition to a robust suite of autotrophic and heterotrophic indicators of ecosystem health, specifically: primary productivity and bacterial growth assays, phytoplankton biomass assessments, and microbial loop assessments. The sites were compared using mean values from May - November. Results from the offshore waters of Lake Ontario, the Bay of Quinte and Hamilton Harbour have also been presented for comparative purposes. The highest mean values observed in Toronto Harbour for total phosphorus (26.5 mu g l(-1)) and chlorophyll a (6.2 mu g l(-1)) which were both in the inner harbour suggested mesotrophic conditions, although the majority of observations suggested oligotrophy. With respect to autotrophic indicators, primary productivity at the mouth of the Humber River as well as the inner harbour (averaging 15 - 20mg C m(-3) h(-1)) suggested mesotrophy whereas the remaining sites were more oligotrophic. Phytoplankton biomass (approximate to 400 - 1000mg m(-3)) suggested oligotrophy. There was a surprising amount of heterotrophic microbial activity at the Humber Bay and inner harbour sites which were influenced by the Humber and Don Rivers. This included elevated rates of bacterial production (approximate to 2 - 3mg C m(-3) h(-1)) and a high biomass of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (approximate to 1300 - 2600mg m(-3)) which was not likely sustained by the autotrophic production. Our findings suggest that a significant amount of organic matter is being deposited by these two rivers and shunted to the microbial food web. Such findings are not obvious from standard indicators (e.g. total phosphorus, chlorophyll a). More work is needed to quantify the sources of organic carbon and assess its utility as ecological indicators.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes result in severe economic and production losses to the sheep industry. An increase in resistance of the nematodes to chemicals used for control, as well as a demand of consumers for meat products free from chemicals, has fostered research on alternative control strategies. Breeding for resistance to nematodes offers an alternative to control parasitism but its effectiveness depends on genetic variation in faecal worm egg count (FWEC), an indirect measure of parasite resistance. A historic dataset of FWEC from four Merino lines subjected to natural parasite challenge was used to estimate genetic parameters for FWEC in three seasons (autumn, winter and spring) using a repeated records animal model, followed by a three-trait animal model analysis treating FWEC in different seasons as separate traits. The effects of selection line, birth year, sex, the sex x birth year interaction, season and the season x year interaction were significant when using 4994 records recorded from 1997 to 2000 (p < 0.001). The heritability of log-transformed FWEC amounted to 0.09 +/- 0.02, with no contribution from the animal permanent environmental variance to the between animal variation across seasons. Three-trait heritability estimates for log-transformed FWEC amounted to 0.07 +/- 0.05 in autumn, 0.13 +/- 0.05 in winter and 0.19 +/- 0.05 in spring. These results suggest sufficient genetic variation in FWEC to support selection for lower log-transformed FWEC. However, the best time to record data for selection is after the break of the season in winter and in spring, when sheep are stimulated by a greater intake of infective larvae from the pasture after the first rains. Genetic correlations among FWEC in the respective seasons were moderate to high, ranging from 0.55 to 0.89. Phenotypic correlations, on the other hand, were significant but lower in magnitude, ranging from 0.09 to 0.16. These results provide useful information for developing strategies for the genetic improvement of ovine resistance to gastrointestinal nematodes under Mediterranean conditions in South Africa by using FWEC as an indicator trait.

AB  - The role of riparian ecosystems in mitigating the effects of diffuse agricultural sources is recognized in several regulatory measures and public policy initiatives in many parts of the world. This study aimed to evaluate the N buffering capacity of semi-natural riparian zones associated with spring-fed lowland streams, also known as "fontanili", representing the most important groundwater-dependent ecosystems in Northern Italy. Monitoring parcels were set up in nine riparian sites selected to cover a range of different soil properties and hydrogeological settings, and to sustain the evaluation of the main drivers affecting their N removal efficiency. Subsurface water level, nutrient concentrations and the main hydro-chemical parameters were monitored along transects of piezometers installed from crop fields to the spring channels. On selected samples from two sites stable isotopes of the water molecule were also determined. Median NO3- input concentrations from adjacent cropland to the riparian sites ranged from 0.10 to 21 mg NL-1, with maximum values exceeding the drinking water limit recorded during the summer and winter fertilization periods. Highly variable groundwater nitrate patterns were found in the riparian areas, including short nitrate plumes extending from the adjacent cropland into some riparian zones, or in others, small patches where NO3- declined at variable distance from the stream. Some chemical indicators (e.g., NO3-/Cl- ratio, O-2, DOC) suggested that NO3- attenuation was mostly due to the denitrifying activity occurring in the subsurface aquifers in specific conditions (hot spots and moments), although, in some cases, physical processes such as dilution also contributed. The overall N removal efficiency was greater than 90% in four sites, 74%, 34% and 30% in three sites, and zero in the remaining two sites. Useful predictors of the nitrate removal capacity were factors linked to the water residence time, such as the hydraulic conductivity, the soil texture and the slope of the riparian profile, together with the water table depth and soil organic carbon. A combination by standardized averaging of these five factors supported a clear discrimination of sites with zero or low N removal effectiveness from those with high efficiency.

AB  - An improved knowledge of the hydrology of coastal dune systems is desirable for successful management of their diverse ecology under a changing climate. As a near-pristine coastal dune spit system, Braunton Burrows (SW England) is an ideal location for the study of the natural processes governing recharge to the dune groundwater system and the evolution of its water quality. Whereas previous investigations have tended to focus on inter-dune slacks, this study has also given attention to infiltration through the high dunes. Cores were taken through dunes and the resulting sand samples processed to provide information on grain size distribution and porewater chemistry. Groundwater samples were obtained from beneath dunes and slacks. A variety of geochemical techniques were applied including hydrochemistry, stable isotopes and residence time indicators. The unsaturated zone profiles indicate the existence of piston flow recharge with an infiltration rate of 0.75-1 m/yr, although faster rates probably also occur locally. Groundwater beneath the high dunes gave ages in the range 13-16 yr, compared to the dune slack groundwater ages of 5-7 yr, and an age of 22 yr for groundwater from the underlying mudstone aquifer. The chemistry of waters in both unsaturated and saturated zones is dominated by Ca and HCO3, supplemented by variable amounts of other ions derived from marine aerosols and limited reaction with sand grains and their coatings. The main chemical evolution of the porewaters occurs rapidly through the mobilisation of surface salt crusts and dissolution of shell carbonate. This situation changes little in the underlying groundwater, though an evolution towards reducing conditions increases the concentrations of redox-sensitive species such as Fe and Mn. The rapid chemical evolution of the infiltrating water means that its composition will respond quickly to changes in the supply of shell material and/or marine salts, which are possible consequences of climate change. However, the residence time measurements suggest the dune aquifer has a relatively long turnover time which will to some extent buffer such changes. The results of the present study should be transferable to natural dune systems in similar coastal situations. (C) 2013 Natural Environment Research Council. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study proposes a new use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for environmental assessment, paying attention to a methodological bias (i.e., different methods produce different results). DEA is analytically classified into radial and non-radial approaches. The radial approach determines the level of unified (operational and environmental) efficiency by measuring an inefficiency score. The score indicates the distance of a projection from an observed performance to an efficiency frontier. In contrast, the non-radial approach determines the level of unified efficiency by measuring a total amount of slacks because each slack indicates inefficiency. To avoid the methodological bias, this study considers the use of radial and non-radial approaches. In this study, we consider a production process where all organizations produce not only desirable (good) but also undesirable (bad) outputs as a result of their business operations. To unify the two types of outputs, this study discusses the concept of disposability, which is separated into natural and managerial disposability. The natural disposability indicates negative adaptation to a regulation change on undesirable outputs. In contrast, the managerial disposability indicates corporate strategy by which a firm considers the regulation change as a new business opportunity. A firm attempts to improve its unified efficiency by utilizing new environmental technology and/or new management. This type of strategy indicates positive adaptation to the regulation change. Under the two disposability concepts, this study discusses how to measure RTS (Returns to Scale) under natural disposability and DTS (Damages to Scale: corresponding to RTS on undesirable outputs) under managerial disposability. The two scale measures are analytically discussed by the proposed radial and non-radial approaches with SCSCs or without SCSCs, where SCSCs indicate strong complementary slackness conditions. An illustrative example on U.S. fossil fuel power plants indicates a policy implication that they need to introduce new technology for environmental protection. This study also discusses a necessity of examining a methodological bias in energy studies. Empirical findings identified in this study document the practicality of the proposed approaches to measure RTS/DTS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(5950 cal. b.c.) the climate changed to cooler summers, milder winters and higher precipitation resulting in the formation of a coniferous belt dominated by Pinus sp. and Abies alba. These favorable environmental pre-conditions had a positive influence on the Neolithisation of the Balkans after the 8200 cal. b.p. (6250 cal. b.c.) cold event, which caused drought in the Eastern Mediterranean. Direct evidence from wood charcoal records from the Neolithic settlement layers in the study area shows a slight modification of the surrounding woodlands and an increase of the light-demanding components, probably expressed through larger forest border zones and thinning out of the wood stands. The increase in the number of settlements in the valleys of southwestern Bulgaria intensified the human activity visible in the palaeobotanical record from 6950 cal. b.p. (5000 cal. b.c.) onwards. Between ca. 5700-5100 cal. b.p. (3800-3200 cal. b.c.) signs of anthropogenic influence on the vegetation are virtually absent. The intensity of human impact increased notably after 3200 cal. b.p. (1400-1250 cal. b.c., approx. Late Bronze Age), documented by a rise of pollen anthropogenic indicators. The final transformations in the natural forest cover after 2750 cal. b.p. (800 cal. b.c. onset of the Iron Age) marked the reduction of the coniferous forests dominated by Abies alba and Pinus sp. and the expansion of Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies. These vegetation changes are contemporaneous with increase of the palaeofire activities and the next peak of anthropogenic indicators. The changes in the landscape during the Roman period and the medieval period reflect regional environmental features and were forced by the diversification of anthropogenic activity.

AB  - Marshland streams along European coastlines are typically located in the transition zone from limnic to brackish conditions. They constitute a distinct and important stream type within the German stream typology, which is predominantly characterised by tidal influence and salinity. According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) the basis for the abiotic classification of European transitional and coastal waters is the 'Venice System' (Weber, M., 2005. Ergebnisse der Bestandsaufnahme 2004 zur Umsetzung der europaischen Wasserrahmenrichtlinie (WRRL) in den Kustengewassern Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns. Rostocker Meeresbiol. Beitr, 14, 7-15). However, the extreme spatial and temporal variability in salinity and tidal influence determines and controls the macroinvertebrate communities of marshland river and stream ecosystems and hampers the application of the 'Venice System'. Earlier, purely biotic classifications of brackish waters typically classify different brackish water zones, each with a specific macroinvertebrate community, and often yield unsatisfactory results due to the extensively dynamic abiotic factors found in marshland streams. In practice, the permanent impact of tidal charge means that stable salinity zones do not exist. This effect can than be intensified by freshwater discharges after heavy rainfall or high tides in combination with strong winds that hinder discharge into the open sea. To overcome the restricted applicability of abiotic and biotic classification systems, we present a scoring system for marshland streams that combines the abiotic salinity classes of the 'Venice System' with the salinity preferences of the macroinvertebrate community. This proposal is based on literature data for macroinvertebrate salinity tolerances and preferences. According to the 137 references that were evaluated, 151 macroinvertebrate taxa were classified into six salinity groups. In a second step, we applied this scoring scheme to empirical data from two official quality assessment surveys. These surveys had been carried out in ten estuary tributaries of German marshland areas in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein in order to implement the WFD. Applying the scoring system to these data revealed a clear (and expected) gradient that was not expressed in the abiotic data. Thus we conclude that the biotic salinity preferences of benthic macroinvertebrates are a useful baseline metric for the ecological assessment of marshland streams and other transitional waters. Regional revision and adaptation of taxonomic salinity preferences would broaden the applicability of this assessment to transitional waters worldwide. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests offer a wide range of timber and non-timber values, which may benefit from a balanced timber harvest by variable retention systems with conservation of biodiversity. A major component of biodiversity are forest floor small mammal communities whose abundance and diversity serve as ecological indicators of significant change in forest structure and function from harvesting activities. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that abundance, reproduction, and survival of (i) the southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi, formerly Clethrionomys gapperi), will decline; (ii) the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), will be similar; and (iii) the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and northwestern chipmunk (Tamias amoenus), will increase, with decreasing levels of tree retention. Small mammal populations were live-trapped from 1994 to 1997 in replicated sites of uncut forest, 20% and 50% volume removal by single tree selection, 20%, 35%, and 50% patch cuts based on openings of 0.1-1.6 ha, and small 1.6 ha clearcuts in Douglas-fir forest near Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. M. gapperi dominated the small mammal community, starting with an abundance of 74-98 animals/ha with mean values ranging from 33 to 51 animals/ha. In the two post-harvest years, abundance, reproduction, and survival of M. gapperi populations were consistently similar among uncut forest and the various levels of tree retention. Thereafter, M. gapperi was seldom found on the small clearcuts. M. pennsylvanicus, T amoenus, and P. maniculatus occurred predominantly in clearcut sites. As with other types of forest disturbance, responses to our treatments were species-specific. The most striking result was the high abundance and productivity of M. gapperi populations in a dry forest ecosystem, a novel result for this bio-indicator species of closed-canopy forest conditions. At least with respect to small mammals, the retention systems studied seem to enable timber extraction and maintenance of mature forest habitat in these dry fir ecosystems. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In seasonally frozen soil compartments, freezing affects hydrothermal cycles and solute transport. In order to effectively identify the variation characteristics of soil temperature, moisture and salinity during freezing and the interaction among them, a laboratory unidirectional freezing experiment was set up. During the experiment, three initial gravimetric moisture contents (N1, 18.84 %; N2, 23.43 %; N3, 28.78 %), three freezing temperatures (N4, -5 degrees C; N5, -10 degrees C; N6, -15 degrees C), and three soil bulk densities (N2, 1.33 g.cm(-3); N5, 1.45 g.cm(-3); N7, 1.58 g.cm(-3)) were established. The spatial distribution characteristics of the temperature, moisture and salinity in the soil columns were analysed, on the basis of these results, soil water, heat, and salt response relationship functions were constructed by using three indicators, i.e., the soil temperature difference, water flux and salt flux. The study results indicated that as the moisture content increased, the water migration ability increased. In addition, as the freezing temperature decreased and the soil bulk density increased, the rapid freezing of soil inhibited water migration. Furthermore, the movement of water carried a certain amount of salt, and in the soil columns with freezing temperatures of -10 and -15 degrees C, the total soil salt migration decreased by 10.05 and 16.41 mg.cm(-2), respectively, compared with the soil column with a freezing temperature of -5 degrees C. The response relationship among the soil water, heat, and salt improved with an increase in the soil moisture content, weakened with a decrease in the freezing temperature and an increase in the soil bulk density, simultaneously, the RMSE between the simulated and measured values of the soil water, heat, and salt response function reduced. In addition, at the spatial scale, the response relationship among soil water, heat, and salt was most significant at the critical soil freezing depth. These study results elucidate the migration and diffusion of soil water, heat, and salt in cold regions and their associated interaction mechanisms, thereby providing guidance for scientific and effective measures for soil improvement, improving the soil ecological environment and ensuring stable increases in grain production.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between hydrological processes and environmental changes is important for improved water management. The Geba catchment in Ethiopia, forming the headwaters of Tekeze-Atbara basin, was known for its severe land degradation before the recent success in integrated watershed management. This study analyses the hydrological response attributed to land management change using an integrated approach composed of (i) simulating the hydrological response of Land Use/Cover (LULC) changes; (ii) assessing the alteration of streamflow using Alteration of Hydrological Indicators (IHA); and (iii) quantifying the contribution of individual LULC types to the hydrology using Partial Least Square Regression model (PLSR).
   The results show that the expansion of agricultural and grazing land at the expense of natural vegetation has increased the surface runoff 77% and decreased dry season flow by 30% in the 1990s compared to 1970s. However, natural vegetation started to recover from the late 1990s and dry season flows increased by 16%, while surface runoff declined by 19%. More pronounced changes of the streamflow were noticed at sub-catchment level, mainly associated with the uneven spatial distribution of land degradation and rehabilitation. However, the rate of increase of low-flow halted in the 2010s, most probably due to an increase of water withdrawals for irrigation. Fluctuations in hydrological alteration parameters are in agreement with the observed LULC change. The PLSR analysis demonstrates that most LULC types showed a strong association with all hydrological components. These findings demonstrate that changing water conditions are attributed to the observed LULC change dynamics. The combined analysis of rainfall-runoff modelling, alteration indicators and PLSR is able to assess the impact of environmental change on the hydrology of complex catchments. The IHA tool is robust to assess the magnitude of streamflow alterations obtained from the hydrological model while the PLSR method is useful to zoom into which LULC is responsible for this alteration.

AB  - Attention should be paid to potential impacts on the soil quality of chemicals initially released into air from accidents as soil pollution by atmospheric deposition can threaten the health of human and ecosystems. The present work aimed to develop and calculate indicators that can be used to score the individual chemicals' surface soil pollution potential which signifies a measure of external exposure incurred from the surface soil pollution.
   The average concentration over time and space and the characteristic length of polluted area were derived as the two indicators to represent the level and spatial extent of pollution, respectively. The two indicators can commonly be applied to human and ecosystem. A new dynamic multimedia mass balance model, SoilPCA, was developed to quantify the indicators under the standard environmental conditions of South Korea. The final score for the surface soil pollution potential was calculated by taking the logarithm of the product of the two indicator values. The score was calculated for a total of 150 organic chemicals of three groups (i.e., 50 hydrophobic semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), 50 non-hydrophobic SVOCs, and 50 volatile organic compounds (VOCs)). The score was found to be dictated essentially by the maximum level of pollution in surface soil that is reached no later than 4 h after a release stops. This indicates that the rank of the chemicals of the surface soil pollution potential is determined principally during this early period and hardly changes afterward in spite of wide differences in the environmental fate properties among the chemicals. The organic-air partition coefficient divided by Henry's law constant (K-oa/K-H) is a useful predictor of the surface soil pollution potential of chemicals for each of the chemical groups, showing a positive relationship with the final score. Contrary to the expectation that hydrophobicity would govern the surface soil pollution potential, the non-hydrophobic SVOCs generally tend to show greater surface soil potential than the hydrophobic SVOCs given K-oa/K-H. This tendency is reinforced if no rain is assumed. The VOCs are largely of the lowest pollution potential as expected.

AB  - A central challenge in the present era of biodiversity loss is to assess and manage human impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Macroinvertebrates are an important group for such bioassessments as many taxa show specific responses to environmental conditions. However, generating accurate macroinvertebrate inventories based on primarily larval morphology is difficult and error-prone. Here, DNA metabarcoding provides new opportunities. Its potential to accurately identify invertebrates in bulk samples to the species level has been demonstrated in several case studies. However, DNA based identification is often limited by primer bias, potentially leading to taxa in the sample remaining undetected. Thus, the success of DNA metabarcoding as an emerging technique for bioassessment critically relies on carefully evaluated primers. We used the R package PrimerMiner to obtain and process cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequence data for the 15 globally most relevant freshwater invertebrate groups for stream assessment. Using these sequence alignments, we developed four primer combinations optimized for freshwater macroinvertebrates. All primers were evaluated by sequencing 10 mock community samples, each consisting of 52 freshwater invertebrate taxa. Additionally, popular metabarcoding primers from the literature and the developed primers were tested in silico against these 15 relevant invertebrate groups. The developed primers varied in amplification efficiency and the number of detected taxa, yet, all detected more taxa than standard "Folmer" barcoding primers. Two new primer combinations showed even more consistent amplification than a previously tested ribosomal marker (16S) and detected all 42 insect taxa present in the mock community samples. In silico evaluation revealed critical design flaws in some commonly used primers from the literature. We demonstrate a reliable strategy to develop optimized primers using the tool PrimerMiner. The developed primers detected almost all taxa present in the mock samples, and we argue that high base degeneracy is necessary to decrease primer bias as confirmed by experimental results and in silico primer evaluation. We further demonstrate that some primers currently used in metabarcoding studies may not be suitable for amplification of freshwater macroinvertebrates. Therefore, careful primer evaluation and more region/ecosystem specific primers are needed before DNA metabarcoding can be used for routine bioassessment of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Bryoria section Implexae is a chemically and morphologically diverse group characterized by pendent growth form and non-spinulose branches. In this study, we examine the chemical diversity, distribution pattern and habitat preferences of European members of section Implexae in Finland. A total of 1253 specimens were collected from four vegetation zones and analysed with thin layer chromatography for secondary chemistry. Secondary chemistry of the specimens and vegetation zones had a significant interaction term in a generalized linear model (GLM) of sample frequencies, indicating that chemotype frequencies differed among vegetation zones. Forest structure interacted with vegetation zones and chemotypes indicating that chemotypes differed among forest structure classes, but also showing that forest structure classes differed among vegetation zones. The overall abundance of Bryoria spp. was significantly different among vegetation zones, increasing substantially from south to north. The abundance was also significantly higher in managed than in old-growth stands in the southern and in the middle boreal zones. This result may reflect the sampling scheme used in the study and shows that members of Implexae can thrive under favorable environmental conditions also in mature managed stands. Barbatolic acid was the most common chemotype, but its proportion clearly declined towards north. The characteristic distribution pattern suggests that the chemotype tolerates shady habitats typical for southern and middle boreal Picea-dominated forests in Finland. The gyrophoric acid chemotype was frequent in the middle boreal zone, but was relatively rare in the hemiboreal and northern boreal zones. The fumarprotocetraric acid chemotype occurred throughout the study area but was especially frequent in the southern boreal zone. The acid-deficient chemotype was most abundant in the northern boreal zone and was preferably late successional in the southern and middle boreal zones. Norstictic acid and psoromic acid chemotypes were both rare and continental in their distribution pattern and confined to the middle and especially northern boreal zones where the overall Bryoria abundance is high. According to this study, chemotypes in section Implexae have distinct ecological and climatic preferences despite the lack of genetic variation and this should be taken into account when using them as bioindicators.

AB  - This brief communication reports on the main findings and recommendations from the 2014 Science Forum organized by CropLife America. The aim of the Forum was to gain a better understanding of the current status of population models and how they could be used in ecological risk assessments for threatened and endangered species potentially exposed to pesticides in the United States. The Forum panelists' recommendations are intended to assist the relevant government agencies with implementation of population modeling in future endangered species risk assessments for pesticides. The Forum included keynote presentations that provided an overview of current practices, highlighted the findings of a recent National Academy of Sciences report and its implications, reviewed the main categories of existing population models and the types of risk expressions that can be produced as model outputs, and provided examples of how population models are currently being used in different legislative contexts. The panel concluded that models developed for listed species assessments should provide quantitative risk estimates, incorporate realistic variability in environmental and demographic factors, integrate complex patterns of exposure and effects, and use baseline conditions that include present factors that have caused the species to be listed (e.g., habitat loss, invasive species) or have resulted in positive management action. Furthermore, the panel advocates for the formation of a multipartite advisory committee to provide best available knowledge and guidance related to model implementation and use, to address such needs as more systematic collection, digitization, and dissemination of data for listed species; consideration of the newest developments in good modeling practice; comprehensive review of existing population models and their applicability for listed species assessments; and development of case studies using a few well-tested models for particular species to demonstrate proof of concept. To advance our common goals, the panel recommends the following as important areas for further research and development: quantitative analysis of the causes of species listings to guide model development; systematic assessment of the relative role of toxicity versus other factors in driving pesticide risk; additional study of how interactions between density dependence and pesticides influence risk; and development of pragmatic approaches to assessing indirect effects of pesticides on listed species.

AB  - This study reports the development of a tool to characterise and differentiate northern Adriatic waters, particularly oligotrophic, high-salinity waters, based on the cellular fatty acids of culturable heterotrophic bacterioplankton. The growth abilities and population dominance were observed for particle-attached and free-living bacteria cultured in three types of media: Marine Broth, diluted Marine Broth (1:10) and R2 broth. Three groups of water layers were distinguished by hierarchical clustering analysis: eutrophic, oligotrophic and oligotrophic nutrient-selected. Significant differences between the resulting groups were tested by two-way ANOVA (with replication). Eutrophic layers were characterised by readily culturable particle-attached and free-living fractions of the bacterial community in all three media, all dominated by fast-growing gamma-Proteobacteria. In contrast, oligotrophic water layers with low productivity had a much weaker culturability and a different population dominance for the free-living community, as compared to their attached or growth-arrested counterparts, for all media. The free-living bacteria from strictly oligotrophic environments demonstrated minimum culturability in Marine Broth, while those from selective oligotrophic environments were culturable and were dominated either by Cytophaga-Flavobacter complex, alpha-Proteobacteria or gamma-Proteobacteria. The conclusive evidence regarding the selective and refractory nature of organic compounds in these waters demonstrates the dominant culturability of the Cytophaga-Flavobacter complex and alpha-Proteobacteria in free-living communities in all growth-media. The response of fatty acid dominance ratios depends significantly on the trophic state and fraction (p < 0.05), although the effect of the trophic state is completely different in attached and free fractions. Both fractions were tested separately, demonstrating a significant influence of the trophic state (p < 0.05), while the effect of the media on the fatty acid response was not significant (p > 0.05). An interaction between media and trophic status was present in the attached fraction (p < 0.05), yet this was not observed in the free fraction (p > 0.05), indicating that any systematic difference between trophic states was the same for each media tested. Accordingly, the free-living fraction of bacterioplankton is a more informative attribute and can be used solely as an indicator of the water layer trophic condition.

AB  - Many sites along the Apulian coast (SE Italy) are composed of weathered and fractured carbonate rocks affected by intense erosion and the development of slope instabilities. Here, coastal morphology was mostly produced by Quaternary tectonics, the severe and selective action of modem erosion by sea waves, and locally, was strongly conditioned by human influences. In addition, due to the carbonate nature of rock masses, the role exerted by karst processes has to be considered. This paper provides a critical review of the common eroding processes and factors affecting coastal morphology in a typical Mediterranean coastal carbonate environment. A stretch of the Murgia coastline south of Bari (between San Vito and Polignano a Mare) made up of cliffs and shore platforms interrupted by small pocket beaches was considered. For qualitative and quantitative assessment of shoreline recession, the coastal stretch was monitored by means of field surveys between 1997 and 2003. Furthermore, a comparison of vertical aerial photographs covering the period 1966-1997 (scales 1:33,000, 1:10,000 and 1:5000), topographic maps (scales 1:5000, year 1987, 1:2000, year 1982), and archival terrestrial photographs taken since the 1930s, was also employed. In some zones, characterised by a gently sloping shore platform, a significant shoreline retreat was calculated at about 20 m in the last 100 years (0.2 myr(-1)), which was caused, above all, by human activity. Here, in fact, the presence of small ancient coastal quarries and artificial salinas is widespread; they are located where soft and porous calcarenites crop out.
   The cliffs are characterized by different types of landslides, with various complex mechanisms of rock slope failure. Cliff recession is episodic and discontinuous in time and space, and occurs in response to single large sea storms, such as that which occurred in January 1999. Between 1997 and 2003, the cliff retreat rates vary within a range of 0.01-0.1 myr(-1) and, in general, decrease where the coast is composed of fine-grained limestones and increase where medium-grained biocalcarenites crop out. Examples of erosion hazard indicators and mass movement typologies are illustrated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thin tidal estuarine deposits of the Naturita Formation (0-23 m) of the San Rafael Swell record the initial flooding of the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway, Utah, and capture the transition from inland fluvial systems to fully marine conditions over a time period of 5 My or less. A tide-dominated estuarine environment is favored due to the combined presence of mud and/or carbonaceous drapes on ripples and dunes, bidirectional flow indicators, sigmoidal cross-stratification, herring-bone cross-stratification, and bimodal paleocurrent measurements. Facies associations are arranged in a predictable manner. Locally at the base of the Naturita Formation, tidally influenced fluvial channel deposits are present. These are overlain by tidal bars, including subtidal bars and intertidal point bars. Overlying the tidal bars are sand-flat and mud-flat deposits as well as bedded coal and carbonaceous mudstone that represents a supratidal setting in the estuary. The Formation can be capped by a thin transgressive lag composed of shell debris, and/or pebbles, that marks the final transition into the fully marine 'l'ununk Shale Member of the overlying Mancos Shale.
   Lateral relationships between estuaries and adjacent paleohighs shed light on the influence of foreland-basin tectonics on the location and preservation of tide-dominated estuaries. Estuarine and shoreface deposits are absent along the eastern flank of the San Rafael Swell and eastward for more than 80 km. This zone of nondeposition or erosion is coincident with the location of the forebulge in the developing foreland basin, implying that growth of the forebulge prohibited the development of, or enhanced the later erosion of, estuarine deposits. Conversely, enhanced accommodation in the transition into the foredeep depozone allow the preservation of tide-dominated estuarine deposits along the western flank of the San Rafael Swell. Additionally, the possibility of a pre-Laramide tectonic history for the San Rafael Swell is indicated by a distinct lack of Naturita Formation deposits in an area that is coincident with the modern-day axis of the anticline.
   Overall, the Naturita records the initial flooding of the Western Interior Seaway in the San Rafael Swell region and provides an excellent case study of the deposits that are laid down in a transgressive system that passes from coastalplain to offshore deposits.

AB  - The capacity of soils to store organic carbon represents a key function of soils that is not only decisive for climate regulation but also affects other soil functions. Recent efforts to assess the impact of land management on soil functionality proposed that an indicator- or proxy-based approach is a promising alternative to quantify soil functions compared to time- and cost-intensive measurements, particularly when larger regions are targeted. The objective of this review is to identify measurable biotic or abiotic properties that control soil organic carbon (SOC) storage at different spatial scales and could serve as indicators for an efficient quantification of SOC. These indicators should enable both an estimation of actual SOC storage as well as a prediction of the SOC storage potential, which is an important aspect in land use and management planning. There are many environmental conditions that affect SOC storage at different spatial scales. We provide a thorough overview of factors from micro-scales (particles to pedons) to the global scale and discuss their suitability as indicators for SOC storage: clay mineralogy, specific surface area, metal oxides, Ca and Mg cations, microorganisms, soil fauna, aggregation, texture, soil type, natural vegetation, land use and management, topography, parent material and climate. As a result, we propose a set of indicators that allow for time- and cost-efficient estimates of actual and potential SOC storage from the local to the regional and subcontinental scale. As a key element, the fine mineral fraction was identified to determine SOC stabilization in most soils. The quantification of SOC can be further refined by including climatic proxies, particularly elevation, as well as information on land use, soil management and vegetation characteristics. To enhance its indicative power towards land management effects, further "functional soil characteristics", particularly soil structural properties and changes in the soil microbial biomass pool should be included in this indicator system. The proposed system offers the potential to efficiently estimate the SOC storage capacity by means of simplified measures, such as soil fractionation procedures or infrared spectroscopic approaches.

AB  - Vulnerability assessment is one of the prerequisites for risk analysis in disaster management. Vulnerability to earthquakes, especially in urban areas, has increased over the years due to the presence of complex urban structures and rapid development. Urban vulnerability is a result of human behavior which describes the extent of susceptibility or resilience of social, economic, and physical assets to natural disasters. The main aim of this paper is to develop a new hybrid framework using Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for constructing a composite social, economic, environmental, and physical vulnerability index. This index was then applied to Tabriz City, which is a seismic-prone province in the northwestern part of Iran with recurring devastating earthquakes and consequent heavy casualties and damages. A Geographical Information Systems (GIS) analysis was used to identify and evaluate quantitative vulnerability indicators for generating an earthquake vulnerability map. The classified and standardized indicators were subsequently weighed and ranked using an ANP model to construct the training database. Then, standardized maps coupled with the training site maps were presented as input to a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for producing an Earthquake Vulnerability Map (EVM). Finally, an EVM was produced for Tabriz City and the level of vulnerability in various zones was obtained. South and southeast regions of Tabriz City indicate low to moderate vulnerability, while some zones of the northeastern tract are under critical vulnerability conditions. Furthermore, the impact of the vulnerability of Tabriz City on population during an earthquake was included in this analysis for risk estimation. A comparison of the result produced by EVM and the Population Vulnerability (PV) of Tabriz City corroborated the validity of the results obtained by ANP-ANN. The findings of this paper are useful for decision-makers and government authorities to obtain a better knowledge of a city's vulnerability dimensions, and to adopt preparedness strategies in the future for Tabriz City. The developed hybrid framework of ANP and ANN Models can easily be replicated and applied to other urban regions around the world for sustainability and environmental management.

AB  - Background: Unconventional natural gas (UNG) extraction (fracking) is ongoing in 29 North American shale basins (20 states), with similar to 6000 wells found within the Fayetteville shale (north-central Arkansas). If the chemical signature of fracking is detectable in streams, it can be employed to bookmark potential impacts. We evaluated benthic biofilm community composition as a proxy for stream chemistry so as to segregate anthropogenic signatures in eight Arkansas River catchments. In doing so, we tested the hypothesis that fracking characteristics in study streams are statistically distinguishable from those produced by agriculture or urbanization.
   Results: Four tributary catchments had UNG-wells significantly more dense and near to our sampling sites and were grouped as 'potentially-impacted catchment zones' (PICZ). Four others were characterized by significantly larger forested area with greater slope and elevation but reduced pasture, and were classified as 'minimally-impacted' (MICZ). Overall, 46 bacterial phyla/141 classes were identified, with 24 phyla (52%) and 54 classes (38%) across all samples. PICZ-sites were ecologically more variable than MICZ-sites, with significantly greater nutrient levels (total nitrogen, total phosphorous), and elevated Cyanobacteria as bioindicators that tracked these conditions. PICZ-sites also exhibited elevated conductance (a correlate of increased ion concentration) and depressed salt-intolerant Spartobacteria, suggesting the presence of brine as a fracking effect. Biofilm communities at PICZ-sites were significantly less variable than those at MICZ-sites.
   Conclusions: Study streams differed by Group according to morphology, land use, and water chemistry but not in biofilm community structure. Those at PICZ-sites covaried according to anthropogenic impact, and were qualitatively similar to communities found at sites disturbed by fracking. The hypothesis that fracking signatures in study streams are distinguishable from those produced by other anthropogenic effects was statistically rejected. Instead, alterations in biofilm community composition, as induced by fracking, may be less specific than initially predicted, and thus more easily confounded by agriculture and urbanization effects (among others). Study streams must be carefully categorized with regard to the magnitude and extent of anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - Background and Aims A clone of the hybrid perennial C4 grass Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) is known for achieving exceptionally high rates of leaf CO2 uptake during chilling. This is a requisite of success in the early spring, as is the ability of the leaves to survive occasional frosts. The aim of this study was to search for genotypes with greater potential than Mxg for photosynthesis and frost survival under these conditions.
   Methods A total of 864 accessions representing 164 local populations of M. sacchariflorus (Msa), M. sinensis (Msi) and M. tinctorius (Mti) collected across Japan were studied. Accessions whose leaves survived a natural late frost in the field were screened for high maximum photosystem II efficiency (F-v/F-m) following chilling weather, as an indicator of their capacity for light-limited photosynthesis. Those showing the highest F-v/F-m were transferred to a high-light-controlled environment and maintained at chilling temperatures, where they were further screened for their capacities for high-light-limited and light-saturated leaf uptake of CO2 (Phi(CO2,max) and A(sat), respectively).
   Key Results For the first time, relatives of Mxg with significantly superior capacities for photosynthesis at chilling temperatures were identified. Msa accession '73/2' developed leaves in the spring that survived night-time frost, and during growth under chilling maintained a statistically significant 79 % higher Phi(CO2,max), as a measure of light-limited photosynthesis, and a 70 % higher Asat, as a measure of light-saturated photosynthesis. A second Msa accession, '73/3' also showed significantly higher rates of leaf uptake of CO2.
   Conclusions As remarkable as Mxg has proved in its chilling tolerance of C-4 photosynthesis, this study shows that there is still value and potential in searching for yet more superior tolerance. Msa accession '73/2' shows rates of light-limited and light-saturated photosynthesis at chilling temperatures that are comparable with those of the most cold-tolerant C-3 species. This adds further proof to the thesis that C-4 photosynthesis is not inherently limited to warm climates.

AB  - The identification of differentiating species, also termed indicator species, is a key issue in striving for group pattern in vegetation samples. With this objective in mind Jancey (1979) proposed species ranking on a variance ratio (F-ratio) criterion, the mechanism of analysis of variance. Almost 20 years later Dufrene and Legendre (1997) presented their indicator value analysis with the same objective in mind but based on different reasoning. This raises the question if (i) the results of the two approaches are equivalent or (ii), if one of the measures of performance is superior in predicting specific properties of ecosystems, such as site conditions, biodiversity, succession or other. Because the outcome of both methods strictly relies on the strength of vegetation pattern reflected by the data sets used as well as the quality of classifications, we compare results from a small and also a large real-world data set and we evaluate the effect of the number of groups involved when clustering sites. In a subsequent step, the ranking of indicator species identified by either of the methods is compared with a ranking obtained by correlating species with measured environmental factors. The results confirm that the outcome of ranking by maximum indicator value (IndVal) according to Dufrene and Legendre (1997) is very similar to the ranking devised by Jancey (1979). Rank correlation reaches a maximum of r > 0.95 when the data set is large and group number in clustering is low. In our examples Jancey's method is generally more closely related to the environmental predictive power of species, outperforming IndVal when applied to continuous variables measured in the field. We conclude that the potential of Jancey's method is generally underrated. As expected, the agreement of results between the two approaches depends on the strength of similarity patterns inherent in the data sets analysed. The method of Dufrene and Legendre (1997) is well adapted to issues of phytosociology where classification is frequently based on expert knowledge. If the resolving power of species is used as a surrogate for patterns and processes of plant-environment systems, then ranking by variance ratio may be the more promising approach.

AB  - Dynamics of soil properties in forests of Rhizophora mangle L. (Rhizophoraceae) in Margarita Island, Venezuela. Biochemical and microbiological properties of soils can provide information related to ecosystems environmental status. With the aim to determine the response of microbial biomass, and enzymatic and microbial activity in hypersaline (IS >= 55ups) and saline (IS<55ups) mangrove soils exposed to interstitial salinities (IS) greater than 36ups, these properties were measured in mono-specific forests of Rhizophora mangle at Laguna de la Restinga National Park (Margarita Island, Venezuela). During three seasons (dry, wet and transition), a total of 120 soil samples were collected from ten (5 hypersaline and 5 saline) randomly-selected sites of 1000m(2) each. Four soil samples (400-500g) per plot were randomly collected with a corer at a depth of 10cm using a 1m(2) quadrat; each sample consisted in the combination of 8 sub-samples (50-60g ea.). Physical, chemical, enzymatic, biochemical and microbiological properties of soil samples were determined using standard laboratory protocols. The response of microbial biomass and microbial and enzymatic activity was analyzed taking into account spatial and climatic factors and interstitial salinity. Microbial biomass was linked to each locality conditions, and was not sensitive to seasonal or salinity differences. Microbial activity remained functionally active during the study period and presented variable responses. Dehydrogenase activity proved to be a good indicator for flooded and anoxic environments, and arginine ammonification resulted to be the more sensitive microbial activity to changes in salinity. Regarding enzyme activities, spatial variability was the most widespread response. We did not find a unique general pattern between enzymatic activities and spatio-temporal variation; and only the enzyme phosphatase was negatively affected by salinity. We conclude that microbial populations of mangrove soils and their activities have functional adaptations to flooded and highly-saline environments typical of a negative estuary, subjected to drastic changes due to weather and water dynamics. Future studies are needed to determine the relation between the "health" of mangrove forest and microbial populations, and their activities in mangroves soils. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58(2): 547-564.

AB  - The natural characteristics of the Moldavian Plateau land and the human intervention lead to soil degradation on the slopes damaging seriously the environmental quality. In order to contribute to maintain soil losses at acceptable levels it was monitored surface runoff and soil erosion under cultivation conditions of the dominant plants in the area. The experiments carried out at the Podu-Iloaiei Agricultural Research and Development Station, during 1965-2006, aimed to study of water runoffs and soil losses by erosion in different crops; the annual rate of soil losses under anti-erosion protection of different crops; the influence of water runoffs and soil erosion on soil organic matter and nutrient losses. For this purpose an appropriate experimentation was established in a side with an average slope of 11%, including plots (25 m x 4 in) for runoff control, isolated from the rest of the area by metallic walls and equipped downstream with installations for collecting water and soil samples. The measurements were carried out on the whole area of the catchments, where the experiments were conducted since 1980, arranged by strip cropping and contour buffer strip. The experiments were supported by the appropriate instrumentation of a hydrological station providing rain gauge, triangular waste weir, limnigraph and devices for water and soil samplings. The results showed that mean annual soil losses by erosion during 1980-2006 were 0.14 t/ha in perennial grasses on the second growth year, 2.01 t/ha in beans, 2.57 t/ha in maize and 3.06 t/ha in sunflower. The highest losses were registered in maize continuous culture (335 kg/ha humus, 17.43 kg/ha nitrogen, 1.06 kg/ha mobile phosphorus and 2.36 kg/ha mobile potassium); these amounts decreased very much at the same time with the increase in rotation structure of crops (pea, wheat, alfalfa and perennial grasses) protecting soil against erosion. At three and four year rotations, which included good and very good cover plants for protecting soil against erosion, the amount of eroded soil and nutritive elements lost by erosion were very close to the limit allowable for this area.

AB  - The old reservoir areas built in 1950s-1970s left behind many socio-economic problems, because of the administrative backward migration and little migration fund, and all these problems would be tied to land. Based on interviewing with peasant households, combining land use survey and socio-economic statistical index, this paper analyzed land use change and its corresponding driving forces in Linshui reservoir area of Dahonghe Reservoir. Results showed that land use change in the reservoir area was mainly embodied on low-lying land submergence and migration requisition land. The former changed the land use patterns, and the latter mainly reconstructed original land property and made land over-fragmented. Cultivated land per capita was 0.041ha in this area, below the cordon of cultivated land per capita enacted by FAO. Currently, there were still 30.25% of peasant households being short of grain in trimester of one year, and there were 35.27% of people living under the poverty line. The conditions of eco-environment in Linshui Reservoir Area were worse, and healthy and sub-healthy eco-environment accounted for less proportion, composed of green belt around the reservoir area and paddy field ecosystem, and economic forest and orchard ecosystem, respectively. The stress of the reservoir project was macroscopic background to analyze the driving factors of land use change, and real underlying diving factor of the land use change in the area was the change of cultural landscape under the stress of reservoir project. The rapid increase of population was the key factor to induce the change of man-land relationship in the reservoir area, the low level of rural economy was the crucial factor to decide how migrants input for production, and the belief of migrants, influencing the land use patterns in a certain extent, was the inducing factor to keep land use stable. The low-lying submergence and infrastructure construction accompanied the reservoir project were leading factors driving land use change in the area, while changes in land use patterns, after the reservoir being built, were the responses of peasant households' behaviors to land use change.

AB  - Central aspects of the sustainability of a mangrove crab fishery in the Cacte estuary, Para, North Brazil, are assessed according to biological, economic and social criteria and based on a 5-year data series. Ucides cordatus is probably a keystone species in this mangrove ecosystem. Over half of rural coastal households depend on the crab for at least part of their income. The fishery shows seasonal and annual differences in terms of labour input, capture volumes and productivity. During the rainy season, more crab collectors work than during the dry season, although labour productivity is generally lower. A reason for this seemingly irrational producer behaviour is the lack of alternative income sources during this time of year. Labour productivity over the monitoring period decreased by 16%. Present crab fishery does not seem to endanger the U. cordatus population as a whole. Mostly mature old crabs, which have reproduced several times already, are captured. Females are not targeted due to lack of market demand. Nonetheless, males are slightly more abundant than females suggesting that the reproductive output of the crab stock is maintained at a sufficient level. Central for the economic and social sustainability of the fishery is crab collectors' purchasing power, which, between 1998 and 2001, fell by 20%. In 2001, the economic sustainability threshold was reached as crab collectors' incomes net of operational and investment costs fell to about the level of the official Brazilian minimum wage. This means that crab collection is now being undertaken at an income level which only just covers the regeneration of crab collectors' labour. At the same time, an ongoing erosion of social sustainability is reflected in territorial conflicts between crab collectors and in the incidence of alcoholism and reliance on child labour in crab collector households. Thus, the current fragility of economic sustainability and the undermining of social sustainability are accompanied by apparently undisturbed biological sustainability conditions. This highly asymmetric outcome is a challenge for transdisciplinary efforts to establish relevant fishery management priorities with the active participation of the centrally affected stakeholders.

AB  - The role of the aggregated distribution of attacks, a castration effect (cessation of reproduction of the parasitized hosts) and the differential selectivity for hosts by the parasitoid Trichopoda giacomellii on the population regulation of its host, Nezara viridula, was investigated using a detail-rich simulation model. The model parameters were estimated either in the laboratory or under field conditions. Additionally, key parameter values were estimated by fitting the model to field data of nine generations of the host and the parasite, respectively. The model proved to be robust, with a high coincidence between the parameter values obtained by fitting the model and the field/laboratory estimates. In both cases, the model reproduces the regular oscillations observed in the real system. Stability analysis revealed that the model could have different dynamic behaviors, unstable or stable depending on the parameter values. It was shown that the aggregated distribution of attacks, as described by the negative binomial distribution with a low k value (aggregation parameter of the parasitoid's egg distribution among hosts), was the dominant mechanism associated with the stability of the model, although there was some degree of interaction with the other two mechanisms (the castration effect and the differential selectivity for hosts). However, neither of these two mechanisms was able to regulate the parasite-host populations in the absence of the aggregated distribution of attacks. The field/laboratory estimate of parameters falls in all cases in the stability region with normal population densities, while the best parameter estimates by fitting the model sometimes fell in the region of the parameter space where the parasite became extinct. This is one of the few cases in which the theoretical stability behavior conclusions derived from simple mathematical models could be assessed with a complex and realistic simulation model based on field/laboratory data, and the dominant stabilizing mechanisms determined. Specifically, the best fit and the field estimates of the parameter k, an indicator of the degree of aggregation of the distribution of attacks, coincided in values less than 1, as predicted by theory for stable parasite-host populations. Larger k values lead to instability.

AB  - Few macrobenthic studies have dealt simultaneously with the two major gradients in estuarine benthic habitats: the salinity gradient along the estuary (longitudinal) and the gradients from high intertidal to deep subtidal sites (vertical gradient). In this broad-scale study, a large data set (3112 samples) of the Schelde estuary allowed a thorough analysis of these gradients, and to relate macrobenthic species distributions and community structure to salinity, depth, current velocities and sediment characteristics. Univariate analyses clearly revealed distinct gradients in diversity, abundance, and biomass along the vertical and longitudinal gradients. In general, highest diversity and biomass were observed in the intertidal, polyhaline zone and decreased with decreasing salinity.
   Abundance did not show clear trends and varied between spring and autumn. In all regions, very low values for all measures were observed in the subtidal depth strata. Abundance in all regions was dominated by both surface deposit feeders and sub-surface deposit feeders. In contrast, the biomass of the different feeding guilds showed clear gradients in the intertidal zone. Suspension feeders dominated in the polyhaline zone and showed a significant decrease with decreasing salinity. Surface deposit feeders and sub-surface deposit feeders showed significantly higher biomass values in the polyhaline zone as compared with the mesohaline zone. Omnivores showed an opposite trend.
   Multivariate analyses showed a strong relationship between the macrobenthic assemblages and the predominant environmental gradients in the Schelde estuary. The most important environmental factor was depth, which reflected also the hydrodynamic conditions (current velocities). A second gradient was related to salinity and confirms the observations from the univariate analyses. Additionally, sediment characteristics (mud content) explained a significant part of the macrobenthic community structure not yet explained by the two other main gradients. The different assemblages are further described in terms of indicator species and abiotic characteristics.
   The results showed that at a large, estuarine scale a considerable fraction of the variation in abundance and biomass of the benthic macrofauna correlated very well with environmental factors (depth, salinity, tidal current velocity, sediment composition).

AB  - The weak electric wave discharges of the knifefish, Apteronotus albifrons (gymnotiformes, apteronotidae) are used as a new biomonitor to assess water quality deterioration. The principle consists in a real-time analysis of the Electric Organ Discharge frequency and waveform. These two characteristics are naturally stable under standard conditions.
   Detailed descriptions of the biological sensor and the test apparatus as well as the set-up for recording, processing and analysing the electric signals are presented. The relationship between Apteronotus electric activity level and temperature of the surrounding water is determined. The variation of the water temperature was increased -decreased and vice versa. Bioelectric responses are investigated in a 22-32 degrees C temperature range.
   The A. albifrons rate of electric organ discharge is temperature dependent rising very significantly with a unit increase in water temperature (t greater than or equal to 246.9; df = 108; P < 0.001) and decreasing also very significantly with a unit fail in temperature (t greater than or equal to 310.3; df = 108; P < 0.001). For the set of the individual fish tested, the observed frequency variations lie between 45.4 and 63.9 Hz/degrees C. Regression coefficients obtained for downward temperature variations are always bigger than the corresponding coefficients for upward temperature variations. Student t-test comparison of the two types of coefficients reveals a sharp significant difference in 75% of the cases considered (6.167 less than or equal to t less than or equal to 18.024; df = 216; P = 0.001). The raw data of the A. albifrons electric activity is shown to be characterized by a phenomenon of hysteresis in the 0.3 to 4.5% range. The Q10-values of the discharge rate over the 22-32 degrees C temperature range was found to be 1.6. The observations did not reveal any dependence of the A. albifrons signal waveform on the temperature of the surrounding water. The temperature dependence of the Electric Organ Discharge frequency imposes the need for a very strict control of the temperature variations of the water surrounding the fish in order to ensure the reliability of using electric fish as indicators.

AB  - Biotic inventories provide critical data for conservation planning, but frequently, conservation decisions are made without surveys, due to lack of time, funds, or appropriate methodology. A method. target taxon analysis, is therefore proposed for streamlining regional biotic inventories. while simultaneously increasing their taxonomic coverage and spatial resolution. In this method, regional inventories focus on a number of narrowly defined target taxa, chosen to represent collectively an array of higher taxa. Such target taxa should be information rich: in other words, the pattern of species distributions in these taxa should correlate either with patterns of environmental heterogeneity or with distributional patterns of species in unrelated taxonomic groups. It is suggested that clades that experienced an evolutionary radiation within the region are likely to be information rich for conservation planning at or within this regional scale. Such clades will be identifiable as low-ranking, species-rich taxa with high endemism. The information richness of these potential target clades can then be evaluated by direct gradient methods of analysis that relate community compositional change to environmental factors, or by correlating distributional patterns of species among separate target clades.
   To assess this approach to biological inventory, a species-rich genus and subgenus of endemic butterflies from the island of Madagascar were chosen as target taxa and were evaluated for information richness in comparison to the entire butterfly fauna of Madagascar. Using canonical correspondence analysis and other analytical techniques, the subgenus of Malagasy Henotesia species (Satyrinae) proved to be as good or better than the entire butterfly fauna at delineating a variety of environmental gradients at both local and landscape scales. The endemic genus Strabena (Satyrinae) was only able to delineate such patterns under a restricted set of conditions. However, this genus, while species rich in Madagascar, was not exceptionally diverse nor were its species members abundant within the study area. It is concluded that target taxon analysis is a potentially useful tool for providing high-quality data while expanding coverage of taxonomic diversity for conservation planning.

AB  - The quantity and quality of organic matter (OM) available for macrobenthos vary on temporal and spatial scale, especially in coastal areas, where the seafloor is supplied by both seasonal pulses of primary production and terrestrial carbon transported by rivers. Human-induced environmental changes will alter OM transport to the seafloor, thus, it is of crucial importance to recognize the impacts of spatio-temporal OM variability on macrobenthic food webs. In this study, the seasonal variability of quantity and quality of OM and its effect on benthic food-web structure were studied at four locations along the southern coast of the Baltic Sea, characterized by similar species pools but different environmental settings and various scales of anthropogenic and riverine influence. Our study shows that temporal changes in the isotopic niche (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of benthic invertebrates follow the patterns of quantity and quality of OM related to seasonal changes of pelagic primary production, riverine discharge of terrestrial OM and the input of anthropogenically enriched sources. In the semi-enclosed bay, exposed to intensive summer blooms, all feeding groups expressed lower delta N-15 values in autumn, suggesting the incorporation of delta N-15-depleted cyanobacteria. At a location supplied by a higher proportion of OM from allochthonous sources (riverine discharge), omnivores occupied higher trophic levels, probably due to a higher abundance of meiobenthic prey. In contrast, at the open Polish coast, where the main food supply occurs during diatom spring bloom, the isotopic niche of omnivorous species showed much higher seasonal variability, underlining the importance of food availability for food-web diversity. Quick adaptation of benthic food-web structure to seasonal variations in OM properties and its modification by local conditions may indicate high plasticity of species feeding behavior that suggests a high capacity of benthic communities to mitigate ongoing changes in the marine environment, at least within the range observed today. Our results confirm that combination of spatial and temporal scales in sampling of the food-web structure is a good indicator of the ecosystem stability and function.

AB  - Drought is a devastating natural hazard that is difficult to define, detect and quantify. The increased availability of both meteorological and remotely sensed data provides an opportunity to develop new methods to identify drought conditions and characterize how drought changes over space and time. In this paper, we applied the surface energy balance model, SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System), for the period 2001-2018, to estimate evapotranspiration and other energy fluxes over the dehesa area of the Iberian Peninsula, with a monthly temporal resolution and 0.05 degrees pixel size. A satisfactory agreement was found between the fluxes modeled and the measurements obtained for 3 years by two flux towers located over representative sites (RMSD = 21 Wm(-2) and R-2 = 0.76, on average, for all energy fluxes and both sites). The estimations of the convective fluxes (LE and H) showed higher deviations, with RMSD = 26 W m(-2) on average, than Rn and G, with RMSD = 15 W m(-2). At both sites, annual evapotranspiration (ET) was very close to total precipitation, with the exception of a few wet years in which intense precipitation events that produced high runoff were observed. The analysis of the anomalies of the ratio of ET to reference ET (ETo) was used as an indicator of agricultural drought on monthly and annual scales. The hydrological years 2004/2005 and 2011/2012 stood out for their negative values. The first one was the most severe of the series, with the highest impact observed on vegetation coverage and grain production. On a monthly scale, this event was also the longest and most intense, with peak negative values in January-February and April-May 2005, explaining its great impact on cereal production (up to 45% reduction). During the drier events, the changes in the grasslands' and oak trees' ground cover allowed for a separate analysis of the strategies adopted by the two strata to cope with water stress. These results indicate that the drought events characterized for the period did not cause any permanent damage to the vegetation of dehesa systems. The approach tested has proven useful for providing insight into the characteristics of drought events over this ecosystem and will be helpful to identify areas of interest for future studies at finer resolutions.

AB  - The Yangye Formation sequence is widely exposed in Kashi sag, Tarim Basin, NW China. To investigate geochemical characteristics and depositional environment of the Yangye Formation successions, 26 samples from an outcrop kzgs section in the north and 21 core samples from YD-1 well in the south were subjected to various geochemical analyses. The average TOC content is 1.87 wt % in the kzgs section and 1.36 wt % in the YD-1 well, and most samples have fairly high TOC contents (> 1.0 wt %). Notably, samples in the YD-1 well are characterized by high S-1, S-2, HI and PG values, compared to those in the kzgs section. Based on pyrolysis data, organic matter (OM) in the kzgs section consists predominantly of type III kerogen with gas prone, whereas OM in the YD-1 well have oil/gas prone characters with dominating mixed type and type III kerogen with minor type II kerogen. T-max values (447-469 degrees C and 453-484 degrees C, respectively) imply that source rocks in the kzgs section are within peak to late mature stages, and samples in the YD-1 well contain late mature to post-mature OM, consistent with the results of Ro, PI, CPI, and biomarker maturity parameters. The distributions of n-alkane, isoprenoids, sterane and terpane, as well as carbon isotopes, suggest a predominance of algal, bacterial and planktonic OM, but with terrigenous higher plants influenced. However, samples in the kzgs section probably received more contributions of terrigenous and bacteria-reworked materials. Moreover, OM in the kzgs section was likely preserved in a suboxic, fresh/brackish condition, while OM from the YD-1 well was developed under a suboxic to oxygen-depleted, fresh with brackish influenced environment. There have distinct differences in organic richness, OM types and thermal maturity between the kzgs section and YD-1 well. Overall, the Yangye Formation in the whole Kashi sag still has fair to good hydrocarbon potential, and source rocks in the YD-1 well have more favorable potential to generate considerable oil and gas hydrocarbons.

AB  - Protected areas are one of the hammers in conservation toolkits, yet few protected areas exist that were designed to protect freshwater ecosystems. This is problematic as freshwater ecosystems are among the most threatened systems on earth. Nonetheless, terrestrial protected areas (TPAs) may afford spill-over benefits to freshwater ecosystems included within their boundaries, but evaluations of these potential benefits for the protection of freshwater fish diversity are lacking. Using fish community data from 175 lakes inside, outside, or bordering TPAs in Ontario, Canada, we sought to determine if TPAs preserve fish functional diversity. We focused on functional diversity because previous work indicated no taxonomic differences between these lakes, but a difference in normalised-length size-spectra slopes inside versus outside TPAs (indicator of unique predator-prey ratios and trophic energy transfer). We expected that communities inside TPAs would show greater functional diversity (i.e. functional dispersion and functional richness) and have more extreme trait combinations (i.e. functional divergence) than communities outside or bordering TPAs. We also tested for differences in the rarity of species-specific functional traits between fish communities inside, outside, or bordering TPAs, between thermal guilds, and across average body size and overall prevalence of the species. Our results indicated no significant differences in functional diversity among lake fish communities inside, outside, or bordering TPAs. However, fish communities inside TPAs had more extreme trait combinations than outside TPAs because abundant species in lake communities outside TPAs had more ubiquitous trait combinations than abundant fishes inside TPAs. Small-bodied species showed greater functional rarity than large-bodied species, indicating that small-bodied fishes fill functionally unique roles while the most prevalent, large-bodied species possess a more generalist set of traits. Overall, the similarity of functional diversity metrics for lake fish communities inside, outside, or bordering TPAs in Ontario suggests that TPAs capture the functional diversity of Ontario's lake fish communities. However, we encourage similar evaluations in regions where environmental conditions and stressors are more distinct across TPA boundaries than they are in Ontario, as these types of evaluations will inform guidelines for the design of freshwater protected areas and monitoring of their effectiveness in the future.

AB  - BackgroundBeing the product of the same environment, soil and vegetation are mutually associated with each other, but the relationships between edaphic properties and vegetation characteristics are still far from clear. Accordingly, the specific aim of this study is to identify relationships between forest site types/forest types and the fertility of soil organic horizons in northwestern Russia. The relationships were assessed at the level of three large forest regions, the northern and middle taiga of the Republic of Karelia, and the Karelian Isthmus (Leningrad region), based on 37 spruce, 66 pine, and 16 birch plots which were integrated with the International Cooperative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests).ResultsSoil forming rock and land-use history partly explain the differences in the fertility of soil organic horizons between the forest ecosystems in northwestern Russia. Climatic factors are closely correlated with plant species richness, density and the fertility of soil organic horizons. Nutrient content in the organic horizons increased from poor to rich site types identified according to composition of understory vegetation and the occurrence of certain indicator species, i.e. Cajander's forest site types. The most informative parameters in explaining differences between Cajander's types were nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen ratio, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium, and base saturation. Extractable phosphorus, carbon to nitrogen ratio, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, aluminum and base saturation were the most informative parameters in explaining differences between forest types identified within the Cajander types in accordance with the tree species composition, i.e. Sukachev's forest types. The organic horizons of spruce and birch-dominated forests contained significantly more nutrients, compared to those dominated by pine. These differences were explained by differences in litter quality, and the crown shape and density of tree species, which affect the intensity of nutrient leaching.ConclusionsThe study presents new findings regarding the relationships between forest sites/types and the fertility of soil organic horizons in northwestern Russia. Differences in organic horizon's fertility between the taiga subzones are explained by differences in the soil forming rock, climatic conditions, land-use history and shares of forest site types/forest types.

AB  - Coastal ecological and economic zoning (ZEEC) has been elaborated and implemented since 1988 in various scales and in fractions of the national territory with the objective of carrying out integrated environmental and territorial management actions. The diverse historical, political, economic and environmental contexts in which they were created denote their different effectiveness degrees. With the intention of carrying out an unprecedented quantitative and qualitative evaluation on this instrument, the Ministry of the Environment, in partnership with the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG), Vale do Itajai University (UNIVALI) and University de Silo Paulo (USP), developed a methodological framework that sought to combine the technical base of available information with the perception of social actors preponderant in the process. This method, developed given the lack of specific methodological references for this type of analysis, is presented here from the perspective of the results obtained with the evaluation of coastal EEZs in the country. The following steps were performed: 1 - Pre-planning; 2 - Documental analysis, with the construction of a systematized database; 3 - Elaboration of a system with 35 specific Indicators; 4 - Elaboration and application of semi-structured interviews in 16 coastal states of Brazil; 5 - Application of the Lickert Scale to the indicators; 6 - Individual analysis of the indicators by means of specific evaluation sheets; 7 - Validation workshop conducted with the presence of coastal states representatives; and 8 - Integrated analysis of indicators. The results indicate, if not to a favourable scenario, to a situation of consolidation and maturity of the management instrument, although not in a homogeneous way, along the Brazilian coast. Such diagnosed scenario does not necessarily indicate a better socio-environmental condition in a given territory, certainly the desired effect in this context. The methodological strategy applied, although it demanded a much longer time than originally planned, was satisfactory with regard to the collection and analysis of the EEZ. As an observation for future applications of the method, it is suggested the revision of certain indicators, especially with respect to the semi-structured interviews, which sometimes did not reflect the need to feed the indicator, as well as the transposition of the urgency of achieving the same.

AB  - Sunflower is one of the major oilseeds produced in Tanzania, but due to insufficient domestic production more than half of the country's demand is imported. The improvement of the sunflower food value chain (FVC) understanding is important to ensure an increase in the production, availability, and quality of edible oil. In order to analyse causes and propose solutions to increase the production of sunflower oil, a conceptual framework that proposes the combined use of different models to provide insights about the sunflower FVC was developed. This research focus on the identification of agricultural models that can provide a better understanding of the sunflower FVC in Tanzania, especially within the context of food security improvement. A FVC scheme was designed considering the main steps of sunflower production. Thereafter, relevant models were selected and placed along each step of the FVC. As result, the sunflower FVC model in Tanzania is organized in five steps, namely (1) natural resources; (2) crop production; (3) oil processing; (4) trade; and (5) consumption. Step 1 uses environmental indicators to analyse soil parameters on soil-water models (SWAT, LPJmL, APSIM or CroSyst), with outputs providing data for step 2 of the FVC. In the production step, data from step 1, together with other inputs, is used to run crop models (DSSAT, HERMES, MONICA, STICS, EPIC or AquaCrop) that analyse the impact on sunflower yields. Thereafter, outputs from crop models serve as input for bio-economic farm models (FSSIM or MODAM) to estimate production costs and farm income by optimizing resource allocation planning for step 2. In addition, outputs from crop models are used as inputs for macro-economic models (GTAP, MAGNET or MagPie) by adjusting supply functions and environmental impacts within steps 3, 4, and 5. These models simulate supply and demand, including the processing of products to determine prices and trade volumes at market equilibrium. In turn, these data is used by bio-economic farm models to assess sunflower returns for different farm types and agro-environmental conditions. Due to the large variety of models, it is possible to assess significant parts of the FVC, reducing the need to make assumptions, while improving the understanding of the FVC.

AB  - Studies have shown that arsenic is desorbed/released into groundwater as a result of bacterial reduction of As(V) and Fe(Ill). However, bacterial activities like sulfate reduction process can also reduce the content of arsenic in groundwater. In this study, we examined the effects of different biogeochemical processes (e.g. NO3- and SO(4)(2-)reduction) on arsenic, by investigating the chemical characteristics and bacterial community structure of groundwater in the Datong Basin, northern China. Along the groundwater flow path, arsenic concentration increased from <1 to 947.6 mu g/L with dominant bacteria change from aerobic (Fluviicola, Rhodococcus) to denitrifying bacteria (Thauera, Gallionella), and then to sulfate reducing bacteria (Desulfosporosinus). According to the groundwater redox sensitive indicators (Eh, NO3-, SO42-/Cl- and Fe2+) concentrations (or ratios), the sampling points were approximately divided into three zones (I, I" and II). Variation in features of these indicators suggested that the groundwater evolved from a weakly oxidizing environment (Zone I, Eh average 933 mV, respectively) to strong reducing environment (Zone II, Eh average -101.8 mV). In Zone I, bacteria mainly consuming O-2 or NO3- were found which inhibits Fe(III) and As(V) reduction reaction, resulting in a low As zone (<1 to 3.3 mu g/L). However, in Zone II, where O-2 and NO3- have been depleted, SO42- reduction appears to be the dominant process, and the Fe(III) and As(V) reduction processes are also occurring and hence, enrichment of As in the groundwater (2.8 to 947.6 mu g/L, average 285.6 mu g/L). Besides, bacterial Fe(III) reduction process was retarded due to the weakly alkaline conditions (pH 7.60-8.11, average 7.83), but abiotic Fe(III) reduction by HS- may be continued. Therefore, we conclude that the Fe(III) and As(V) reduction processes contributed to arsenic enrichment in the groundwater, and the reductive desorption of arsenate is the main occurring process especially in the weakly alkaline environment. Moreover, NCT reduction process can significantly restrain the release of arsenic, but the process of SO42- reduction is insignificant for arsenic concentration decline in natural groundwater.

AB  - The natural flow regime of rivers across the world has been largely modified. Understanding the extent to which the flow regime deviates from natural conditions is necessary for designing sound management and restoration measures. In this regard, 'Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration' is currently considered one of the most effective approaches for assessing hydrologic alteration (HA). However, several generalized drawbacks such as the climatic variability between the pre- and post-impacted series and the scarcity of hydrological data in many impaired rivers should be addressed. In this study, a protocol with the following five alternative designs based on data availability is presented: (1) Paired-Before-After Control-Impact (BACIP), (2) Before-After (BA), (3) Control-Impact (Cl), (4) Hydrological Classification (HC) and (5) Predicted Hydrological indices (HP). BACIP compares the status of the impacted gauge before and after the perturbation is started, in addition to controlling for natural climatic changes. Hence, it has been considered as the reference benchmark for all other designs. When this protocol was applied to 11 reservoirs situated in the northern third of the Iberian Peninsula, the BA design was able to correctly identify most of the non-significant HA but failed in almost one quarter of the significant alterations. Similarly, BACIP and Cl showed an agreement of >80%. This suggests that the method is suitable when proper data are unavailable for BACIP or BA. In addition, our results indicated that the critical thresholds for HA varied depending on the hydrological index being considered. Significant HAs ranged from <5% for the number of days with increasing and decreasing flows to >64% for the duration of low-flow pulses. To delineate adequate thresholds, further research combining hydrological analyses with the biological response to the HA is warranted. Finally, the application of HC and HP designs revealed a significant degree of uncertainty related to the intra-class variability and the predictive error of the models. Therefore, 25% of the analysis could not be evaluated. However, in the evaluable cases, the HC and HP designs correctly assessed >75% of the HA, which highlighted the potential of this method in cases of scarce streamflow data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil samples were collected from six different localities and habitats in the Gireniz valley of Denizli province, Turkey, where six species of mushroom (Agaricus langei, Lactarius salmonicolor, Morchella conica, Rhizopogon roseolus, Russula delica and Tricholoina terreum) grow naturally and plentifully, and which are known as the 'home' of these mushrooms, and their physical properties (soil reaction, salt, saturation, organic matter and lime) and chemical properties (P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) were determined. In addition, the vegetation, elevation and growing seasons of these mushrooms were studied in order to investigate the effects of habitat characteristics, on their growth.
   It was found that mushroom growth required a soil that was moderately or slightly alkaline (pH 7.70-8.19), non-saline (432-550 mu S/cm), clayey (74-109%) or clayey-loamy (67-69%) in structure, having 1.56-5.49% humus as organic matter, and chalky (1.26-33.48%). Also, such macro- and micro elements as P (3.64-10.58 mg kg(-1)), K (221.4-381.4 mg kg(-1)), Ca (5917-9195 mg kg(-1)), Mg (425.1-1202 mg kg(-1)), Cu (0.459-1.334 mg kg(-1)), Fe (6.91-47.90 mg kg(-1)), Mn (4.43-30.08 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (0.155-1.567 mg kg(-1)) are needed for the growth and reproduction of mushrooms. It was established that the concentration in Na in the soils was very low (10.92-20.85 mg kg(-1)). It was determined in our study that mushrooms needed suitable vegetation, elevation and temperature in order to grow plentifully in a given area. It was also established that mushroom variety was high in areas where plant variety was also high.
   It is thought that areas where mushrooms grow plentifully in the wild will be effective in protecting or bringing under cultivation various edible mushrooms which have their own characteristic habitat, climatic and soil conditions, and which are used as economic, food or medical resources, whether locally or more generally. Also, some mushroom species could be indicators of the environment where they are found or of the soils in which they grow.

AB  - Thermokarst lakes are assumed to develop cyclically, driven by processes that are triggered by climate and maintained by internal feedbacks that may trigger lake drainage. However, the duration of these cycles remains uncertain, as well as whether or not they affect the stabilization of lake ecosystems in permafrost regions over millennial time scales. Our research has combined investigations into modern lake-to-lake variability with a study of the long-term development of individual lakes. We have investigated the physico-chemical and diatom compositions of a set of 101 lakes with a variety of different origins in central Yakutia (Eastern Siberia), including thermokarst lakes, fluvial-erosion thermokarst lakes, fluvial-erosion lakes, and dune lakes. We found a significant relationship between lake genesis and the present-day variability in environmental and diatom characteristics, as revealed by multi-response permutation procedures, indicator species analyses, and redundancy analyses. Environmental parameters also exhibit a significant correlation with variations in the diatom data, for which they may have been to a substantial extent responsible. Mg and SO4 concentrations, together with pH and water depth, were identified as the most important parameters, influencing the variations in the diatom data almost as much as the entire environmental parameter set. We were therefore able to establish a robust Mg-diatom transfer function, which was then applied to three Holocene lake records. From these reconstructions, together with a general interpretation of the diatom record (including, e.g., the ratio between benthic/epiphytic and planktonic taxa), we have been able to infer that all three of these lakes show (1) a continuous record with no desiccation events, (2) high lake water-levels during the early Holocene, (3) centennial to millennial scale variability, and (4) high levels of variability during the early Holocene but rather stable conditions during the late Holocene (a feature that is also known from other sites around the world). We therefore concluded that the development of these three lakes was mainly driven directly by the climate, rather than by thaw lake cycling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global Ocean Biogeochemistry General Circulation Models are useful tools to study biogeochemical processes at global and large scales under current climate and future scenario conditions. The credibility of future estimates is however dependent on the model skill in capturing the observed multi-annual variability of firstly the mean bulk biogeochemical properties, and secondly the rates at which organic matter is processed within the food web. For this double purpose, the results of a multi-annual simulation of the global ocean biogeochemical model PELAGOS have been objectively compared with multi-variate observations from the last 20 years of the 20th century, both considering bulk variables and carbon production/consumption rates. Simulated net primary production (NPP) is comparable with satellite-derived estimates at the global scale and when compared with an independent data-set of in situ observations in the equatorial Pacific. The usage of objective skill indicators allowed us to demonstrate the importance of comparing like with like when considering carbon transformation processes. NPP scores improve substantially when in situ data are compared with modeled NPP which takes into account the excretion of freshly-produced dissolved organic carbon (DOC). It is thus recommended that DOC measurements be performed during in situ NPP measurements to quantify the actual production of organic carbon in the surface ocean. The chlorophyll bias in the Southern Ocean that affects this model as well as several others is linked to the inadequate representation of the mixed layer seasonal cycle in the region. A sensitivity experiment confirms that the artificial increase of mixed layer depths towards the observed values substantially reduces the bias. Our assessment results qualify the model for studies of carbon transformation in the surface ocean and metabolic balances. Within the limits of the model assumption and known biases, PELAGOS indicates a net heterotrophic balance especially in the more oligotrophic regions of the Atlantic during the boreal winter period. However, at the annual time scale and over the global ocean, the model suggests that the surface ocean is close to a weakly positive autotrophic balance in accordance with recent experimental findings and geochemical considerations.

The study was conducted between March 1997 and March 1998. The region is known by its sustained economic development and one of the highest population growth rates in the country (4% per year). The objective of this work was the assessment of organic pollution spatial gradients in both rivers, as a function of the hydrological regime (a long period of drought from May to October and floodings the rest of the year). Three groups of biotic indices were applied to characterize the level of organic pollution and were based on planktonic microalgae to evaluate water quality. The relative performance of these indices was then compared for use to biomonitoring programs. The diversity indices: Shannon-Weaver and Whilm-Dorris were not highly sensible to detect moderate pollution. The saprobity indices (Pantle and Buck and Diatom Assemblage Index of Watanabe et al.), were useful to detect intermediate levels of organic load, but their sensitivity dropped at high pollution levels. The second index precisely discriminated the most deteriorated part of river Rosario, with values between 0.3 - 0.7 (extreme poli-saprobity). Raw sewage discharges along the most polluted sector of river Arias-Arenales were assigned a value between 10 and 11 in both periods of the hydrological regime. Both saprobity indices consider the same indicator pollution value of species. The first one is based on the relative abundance of the species while the second one is calculated with the species relative frequency. The second index is better than the first one in considering non-dominant species that were constant in each particular environmental condition. The principal component analysis allowed a representation of time and space pollution patterns and showed the specific microalgae assemblage for all the sampling stations and for both periods in the hydrological cycle. Only the latter proved to be fully useful and correct for the biological characterization of water quality system.

AB  - Twenty-six strains of Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from green olive fermentations were tested for cross-antagonistic activities in an agar drop diffusion test. Cell-free supernatants from four of these strains were shown to inhibit the growth of at least one of the L. plantarum indicator strains. L. plantarum LPCO10 provided the broadest spectrum of activity and was selected for further studies. The inhibitory compound from this strain was active against some gram-positive bacteria, including clostridia and propionibacteria as well as natural competitors of L. plantarum in olive fermentation brines. In contrast, no activity against gram-negative bacteria was detected. Inhibition due to the effect of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, or bacteriophages was excluded. Since the inhibitory activity of the active supernatant was lost after treatment with various proteolytic enzymes, this substance could be classified as a bacteriocin, designated plantaricin S. Plantaricin S was also sensitive to glycolytic and lipolytic enzymes, suggesting that it was a glycolipoprotein. It exhibited a bactericidal and nonbacteriolytic mode of action against indicator cells. This bacteriocin was heat stable (60 min at 100-degrees-C), active in a pH range of 3.0 to 7.0, and also stable in crude culture supernatants during storage. Ultrafiltration studies indicated that plantaricin S occurred as multimolecular aggregates and that the size of the smallest active form is between 3 and 10 kDa. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, plantaricin S migrated as a peptide of ca. 2.5 kDa. Maximum production of plantaricin S was obtained in a fermentor system in unregulated pH and log-phase cultures of L. plantarum LPCO10 in MRS broth plus 4% NaCl. In these culture conditions, a second bacteriocin (designated plantaricin T) was produced in late-stationary-phase cultures of L. plantarum LPCO10. On the basis of its biological activity, its sensitivity to various enzymes, and its molecular weight (lower than that of plantaricin S) as assessed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, plantaricin T appeared different from plantaricin S. Curing experiments with L. plantarum LPCO10 resulted in the appearance of variants that no longer produced either of the two bacteriocins but that were still immune to both of them.

AB  - The Paleocene Waipawa Formation is a widespread, similar to 2-80 m-thick marine mudstone that occurs in several New Zealand basins. It is relatively enriched in organic matter (OM) and is the inferred source of a sub-commercial oil discovery and several correlated oil seeps. To determine the organofacies and depositional influences on the petroleum potential of the formation, we have undertaken a high-resolution, multidisciplinary study of the Taylor White section in the central East Coast Basin. This section is the thickest stratigraphically coherent surface exposure of the formation and includes contacts with the bounding Whangai and Wanstead formations. Bathymetric indicators within the foraminiferal assemblages indicate a slope setting for the section, deepening from middle to lower bathyal through the Waipawa-Wanstead succession. Significantly, the Whangai Formation in this section is barren of foraminifera. Dinoflagellate and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy provides somewhat conflicting age control but a resulting age model indicates a tenfold increase in compacted sediment accumulation rate during Waipawa deposition (from similar to 1 to similar to 10 cm/ky).
   Our multivariate statistical analysis of geochemical and paleontological data reveals systematic variation in paleoenvironmental and source rock parameters within the section, with samples forming four distinct clusters or organofacies: OM-rich and OM-poor Waipawa organofacies, Whangai, and Wanstead organofacies. The two Waipawa organofacies are distinguished by enrichments in total organic carbon (TOC) and organic C-13, dominance of phytoclasts (mainly degraded woody plant matter; 66-98%), and low amounts of amorphous organic matter (< 3%). Higher contributions of terrestrial OM are also indicated by high phenol/naphthalene ratios and higher plant biomarkers of mainly angiosperm origin (e.g., high relative oleanane contents, and high C-24 tetracyclic/C-23 tricyclic terpane ratio). A small but significant marine OM contribution within the Waipawa deposition is indicated by unusually high abundance of C-35 steranes of marine pelagophyte origin, whereas the higher sulfur content and redox indicators signal hypoxic to anoxic conditions within the depositional environment. Stratigraphic fluctuations in key geochemical parameters within the Waipawa Formation indicate episodic influxes of terrestrial OM into the slope environment, with consequent reduction in water-column oxygen levels. The inferred oxygen depletion in the water column and sediments together with sulfurisation appears to have resulted in enhanced preservation of OM.
   Whangai and Wanstead organofacies are characterised by a greater proportion of marine OM but are distinguished from each other by differences in OM preservation: OM is well-preserved with indications of hypoxia in the Whangai organofacies but is poorly preserved in the Wanstead organofacies. Geochemical fingerprinting identifies an interval of Whangai organofacies that separates two phases of Waipawa organofacies deposition. The lower phase comprises four alternations between OM-rich and OM-poor Waipawa organofacies and the upper phase comprises a single pulse of OM-rich Waipawa facies bounded by OM-poor intervals.
   Overall, Waipawa Formation in this section has TOC and pyrolysable hydrocarbon (S2) values of 0.2-4.6 (mean 2.2) wt% and 0.1-12.4 (mean 3.9) mg HC/g rock, respectively. One-third of S2 values exceed 5 mg HC/g rock, indicating good-very good bulk petroleum potential, with the remainder having poor-fair potential. Petroleum potential (S2) increases with increasing TOC (R-2 = 0.85). Hydrogen index (HI) values range from 21 to 295 mg HC/g TOC, averaging just 147 mg HC/g TOC. In line with these modest HI values, quantitative pyrolysis-gas chromatography confirms that the petroleum potential is primarily for gas or gas-condensate, with relatively little oil potential. Of the total paraffinic petroleum yield, gas (n-C1-5) contributes 80-100%, whilst total (n-C6+) and non-volatile (n-C15+) paraffinic oil contribute <= 20% and <= 6%, respectively. Despite the low paraffinic oil potentials, n-C6+ and n-C15+ correlate relatively strongly with HI, and less strongly with TOC.
   The overall gas-condensate-prone nature of the Waipawa organofacies at Taylor White reflects the pre-dominance of woody phytoclasts, which are unlikely to produce paraffinic oil. The small paraffinic oil component is instead more likely to be associated with the marine algal component. Although this component is volumetrically subordinate, the higher paraffinic oil potential appears to result from the combination of high productivity of specific marine algae (i.e., pelagophytes), hypoxic depositional conditions and, most importantly, increased preservation of OM, including through sulfurisation. This raises the possibility of more algal-rich, oil prone facies existing within the Waipawa Formation in areas with higher TOC or, alternatively, in areas beyond the direct reach of the terrestrial influxes, yet still sufficiently influenced by low water-column oxygen levels and high sulfur contents that promote enhanced OM preservation.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau, also known as the "Water Tower of Asia" because of its function as a water storage and supply region, responds dramatically to modern climate changes. Paleoecological shifts inferred from lake sediment archives provide essential insights into past climate changes, and the processes that drove those shifts. This is especially true for studies of lakes in endorheic basins on the Tibetan Plateau, where lake level is regulated predominantly by Monsoon intensity. Such water bodies provide excellent opportunities to reconstruct past changes in humidity. Most paleolimnological investigations of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau, however, have involved the study of a single sediment core, making it difficult to discern between changes caused by local events and those caused by lake-wide or regional processes. Here we present results from a paleolimnological study of Lake Taro Co, a currently closed-basin lake in Central Tibet. We compared a sediment record from the central part of the lake to a record from the near-shore area, and present results of sedimentological and bioindicator (chironomid, diatom, pollen) analyses from both records. Results show three periods of lake-wide ecosystem change (> ca. 5250, 5250-2250 and < since about 2250 cal year BP), which reflect a continuous drying trend throughout the Middle and Late Holocene. In addition to this lake-wide trend, we identified two local events in the sediment core from the southeastern, nearshore site. These include (1) a hiatus between 12,400 and 5400 cal year BP and (2) an 1800-year period of distinct paleoenvironmental conditions (5400-3600 cal year BP). We hypothesize that both events were caused by relocation of a river in the southeast sector of the lake's catchment. We propose that the first relocation caused an erosion event that removed sediment, thereby producing the hiatus. During the following 1800 years, the core site may have been located on the river delta, before another river relocation at 3600 cal year BP established the modern prodelta situation. Our study demonstrates the value of using multiple sediment cores from a lake, to better identify processes that control widespread versus local events.

AB  - Background The environment exerts a strong influence on the fish external microbiota, with lower diversity and increased abundances of opportunistic bacterial groups characterizing cultured fish compared to their wild counterparts. Deviation from a healthy external microbiota structure has been associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial pathogens. Treatment of wild-caught broodstock with copper sulfate for the removal of external parasites is a common aquaculture practice. Despite the microbiota's importance to fish health, the effects of copper sulfate on mucosal bacterial communities and their ability to recover following this chemical treatment have not been examined. The skin microbiota of adult common snook was characterized from wild individuals (Wild), and wild-caught fish maintained in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) immediately following a month-long copper sulfate treatment (Captive-1), and then two-weeks (Captive-2) and 2 years (Captive-3) after cessation of copper treatment. Results The skin microbiota of wild fish were characterized by high diversity and taxa including Synechocococcus, SAR11, and a member of the Roseobacter clade. Bacterial diversity decreased in Captive individuals during the 2-year sampling period. Captive fish harbored greater abundances of Firmicutes, which may reflect glycan differences between aquaculture and natural feeds. Bacterial taxa with copper resistance mechanisms and indicative of metal contamination were enriched in Captive-1 and Captive-2 fish. Vibrionaceae were dominant in Captive fish, particularly immediately and 2 weeks following copper treatment. Based on our observations and previous literature, our results suggest putatively beneficial taxa amass over time in captivity. Within 2 years, Captive individuals harbored Bacillus which contains numerous probiotic candidates and the complex carbon degraders of the family Saprospiraceae. Predicted butanoate metabolism exceeded that of Wild fish, and its reported roles in immunity and energy provision suggest a prebiotic effect for fishes. Conclusions The mucosal microbiota contains bacterial taxa that may act as bioindicators of environmental pollution. Increases in mutualistic groups indicate a return to a beneficial skin microbiota following copper sulfate treatment. Our data also suggests that vastly different taxa, influenced by environmental conditions, can be associated with adult fish without noticeable health impairment, perhaps due to establishment of various mutualists to maintain fish mucosal health.

AB  - Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania contains a fossiliferous, well-characterized Pleistocene sedimentary record and provides the opportunity to study the relationships between a changing climate, ecology, and hominin evolution. The Olduvai Gorge Coring Project drilled four cores (1A, 2A, 3A, and 3B) into the depocenter of Paleolake Olduvai in 2014 to achieve increased temporal resolution of local climate and ecological data, and investigate the influence and timing of regional climate and tectonics on local signals. We present high-resolution records of bulk organic carbon isotopes (delta C-13(org), parts per thousand) from Cores 2A and 3A, total organic carbon (wt%) from Cores 2A and 3A, and organic carbon-nitrogen ratios (C:N) from Core 2A. Previous work at Olduvai linked % TOC and delta C-13(org), to orbitally paced variations in lake depth and ecosystem dynamics from Upper Bed I and Lower Bed II (1.9-1.7 Ma), associated with eccentricity maxima and the presence of a perennial saline-alkaline lake in the basin. Bulk organic geochemical properties in both cores exhibit marked shifts in variance and magnitude at 1.9 and 1.7 Ma. Low % TOC values prior to and following 1.9-1.7 Ma implicate low productivity and/or increased degradation of organic matter, while C:N ratios from Core 2A reflect increased aquatic or bacterial input. Within the 1.9 to 1.7 Ma interval, high % TOC is dominated by terrestrial inputs as evidenced by high C:N ratios, and bulk delta C-13(org) captures high variability C3-C4 ecosystem dynamics. Climate variability is highest from 1.9-1.7 Ma, but the delta C-13(org) records are not consistent between Core 2A and Core 3A. From 1.9-1.7 Ma, Core 3A has increased indicators of erosion relative to Core 2A, suggesting a sedimentary aliasing of the delta C-13(org) record in Core 3A. Outside of the 1.9-1.7 Ma interval, both changes in organic carbon source and preferential preservation of proxies for wet conditions may obscure true climate variability, inviting further investigation into the ability of the Olduvai Gorge sedimentary record to test climate variability hypotheses for hominin evolutionary events.

AB  - Pesticides are frequently detected in surface waters, sometimes at levels exceeding ecotoxicological guidelines. We screened for almost 100 pesticides in 32 streams from intense agricultural areas in Southern Sweden, in concert with water chemistry parameters. In addition, we investigated the communities of benthic macroinvertebrates, biofilm nematodes and algae and calculated multiple bioassessment metrics. The number of pesticides found in each stream ranged between 2 and 52, but the sum of Toxic Units (Sigma TU) for the mixtures was generally low, and exceeded the European Uniform Principles only in a single sample for algae and in 2% of the samples for Daphnia. Only nematode communities were significantly correlated with the Sigma TU, potentially due to their higher pesticide exposure in biofilms. Diatom metrics showed that most streams were impacted by eutrophication and macroinvertebrate metrics showed good status in most streams, whereas the SPEAR(pesticides) (SPEcies At Risk) index, specifically designed to indicate pesticide effects, showed that about half of the samples were at risk. Interestingly, SPEAR(pesticides) was not correlated to Sigma TUDaphnia and this discrepancy suggests that redefining the boundaries for quality classes might be necessary for this index. Moreover, SPEAR(pesticides) was positively correlated with the commonly used macroinvertebrate index ASPT, although disparate results were found for several streams. We argue that this questions the scaling of both metrics and the specificity of their responses. We discuss that the overall good/moderate status of the streams, despite the intense agriculture in the catchments, can be due to the fact that i) a sampling strategy with repeated grab samples did not capture peak pesticide concentrations, thus underestimating acute exposure, ii) pesticide run-off indeed was low, due to measures such as buffer strips, and iii) the nutrient-rich conditions and high sediment loads counteracted pesticide toxicity. We conclude that agricultural land use was the overriding stressor in the investigated streams, including strong effects of nutrients, less apparent effects of pesticides and likely impact of hydromorphological alterations (not specifically addressed in this study).

AB  - Simple Summary Welfare assessment in outdoor and extensive systems has rarely been investigated, and little is known about the most appropriate indicators. This study aimed at compiling a list of animal-based measures of welfare for domestic ruminants raised on outdoor/extensive systems by means of a systematic review. Out of 810 papers retrieved, 52 matched the inclusion criteria and went through an in-depth analysis. According to available literature, 45 indicators have been used to assess welfare on pasture, often following different methodologies. Most indicators were measured by observers even if the use of sensor technologies increased in recent years. Considering the growing interest in pasture-based or grass-fed products, it is suggested that welfare assessment in outdoor/extensive farming systems is carried out by following shared methodologies in order to provide evidence of the higher animal welfare claims that these products often imply compared to indoor systems.
   Abstract Outdoor and extensive farming systems allow animals to behave in a natural way and are often perceived as welfare friendly. Nonetheless, the natural environment poses multiple challenges to the welfare of animals, sometimes hampering their capacity to cope. Welfare assessment in outdoor and extensive systems has been rarely investigated, and little is known about the most appropriate indicators. The aim of this review was to identify animal-based measures of welfare to apply in extensive and pasture-based systems in domestic ruminants. Through the use of a dedicated software for systematic reviews, 810 papers were screened and a total of 52 papers were retained for in-depth analysis. ABM resulting from these papers were initially divided according to the species (cattle and small ruminants, including sheep and goats) and then to four principles: comfort, behavior, feeding and health. The results showed that welfare data were collected applying different methodologies, with an increasing use of sensors in recent years. The need to herd and restrain animals for individual data collection is one of the major constraints to data collection in extensive farming systems. It is suggested that welfare assessment in outdoor/extensive farming systems is carried out by following shared procedures in order to provide evidence of the higher animal welfare claims that these products often imply compared to indoor systems.

AB  - Engineering and geographic substantiation of the anti-erosion organization of agricultural landscapes requires not only differentiated estimations of erosion losses, but also commensurate (in terms of space-time scales) estimations of the soil loss tolerance. The main approaches for determining the participation of estimations of soil formation in the substantiation of erosion tolerance have been defined. This study is aimed at justifying the methods of incorporating the results of pedogenesis modeling into computational methods for organizing agricultural landscapes. This paper presents the results of a study of the process of formation of the humus horizon and the accumulation of organic carbon in soils, based on soils from archaeological sites in the Crimean Peninsula over a period from 25 to 2000 years ago, with differences in climate and parent rock, in a region with a thousand-year history of human activity. The patterns of variation in the thickness of the humus horizons over time and the accumulation of carbon were determined, and estimates for the rate of the pedogenesis were obtained. In connection with the slowing of the rate of pedogenesis over time, the chronofunction of the change in the thickness of soils (of both exponential and logistic types) may be applied and, on this basis, it is possible to calculate the rates of the formation of the humus horizon depending on the morphological status of the soils. During re-naturation of highly degraded soils, maximum renewal rates may take place only with a very high input of organic matter, which is crucial to take into account in the development and implementation of programs for the rehabilitation of degraded lands. Under the conditions of slope agriculture, the rationale for T-values should be linked to many factors of the input and consumption of organic carbon, which provides a logical mathematical model of the formation of soil quality. For soil quality management on agricultural lands, a formula for calculating T-values, using an equation where the rate of pedogenesis is associated with a variety of changes in soil organic carbon, is proposed in this article.

AB  - Understanding the associations between urbanization intensity and urban forest structural-taxonomic attributes is a central theme of urban ecology, biodiversity conservation and forest management for maximizing ecological services to design proper urban green infrastructure. By selecting a typical provincial capital city of Changchun as an example, the effects of urbanization intensity (low, medium and heavy urbanization as measured by impervious surface area, ISA) on landscape patterns and structural-taxonomic attributes of urban forests were investigated in this study. The results showed that the urban forest Patch Density (PD), Landscape Shape Index (LSI), Interspersion & Juxtaposition Index (IJI), Tree Density (TD), Canopy Density (CD), Species Richness (SR) and Species Diversity (H' index) exhibited strictly monotonic increases with urbanization intensity, increasing by 162%, 60%, 44%, 37%, 50%, 85%, and 84% from low to heavy urbanization areas, respectively. In contrast, the forest Mean Euclidian Nearest Neighbor Distance (ENN-MN) and Health Condition grade (HC) monotonically decreased by 12% and 37%, respectively. Furthermore, regression analysis suggested that structural-taxonomic attributes were closely associated with forest-related landscape patterns, but urbanization intensity dramatically influenced these associations. Our findings highlight that the planning of urban green infrastructure, in particular, urban afforestation and associated management, should be different at different urbanization intensities. In low urbanization areas, low Total area (TA, forest area) requires construction of larger forest patches and the protection of large remnant trees, and TD and above ground biomass (AGB) could be increased by enhancing the Mean Fractal Dimension (FRAC-MN) and PD, respectively. In medium urbanization areas, the same increases in TD and AGB could be more effectively achieved by decreasing the LE and Area-Weighted Mean Contiguity (CONTIG-MN). Moreover, in heavy urbanization areas, more attention should be paid to increasing forest patch aggregation and contiguity, and both tree diversity and evenness could be increased by enhancing the FRAC-MN index. Because these structural -taxonomic attributes are the basis of various forest ecological services, our findings indicate that regulation of some of these landscape metrics could improve urban forest services in Changchun.

AB  - Due to deforestation, intact tropical forest areas are increasingly transformed into a mixture of remaining forest patches and human modified areas. These forest fragments suffer from edge effects, which cause changes in ecological and ecosystem processes, undermining habitat quality and the offer of ecosystem services. Even though detailed and long term studies were developed on the topic of edge effects at local scale, understanding edge effect characteristics in fragmented forests on larger scales and finding indicators for its impact is crucial for predicting habitat loss and developing management options. Here we evaluate the spatial and temporal dimensions of edge effects in large areas using remote sensing. First we executed a neighborhood pixel analysis in 11 LANDSAT Tree Cover (LTC) scenes (180 x 185 km each, 8 in the tropics and 3 in temperate forested areas) using tree cover as an indicator of habitat quality and in relation to edge distance. Second, we executed a temporal analysis of LTC in a smaller area in the Brazilian Amazon forest where one larger forest fragment (25,890 ha) became completely fragmented in 5 years. Our results show that for all 11 scenes pixel neighborhood variation of LTC is much higher in the vicinity of forest edges, becoming lower towards the forest interior. This analysis suggests a maximum distance for edge effects and can indicate the location of unaffected core areas. However, LTC patterns in relation to fragment edge distance vary according to the analyzed region, and maximum edge distance may differ according to local conditions. Our temporal analysis illustrates the change in tree cover patterns after 5 years of fragmentation, becoming on average lower close to the edge (between 50 and 100 m). Although it is still unclear which are the main causes of LTC edge variability within and between regions, LANDSAT Tree Cover could be used as an accessible and efficient discriminator of edge and interior forest habitats in fragmented landscapes, and become invaluable for deriving qualitative spatial and temporal information of ecological and ecosystem processes.

AB  - Land-use change processes present a variety of trajectories depending on local conditions, the regional context and external influences. This study is an in-depth analysis of spatial and temporal land-use change in a rural mountain area for the data period 1965-2010. It concerns a rural area with partially mountainous characteristics and a high prevalence of forest land, in which both the processes of peri-urbanisation and a common land management system involving the state and the community can be observed. Supported by a collection of five periods of image analysis (the 1965, 1974, 1983, 1995, and 2010 maps), the transformation indicators were analysed in terms of the stability grade (SG), which expresses the total proportion of the landscape that has not experienced any transition, the rate of forest transformation (FS) and artificialisation processes (AS). In the area as a whole, the spatial and temporal transitions involve a significant increase in urban areas with a discontinuous fabric, a reduction in agricultural areas, and significant routing of forest occupation with typology and pattern transition. In the common lands, the major transformations occur between forests and semi-natural areas, with a general temporal increase in broad-leaved forest and degraded forest areas and a decrease in agricultural and agro-forestry areas, showing improvements to forest land through the introduction of new species and forest maintenance reflected in smaller subdivisions of patterns of land use. The methods enabled four periods to be identified revealing a distinctive evolution in land use, in which urban consolidation is present consistently, together with rotation of the forest typology involving forest degradation, gains from agro-forest land or sparsely vegetated areas and the appearance of burnt areas. The results highlight the importance of public policies in the dynamics of land-use change, either in the form of planning or regulatory instruments closely linked to local communities and based on agriculture and forest resources. The management of common land, even in an informal way, introduces differences to land-use trajectories and forest maintenance and greater benefits for the communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work focused on the validation of biological specificity of the quantitative LC-MS/MS assay by checking the natural variability of Vg levels during the reproductive cycle in Gammarus fossarum (i.e., including oogenesis and embryogenesis). Laboratory tests were performed for 21 days under controlled conditions to assess Vg changes in male and female gammarids after exposure to chemical stress. Females were exposed to two crustacean hormones, 20-hydroxyecdysone (0.01, 1 and 100 mu g L-1) and methyl-farnesoate (0.01, 1 and 100 mu g L-1). No effect was recorded for 20-hydroxyecdysone, whereas in females exposed to methyl-farnesoate a deleterious impact on Vg production was observed. Males were exposed to crustacean hormones 20-hydroxyecdysone (0.01, 1 and 100 mu g L-1) and methyl-farnesoate (0.01, 1 and 100 mu g L-1), the insecticide methoxyfenozide (0.001, 0.1 and 10 mu g L-1), the fungicide propiconazole (0.001, 0.1. 10 and 1000 mu g L-1), and the pharmaceutical products benzophenone, carbamazepine, cyproterone, and R-propranolol (0.001, 0.1, 10 and 1000 mu g L-1). Induction of Vg synthesis was recorded in males exposed to cyproterone, methoxyfenozide, methyl-farnesoate, and propiconazole. Finally, we validated the function of the ILIPGVGK peptide used to track vitellogenin in G. fossarum across reproductive processes (vitellogenesis and embryogenesis), and results confirmed the energy reserve role of Vg during embryo development. We show that oocyte surface measurement is directly related to Vg levels in the oocyte, constituting a reliable indicator of egg quality in G. fossarum. Consequently, it could be used as a reliable tool for biomonitoring programs. We recorded induction of Vg in male G. fossarum; however, the possible use of this tool as a specific biomarker of exposure to endocrine disruption should be confirmed in further studies.

AB  - Floodplain deposits from the Carboniferous Tupe Formation of western Argentina contain a low-diversity ichnofauna of invertebrates and plants. The assemblage consists of Archaeonassa fossulata, Didymaulichnus lyelli, Helminthoidichnites tenuis, Palaeophycus tubularis, Planolites isp., and root traces. This ichnofauna is characterized by the dominance of very simple forms, superficial or very shallow trace fossils, combination of locomotion, grazing, and dwelling structures, and production by arthropods and vermiform organisms. Primary sedimentary fabrics are disturbed only by plant trace fossils while animal trace fossils are mostly restricted to bedding surfaces, resulting in the virtual absence of bioturbation. The poorly-defined morphology of the ichnofossils, and the absence of backfilled striated trace fossils and structures indicative of subaerial exposure suggest subaqueous production. The envisaged depositional environment is a freshwater body developed in a floodplain and overfilled by overbank deposits. A review of floodplain ichnofaunas documented from the stratigraphic record indicates that two recurrent assemblages may be recognized. The first assemblage is characterized by low to rarely moderate diversity of invertebrate trace fossils, moderate to high diversity of vertebrate structures, and common presence of meniscate backfilled structures, bilobate trace fossils with scratch marks, arthropod trackways and tetrapod trackways. It is regarded as an example of the Scoyenia ichnofacies developed in desiccated floodplains. The second type of floodplain assemblage, illustrated by the example documented in this paper, is characterized by grazing trails, locomotion trails and dwelling burrows, low to rarely moderate ichnodiversity, simple trace fossils, and superficial to very shallow structures. Although formed in floodplain environments also, this type of assemblage is remarkably different from the Scoyenia ichnofacies. It is here regarded as an example of the Mermia ichnofacies. Basic features of these ichnofaunas reflect subaqueous production of the assemblage. The lower ichnodiversity of these floodplain assemblages in comparison with their equivalents from lacustrine basins is probably an expression of the less stable conditions and temporary nature of floodplain water bodies. Our study supports the view that ichnofacies are not indicators of sedimentary environments but reflect sets of environmental factors. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An integrated monitoring approach was implemented for an overland-flow wastewater facility over a 1-year period to determine whether the effluent caused water quality impairment in the receiving system (X-Trib) and appropriate metal effluent limits. The Rapidan Service Authority (Gordonsville, Va.) wastewater effluent comprises approximately 98% of the X-Trib flow under 7Q10 conditions. Aquatic life in both X-Trib and South Anna River, downstream of the discharge, were previously recorded as heavily impacted prior to the addition of overland-flow treatment. Three forms of monitoring were implemented at this facility: chemical-specific analyses of effluent samples, whole effluent chronic toxicity tests, and stream bioassessments. Two reference streams in the area were also sampled to determine the types of fauna capable of inhabiting the receiving stream. Chemical data suggested elevated levels of copper, cadmium, and lead instream compared to U.S. EPA criteria and Virginia Standards. Chronic toxicity tests, however, often indicated no effects on sensitive EPA indicator species. Stream bioassessments suggested that both habitat and benthic substrate quality were limiting for aquatic biota in the X-Trib. Benthic grab samples and fish sampling suggested ecological impairment due to the effluent. However, introduced benthic substrate studies in the fall and spring indicated no impairment. Thus, the adverse impact observed in benthic samples appeared to be an historical effect of the effluent prior to upgrade, and not an indication of present effluent quality. The biological results indicated that the upgraded plant was in compliance with the goals of the Clean Water Act despite elevated metal levels. High effluent total organic carbon (TOC) was at least partly responsible for this result since even occasional high levels of dissolved metals did not cause toxicity. Our results suggest that following a truly integrated monitoring approach can yield appropriate effluent metal limits on a site-specific basis without necessarily relying on criteria or standards modification studies; state standards for metals, even based on the dissolved fraction, may, in some cases, be overly stringent where other factors are present that reduce the bioavailability of those metals; and setting appropriate standards for effluent-dominated streams requires consideration of effluent characteristics which may affect the bioavailability of pollutants.

AB  - Changes in the timing, magnitude, frequency, and duration of extreme hydrologic events are becoming apparent and could disrupt species assemblages and stream ecosystems across the Northeastern United States. Between August 28 and 29 of 2011, an average of 31 cm of rain from Tropical Storm Irene fell across Eastern New York State in less than 24 h and caused historic flooding in numerous streams of the Catskill Mountain Region. Peak discharges exceeded the 0.01 annual exceedance probability (>100 year flood) in many Catskill Mountain streams. Approximately one week later, the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee deposited another 19 cm of rain onto saturated soils and caused additional flooding. Data from annual benthic macroinvertebrate surveys completed at 5 sites in the Upper Esopus Creek, a premier trout stream in the region, during August 2009-2011 (before the floods) were compared to data collected from the same sites in September 2011, November 2011, March 2012 and August 2012 (after the floods). The impact, rate of recovery and the factors which might affect the resilience of benthic macroinvertebrate communities were evaluated. The results of biological water quality assessment metrics immediately after the floods resembled those of highly polluted waters, yet severe floods were the only disturbance. Prior to the floods, standard biological assessment metrics showed that communities were not impacted and water quality was pristine. A large decrease in macroinvertebrate density was evident in the September 2011 surveys following the floods and bioassessment metrics reflected highly degraded water quality conditions. Most community metrics rebounded in 3-7 months (November 2011 and March 2012), and full recovery was evident in 12 months (August 2012) which suggests that macroinvertebrate assemblages are relatively resilient to the effects of extreme floods in these low-order streams. Therefore, macroinvertebrate samples collected from a flood-impacted stream before full recovery occurs might reflect loss of diversity and abundance from the flood disturbance and incorrectly attribute the impact to impaired water quality. The strong short-term impacts and the relatively rapid recovery of macroinvertebrate communities following catastrophic floods have important ramifications for routine bioassessment programs considering changing hydrologic regimes in streams across the Northeast and elsewhere.

AB  - One of the major applications of transgenic crops in agriculture are the so-called Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) plants, in particular Bt maizes, which produce insecticidal Cry proteins that target specific orders, such as the Lepidoptera or Coleoptera. We reviewed publications that reported on the direct toxic effects of Bt-maize and/or Cry proteins of current Bt-maize events on larvae of non-target butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). In total, 20 peer-reviewed publications were identified, of which 16 papers contributed laboratory-based data and seven field-based data. An adverse effect on caterpillars was recorded in 52% of all laboratory-based and in 21% of all field-based observations. The variables most often studied and having the highest occurrence of effects were larval survival, body mass, and developmental time. Parameters of the adult stage were under-represented in the studies. Overall, 11 lepidopteran species were tested. The majority of the studies originated from the USA, with the Monarch butterfly being the most studied, whereas other species and other parts of the world were widely neglected. Laboratory experiments were often run under unrealistic conditions from an ecological point of view. Although the papers we reviewed indicated a potential hazard for Lepidoptera that are exposed to and feed on lepidopteran-specific Bt-maize pollen, a general conclusion on the level of risk for butterflies and moths cannot as yet be drawn. A comprehensive risk characterization would require thorough hazard identification, exposure assessment, and impact assessment. However, our review showed that even the basic level of hazard characterization is as yet incomplete. Reasons for this are the still-limited numbers of publications and concurrent lack of knowledge, the restriction of data to only a few species, the over-representation of North American species, and the identified limitations of both laboratory and field experiments. The findings of this review suggest that more realistic, ecologically meaningful, and detailed experiments and analyses are crucial to improve the present assessment of Bt-maize cultivation effects on Lepidoptera.

AB  - This study investigates how the floristic composition and species richness of fertile grasslands in the Swiss Alps has changed over the last three decades. A total of 259 phytosociological releves in four regions were resurveyed after periods of between 17 and 29 years. Analysis of the data revealed that floristic composition of the grasslands changed significantly during the study period, although the factor 'time' explained only a small proportion of the total variation (2.0-4. 1 %). The shifts in floristic composition were interpreted as indicators of changing management intensity due to continuing changes in agricultural structures. In three of the study regions there was an increase in species that are competitive under nutrient-rich conditions, possess high roughage quality and are tolerant of frequent mowing, indicating that the intensity of management had increased. Despite this apparent intensification, however, the initially high mean values per plot for species number (30.7-36.3) and evenness (0.72-0.77) mainly increased during the interval between the surveys. In the study region with the highest intensity of management, the abundance of weed species increased on some sites and the indicator value for roughage quality decreased, suggesting that intensification had been excessive and had destabilised these plant communities. Floristic shifts in the fourth study region, where the number of farms had declined considerably, mainly indicated extensification, especially on more marginal sites. The nature conservation value of the plant communities (i.e. number per plot of species indicating ecological quality) decreased in the three study regions where the floristic changes indicated that management had been intensified (-0.4 to -0.7 species) but increased in the fourth region (+ 1. 1 species). It is concluded that the intensification of management in the fertile grasslands of the Alpine regions studied has been less extreme than in many European lowland areas, and that the developments have in most cases been sustainable. However, the evidence of some destabilised plant communities suggests that management intensity is now too high on these sites, (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Heat stress is a common cause of poor welfare in cattle and is expected to increase with climate change. The biggest challenges are to feedlot and dairy cattle in hot climates but determining whether cattle are heat stressed can be difficult due to the invasive and time-consuming nature of established methods of measurement, such as rectal temperature, and the lack of specificity of some measures, such as cortisol in plasma or faeces. We review the various methods of non-invasively measuring heat stress in cattle and highlight the value of infrared thermographic imaging for the accurate and rapid determination of external body surface temperatures. Further research options to establish thresholds and optimum methodology for these non-invasive measures and their use in different cattle types are identified. Their use promises to accelerate response times to cattle experiencing heat stress under intensive management conditions.
   Cattle are susceptible to heat stress, especially those kept on high levels of nutrition for the purpose of maximising growth rates, which leads to a significant heat increment in their bodies. Consequences include compromised health and productivity and mortalities during extreme events, as well as serious economic loss. Some measures of heat stress, such as plasma cortisol and temperature in the rectum, vagina, or rumen, are invasive and therefore unlikely to be used on farms. These may cause additional stress to the animal due to handling, and that stress in itself can confound the measure. Consequently, it is desirable to find non-invasive alternatives. Panting score (PS), cortisol metabolites in faeces, milk, or hair, and the infrared temperature of external body surfaces are all potentially useful. Respiratory indicators are difficult and time consuming to record accurately, and cortisol metabolites are expensive and technically difficult to analyse. Infrared temperature appears to offer the best solution but requires further research to determine the thresholds that define when corrective actions are required to ensure optimal health and productivity. Research in this area has the potential to ultimately improve the welfare and profitability of cattle farming.

AB  - Particleboard is a composite panel comprising small pieces of wood bonded by adhesives. The particleboard industry is growing in Pakistan, but there is little information on the environmental impacts associated with this product. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a life cycle assessment of particleboard manufactured in Pakistan and to provide suggestions to improve its environmental profile. The study covers energy use and associated environmental impacts of raw materials and processes during particleboard manufacture in the year 2015-2016.
   The study uses a cradle-to-gate (distribution center) life cycle assessment approach. The reference unit for this study was 1.0 m(3) of finished, uncoated particleboard. Primary data from the particleboard mill surveys were combined with secondary database information and modeled using CML 2000 v.2.05 methodology and a cumulative exergy demand indicator present in the SimaPro v.8.3 software.
   The results reveal that urea formaldehyde resin, transportation of raw materials, and finished product distribution had the highest contribution to all the environmental impact categories evaluated. Heavy fuel oil and natural gas consumption was responsible for abiotic depletion, photochemical oxidation, ozone layer depletion, and marine aquatic ecotoxicity impacts. The rotary dryer and hot press were the most important sectors in terms of emissions from the manufacturing process. The total cumulative exergy demand required for manufacturing of 1.0 m(3) particleboard was 15,632 MJ-eq, with most of the energy usage associated with non-renewable, fossil fuel sources. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for a reduction in the quantity of urea formaldehyde resin consumed and freight transport distances.
   The results indicated that reducing the urea formaldehyde resin use and freight distances could greatly decrease environmental impacts. Most of the surveyed mills did not have emissions control systems, and most of the mills exceed the limits set by the National Environmental Quality Standards of Pakistan. Environmental impact improvements might be attained by reducing quantity of urea formaldehyde resin and transportation freight distances and by installing pollution control devices.

AB  - Late Cretaceous source rocks in the south Texas Eagle Ford Formation were characterized based on geo-chemical features of the Iona-1 core, which penetrates the lower and upper Eagle Ford Formation. This set of immature samples provides a detailed record of the variation of organic matter (OM) sources across different depositional facies. Our results show that organic matter rich shales are dominated by marine Type II kerogen. Lower Eagle Ford (LEF) contains high-sulfur kerogen (Type II-S) with S/C > 0.04, and a minor contribution of terrestrial OM is evident in the upper Eagle Ford (UEF). Combined geochemical data from Iona-1 core samples based on bulk geochemical rock properties, residual oil chromatography and biomarker analyses reveal that the total organic carbon content and extractable bitumen content in the LEF are higher than in the UEF; redox-sensitive biomarkers demonstrate that sulfur-rich photiczone anoxia/euxinia developed in the LEF and that persistent oxygenation occurs during deposition of the UEF. Sulfur-rich kerogen in the LEF, in turn, generates medium/ high sulfur-containing oils (up to 2.6%). As a consequence of the elevated sulfur contents in the LEF, oil/bitumen generation initiated earlier and at lower maturity levels than in the UEF. High levels of anomalous 22S/(22S + 22R) homohopane ratios and 20S 5 alpha, 14 alpha, 17 alpha-steranes have been observed in the LEF interval, which is controversial because of the low maturity level indicated by most bulk geochemical thermal maturity parameters, including T-max-calculated %Ro (similar to 0.45) and Ts/(Ts + Tm), as well as C29Ts/(C29Ts + C-29) hopane and C-29 beta beta/(beta beta + alpha alpha) sterane ratios. These anomalously high thermal maturity parameters are more likely caused by enhanced isomerisations due to high organic-sulfur content under reducing depositional environments in the LEF rather than by thermal maturation. Hypothetical diagenetic pathways for the sulfurisation of homohopanoids and steroids are proposed to explain their abnormal isomerisations in the LEF. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Teeth in Cervidae are permanent structures that are not replaceable or repairable; consequently their rate of wear, due to the grinding effect of food and dental attrition, affects their duration and can determine an animal's lifespan. Tooth wear is also a useful indicator of accumulative life energy investment in intake and mastication and their interactions with diet. Little is known regarding how natural and sexual selection operate on dental structures within a species in contrasting environments and how these relate to life history traits to explain differences in population rates of tooth wear and longevity. We hypothesised that populations under harsh environmental conditions should be selected for more hypsodont teeth while sexual selection may maintain similar sex differences within different populations. We investigated the patterns of tooth wear in males and females of Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) in Southern Spain and Scottish red deer (C. e. scoticus) across Scotland, that occur in very different environments, using 10343 samples from legal hunting activities. We found higher rates of both incisor and molar wear in the Spanish compared to Scottish populations. However, Scottish red deer had larger incisors at emergence than Iberian red deer, whilst molars emerged at a similar size in both populations and sexes. Iberian and Scottish males had earlier tooth depletion than females, in support of a similar sexual selection process in both populations. However, whilst average lifespan for Iberian males was 4 years shorter than that for Iberian females and Scottish males, Scottish males only showed a reduction of 1 year in average lifespan with respect to Scottish females. More worn molars were associated with larger mandibles in both populations, suggesting that higher intake and/or greater investment in food comminution may have favoured increased body growth, before later loss of tooth efficiency due to severe wear. These results illustrate how independent selection in both subspecies, that diverged 11,700 years BP, has resulted in the evolution of different longevity, although sexual selection has maintained a similar pattern of relative sex differences in tooth depletion. This study opens interesting questions on optimal allocation in life history trade-offs and the independent evolution of allopatric populations.

AB  - Variability in the activity and composition of soil microbial communities may have important implications for the suite of microbially-derived ecosystem functions upon which agricultural systems rely, particularly organic agriculture. An on-farm approach was used to investigate microbial communities and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability on 13 organically-managed fields growing Roma-type tomatoes, but differing in nutrient management, across an intensively-managed agricultural landscape in the Central Valley of California. Soil physicochemical characteristics, potential activities of nine soil enzymes involved in C, N, phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) cycling, and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were measured during the growing season and evaluated with multivariate approaches. Soil texture and pH in the 0-15 cm surface layer were similar across the 13 fields, but there was a three-fold range of soil C and N as well as substantial variation in inorganic N and available P that reflected current and historical management practices. Redundancy analysis showed distinct profiles of enzyme activities across the fields, such that C-cycling enzyme potential activities increased with inorganic N availability while those of N-cycling enzymes increased with C availability. Although FAMEs suggested that microbial community composition was less variable across fields than enzyme activities, there were slight community differences that were related to organic amendments (manure vs. composted green waste). Overall, however, the general similarity among fields for particular taxonomic indicators, especially saprophytic fungi, likely reflects the high disturbance and low complexity in this landscape. Variation in potential enzyme activities was better accounted for with soil physicochemical characteristics than microbial community composition, suggesting high plasticity of the resident microbial community to environmental conditions. These patterns suggest that, in this landscape, differences in organic agroecosystem management have strongly influenced soil nutrients and enzyme activity, but without a major effect on soil microbial communities. The on-farm approach provided a wide range of farming practices and soil characteristics to reveal how microbially-derived ecosystem functions can be effectively manipulated to enhance nutrient cycling capacity.

AB  - A recent research concept prioritises 26 out of Bavaria's 159 strict forest nature reserves for long-term observation. In 2013 the first permanent plot sample for ecological studies was established in four of the priority reserves. A total of 24 circular 314 m(2) vegetation plots were located within the large (1 ha) permanent core areas of six priority reserves.
   The concept for long-term observation of natural forests is presented, pathways of analysis are outlined and exemplified on the basis of the 2013 vegetation data. Because plots are inevitably spatially autocorrelated, they were coupled with a representative reference from the whole of Bavaria. The latter data set comprises 313 plots in strict forest nature reserves which were selected to represent the potential natural vegetation of plots in the 8 x 8 km grid of the "Forest Soil Condition Survey" (BZE II; EWALD 2009). Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) was used to detect gradients of species composition and corresponding plot groupings. Thus, the newly collected plots were classified independently and impartially on the base of their floristic similarity to reference vegetation types. The subsequent characterisation of vegetation types was performed by ordering phytosociological tables.
   The newly collected data comprise beech forests on limestone (Hordelymo-Fagetum) and on siliceous substrates (Galio- and Luzulo-Fagetum), as well as mixed forests of unstable hillsides (Adoxo-Aceretum) and riverine forests (Pruno-Fraxinetum, Querco-Ulmetum). Post-hoc correlation with Ellenberg indicator values suggested soil reaction and nutrient availability as putative drivers of species turnover along the first axis; species turnover along the second axis was apparently caused by a temperature gradient. While these correlations are congruent between ordinations of the newly collected and the reference data set, the temperature gradient (featuring low Ellenberg temperature values) in the new plots appears as a pseudo-effect due to cultivated conifers. Opportunities for data analysis will gradually increase within the next two decades, and, with the data set of the 26 priority reserves completed, the long-term observation of vegetation dynamics in beech forests as well as at the temperature- and moisture-induced margins of beech distribution will become pivotal.

AB  - Question: How may Landolt indicator values be re-calibrated to improve the performance of predictive models?
   Location: Mires Gross Moos Schwandital (1250 m a.s.l.) in the Prealps, Burgymoos (465 m. a.s.l.) on the Central Plateau and La Burtigniere (1000 m a.s.l.) in the Jura, Switzerland.
   Methods: Habitat distribution models based on high resolution remotely sensed data and vegetation field data are applied to monitor 130 mires. Instead of plant species or communities we used mean indicator values of vegetation records as response variables. To improve the differential power of indicator values for wetland habitat conditions, we calibrated these values using field data. Different methods were tested with our predictive models in three mires to see which calibration method is best in enhancing model performance. To assess the effect of the uneven distribution of vegetation records along environmental gradients. calibrations based on random and evenly distributed samples were compared. As a test of the predictive power of the models we used r(2) between ground truth and model prediction.
   This approach is illustrated through an application with nutrient indicator values in the mire La Burtigniere.
   Results: Model performances were not the same for the three mires. The predictive power was better for the nutrient values, soil reaction and humus values than for light and moisture values. 2000 records were sufficient as basis for re-calibration. Models based on original Landolt indicator values were overall the weakest compared with re-calibrated values. By comparing the predictive power of Models based on randomly or evenly selected records were about equally predictive.
   Conclusions: 1. A habitat-specific re-calibration of the Landolt indicator values enhances the predictive mapping of the Swiss mire ecosystems. 2. The re-calibration based on weighted averaging gives a better performance than the one based on Gaussian logistic regression. 3. The uneven distribution of indicator values due to the over-representation of mire habitats does not hamper model performance. 4. 2000 vegetation records are a sufficient basis for an optimal re-calibration of the vegetation types. An illustration of the method is given by using the soil fertility pattern of the mire La Burtigniere.

AB  - Sustainability is a multifaceted concept. It is expressed here as 'to ensure that the past and current management and use of natural resources does not diminish their capacity to meet economic, environmental, social and aesthetic needs and opportunities of the present and future generations'. Sustainability indicators can be used to monitor responses in condition and trend as a result of natural resource management. We report here 2 case studies that demonstrate the significance of sustainability indicators in discerning trends in land and water resources in the southern Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) Belt, a major region of the Queensland Murray - Darling Basin. First, soil organic matter was used as a sustainability indicator of soil productivity, soil aggregation, and its association with soil sodicity since these soil attributes affect infiltration rates, runoff and drainage. The second study involved comparing the trends in stream salinity ( electrical conductivity) over 35 years and sustainability indicators for a dominant Vertosol in a region used for cereal cropping. Groundwater level and electrical conductivity of a long-term monitoring bore in the Dalby - Chinchilla region, were also analysed to discern trends in salinity and association of the groundwater with soil and stream salinity.
   Soil organic matter declined exponentially as the cultivation period for cereal cropping increased. This resulted in a reduction in soil nitrogen supply, and lower grain protein and cereal grain yields. The associated effects were reduced soil aggregation and increased soil sodicity. Electrical conductivity of the soil as well as stream water showed weak but declining trends with time. Groundwater level from the long-term monitoring bore near the stream and groundwater salinity showed significantly declining trends over the 35 years sampling period. Groundwater salinity was similar to the Vertosol electrical conductivity at 240 - 300 cm depths, suggesting groundwater connectivity to the overlaying soil. Thus, use of sustainability indicators provided a strong association among the various attributes of the landscape. However, it is still a challenge to integrate the various sustainability indicators in a landscape context, integrated over space ( spatial and geographical distribution), attributes ( quality characteristics) and time ( trend).

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Open-pit mining is an important activity to obtain mineral resources that supply society with raw materials to improve people's quality of life. However, this extractive activity causes negative environmental impacts and, it is therefore necessary to identify and evaluate these impacts in order to design preventive and control measures to reduce them and thus safeguard the environment and natural resources. In the Region of Murcia, in Spain, as well as other Mediterranean areas with similar climatic conditions, there is a great deal of mining activity linked to the building sector, in which mainly ornamental rock (marble and marble limestone) and limestone aggregates are used. All of this has given rise to numerous active and abandoned mines, where no restoration process has been carried out, generating strong impacts on the environment.
   METHODS: In this study, 8 environmental impact assessments studies of ornamental rock and aggregate quarries in the Region of Murcia were analysed to identify the negative impacts on the abiotic and biotic environment, landscape, socio-economic and socio-cultural environment, and infrastructures and analysing preventive and control measures.
   FINDINGS: According to the environmental impact assessment studies analysed, the importance of the most significant environmental impacts has been calculated, indicating whether the impacts are critical, severe, moderate or compatible, and based on it, preventive and corrective measures are proposed together in an impact mitigation management system based in flow charts that will serve to more easily apply and control these measures, in order to prevent them from causing significant or irreversible damage to the environment. Analysing these measures, it has been observed that 90% of the measures applied to control the different negative environmental factors in this type of quarry are the same.
   CONCLUSION: Open-pit mining extraction systems have a series of similar characteristics that allow a systematic approach to be established when analysing the impacts. With the use of flowcharts, it becomes easier to apply measures to reduce environmental impacts and in addition, these diagrams, allow at the same time the easy incorporation of updates due to changing regulations.

AB  - Worldwide, millions of dogs are held in kennels for extended periods of time and may experience compromised welfare. Enrichment, often using toys, is considered important to minimize the negative impacts of kennelling. However, the value of this enrichment may be based on various sensory facets of such toys and untangling the relative contributions is a residual challenge. Therefore, improving the utility of toys as enrichment is contingent on an improved understanding of the relationship between the properties of a toy and a dog's interaction with it. The present study aimed to evaluate the addition of two different scents to toys, both presumed to have a different level of biological salience. The behaviour and level of toy engagement of 44 singly housed dogs in a rehoming centre was compared amongst no-toy (NT), unscented-toy (T) and scented-toy (T+) treatments. For T+ two scents were used: rabbit (T+R) and lavender (T+L). Toys were colour and type-matched for each treatment. Many of the datasets were zero-inflated therefore a Hurdle analysis was used to explore the relationships amongst the treatments. Non-zero inflated behavioural data were analysed using a Linear Mixed Model to discern treatment effect. Dogs were significantly more likely to interact, and interacted for longer, with scented toys. This was both in comparison to periods when only unscented toys were present and when both scented and unscented toys were simultaneously presented. However, there was no difference in response to the rabbit or lavender scented toys. Provision of scent also significantly reduced stress related behaviours and increased exploration. However, alterations in behaviour were not directly related to likelihood or amount of toy use, suggesting the scents were altering behaviour through means other than increasing physical enrichment use. These findings suggest that augmentation of toys using scents may improve engagement of dogs with them, and positively affect behavioural welfare indicators in the kennelled environment. The use of novel scents may therefore promote better welfare in kennels irrespective of their presumed biological salience, but differing scents should be further trialled.

AB  - Black coal is formed by a carbon framework originating from metamorphism of condensed polycyclic organic compounds. This framework includes volatile organic substances, as well as a definite amount of mineral admixtures that form ash after coal combustion. The content of individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in coal depends on the nature of initial plant material that participated in the stages of coal formation, and on thermodynamic conditions of this process. One of the major representatives of PAHs possessing a strong carcinogenic effect is benz(a)pyrene. The group of PAHs compounds also includes phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, which are the major components of emissions during coal production, transportation, storage, concentrating, gasification, coking and combustion, and serve as convenient tracers to evaluate the pollution of the atmosphere, surface waters, and soil. The latter plays the part of a special accumulator into which PAHs get as a result of the global transport of emissions from anthropogenic sources and arrival from natural sources into the atmosphere. Because of this, soil relates to the most representative objects to study PAHs accumulation. The presence of these compounds may play the role of indicators depicting the presence of pollution source. As a rule, PAHs are determined by means of gas and high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Gas chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry appears to be the most promising method. To obtain reliable data on PAHs content in various objects, special attention is paid to sample preparation (extraction, purification, concentrating). Methodically correct arrangement of this stage allows excluding a noticeable fraction of the possible error of quantitative determination. The paper presents a review of the methods of PAHs extraction from solid matrices, in particular from fossil coal. It is demonstrated that all ranks of coal may be the sources from which toxic and carcinogenic PAHs enter various environmental objects. A review of the scientific foundations and modern practical methods of PAHs extraction from black coal is presented, the data on the distribution of the representatives of this group of compounds and on the prediction of carcinogenic activity during coal mining, transportation and processing are assessed.

AB  - Since 1992 agri-environmental issues have gained attention by reforms of the CAP. For instance by supporting environmentally friendly land use, such as permanent pastures in less-favoured areas (LFA) that are only marginally suitable for alternative farming practices. In the last two decades a significant part of agricultural land in Portugal has been converted to permanent pastures. The question is what role the EU agri-environmental measures (AEM) have played in that development.
   This paper assesses to which extent AEM have been effective in, preserving and promoting permanent pastures and extensive animal production. We investigated two AEM in two research areas: Traditional Mixed Farming (TMF) in Centro and Extensive Grassland (EG) in Alentejo for the implementation period 2005-2009. Spatial information was analysed to link plot and farm characteristics with performance (result and impact) indicators such as stocking rate and soil cover (assessed through the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI)). These indicators have been recognized as valuable indicators of AEM effects, and are therefore used in this research. A comparison was made between farms with certain AEMs and farms without these AEMs, that would be eligible for these specific AEMs. The results indicate that the participation in TMF and EG in preserving permanent pastures has been rather low in both regions. Nevertheless, these measures contributed to the upkeep of extensive livestock production with about 65% of participant farms achieving the expected policy result (maintenance or intensification of livestock keeping), although the effect was only significant in Centro. TMF and EG measures were effective in preserving the number of grazing livestock (goats and sheep, in Centro and Alentejo, respectively). These effects on livestock appeared to be associated with increased vegetation cover on participant farms in Centro, and with a tendency towards maintaining the pre-existing vegetation cover in Alentejo. Our results suggest that although AEM were effective in preserving grazing livestock, changes in grazing practices have not led to a significant improvement of the conditions to reduce the risk of wildfire and soil erosion. This should be taken into account in the design of new AEMs. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forest resilience to climate change is a topic of national concern as our standing assets and future forests are important to our livelihood. Many tree species are predicted to decline' or disappear while others may be able to adapt or migrate. Efforts to quantify and disseminate the current condition of forests are urgently needed to guide management and policy. Here, we develop a new indicator to summarize raw density-independent mortality of forested stands by species from the last decade of the 20th century to the first decade of the 21st century using forest inventory data. We define density-independent mortality to be stand mortality by species due to processes unrelated to natural mortality from succession or stand maturation, which is marked by overall increase in tree girth at the expense of density of individuals. We assess trends for 22 species on national forests in two U.S. states, Washington and Oregon. Populations of some species including timber species have no or low overall levels of density-independent mortality (Juniperus occidentalis, Abies procera, Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla, Pinus ponderosa, and Pseudotsuga menziesii). In contrast, other species demonstrate unsustainable levels of density-independent mortality (Pinus monticola, Arbutus menziesii, Pinus albicaulis, Abies lasiocarpa, Taxus brevifolia, Pinus contorta, Abies grandis, Picea englemanii, and Larix occidentalis). Additionally, the net potential for unsustainable levels of density-independent mortality in standing populations does not necessarily warrant concern when examined across species for our study area and time period; however, when examined by species, the number of species in decline exceeds the number of species where mortality can be generally attributed to endogenous self-thinning. We argue that this work can aid management and policy decisions and our understanding of complex vegetation dynamics in a changing climate. Application of the indicator at larger spatial scales and in conjunction with data on migration and establishment may be used to address questions such as, how can we make cost-effective management decisions to ensure long-term sustainability of tree species and forests? Tree species distributions across the landscape are complex systems, and raw characterization of current trends occurring in forest inventories is important especially given the uncertainty associated with the modeling and prediction of complex systems such as tree species.

AB  - Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, 1813 is a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered as an indicator of environment quality in coastal areas. This species forms large meadows, which are sensitive to several anthropogenic pressures and the decrease in their extension is considered a priority issue for the Mediterranean Sea. The aim of this study was to develop a Species Distribution Model for P. oceanica, to be applied to the Mediterranean North African coast, in order to obtain an estimation of the potential distribution of this species in the region. The Species Distribution Model was calibrated using high resolution data from 4 Mediterranean sites, located in Italy and Spain, as the study area is a data-poor zone with regard to seagrass distribution (i.e. only for some areas detailed distribution maps are available). The model was then validated using available data concerning the North African coast. The probability of presence of the species in a given area was modelled using a binomial generalized linear model as a function of the bathymetry and water transparency, dissolved organic matter, sea surface temperature and salinity, mainly obtained from satellite data. Model selection procedure suggests that water transparency plays a major role, but also other variables, such as salinity and sea surface temperature, are important at larger spatial scales in explaining meadows distribution. The availability of high resolution time-series of input data allowed us to apply the validated model to the whole North African coast. Suitable areas are strongly related to the coastal realm, and cover a large portion of North African coasts, with Tunisian and Lybian ones being the most relevant zones for this species. In particular, the shelf of the Gulf of Gabes includes large areas with environmental conditions suitable for the species. Based on model predictions, we developed a robust indicator of potential habitat suitability, which could be used for the assessment of Good Environmental Status, as requested by the Ecosystem Based Approach, to be implemented at the scale of the whole Mediterranean basin in the framework of the Barcelona Convention.

AB  - Assessments and sustainable management of ecosystem services (ES) require an understanding of both ES supply and demand qualities, quantities, spatial scales and dynamics. Mismatches, i.e., differences in quality or quantity between the supply and demand of ES, can occur in many different forms. Being able to identify these mismatches and their nature is of prime importance for informing governance and management decisions. This manuscript explores which mismatches can be detected by current ES supply and demand assessments and which mismatches currently remain unidentified.
   An analytic framework was developed comprised of five interlinked components of ES supply and demand linking nature and society (i.e., potential supply, managed supply, match, demand, and interests). This framework was used to examine 11 recent papers, which applied ES assessments to both ES supply and demand, to determine which mismatches were or could be identified and which mismatches remained unidentified.
   The selected papers typically used multiple methods in their assessments to capture supply and demand components. The found diversity in methods and the inclusion of temporal and spatial dimensions, and the existence of multiple stakeholder groups allowed for the assessments to identify several mismatches, but also lead to differences in the discriminative capacity of the assessments between the selected papers. The mismatch that was most often included in the assessments was Unsatisfied demand, whereas the least included mismatch was Unsustainable uptake. The mismatches caused by differing spatial patterns were most often identified, whereas the existence of mismatches among different stakeholder groups was least often detected in the assessment methods.
   Three options emerged that could further strengthen the discriminative capacity of ES supply and demand assessments to inform sustainable ES governance and management decisions: (i) include multiple stakeholders groups and the diversification of their roles and demands; (ii) acknowledge that ES supply is not only determined by the bio-geophysical conditions, but also determined by the ES demand by society, in terms of their quantity, quality and location, as well as by the applied management; (iii) include temporal and spatial scale sensitivity into the discriminative capacity of assessment methods to allow for a better identification which institutional structures could most effectively act upon them.

AB  - The control of phytoplankton growth is mainly related to the availability of light and nutrients. Both may select phytoplankton species, but only if they occur in limiting amounts. During the last decade, the functional groups approach, based on the physiological, morphological and ecological attributes of the species, has proved to be a more efficient way to analyze seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass. We analysed the dynamics of the phytoplankton functional groups sensu Reynolds, recognising the driving forces (light, mixing regime, and nutrients) in the Sau Reservoir, based on a one year cycle (monthly surface-water sampling). The Sau Reservoir is a Mediterranean water-supply reservoir with a canyon-shaped basin and a clear and mixed epilimnion layer. The long stratification period and high light availability led to high phytoplankton biomass (110.8 fresh-weight mg L-1) in the epilimnion during summer. The reservoir showed P-limitation for phytoplankton growth in this period. All functional groups included one or more species (X2-Rhodomonas spp.; Y-Cryptomonas spp.; F-Oocystis lacustris; K-Aphanocapsa spp.) selected by resources, especially phosphorus. Species of Cryptomonas (group Y) dominated during the mixing period (winter season) in conditions of low light and relatively high availability of dissolved nutrients. Increases in water-column stability during spring stratification led to phytoplankton biomass increases due to the dominance of small flagellate functional groups (X2 and X3, chrysophyceans). The colonial chlorophycean O. lacustris (group F) peaked during the mid-summer stratification, when the mixed epilimnion was clearly depleted in nutrients, especially SRP. High temperature and increases in nutrient concentration during the end-summer and mid-autumn resulted in a decrease of green algae (group F) and increase of Aphanocapsa spp. (cyanobacteria, group K) and dinoflagellates (group L-o). The study also revealed the important role of physical processes in the seasonal gradient, in selecting phytoplankton functional groups, and consequently in the assessment of ecological status. The Q index (assemblage index) based on functional groups indicated the overall good ecological status of the Sau Reservoir, which varied as a function of the mixing regime. This is the first application of the Assemblage Index to a European water-supply reservoir. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Establishing microbiological indices for the monitoring of environmental decay by crude oil pollution in the Niger Delta region has been a major concern of our current researches. Chromatium species, a purple, Gram positive pleomorphic, motile, microaerophlic sulfur bacterium offers a good potential for use in the assessment of the short term effects of oil pollution of tidal mud flats in the Niger Delta mangrove ecosystem. Its response to the November 22, 2003 spillage at the Qua Iboe Estuary and the adjoining Cross River Estuary was investigated. Our results have revealed that the sulphur bacterium is easily identified and widely distributed in the epipellic sediment of the mangrove ecosystem but very sensitive to hydrocarbon pollution. The bacterium was readily detected in the tidal mud flats containing as much as 2.0 mg kg(-1) but not detected in sediment with THC level of 3.65 mg kg(-1) and above. It is thus, suggestive that the threshold and lethal limits of effect of hydrocarbons against the sulfur bacterium lies between 2.04 and 3.65 mg kg(-1). These imply that in any case of crude oil pollution that Chromatium is not detected during monitoring the THC levels of the sediment may have been raised to a level close to or above 3.65 mg kg(-1). Statistical analysis of the relationship between THC level and density of Chromatium in sediment revealed a significant (p < 0.05) negative relationship (r = -0.85) in Qua Iboe mangrove ecosystem as against an insignificant (p > 0.05) relationship (r = -0.41) recorded for the Cross River mangrove ecosystem which served as the control. The result indicates that oil pollution affect the homeostatic status of Chromatium in tidal mud flats despite its even distribution (R (2) = 71.4%). The finding though not definitive may contribute to the hierarchical process of oil pollution assessment in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. However, its effective utilization will require not only the development of a selective medium for enumeration and isolation of the bacterium but also the establishment of a defined dose-response relationship under controlled conditions which requires further research.

AB  - The relationships between limestone bedrock geology (with extensive Karst topography), water chemistry and the community structure of benthic diatoms were examined for 35 riffle sites using multivariate analysis. The results showed that physical and chemical environmental variables had a notable effect on the biological diversity of benthic diatoms. Eighteen environmental variables were studied, including velocity (current flow), total phosphorus (TP), conductivity (COND), total nitrogen (TN), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), water temperature (WT), pH, silicon dioxide (SiO2), turbidity, major ions (Na+, K,(+) Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-+CO32-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-). Two variables, TP and velocity were found to be the most important factors explaining diatom distributions. With further analysis using weighted average inference models, the results showed good predictive statistics for diatom composition and TP (R-2= 0.654, RMSE = 0.036; R-boot(2) = 0.483; RMSEboot= 0.048) and velocity (R-2= 0.641, RMSE = 0.378; R-boot(2) = 0.416, RMSEboot = 0.500). Indicator diatom species for TP and velocity were identified and assessed using weighted average optima and tolerances. Fifty-seven taxa were identified as biological indicators, which included Fragilaria vaucheriae, Achnanthidium convergens, A. lineare, Kolbesia suchlandtii and Nitzschia frustulum for high TP (> 200 mu g l(-1)) and Reimeria sinuata, Achnanthidium minutissimum var. scoticum, A. exile, Cymbella leptoceris, and Navicula cf. pseudokotschyi for low TP (50-97 mu g l(-1)). These taxa are useful as monitoring tools for eutrophication in ZhuJiang watershed within a Karst region of south-central China. Diatom richness followed a Gaussian distribution with the most taxa observed in waters with moderate levels of TP. This distribution supports the intermediate disturbance hypothesis which predicts that species richness and diversity will be highest under moderate environmental conditions. A Gaussian distribution was also observed for species richness under changing current flow. Measures of diatom diversity, richness, and species optima from the south-central highlands of China will be useful as indicator values for future water-quality assessments.

AB  - In 1972(74)-1996(98), repeated phytocoenological surveys of natural mixed forest remainders were made on permanent plots in the Sumava Mts. in the south-western part of the Czech Republic. The surveys were made in localities with subsoils poor in nutrients (Boubin-Milesice-27 plots) and in a locality with nutrient-rich subsoil (Stozec-15 plots). Vegetation dynamics were studied according to the year of measurement and the nutrient capacity of the geological bedrock. We used the indices of floristic similarity, the calculation of plant communities' characteristics (Shannon-Wiener's index, equitability index), the calculation of taxa characteristics (fidelity, average cover, constancy) and multivariate ordination analyses-indirect (DCA) and direct (CCA). Changes in environmental conditions were studied between the years of measurement and between the localities using bioindication-by the calculation of Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) for plant communities. Over 24 years both the nutrient-poor site and the nutrient-rich site showed a considerable reduction in the tree layer cover and conversely the advancement of shrub layers. The coverage degree of dominants in the main tree layer (Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies and Abies alba) markedly decreased. Abies alba also exhibited a pronounced drop in constancy. On the other hand, the lower tree layer and shrub layers in Boubin-Milesice exhibited a distinctive invasion of Fagus sylvatica. An increase in the frequency of Sorbus aucuparia and a decrease in the frequency of Ulmus glabra were determined too. Herb layer changes were highly significant between the 1970s and the 1990s with qualitative changes being greater than quantitative changes. The number of species and Shannon-Wiener's index increased. A significant difference was recorded between the nutrient-poor and the nutrient-rich sites in the values of the quantitative similarity of releves with other differences being insignificant. The nutrient-poor sites exhibited herb layer homogenisation. A significant increase of EIV for light was found on both site types. The changes in phytocoenoses were interpreted partly as developmental trends (caused by indirect impact of man-e.g. fluctuations in game populations since the 18th century, the impact of air pollution); partly as cyclical changes connected with the developmental cycle of the natural temperate forest.

AB  - Aim The aims of this paper are to reconstruct the vegetation and fire history over the past 2000 years in a well-preserved rain-forest area, to understand interactions between climate, fire, and vegetation, and to predict how rain forest responds to global warming and increased intensity of human activity.
   Location Xishuangbanna, south-west China, 21-22 degrees N, 101-102 degrees E.
   Methods Phytolith (plant opal silica bodies) morphotypes, assemblages, and indices were used to reconstruct palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate changes in detail. Micro-charcoal particles found in phytolith slides, together with burnt phytoliths and highly weathered bulliform cells, were employed to reconstruct a record of past fire occurrence. A survey of field sediments, lithology, and C-14 dating were also employed.
   Results Phytoliths were divided into 11 groups and classified into 33 well-described morphotypes according to their shape under light microscopy and their presumed anatomical origins and ecological significance. The phytolith assemblages were divided into six significant zones that reveal a complete history of vegetation changes corresponding to climate variation and fire occurrence. Phytolith assemblages and indices show that the palaeoclimate in the study area is characterized by the alternation of warm-wet and cool-dry conditions. Phytolith and charcoal records reveal that 12 fire episodes occurred. Comparison of burnt phytoliths with an aridity index (Iph) shows that fire episodes have a strong relationship with drought events.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate that fire occurrence in the tropical rain forest of Xishuangbanna is predominantly under the control of natural climate variability (drought events). Nearly every fire episode is coupled with a climatic event and has triggered vegetation composition changes marked by a pronounced expansion of grasses. This indicates that drought interacts with fire to exert a strong influence on the ecological dynamics of the rain forest. However, the impact of human activity in recent centuries is also significant. Our results are important for understanding the interactions between climate, fire, and vegetation, and for predicting how rain forest responds to global warming and increased human activity.

AB  - The objectives of these studies were two-fold: (1) to determine efficacy of low and high expression hMT gene constructs by assessing accumulation of Cu in shoots of parental and transgenic plants of alfalfa (Medicago varia L.) exposed to different concentrations of CuSO4 by addition of CuSO4 solutions to soil and (2) to identify potential unintended effects of the genetic engineering on root and shoot biomass, shoot nutrient content, arbuscular mycorrhizal infection and on the metabolic functions of microbial communities in the rhizosphere. In the absence of exogenous CuSO4 additions to soil shoot biomass and the macronutrient (C, P, K, Ca, Mg and N) content of plants expressing hMT were not significantly different from the parental control. In the 0.5 mM and 1.0 mM CuSO4 treatments transgenic plants expressing the commonly used transgenic beta-glucuronidase (GUS) marker had significantly higher Fe content than the parental genotype. Significant differences were observed in the carbon substrate utilization patterns of rhizosphere microbial communities among the transgenic plants; no significant differences were observed in the percent mycorrhizal infection of parental and transgenic plants. Shoot biomass increased significantly in all genotypes treated with 0.5 mM CuSO4 and decreased in all genotypes at CuSO4 concentrations of 1.5 mM and 2.0 mM. Root dry weights decreased significantly in all genotypes at concentrations of 1.0 mM, 1.5 mM and 2.0 mM CuSO4. The largest decreases in root dry weight were observed in hMT genotypes grown in soil treated with 1.5 and 2.0 mM CuSO4. In plants treated with 1.5 mM CuSO4, shoots of transgenic plants expressing the hMT gene accumulated nominally, but not statistically significantly higher levels of Cu in shoot tissue. Our results were surprising with regard to lack of sufficient efficacy of the current hMT constructs for significant accumulation of Cu from soil treated with CuSO4. However, our results suggest the utility of applying adverse levels of CuSO4 or other environmental stressors to identify potential unintended effects of genetic engineering that may not be apparent under typically more optimal plant growth test conditions.

AB  - The infauna of intertidal and subtidal marine sediments at 18 sites near a large lead-zinc smelter in Spencer Gulf, South Australia, was sampled twice about 6 mo apart. The sampled habitats were bare intertidal mudflats, intertidal seagrass (Zostera sp.) beds, subtidal seagrass (Posidonia spp.) beds, and unvegetated sediments at 5 to 10 m depth. The infauna consisted of 372 identifiable taxa, mainly polychaetes, molluscs and crustaceans. The number of taxa at each site and time showed no simple relationship with the concentrations of trace metals in sediments, habitat type or time of sampling. However, the patterns of distribution, analysed using frequencies of occurrence of taxa derived from multivariate classification and ordination techniques, were related to the sediment concentrations of As, Cu, Mn, Pb, Sb and Zn. The extremely high concentrations of these trace elements (probably mainly Pb and Zn) appeared to affect both the abundances and distribution of many infaunal species. The multivariate techniques could detect which species were affected in the most metal-polluted sites (the intertidal sites). However, in the less-polluted subtidal sites, patterns in species composition were detected but only a few individual species could be unambiguously correlated to the presence of the metals. The polluted intertidal sediments, which had some of the highest metal concentrations ever recorded in marine sediments (Pb up to 5270 mu g g(-1) and Zn up to 16700 mu g g(-1)), supported 42 taxa. The polychaetes Heteromastus filiformis, Capitella 'capitata' and Glycera americana, and the crustacean Tanais dulongii were very abundant in these sites; they apparently can selectively exploit the metal-contaminated conditions. C. 'capitata' and T. dulongii were found almost exclusively in these sites. In contrast, 15 species of polychaetes, 5 crustaceans and 4 molluscs found elsewhere in the study area, representing 26, 20, and 17% of these intertidal taxa respectively, were not found in the metal-polluted sites. No taxonomic selectivity in the effects of the metals was detected amongst the 3 major groups-polychaetes, molluscs and crustaceans. Future studies may, therefore, be able to sample indicator species from only one of these major groups to determine the spatial extent of ecological effects or to monitor metal effects in this area.

AB  - Radiolarians are planktonic protozoon that play an important role in marine ecosystem and paleoenvironmental construction. The South China Sea (SCS) and Malacca Strait (MLS), strongly influenced by the East Asian monsoon, are the key gateway between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, few studies of radiolarians in the water column are performed during winter and spring in the SCS and MLS due to the adverse sea conditions. In this study the use of a ship-board plankton net rendered it possible to obtain shallow water samples (similar to 5 m depth) along transects from the northern SCS to MLS during the spring of 2017 and winter of 2017-2018. The results show that partitioning among Spumellaria, Nassellaria and Collodaria radiolarians differed spatially and seasonally. The high partition of Collodaria and low partition of Nassellaria are potential indicators of the strongly stratified waters with low nutrients for paleoceanographic studies in the slope and basin SCS. The radiolarian assemblages in the MLS are quite different from those in the SCS, that is, the two communities are largely independent, suggesting that advective transport between the MLS and SCS is rare. There are obvious seasonal variations in species diversity and abundance in both the MLS and SCS, generally with higher biodiversity and maximum abundances in winter. The results of Q-mode cluster analysis showed that radiolarian assemblages during winter were grouped together in the slope and basin SCS, and their distributions had moved to the southwest relative to those in spring. The results demonstrate the East Asian monsoon has a significant controlling effect on radiolarian diversity and geographic distribution in the studied areas. We also established five candidates for weakly stratified waters with high nutrients: Archiperidium hexacantha, Acanthodesmia vinculatus, Peromelissa phalacra, Dictyocoryne muelleri, and Tetrapyle octacantha. Thus, this study increases the knowledge of radiolarian geographic distribution in the tropics as a whole, as well as revealing the sensitive response of radiolarians to the regional environments, a fact which may prove useful for reconstructing the paleoceanographic changes.

AB  - In 1980, within an ecosystem research project nearby Gottingen 41 vegetation releves have been made on permanently marked plots within a calcareous beech forest (Hordelymo-Fagetum lathyretosum). These releves have been repeated in 2001 and 2016 and were now analysed as a time series. In all vegetation layers significant changes could be found. In 1980 different dominance types (DT) were defined by high coverage of single plant species of the herb layer. The different allocation of the releves to these DT over time indicated structural changes. Especially the 1980 prevalent Mercurialis perennis-DT shifted to the Allium ursinum- or Anemone nemorosa-DT (Table 1-2). The total comparison (Table 3-4) showes further structural and floristic changes. The tree layer, dominated by Fagus sylvatica, developed a denser canopy. Fencing of the total research area initiated the establishment of a shrub layer, mainly consisting of young trees. The statistically evaluated changes in the herb layer resulted in species groups of different dynamics: 15 winners, 20 losers and 18 constant species. Comparisons with literature data show partly similar results (Table 5). The total species number of all releves decreased from 63 to 58. Functional traits (life form, leave longevity; Fig. 2-3) changed only slightly. Almost all herbaceous plants have a strong forest affinity (Fig. 3). The evaluation of ecological indicator values (Fig. 4) suggests the development of a more shady and humid microclimate. An ordination (NMDS; Fig. 5) also showes a clear floristic change over time. As the main driver for vegetation changes the forest history is considered, i.e. the change from a coppice-with-standards to high forest management since about 100 years. Climate change is especially recognizable by earlier beginning and longer lasting of spring phenophases, among others promoting spring geophytes. The often described eutrophication by atmospheric nitrogen input, however, seems to be not very important. Despite of changing ecological conditions within almost 40 years no basic structural-floristic changes can be observed.

AB  - Vegetation restoration is one of the effective means to control soil erosion and an essential method of eco-environmental restoration in fragile karst rocky desertification areas. The shallow karst fissure (SKF) filled with soil has become one of the most important root habitats in this area. It is essential to scientifically evaluate the soil quality of SKF and to provide a basis for matching species with sites. Here, we explore and gain insight into the characteristics of the response of the physicochemical properties of SKF soil to different stages of vegetation succession. Additionally, we develop a synthetical assessment system to determine soil quality. The key results were as follows. Significant differences were found in the soil properties between the surface and the SKF. Compared with the surface, the SKF soil structural property was poor, but the water conditions were better. The soil nutrient content of the SKF was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that of the surface, but the differences in soil nutrients inside the SKF were not significant. In addition, the soil quality indicator (SQI) values of the SKF soil were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than those of the surface and decreased gradually with soil depth. Moreover, secondary succession significantly (p < 0.05) improved the soil properties and, thus, the soil quality. With recovery of vegetation, the soil properties of the surface and the SKF were significantly improved. The difference in the soil properties and the SQI values between the surface and underground gradually narrowed with succession. Furthermore, the thickness of the SKF soil was more than twice that of the surface soil. Overall, the soil properties and the soil quality of the SKF were relatively poor, but they were greatly improved with vegetation restoration. The SKF habitat can be the preferred habitat for vegetation restoration and is more favourable for plants with deep roots and a higher root penetration ability. The results of this study can supply references for future studies on karst rocky desertification control and vegetation restoration in the karst area of southwestern China, northern and central Vietnam, the islands of Java, Indonesia and Kampot Province, southwestern Cambodia and other karst regions with the same ecological background.

   Methods: Quantitative and qualitative characteristics of species along with environmental variables were measured using a randomly stratified design to identify the major plant communities and indicator species of the Thandiani sub Forests Division. Species composition was recorded in 10 x 2.5 x 2 and 0.5 x 0.5 m square plots for trees, shrubs and herbs, respectively. GPS, edaphic and topographic data were also recorded for each sample plot. A total of 1500 quadrats were established in 50 sampling stations along eight altitudinal transects encompassing eastern, western, northern and southern aspects (slopes). The altitudinal range of the study area was 1290 m to 2626 m above sea level using. The relationships between species composition and environmental variables were analyzed using Two Way Cluster Analysis (TWCA) and Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) via PCORD version 5.
   Results: A total of 252 plant species belonging to 97 families were identified. TWCA and ISA recognized five plant communities. ISA additionally revealed that mountain slope aspect, soil pH and soil electrical conductivity were the strongest environmental factors (p <= 0.05) determining plant community composition and indicator species in each habitat. The results also show the strength of the environment-species relationship using Monte Carlo procedures.
   Conclusions: An analysis of vegetation along an environmental gradient in the Thandiani sub Forests Division using the Braun-Blanquet approach confirmed by robust tools of multivariate statistics identified indicators of each sort of microclimatic zones/vegetation communities which could further be used in conservation planning and management not only in the area studied but in the adjacent regions exhibit similar sort of environmental conditions.

AB  - Detailed investigations of peaty earth hummocks called pounus were carried out in northernmost Finnish Lapland in the vicinity of the Kevo Subarctic Research Station. Pounus are complex, often vegetated, cryogenic mounds formed partly of peat. Some have a core of mineral soil or several large stones. or just one frost-heaved boulder covered by peat. They belong to the same group of earth hummocks as thufur and nonsorted circles, The typology of pounus is described and compared with other types of cryogenic earth hummocks. Stratigraphical study of pounus shows how cryoturbation has deformed the previous soil horizons of typical Arctic podzols and has been followed by intense peat growth and later frost reactivation, Microstructures in pounus confirm the frost activity and several phases of peat growth during their formation. Alternating warmer and dryer conditions with water-table rise and renewed peat formation could be inferred, The present stage of development is frost reactivation and peat growth. Pounus are relatively young features. The maximum age for pounu development corresponds with the age of peat formation. Peat of a boulder pounu yielded a data of 330 +/- 70 BP and a minerogenic pounu gave an age of 710 +/- 50 BP. The Sphagnum peat formation on peat pounus started intensively about 1000 BP. They are random surficial forms with variable control by frost heave and vegetation growth, independent of the presence or absence of permafrost. They are related to a dynamic snowcover in areas of open birch stands or tundra and their development is polygenetic with alternating frost disturbance and phases of humification or podzolization. Pounus act thermally as a biological refuge in the autumn and spring. At present, perennial frozen cores seem to be common, especially in large peat pounus. Pounu development, as with other earth hummocks, occurs after the main phase of interglacial pedogenesis and can be considered as an indicator of a general cooling trend, developing mostly during the second half of the Holocene. Pounus' relation to climatic change is discussed. Pounus can be considered as an indication of a general cooling trend associated with progressive depletion of summer insulation, Hummock extent is coherent and parallel with trends in permafrost growth, but not directly linked to it.

AB  - 1. In this study we used species accumulation models to solve one of the most serious problems encountered when comparing species richness between different communities. The problem is how to compare data among inventories in which different methodologies or measures of sampling effort have been employed. The methods used here for bats may be applied to any other biological group. We fit two asymptotic models to species accumulation curves for bat inventories to evaluate local or within-community diversity (alpha) and landscape diversity (gamma) in central Veracruz, Mexico.
   2. Species accumulation models allow us to: (i) measure within-inventory efficacy and completeness; (ii) obtain an estimate of species richness that is based on a standardized measure of sampling effort, which makes valid comparisons between inventories possible; and (iii) estimate the minimum sampling effort required to reach a satisfactory level of completeness.
   3. The applied models fit well in all cases (r(2) > 0.95). The linear dependence model predicted lower asymptotes and the Clench model predicted higher asymptotes than the observed species richness. These models are useful as predictors representing the lower and upper limits between which the true species richness value should lie.
   4. Alpha diversity for bats in all vegetation communities (11-18 species) was lower than the gamma diversity (20 species), suggesting that species richness and the sampling effort required are related to environmental heterogeneity.
   5. We propose that 90% of the total fauna predicted by either of the models is an acceptable standardized value for comparing species richness between communities.
   6. We assessed the within-inventory completeness as the proportion of the models' asymptote, where 90% is the desired minimum level of completeness. Except in palm stands, all bat inventories had an acceptable level of completeness, at least for the linear dependence model.
   7. For conditions similar to those of our study area, the minimum effort required to obtain a satisfactory level of completeness is 5-18 nights for plant communities and 18 nights for more heterogeneous landscapes.
   8. We make recommendations for improving the efficacy and completeness of bat surveys based on the application of species accumulation models.

AB  - In the context of the formation of post-non-classical scientific and educational paradigm in the 21st century, the social and didactic status of a foreign language is changing significantly. In such an interpretation, the need for a more thorough study of communicative processes is obvious, including the specifics of intercultural communication in general and in the field of teaching foreign languages. Accordingly, new requirements arise for the teacher of a foreign language and the system of their training at the university. The directions of research in the field of training a future teacher of a foreign language are determined by the peculiarities of the new paradigm of public relations, which are fixed in the tasks of modernizing the Russian education system in general and higher foreign language education in particular. The main directions of state policy in the field of modernization of foreign language education are reflected in the National Doctrine of Education of the Russian Federation until 2025, the National Project "Education". In modern conditions, the scientific consideration of the processes of modernization of education cannot take place in isolation from the information environment as an integral part of the modern socio-cultural life of a person. The new living conditions, the formation of which is largely caused by the spread of COVID-19, have significantly strengthened the vector of considering informatization not only as a technical and technological phenomenon, but also as a phenomenon of modern culture. Applying a philosophical understanding of the processes of informatization of modern society to educational systems, researchers consider them as a process of forming qualitative changes in the components of the system, as a result of which it acquires new characteristics and properties of the information environment, which together determine a new result - an increase in the quality of education. At the same time, it is noted that it is the interdisciplinary, integrative nature of such changes that determines the stability of the educational system, obtaining a guaranteed high-quality result. The interdisciplinarity and integrativeness of the processes of informatization of the training of a modern foreign language teacher is reflected in the new requirements of federal state educational standards of higher education for its results - mastering a set of competencies that characterize the competence of a foreign language teacher. In this rhetoric, the competence of a foreign language teacher is a methodological basis for the interdisciplinary integration of student training in the process of studying at a university in the context of informatization. An analysis of publications that reveal the content and quality of training of a foreign language teacher indicates that his professional competence in the information space is mainly determined by the integrative nature of linguistic and informational training in the process of forming the competence of a foreign language teacher in accordance with the social role and tasks of further activities - the implementation of the process of foreign language education.
   Based on the position of the systematic approach, that the object of research is considered as a system, by which one should understand the interconnected unity of individual elements, forming a new quality, which has specific properties, we consider it necessary in this article to outline the integrative processes of forming the competences of a future teacher of a foreign language and informatization of such training as "linguo-informational training". Ensuring the integrative linguo-informational training of a future foreign language teacher from the standpoint of the methodology of foreign languages education requires the development of an appropriate system of teaching a foreign language, focused on the interdisciplinary integrative formation of competencies in the linguo-informational context of training a future teacher of a foreign language. An indicator of the quality of preparation of a future teacher of a foreign language is a certain resource of his personality, which provides an opportunity for his participation in intercultural communication in the field of foreign language education. According to this trend, the modern process of linguo-informational training at the university orients students towards extensive communicative interaction in the linguo-informational context. On the other hand, the extensive theoretical basis for considering the concept of intercultural communication in the methodology of teaching a foreign language makes it possible to determine the linguo-informational context of intercultural communication as a leading factor in the linguo-informational training of a future teacher of a foreign language and a system-forming idea in the interconnected teaching of students a foreign language and the methodology of teaching it in the context of informatization. The article is devoted to the consideration of the problem of the linguo-informational context of training future foreign language teacher, the analysis of the linguodidactic potential of the corresponding context of intercultural communication, the definition of the concept, the invariant and variable structure and mechanisms of the linguo-informational development of the future teacher of a foreign language. The article also describes the content and results of an experimental study of the linguo-informational training of future teachers of a foreign language.

AB  - A rapid and efficient analytical method is proposed and optimized for the enrichment, extraction and instrument analysis of four typical organic flame retardants (OFRs), including organophosphate esters (OPEs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDs) and dechlorane com-pounds (Dechloranes) in maricultural waters using High-volume/High-throughput Solid-phase extraction with in-situ ultrasonic technique followed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS) instrumen-tal detection. The optimized pretreatment conditions were that the analytes were enriched by XAD-2 resins and eluted repeatedly with 50 mL hexane/acetone (1:1, v:v) for 5 min. The results of method vali-dation exhibited that the developed method can be used for quantitative detection of 11 OPEs, 13 PBDEs, 3 HBCDs and 5 Dechloranes in water samples. The method detection limits (MDLs) and limits of quantifi-cation (LOQs) are 0.4-26.2 pg/L and 1.5-87.4 pg/L for OPEs, 23.3-35.4 pg/L and 77.5-117.9 pg/L for HBCDs, 0.8-97.4 pg/L and 2.6-324.7 pg/L for PBDEs and 9.3-78.5 pg/L and 31.0-261.8 pg/L for Dechloranes, re-spectively. The method was successfully applied in lagoon maricultural areas in Hainan province, and the results showed that 4 OFRs were detected in almost all water samples. Total concentrations of 18 water samples were 1.89-39.97 ng/L for OPEs, 0.18-5.40 ng/L for PBDEs, ND-0.24 ng/L for HBCDs and 0.01- 1.77 ng/L for Dechloranes, respectively. The optimized analytical method is highly sensitive and efficient with expectation to play an essential role in monitoring the ultra-trace organic pollutants and providing an effective risk assessment in ecological environment.

AB  - Teleconnection patterns can be an important tool for investigating the impact of climate change on biological communities. The aim of the study was, using 2003-2020 data on chlorophyll a concentrations (CHL) and plankton primary production (PP) in midsummer, to determine which of the teleconnection patterns have most pronounced effects on phytoplankton productivity in the estuary located on the border between western and eastern Europe. CHL correlated significantly with the winter values of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAOw) and Scandinavia (SCANDw) indices, as well as with the values of the annual Polar/Eurasian (POLy) and annual Arctic Oscillation (AOy) indices. PP was significantly correlated with the values of POLy. East Atlantic/Western Russia pattern showed no significant correlation with both phytoplankton indicators. Stepwise multiple linear regressions were performed to determine the most influential indices affecting CHL and PP in the Neva Estuary. POLy, SCANDw, and NAOw appeared to be the main predictors in CHL multiple regression model, while the values of POLy and the July NAO and SCAND values were the main predictors in the PP model. According to our research, the productivity of phytoplankton in the Neva Estuary, located in the most northeastern part of the Baltic Sea, showed a significant relationship with the POL, which determines weather conditions in the northeastern regions of Eurasia. Possible mechanisms of the influence of these teleconnection patterns on phytoplankton productivity are discussed. Using the obtained multi-regression equations and the values of climatic indices, we calculated the values of CHL and PP for 1951-2002 and compared them with the results of field observations. The calculated and measured values of CHL and PP showed a significant increase in phytoplankton productivity in the Neva Estuary in the second half of the 2010s compared to earlier periods. In some years of the 1950s, 1980s, and late 1990s, CHL could also be above average and the low phytoplankton productivity should have been observed in the 1960s-1970s. This indicates a significant contribution of current climate change to fluctuation in phytoplankton productivity observed in recent decades, which should be taken into account when developing measures to protect aquatic ecosystems from eutrophication.

AB  - Purpose Dredged sediments are often disposed on land areas and can cause adverse effects on soil biota, since these materials generally may contain toxic agents. This work examines the ecotoxicological effects on earthworms exposed to technogenic deposits formed from the deposition of dredged sediments from an urban tropical lagoon. Such evaluation supports the understanding of the ecological effects derived from dredged sediments in the tropics, as well as the influence of soil properties in the toxicity. Materials and methods To simulate dredged sediment disposal under tropical conditions, a dredged sediment sample from the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) was mixed with a Gleysol (a typical organic tropical soil) to obtain the following doses: 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24%, where 0% = pure Gleysol. Acute and avoidance bioassays withEisenia andreiwere applied to these mixtures following standard protocols (ISO). Physical, chemical, and mineralogical characterization of the materials and metal determination in the test mixtures were performed to support the interpretations of ecotoxicological data. Results and discussion Metal concentrations in the test mixtures were generally in accordance with the limits defined by Brazilian law. Earthworm mortality was significant in doses >= 8% (LC50 = 7.1%), while doses >= 2% caused avoidance responses (EC50 = 1.7%,p < 0.05). The salinity in 8% treatment is similar to the salinity levels described by the literature that cause adverse effects on earthworms, suggesting that salinity played a key role in the toxicity. Earthworm biomass increased (p < 0.05) when the organisms were exposed to non-lethal doses, and this is probably due to water bioaccumulation related to high contents of salts. When comparing the toxicity found in this work with data obtained with other tropical soils, one could suppose that Gleysol mineralogy seems to control the bioavailability of salts and metals. Conclusion The possible formation of technogenic soils (constructed soils) due to land deposition of dredged sediments may potentially compromise natural soil fauna. In this particular case, soil mineralogy, salinity, and metals played a relevant role in the toxicity to earthworms. The development of approaches that can integrate ecotoxicological, ecological, and pedological data is urgent for better understanding the damages associated with the disposal of dredged sediments in tropical lowlands areas.

AB  - We investigated whether cross-shore distributions of coastal phytoplankton to the surf zone are controlled by hydrodynamics and their biological characteristics. Data from a rip-channeled beach indicate that concentrations of phytoplankton are higher in the surf zone than offshore. To examine how phytoplankton is transported toward the shore, we used a coupled biophysical model, comprised of a 3D physical model of coastal dynamics and an individual-based model (IBM) for tracking phytoplankton on the rip-channeled beach. Waves and wind in the biophysical model were parameterized by the conditions during the sampling period. Previous studies indicated that growth rates of phytoplankton can be enhanced by high turbulence, which might contribute to high phytoplankton concentration in the surf zone. Some numerical and laboratory works showed that turbulence can also increase the downward velocity of phytoplankton, which could be carried by onshore bottom currents and remain in the surf zone. Furthermore, we adapted the IBM with the theoretical model of diurnal vertical migration (DVM) for phytoplankton. The theoretical DVM works as follows: in the morning, phytoplankton cells adhere to air bubbles and stay at the surface and close to the shore in the daytime because onshore wind and surface current direction is usually onshore; in the late afternoon, the cells switch their attachment from air bubbles to sand grains and sink to the bottom where the water flow is normally onshore at night. Finally, depth-varying growth of phytoplankton was also incorporated into the DVM module. Simulations using neutral passive particles do not give the expected results of observed patterns. All tested mechanisms, i.e., wind- and wave-driven currents, rip-current circulation, turbulence-driven growth and sinking, DVM, and depth-varying growth, enhanced onshore phytoplankton migration and cell concentrations in the surf zone, indicating that both biological traits and physical factors can be essential to phytoplankton cross-shore transport and spatial variability. Our model is open to be modified and re-parameterized, followed by further analysis and validation, so that it can be more adequate for ecological assessment of coastal areas.

AB  - In this study, nanoscale zero valent iron I-NZVI was investigated as a remediation strategy for uranium contaminated groundwater from the former Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site in Oklahoma, USA. The 1 L batch-treatment system was applied in the study. The result shows that 99.9% of uranium in groundwater was removed by I-NZVI within 2 h. Uranium concentration in the groundwater stayed around 27 mu g/L, and there was no sign of uranium release into groundwater after seven days of reaction time. Meanwhile the release of iron was significantly decreased compared to NZVI which can reduce the treatment impact on the water environment. To study the influence of background pH of the treatment system on removal efficiency of uranium, the groundwater was adjusted from pH 2-10 before the addition of I-NZVI. The pH of the groundwater was from 2.1 to 10.7 after treatment. The removal efficiency of uranium achieved a maximum in neutral pH of groundwater. The desorption of uranium on the residual solid phase after treatment was investigated in order to discuss the stability of uranium on residual solids. After 2 h of leaching, 0.07% of the total uranium on residual solid phase was leached out in a HNO3 leaching solution with a pH of 4.03. The concentration of uranium in the acid leachate was under 3.2 mu g/L which is below the EPA's maximum contaminant level of 30 mu g/L. Otherwise, the concentration of uranium was negligible in distilled water leaching solution (pH = 6.44) and NaOH leaching solution (pH = 8.52). A desorption study shows that an acceptable amount of uranium on the residuals can be released into water system under strong acid conditions in short terms. For long term disposal management of the residual solids, the leachate needs to be monitored and treated before discharge into a hazardous landfill or the water system. For the first time, I-NZVI was applied for the treatment of uranium contaminated groundwater. These results provide proof that I-NZVI has improved performance compared to NZVI and is a promising technology for the restoration of complex uranium contaminated water resources.

AB  - Back ground. The diversity and composition of the microbial community of tree leaves ( the phyllosphere) varies among trees and host species and along spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients. Phyllosphere community variation within the canopy of an individual tree exists but the importance of this variation relative to amongtree and among-species variation is poorly understood. Sampling techniques employed for phyllosphere studies include picking leaves from one canopy location to mixing randomly selected leaves from throughout the canopy. In this context, our goal was to characterize the relative importance of intra-individual variation in phyllosphere communities across multiple species, and compare this variation to inter-individual and interspecific variation of phyllosphere epiphytic bacterial communities in a natural temperate forest in Quebec, Canada.
   Methods. We targeted five dominant temperate forest tree species including angiosperms and gymnosperms: Acer saccharum, Acer rubrum, Betula papyrifera, Abies balsamea and Picea glauca. For one randomly selected tree of each species, we sampled microbial communities at six distinct canopy locations: bottom-canopy (1-2 m height), the four cardinal points of mid-canopy (2-4 m height), and the top-canopy (4-6 m height). We also collected bottom-canopy leaves from five additional trees from each species.
   Results. Based on an analysis of bacterial community structure measured via Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S gene, we demonstrate that 65% of the intra-individual variation in leaf bacterial community structure could be attributed to the effect of inter-individual and inter-specific differences while the effect of canopy location was not significant. In comparison, host species identity explains 47% of inter-individual and inter-specific variation in leaf bacterial community structure followed by individual identity (32%) and canopy location (6%).
   Discussion. Our results suggest that individual samples from consistent positions within the tree canopy from multiple individuals per species can be used to accurately quantify variation in phyllosphere bacterial community structure. However, the considerable amount of intra-individual variation within a tree canopy ask for a better understanding of how changes in leaf characteristics and local abiotic conditions drive spatial variation in the phyllosphere microbiome.

AB  - A need exists in arid rangelands for effective monitoring of the impacts of grazing management on vegetation cover. Monitoring methods which utilize remotely-sensed imagery may have comprehensive spatial and temporal sampling, but do not necessarily control for spatial variation of natural variables, such as landsystem, vegetation type, soil type and rainfall. We use the inverse of the red band from Landsat TM satellite imagery to determine levels of vegetation cover in a 22,672km(2) area of arid rangeland in central South Australia. We interpret this wealth of data using a cross-fence comparison methodology, allowing us to rank paddocks (fields) in the study region according to effectiveness of grazing management. The cross-fence comparison methodology generates and solves simultaneous equations of the relationship between each paddock and all other paddocks, derived from pairs of cross-fence sample points. We compare this ranking from two image dates separated by six years, during which management changes are known to have taken place. Changes in paddock rank resulting from the cross-fence comparison method show strong correspondence to those predicted by grazing management in this region, with a significant difference between the two common management types; a change from full stocking rate to light 20% stocking regime (Major Stocking Reduction) and maintenance of full 100% stocking regime (Full Stocking Maintained) (P = 0.00000132). While no paddocks had a known increase in stocking rate during the study period, many had a reduction or complete removal in stock numbers, and many also experienced removals of pest species, such as rabbits, and other ecosystem restoration activities. These paddocks generally showed an improvement in rank compared to paddocks where the stocking regime remained relatively unchanged. For the first time, this method allows us to rank non-adjacent paddocks in a rangeland region relative to each other, while controlling for natural spatio-temporal variables such as rainfall, soil type, and vegetation community distributions, due to the nature of the cross-fence experimental design, and the spatially comprehensive data available in satellite imagery. This method provides a potential tool to aid land managers in decision making processes, particularly with regard to stocking rates.

AB  - Electricity consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with wastewater flows from residential and commercial water use in three major cities of the United States are analyzed and compared for the period 2010-2018. Contributions of unit wastewater treatment processes and electricity sources to the overall emissions are considered. Tucson (Arizona), Denver (Colorado), and Washington, DC were chosen for their distinct locations, climatic conditions, raw water sources, wastewater treatment technologies, and electric power mixes. Denver experienced a 20% reduction in treated wastewater volumes per person despite a 16% increase in population. In Washington, DC, the reduction was 19%, corresponding to a 16% increase in population, and in Tucson 14% despite a population growth of 3%. The electricity intensity per volume of treated wastewater was higher in Tucson (1 kWh m(-3)) than in Washington, DC (0.7 kWh m(-3)) or Denver (0.5 kWh m(-3)). Tucson's GHG emissions per person were about six times higher compared to Denver and four times higher compared to Washington, DC. Wastewater treatment facilities in Denver and Washington, DC generated a quarter to third of their electricity needs from onsite biogas and lowered their GHG emissions by offsetting purchases from the grid, including coal-generated electricity. The higher GHG emission intensity in Tucson is a reflection of coal majority in the electricity mix in the period, gradually replaced with natural gas, solar, and biogas. In 2018, the GHG reduction was 20% when the share of solar electricity increased to 14% from zero in 2016. In the analysis period, reduced wastewater volumes relative to the 2010 baseline saved Denver 44 000 MWh, Washington, DC 11 000 MWh and Tucson 7000 MWh of electricity. As a result, Washington, DC managed to forgo 21 000 metric tons of CO(2-eq)and Denver 34 000 metric tons, while Tucson's cumulative emissions increased by 22 000 metric tons of CO2-eq. This study highlights the variability observed in water systems and the opportunities that exist with water savings to allow for wastewater generation reduction, recovering energy from onsite biogas, and using energy-efficient wastewater treatment technologies.

AB  - Meteorology and air quality are key aspects for city life and urban metabolism. Both aspects build upon urban and natural processes, involve stocks and flows of heat and pollution, with in the end consequences for stocks and flows concerning other urban entities and processes such as human outdoor activities, leisure, transport modes, as well as for urban design and planning. During hot summer days cities experience an urban heat island effect mainly at the start of the evening and at night. As a result inhabitants might be subject to a reduced human thermal comfort. Hot summer days often also coincide with relatively poor air quality conditions. Both short-term effects are known to increase the mortality rates, and it is challenging to distinguish their impacts on health effects. Moreover, climate change scenarios indicate an enhancement of future heat wave frequency and intensity and a further deterioration of human thermal comfort. These issues raise the need and the urgency for city adaptation, but an integrated method for the assessment is still missing. Effective city adaptation is hampered by the complexity of the urban climate (induced by both meteorology and urban morphological characteristics) and its potential health risks, combined with the complex spatial interaction of stakeholders and economical functions. To warn the general public, and to effectively perform urban planning interventions, straightforward environmental indicators are required. indicators have been developed for the individual aspects before, but indices that combine both air quality and urban heat are rather scarce (Rainham and Smoyer-Tomic, 2003). This study develops a novel metric that combines the impact of thermal comfort and air quality by accounting for the relative health risk for both aspects. A straightforward quantification method for this metric has been developed to provide an objective, rational assessment. The application of this new Urban Climate assessment tool is then applied to a case study for a heat wave in the Northwestern Europe, and applied for a sample intervention in the city center of Ghent (Belgium).

AB  - Environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) is broadly applied and recently social and economic LCA have emerged. However, the development of a general framework for social LCA is still at an early stage of development. The aims of this paper are to systematically discuss general considerations regarding social LCA, to build a consistent and operationalized framework for a number of indicators and to test the framework through application on a case study.
   The first step was to define the scope of the framework starting from a comprehensive review of concepts of social sustainability and social well-being, focusing on the conditions potentially affected by large-scale introduction of novel technologies. Secondly, main areas of concern for social well-being were defined. This resulted in the identification of four main areas of concern. The third step was to make an inventory of potential social indicators and select a number of indicators that could make the framework operational. Additionally, factors for weighting and normalization were developed.
   The framework developed in this paper is based on four categories and 11 indicators and follows a life-cycle perspective. Six of the indicators are quantitative and are assessed using an input-output model linked to databases from the International Labour Organization. The remaining five indicators are qualitative indicators which are mapped using expert elicitation and a literature review. Identified concerns regarding the qualitative indicators are "flagged" and provided alongside the results of the quantitative assessment, which are aggregated into one single score by means of a weighted and normalized arithmetical mean. The paper illustrates the application of the methodology in a case study examining the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies in Europe.
   The paper presents a framework that can be used to explore potential impacts on social well-being resulting from the large-scale implementation of novel technologies. The selection of a limited number of indicators (11) keeps the methodology simple and transparent. Although the framework provides a useful approach in allowing both quantitative or qualitative identification of potential areas of concern, the results remain highly explorative in nature. The inherent value-laden and context specific nature of social aspects remains one of the key challenges for developing a general applicable framework.

AB  - Life form spectrum is an informative parameter in a comparative analysis of ecological structure of Collembola communities, and a valuable indicator of conditions of soil environment. This suggests a search of adequate methods of its determination. In the present study, two methods of evaluation of life form spectra in springtail communities are compared. A usual approach is a determination of the species composition and abundance, with a subsequent formal distribution of the species present among the life form categories of a chosen system, e.g. among epedaphic, hemiedaphic and euedaphic life forms considered as dwellers of litter surface and upper horizon, of litter depth and topsoil, and of soil horizon, respectively (Hopkin 1997). By this method (A) all the specimens of a given species are attributed to the same life form. However, species populations contain juveniles with smaller body size, thinner cuticle and weaker pigmentation, which tend to be more sensitive to environmental constraints and to dwell deeper in soil than adults. Therefore the attribution of juveniles and adults of a given species to the same life form may not be accurate. Another approach is a direct attribution of a life form category to each collembolan individual during the determination process, according to the visual assessment of its morphological characters (body size and development of pigmentation, number and pigmentation of ommatidia). In that case representatives of a given species might be attributed to more than one life form category, e.g. adults to epedaphic whereas juveniles to hemiedaphic life form, or to hemi- and euedaphic life form, respectively (method B). To compare both methods, mass collembolan material of a microcosm experiment carried out in a beech-oak forest at Mikolajki Research Station (NE Poland) and aimed at investigation of mesofauna/earthworm interactions, was used. The comparison showed a statistically significant bias between the spectra of Collembola life forms estimated by methods A and B: the latter spectrum was shifted to the favour of euedaphic forms. The range of the bias was larger in soil than in litter horizon. Method B is suggested to be closer to a real life form distribution in a collembolan community and may be used for corrections of the data obtained by the traditional taxonomic method A.

AB  - Paleoecological investigations of sediments deposited downstream of freshwater springs have the potential to reconstruct the environmental history of source aquifers and their catchments, thereby allowing for the study of long-term changes in these important hydrological systems. In an exploratory investigation, a 76-cm sediment column was obtained from a spring bed in Scarborough, southern Ontario, Canada, Thr column represents about 160 years of accumulated sediment. Siliceous microfossils, including diatoms, chrysophyte cysts, phytoliths and plates of testate amoebae (Rhizopoda), were identified and enumerated. Over the similar to 160-year period, siliceous remains track a gradual transition from a slow river environment in the early 1800s to a spring-fed pond environment by the late-1800s, hurricane-induced flooding, and the eventual slowing and drying of thr spring in the latter half of the twentieth century. Basal, pre settlement sediments contain a cosmopolitan assemblage of diatom taxa and testacean plates of the genus Lesquereusia. Between similar to 1880 and similar to 1954, fossils of aquatic species occur only in trace amounts, indicating increased deposition of elastic material and poor conditions for survival. but unbroken microfossils indicate that preservation of opaline remains was not a problem. Despite low concentrations of microfossils in this interval, chrysophyte and testacean survival was favoured over diatoms. In 1954, a thick layer of sediment was deposited by hurricane-induced flooding, confirmed by high phytolith concentrations from terrestrial sources. Since similar to 1960, epiphytic diatoms, reflecting dense macrophyte growth and higher productivity, dominate the diatom assemblage. Some of the recent diatom ta,va are also salinity-tolerant, reflecting possible groundwater salinification. Chrysophyte cysts are relatively abundant at thr op of the sediment column. but recent concentrations are lower than pre-settlement levels, likely reflecting an increased nutrient load. Recent increases in vegetation in and around the spring are also inferred by high concentrations of testacean plates and phytoliths. These paleoecological data match historical records and data from previous investigations of fossil aquatic insect larvae. These approaches show promise for relating changes in siliceous microfossils to human impacts and natural changes in spring habitats, their catchments and the quality of groundwater.

AB  - With a depositional history spanning the early Aptian to early Albian (similar to 19 mys), the Lower Cretaceous Xinminpu Group in Jiuquan, NW China provides detailed record of an inland ecosystem responding to global climatic and environmental changes. The Xinminpu Group exhibits the most typical elements of the Jehol Biota found outside NE China, a highly diverse avifauna and a mid-Cretaceous angiosperm flora. The absence of a comprehensive stratigraphical framework for this area however limits the degree to which the unit can be interpreted relative to coeval sections and the geological records in genera. Recent fossil discoveries and radio-isotopic age data can provide a more detailed biostratigraphical and chronostratigraphical framework for Lower Cretaceous units around Jiuquan. The data complied here indicate that the Chijinpu Formation correlates with the middle-upper Yixian and lower Jiufotang formations of NE China making it early Aptian in age, and the Xiagou Formation correlates with the upper Jiufotang and Shahai formations making it late early Aptian-early Albian in age. This research further reports a novel zircon U-Pb age constraint of 112.4 +/- 0.3 Ma for a basalt sample from the lowermost Zhonggou Formation, which is supported to be correlated with the Fuxin Formation of early Albian age. The Chijinpu Formation contains typical elements of the Jehol Biota, i.e. the Eosestheria-Lycoptera-Ephemeropsis trisetalis assemblage, confirming the interpretation that the Jehol Biota had reached Jiuquan during its second evolutionary stage. The Xiagou Formation contains the amphibious avifauna appearing just above OAE1a, indicating a close link between the early Ornithuromorpha evolution and early Aptian global climate changes. The Zhonggou Formation in Jiuquan records the first appearance of an angiosperm flora above OAE1b. Depositional indicators suggest a humid climate with a gradual shift to arid conditions during this time. This review paper laid foundation for the systematic study of the well-preserved Early Cretaceous ecosystem in Jiuquan, allowing to understand correlations between inland and marine environments as recorded in sediments from this critical period.

AB  - Due to the combined influences of climate change and human activities, the water deficiency and saline-alkalinization of soil are becoming more severe in the Momoge National Nature Reserve (MNNR) in Songnen Plain, China, resulting in extensive vegetation degradation in wetlands. Suaeda salsa acts as a pioneer species in vegetation restoration of saline-sodic wetlands in MNNR because of its high salt-tolerance. The seeding emergence and early growth of S. salsa in natural condition can be especially affected by the increased water, salt, and alkaline stresses in the surface soil. However, little is known about the plant-soil relations, as it leads to the uncertainty of establishing S. salsa population in degraded wetlands. The purpose of the present study is to quantify the main soil factors controlling the early establishment of S. salsa population. The heterogeneity in soil water content (SWC), electrical conductivity (EC) and pH across 0-20 cm soil, and S. salsa population characteristics were investigated in natural stands, as well as their relationships were studied. There was a synergistic relationship between EC and pH across 0-20 cm soil, and they had negative correlation with SWC in 5-20 cm soil, implying that the water management could potentially affect soil saline-alkalinization. Redundancy analysis and correlation analysis revealed that the S. salsa characteristics were negatively related with SWC in 0-10 cm and EC in 0-5 cm soil, demonstrating that soil moisture and salinity in surface soil were major determinants of early establishment of S. salsa population. In addition, the positive relationships between the root/shoot ratio (RSR) and SWC and EC in 0-5 cm soil indicated that S. salsa adapted to the increased moisture and salinity by regulating the biomass allocation between shoot and root. Results in this study suggest that soil moisture and salinity can be used as effective environmental indicators for evaluating the early establishment of S. salsa population during pioneer species introduction for vegetation restoration in degraded saline-sodic wetlands in Songnen Plain.

AB  - The relevance of the work is caused by the lack of a unified concept of taking into account the natural and climatic conditions in system studies in the energy sector.
   The main aim of the study is to demonstrate the possibility of using long-term meteorological observation data with international codes FM 12 Synop and METAR recorded at the nearest meteorological station from the object under consideration to reproduce the natural-climatic situation with a fixed estimated step throughout the entire cycle of the settlement period; to show the significance of long-term meteorological observation data in solving the global problem of optimizing the composition of autonomous energy complexes using renewable sources and energy storage applying the chronological method of calculating the system.
   The methods. The concept introduced is consistently built on the fundamental provisions of the theory of system and interdisciplinary research with reference to the proven mathematical models that allow both processing and simulating natural climatic indices with a fixed discrete step. The work uses multi-year meteorological series with international codes FM 12 Synop and METAR, recorded at various weather stations in the Republic of Yakutia and the state of Alaska. A high-level Matlab programming language is used.
   The results. The author has proposed a unified concept for reproduction of actinometrical and wind power indices, as well as many other natural and climatic parameters, having a direct connection with systemic tasks in the energy sector. This concept is implemented in the software and computing complex "Local analysis of environmental parameters and solar radiation" using a high-level programming language Matlab. The paper introduces the results of processing multi-year arrays of environmental parameters for 22 settlements located in various natural and climatic zones of the Republic of Yakutia and the American state of Alaska. The author carried out the detailed analysis of the results obtained with relevant conclusions and conclusions on the degree of their reliability and the possibility of using autonomous energy complexes with renewable sources and energy storage in the optimization studies applying the chronological method of calculating the system.

AB  - The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis posits that personality traits (i.e. consistent individual differences in behaviour) are linked to life history and fitness. Specifically, fast-paced individuals are predicted to be proactive (i.e. active and aggressive) with an earlier age at first reproduction, a shorter life span and higher fecundity than slow-paced individuals. Environmental conditions and sex differences may be important in maintaining behavioural and life history variation in populations and may influence the covariance of personality with life history or lifetime fitness. However, these effects are rarely tested together. We investigated whether the occurrence of a resource pulse (called a mast year) during adulthood altered the associations between personality and life history traits or lifetime offspring production in adult North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus. Despite accounting for environmental context during adulthood, we found no evidence of an overall pace-of-life syndrome in this population as personality was not associated with age at first reproduction or longevity in either sex. Males and females had similar activity levels, but females were more aggressive, potentially due to the fitness benefits of protecting their offspring from predation. In all females, regardless of mast experience, there was no association between activity and lifetime pup production, but there was a positive association between aggression and lifetime pup production. In males that experienced a mast, there was a positive association between lifetime pup production and both activity and aggression. In males that did not experience a mast, there was no association between activity and lifetime pup production, but there was a negative association between aggression and lifetime pup production. Lifetime recruit production (number of adult offspring recruited into the breeding population) in either sex was not influenced by activity or aggression regardless of mast experience. Overall, our results suggest that the infrequent occurrence of mast years may contribute to maintaining variation in personality traits in red squirrels.

AB  - Of marine eubacteria, the genus Vibrio is intriguing because member species are relevant to both marine ecology and human health. Many studies have touted the relationships of Vibrio to environmental factors, especially temperature and salinity, to predict total Vibrio abundance but lacked the taxonomic resolution to identify the relationships among species and the key drivers of Vibrio dynamics. To improve next-generation sequencing (NGS) surveys of Vibrio, we have conducted both 16S small subunit rRNA and heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) amplicon sequencing of water samples collected at two well-studied locations in the Neuse River Estuary, NC. Samples were collected between May and December 2016 with enhanced sampling efforts in response to two named storms. Using hsp60 sequences, 21 Vibrio species were identified, including the potential human pathogens V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus. Changes in the Vibrio community mirrored seasonal and storm-related changes in the water column, especially in response to an influx of nutrient-rich freshwater to the estuary after Hurricane Matthew, which initiated dramatic changes in the overall Vibrio community. Individual species dynamics were wide ranging, indicating that individual Vibrio taxa have unique ecologies and that total Vibrio abundance predictors are insufficient for risk assessments of potentially pathogenic species. Positive relationships between Vibrio, dinoflagellates, and Cyanobacteria were identified, as were intraspecies associations, which further illuminated the interactions of cooccurring Vibrio taxa along environmental gradients.
   IMPORTANCE The objectives of this research were to utilize a novel approach to improve sequence-based surveys of Vibrio communities and to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by presenting an analysis of Vibrio dynamics in the context of environmental conditions, with a particular focus on species that cause disease in humans and on storm effects. The methods presented here enabled the analysis of Vibrio dynamics with excellent taxonomic resolution and could be incorporated into future ecological studies and risk prediction strategies for potentially pathogenic species. Next-generation sequencing of hsp60 and other innovative sequence-based approaches are valuable tools and show great promise for studying Vibrio ecology and associated public health risks.

AB  - AimsSuccessful establishment of species-rich Nardus grasslands on ex-agricultural land requires identification and removal of barriers to effective seed germination and seedling survival. Therefore, we investigate how germination and early development are affected by soil conditions from different restoration phases and how this relates to their specific plant strategies.
   LocationGrasslands and experiments in northern Belgium.
   MethodsWe selected three grassland restoration phases (Lolium perenne grasslands, grass-herb mix grasslands and species-rich Nardus grasslands), which were characterized by a distinct plant community and soils with contrasting abiotic and biotic properties (respectively, eutrophic, mesotrophic and oligotrophic soils). In a first germination experiment we investigated the species-specific responses (germination, lag time and emergence rate) of 70 grassland species (that typically occur along the restoration gradient) in each of the selected soils. Second, a mesocosm experiment was set-up in which a mixture of 19 species (representative of the distinct grassland restoration phases) was grown together in the respective soils. Here, we analysed the intraspecific variation of plant growth, SLA and identified changes in community assembly.
   ResultsIrrespective of soil influences, Nardus grassland species had significantly lower germination potentials and longer germination lag times than L. perenne grassland species. Germination (and its lag time) of grass-herb mix grassland species were negatively affected by the oligotrophic soils. Soil factors determined early growth patterns during the emergence and establishment phase. L. perenne grassland species exhibited a more plastic growth response and were highly dependent on soil type. Nardus grassland species exhibited large intraspecific variation in SLA, which was found to be significantly lower in the oligotrophic soils. Even though the difference in bio-available P between mesotrophic and oligotrophic soils was minor, Nardus grassland species were only able to compete in the oligotrophic soils (no significant difference in biomass between communities). Mesotrophic mesocosms exhibited the highest species richness after 200d of growth.
   ConclusionPlant species from the three grassland restoration phases display distinct germination strategies, irrespective of soil type. Interactions between growth strategies and soil factors determine competitive asymmetry and therefore shape community assembly in the distinct grassland phases.

AB  - Many bacteria and fungi in the plant rhizosphere and endosphere are beneficial to plant nutrient acquisition, health, and growth. Although playing essential roles in ecosystem functioning, our knowledge about the effects of multiple cropping regimes on the plant microbiome and their interactions is still limited. Here, we designed a pot experiment simulating different cropping regimes. For this purpose, wheat and faba bean plants were grown under controlled greenhouse conditions in monocultures and in two intercropping regimes: row and mixed intercropping. Bacterial and fungal communities in bulk and rhizosphere soils as well as in the roots and aerial plant parts were analyzed using large-scale metabarcoding. We detected differences in microbial richness and diversity between the cropping regimes. Generally, observed effects were attributed to differences between mixed and row intercropping or mixed intercropping and monoculture. Bacterial and fungal diversity were significantly higher in bulk soil samples of wheat and faba bean grown in mixed compared to row intercropping. Moreover, microbial communities varied between crop species and plant compartments resulting in different responses of these communities toward cropping regimes. Leaf endophytes were not affected by cropping regime but bacterial and fungal community structures in bulk and rhizosphere soil as well as fungal community structures in roots. We further recorded highly complex changes in microbial interactions. The number of negative inter-domain correlations between fungi and bacteria decreased in bulk and rhizosphere soil in intercropping regimes compared to monocultures due to beneficial effects. In addition, we observed plant species-dependent differences indicating that intra- and interspecific competition between plants had different effects on the plant species and thus on their associated microbial communities. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating microbial communities in different plant compartments with respect to multiple cropping regimes using large-scale metabarcoding. Although a simple design simulating different cropping regimes was used, obtained results contribute to the understanding how cropping regimes affect bacterial and fungal communities and their interactions in different plant compartments. Nonetheless, we need field experiments to properly quantify observed effects in natural ecosystems.

AB  - Understanding long-term effects of climate on soil with organic contaminations is a major advantage for natural attenuation assessment. However, studies are often limited to evaluating the evolution of availability of one/several selected contaminant(s) spiked into natural or agricultural soils. These approaches are not representative of real cases of industrial wastelands. In this study, we want to understand the evolution of a broad set of anthropogenic soil and especially the organic matter reactivity through climate aging factors.
   Eleven soils were sampled from representative former industrial sites contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (coking and gas plants, backfills). They were broadly characterized and then aged through several experimental climatic simulations in controlled conditions: freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs), wetting-drying cycles (WDCs), and heating on dry and wet soil (HDS and HWS). The variation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content was used as an indicator of the modification of the organic matter reactivity induced by climate aging modalities.
   Physico-chemical soil characterization indicates similar characteristics to those of Technosols but very different compared to natural/agricultural soils. A principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear correlation between initial DOC, PAH concentration, and the solvent extractible fraction of organic matter. This means that DOC is a clear indicator of technogenic organic matter mobility. After aging, DOC followed several significant trends depending on the aging modality. These trends were controlled by the competition of (i) biodegradation/oxidation, (ii) formation/disruption of aggregates, and (iii) sorption/desorption processes. A multivariate analysis performed by PCA revealed that DOC variations were strongly linked with the silt fraction and the occurrence of vegetation cover after FTC, HWS, and HDS. These parameters emphasized their important role as regulating the reactivity of organic compounds during climate aging.
   This study provides the first steps to assess natural evolution and natural attenuation of organic pollutants in historically contaminated soils. This original approach reveals the influence of climate aging on the reactivity of technogenic organic matter. Moreover, this influence appears to be particularly intensified in soil with a high silt fraction and the occurrence of vegetation cover.

AB  - Urban ecological indicators allow the objective and quantitative characterisation of ecological conditions in a spatially continuous way by evaluating the influence of urban surface types with respect to ecological functions and ecosystem services. Although the concept had already been developed in the 1980s, the variety of existing indicators had not been widely applied yet in urban planning practice, because of the high manual mapping effort that is required for spatially differentiated urban surface mapping. This paper presents a new automated remote sensing and GIS-based system for the flexible and user-defined derivation of urban ecological indicators. The system is based on automated surface material mapping using airborne hyperspectral image data and height information. Because the material classes obtained from remote sensing analysis differ in part from the surface types needed for the calculation of urban ecological indicators, they have been transformed into so-called linking categories representing the basis for the automated GIS-based derivation of urban ecological indicators. For this purpose, a computer-based system for flexible indicator derivation has been developed, allowing the user-defined integration of indicators based on the variable determination of mapping units, linking categories and respective weighting factors. Based on a comprehensive review of existing ecological indicators, 14 indicators have been selected and implemented in the system. To demonstrate the potential of the new system, a variety of indicators has been derived for two test sites situated in the German cities of Dresden and Potsdam, using city blocks defined by the municipal authorities as spatial mapping units. The initial mapping of surface materials was automatically performed on the basis of airborne hyperspectral image data acquired by the HyMAP system. The results of subsequent GIS-based indicator calculation were validated using results from field-based reference mapping that had been carried out for selected city blocks situated in both cities. An accuracy assessment for these reference city blocks has revealed mean errors of approximately 4%, confirming the suitability of the developed automated GIS-based system for flexible and efficient indicator calculation.

AB  - Success in ecological restoration is rarely assessed rigorously due to insufficient planning for post-restoration monitoring programs, limited funding and, especially, lack of scientifically validated evaluation criteria and protocols. In this article, we propose the use of the Indicator Value Index technique (IndVal), which statistically determines the association of species to one or several particular site types, to obtain indicators of success at the early stages of the recovery process in restoration projects. Peat bogs extracted by the vacuum method, subsequently restored by a moss-transfer technique and regularly monitored for similar to 10 years were used as a model system to test this approach. We first identified 34 restored sectors of similar to 10 ha from 4 to II years old in twelve eastern-Canadian bogs. These sectors were then classified according to their degree of success in recovering a typical sphagnum moss carpet (restoration goal). Then, we retrospectively reviewed vegetation communities recorded at the third year after restoration to identify indicator species of different categories of restoration success, using the IndVal methodology. By identifying early indicator species, our method provides a tool that guides intervention soon after restoration if a site is not on a desired successional trajectory. Typical bog species, namely the bryophytes S. rubellum and Mylia anomala and the tree Picea mariana, were indicative of successful restoration; while bare peat, lichens and one species of ericaceous shrubs (Empetrum nigrum), which cope better under drier conditions, indicated sites where restoration failed. A surprising finding was that the moss Polytrichum strictum, which is known to facilitate the colonization of sphagnum in disturbed peatlands, is an early indicator of unsuccessful restoration. This finding made us question the nursing role of P. strictum at a cover threshold above ca. 30%, when P. strictum could be outcompeting sphagnum and become dominant. We conclude that the IndVal method is an effective tool to identify early indicators of restoration success when combined with a thoughtful examination of species frequency and cover within each site type.

AB  - Featured Application: The engineering properties obtainable during the construction of road pavement layers using reactive stabilising agents are traditionally determined using a trail-and-error approach based on material indicator tests, some developed more than a century ago. These tests inhibit the limitations associated with an empirically derived test or method, often leading to costly failures. The introduction of proven and applicable nanotechnologies to treat or stabilise granular material for use in pavement layers could result in the rejection of these technologies if not based on the understanding of the basic chemistry of both the stabilising agent and the mineralogy of the granular materials. This article gives a basic explanation of elementary chemistry that will affect the physical engineering properties (stresses and strains) that can be expected using available, proven and cost-effective nanotechnologies to improve granular materials for use in a pavement structure.
   Nanoscale organofunctional silanes have been developed, tested and successfully applied to protect stone buildings in Europe against climatic effects since the 1860s. The same nanotechnologies can also be used in pavement engineering to create strong chemical bonds between a stabilising agent and granular material. The attachment of the organofunctional silane to a material also changes the surface of the material to become hydrophobic, thereby considerably reducing future chemical weathering. These properties allow naturally available materials to be used in any pavement layer at a low risk. In the built environment, scientists soon determined that the successful use of an organo-silane depends on the type and condition of the stone to be treated. The same principles apply to the implementation of applicable nanotechnologies in pavement engineering. Understanding the basic chemistry, determining the properties of the stabilising agent and the organofunctional modifying agent and the chemical interaction with the primary and secondary minerals of the material are essential for the successful application of these technologies in pavement engineering. This paper explains some basic chemistry, which fundamentally influences engineering outputs that can be achieved using New-age (Nano) Modified Emulsions (NME) stabilising agents with naturally available granular materials in all road pavement layers below the surfacing.

AB  - Electrocoagulation (EC), ozonation (O-3) and their combination have attracted the interest of researchers for textile wastewater treatment. However, the lack of an exhaustive comparison among the different approaches, including also the evaluation of their impact on the environment, has hampered full-scale application. As a result, in this study, environmental impacts of simultaneous (-) and sequential (->) combination of EC and O-3 were analyzed and compared to EC and O-3 alone processes. The effect of type of electrode (Fe or Al) was evaluated in the EC process. The processes were investigated at lab scale and compared through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), using ReCiPe midpoint and endpoint methods. EC process with Al electrodes resulted in the lowest impact for all the environmental categories due to the lower energy consumption, while O-3 process resulted in the highest impact being an energy- and oxygen-intensive process. In particular, when the processes removed COD below 60 mg/L, the higher CO2 emission as the key midpoint method indicator was expected for O-3 (81.4 g CO2 eq), while the lower was measured for EC(Al) (1.4 g CO2 eq). Moreover, the higher effect on Human Health, as the key endpoint method indicator, was obtained for O-3 (6.65E-6), and the lower one was for EC(Al) (1.35E-7). The environmental impact of simultaneous combination (EC-O-3) is still high due to high ozonation time. In sequential combination option (EC -> O-3), O-3 treatment time was very short and environmental impacts decreased significantly besides high purification performance (approximately 50% COD removal). It is worthy to note that the environmental impacts of all processes are strongly related to energy and chemical consumption, that emphasize the importance of optimizing operation conditions. LCA showed that the sequential combination of EC and O-3 is the most sustainable solution for textile wastewater treatment among the investigated processes and it can be successfully applied at industrial scale.

AB  - Coal mining in China is continually increasing, and the associated emitted coal mine dust is of growing environmental and occupational concern. In this study, deposited coal mine dust (DD) was analysed in three different regions of an active, highly-volatile bituminous open-pit coal mine in the Xingjian Province, Northwest of China: coal working fronts, tailings handling sites, and road traffic sites. Samples were analysed for particle size, and geochemical and mineralogical patterns, and then compared with the respirable DD fractions (RDDs, <4 mu m) separated from DD samples. Online measurements of ambient air concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), black carbon (BC) and ultrafine particles (UFP) were performed in the same mine zones where DD was sampled.
   Furthermore, the RDD samples were subjected to analysis of specific biological response or toxicological indicators (oxidative potential, OP). The results demonstrated: i) large differences in particle size and composition among DD from tailings handling, mad traffic and coal working front sites, ii) a strong influence of the DD moisture contents and ash yields on particle size, and, accordingly, on the potential dust emissions, iii) an enrichment of multiple elements (such as Nb, Th, Cr, Sr, Li, As, Pb, Cu, Zr and Ni) in the RDD from coal working fronts compared with their contents in the worked parent coal seams, mostly attributed to mining machinery, tyre and brake wear emissions and to deposition of dust emitted from gangue working zones, iv) low OP values of the RDD emitted from the studied mine, which works a high-quality coal, with OP being influenced by Mn, sulphate and anatase (TiO2) contents, and v) the impact of specific mining operations and mine areas on the levels of air pollutants, such as high PM from tailings handling in the upper parts of the mine or the high UFP levels in the bottom of the mine (due to vehicle and machinery emissions and lower dispersive conditions). The data presented here demonstrate the necessity of extracting the more deeply respirable size fraction of coal mine dusts in future studies on the health effects of these materials because this finer fraction is mineralogically and geochemically different from the parent rocks.

AB  - Isolation basins are natural topographic depressions that at various times in their history may be connected to or isolated from the sea by changes in relative sea-level (RSL). They provide a valuable source of data for tracking large scale (tens of meters) changes in RSL over millennia, as well as quiet-water depositional environments where abrupt changes caused by tsunami, iceberg roll or storms may be recorded. In this paper we review isolation basins as sources of RSL data with a particular focus on their use in Greenland to constrain the Holocene history of the ice sheet. A new RSL curve from Disko Fjord, West Greenland is presented, which shows that local ice free conditions were established at c. 11 k cal yr BP, after which RSL fell rapidly from a marine limit at c. 80 m to reach close to present sea level by c. 4 k cal yr BP. We compare this record with other isolation basin RSL data from six other sites in Disko Bugt and note a strong northwest/southeast differential rebound across the area during the early and mid-Holocene that reflects variations in ice load history. We compare the Disko Bugt data with other previously published isolation basin RSL records from Sisimiut (central West Greenland), Nanortalik (south Greenland) and Ammassalik (southeast Greenland). RSL fell below present during the early-Holocene at Nanortalik (c. 10 k cal yr BP) and during the mid to late Holocene elsewhere before rising to present. These differences reflect variations in the timing and amount of Greenland ice load change since the last glacial maximum, as well as non-Greenland processes, notably the collapse of the Laurentide forebulge and also changes in ice equivalent sea-level. Isolation basin data have relatively small age and height uncertainties compared with other RSL indicators, enabling them to resolve between different earth and ice sheet models, especially during periods of large ice load and RSL change.

AB  - Factors contributing to variation in heading date in spring barley were examined in several studies commencing with a survey of developmental variation in a large collection of genotypes and concluding with the molecular genetic analysis of 7 doubled haploid populations. Genotypes varied considerably in their specific responses to photoperiod and vernalisation, and in the duration of a pre-inductive ( or juvenile) phase defined in this paper as a 'basic vegetative period'. The latter includes differential genotype responses to ambient temperature and their interaction with photoperiod. Combinations of these largely independent environmental variables account for variation in heading date associated with differences in growing season conditions, particularly geographic region, sowing dates, and cultivar adaptation. Under extended and natural ( short) photoperiods, in both summer and winter field plantings, conventional genetic analysis was characterised by simple Mendelian segregation combined with considerable transgressive segregation within distinct early and late flowering subpopulations. Equivalent transgressive segregation characterised molecular genetic analysis that identified 16 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with contributions ranging from > 50% of the variation recorded to < 10%. These were dominated by 2 QTLs located on chromosome 2, one of which on 2HS was associated with response to extended photoperiod and the other, located near the centromere, with variation in the duration of the basic vegetative period. As only one population segregated for response to vernalisation, all analyses were restricted to parents and progeny homozygous for no response. Three other QTLs on 1HL, 3HL, and 5HL were primarily associated with vernalised parents and progeny characterised by prostrate seedling growth habits, which questions any assumption of a pleiotrophic association between genes for vernalisation and growth habit.
   The potential for exploiting markers for selection is considered to be limited by the considerable transgressive segregation observed in lines homozygous for parental alleles, and the limited understanding of the causes of variation in the phenotypic expression of the QTLs identified. Such markers would be useful in the selection of backcrossed progeny and in developing materials for investigating fundamental mechanisms contributing to developmental variation.

AB  - Species distribution depends on the physiological and ecological niche where a species can exist and regenerate in resource competition with other species (niche limitation). The realized niche is influenced by local biotic processes that influence species behaviour and the shape of the response curves relative to environmental gradients. Processes on larger scales also influence the species niche through source-sink mechanisms (dispersal limitation) and the species richness of an area (pool limitation). Despite the growing evidence of skewed or irregular species response curves along gradients, many ecologists still assume symmetric, unimodal response curves along gradients in ecological interpretation. Ellenberg's indicator system is probably the most common example. However, the assumption is not ecologically or statistically valid, due to the many different processes affecting the distribution of plant species. Here I present the results of Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) regressions for 209 Danish forest species. HOF modelling is chosen to avoid the classical drawbacks of assuming symmetric, unimodal response patterns. I calculate the optima for all species with unimodal responses to soil pH and compare these with the Ellenberg indicator values for reaction (R), which are often used as a substitute for soil pH measurements. I demonstrate that the assumption of symmetric, unimodal species behaviour is violated in 54% of the cases and that pH optima and R indicator values for species are not always compatible. Ellenberg reaction scale has been used by EWALD (Folia Geobot. 38: 357-366, 2003) as an indicator of which species are calcicole, i.e., whether they can grow and reproduce on calcareous soils. Such affinities of species, however, are related to both local niche properties and processes on large scales and cannot be generalized from a single empirical variable such as pH, nor from Ellenberg semi-ordinal indicator scale. I conclude that while the determination of whether species are calcicole or calcifuge requires more research, it is evident that Denmark contains a fairly balanced number of calciphytic and acidophytic species. This is probably due to the nearly equal areas with acidic and alkaline soils in Denmark, which also contribute to the high species richness of more than 500 vascular plant species in Danish forests.

AB  - Consistent identification of diatoms is a prerequisite for studying their ecology, biogeography, and successful application as environmental indicators. However, taxonomic consistency among observers has been difficult to achieve because taxonomic information is scattered across numerous literature sources, presenting challenges to the diatomist. Firstly, literature is often inaccessible because of cost or its location in journals that are not widely circulated. Secondly, taxonomic revisions of diatoms are taking place faster than floras can be updated. Finally, taxonomic information is often contradictory across literature sources. These issues can be addressed by developing a content creation community dedicated to making taxonomic, ecological, and image-based data freely available for diatom researchers. Diatoms.org represents such a content curation community, providing open, online access to a vast amount of recent and historical information on North American diatom taxonomy and ecology. The content curation community aggregates existing taxonomic information, creates new content, and provides feedback in the form of corrections and notices of literature with nomenclatural changes. The website not only addresses the needs of experienced diatom scientists for consistent identification but is also designed to meet users at their level of expertise, including engaging the lay public in the importance of diatom science. The website now contains over 1000 species pages contributed by over 100 content contributors, from students to established scientists. The project began with the intent to provide accurate information on diatom identification, ecology, and distribution using an approach that incorporates engaging design, user feedback, and advanced data access technology. In retrospect, the project that began as an 'extended electronic book' has emerged not only as a means to support taxonomists, but for practitioners to communicate and collaborate, expanding the size of and benefits to the content curation community. In this paper, we outline the development of diatoms.org, document key elements of the project, examine ongoing challenges and consider the unexpected emergent properties, including the value of diatoms.org as a source of data. Ultimately, if the field of diatom taxonomy, ecology, and biodiversity is to be relevant, a new generation of taxonomists needs to be trained and employed using new tools. We propose that diatoms.org is in a key position to serve as a hub of training and continuity for the study of diatom biodiversity and aquatic conditions.

AB  - Spatial patterns can reveal a lot about ecological processes, but our knowledge of the spatial ecology of tree regeneration at a fine scale is quite limited. Therefore, we studied the spatial patterns of living and dead small trees in two subalpine Norway spruce forest reserves in Switzerland (Scatle` and Bo center dot dmerenwald) using three types of analyses. First, we investigated the distances of small trees to the nearest large neighboring tree and, by using maximum distances as indicator, inferred the size of forest gaps, detecting mainly forest gaps of small size, although with two exceptions that were driven by large-scale disturbances. Second, we accounted for spatial inhomogeneity in the pattern of small and large trees (i.e., variations in local tree densities) by including environmental covariates in point pattern models. Latitude (within the forest reserve), elevation and aspect contributed significantly to explaining the density of living and dead small trees, and partly of living and dead large trees. Yet, the influence of these environmental covariates varied between the two reserves due to their different topography and peculiar site conditions. Third, we analyzed neighborhood interactions between small and large trees based on the vicinity and size of trees. In both forest reserves, small living trees were randomly dispersed around large dead trees over a broad range of distances and, at certain distances in one reserve, even dispersed away from them. Small living trees further showed clustering around large living trees at short distances and dispersion at large distances. Small dead trees featured mainly a random pattern, although with a tendency to cluster around large neighbors at short distances, irrespective whether these were living or dead. Yet, the weakening of clustering with increasing distances indicates that the influence of large trees on small trees varies with spatial scale and thus that these neighborhood interactions are scale-dependent. Overall, our study contributes to a better understanding of the spatial ecology of mortality in small trees and ultimately of tree regeneration processes and stand dynamics in mountain forests.

AB  - Understanding of the pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) remains incomplete, particularly in respect to the multi-organ dysfunction it may cause. We were the first to report the analogous biological and physiological features of COVID-19 pathogenesis and the harmful amplification loop between inflammation and tissue damage induced by the dysregulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. Given the rapid evolution of this disease, the nature of its symptoms, and its potential lethality, we hypothesize that COVID-19 progresses under just such an amplifier loop, leading to a massive, uncontrolled inflammation process. Here, we describe in-depth the correlations of COVID-19 symptoms and biological features with those where uncontrolled NET formation is implicated in various sterile or infectious diseases. General clinical conditions, as well as numerous pathological and biological features, are analogous with NETs deleterious effects. Among NETs by-products implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis, one of the most significant appears to be elastase, in accelerating virus entry and inducing hypertension, thrombosis and vasculitis. We postulate that severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) may evade innate immune response, causing uncontrolled NETs formation and multi-organ failure. In addition, we point to indicators that NETS-associated diseases are COVID-19 risk factors. Acknowledging that neutrophils are the principal origin of extracellular and circulating DNA release, we nonetheless, explain why targeting NETs rather than neutrophils themselves may in practice be a better strategy. This paper also offers an in-depth review of NET formation, function and pathogenic dysregulation, as well as of current and prospective future therapies to control NETopathies. As such, it enables us also to suggest new therapeutic strategies to fight COVID-19. In combination with or independent of the latest tested approaches, we propose the evaluation, in the short term, of treatments with DNase-1, with the anti-diabetic Metformin, or with drugs targeting elastase (i.e., Silvelestat). With a longer perspective, we also advocate a significant increase in research on the development of toll-like receptors (TLR) and C-type lectin-like receptors (CLEC) inhibitors, NET-inhibitory peptides, and on anti-IL-26 therapies.

TI  - Site-specific differences in microbial community structure and function within the rhizosphere and rhizoplane of wetland plants is plant species dependent
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
LA  - English
AB  - Two types of organisms that are vital to the ecosystem services provided by wetlands are plants and soil microorganisms, more specifically, the bacteria associated with the roots of wetland plants. In order to better understand the relationships between wetland plants and their associated microorganisms, we tested the hypothesis that the microbial rhizosphere and rhizoplane communities in wetland systems highly impacted by anthropogenic activities subjected to poor water quality inputs would differ from those communities in areas less impacted by anthropogenic activity receiving higher water quality inputs. To test this hypothesis we compared structural and functional characteristics of microbial communities from water, rhizosphere and rhizoplane microbial communities associated with three wetland plant species (Iris versicolor, Potamogeton natans and Veronica spicata) at two sites along the Grand River (Ontario Canada) experiencing different levels of anthropogenic impact. West Montrose (WM) is a northern site which has historically been classified as having "good" water quality, while Rare (RA) is a site located in a highly urbanized area receiving effluent from a municipal waste water treatment plant (WWTP). Microbial community composition, assessed using PCR-DGGE, differed between sites, community types and plant species, however, the magnitude of variance between sites was dependent on the associated plant species and the community type. Rhizoplane microbial communities associated with I. versicolor, P. natans, and V. spicata shared 8.1%, 19.9% and 23.9% structural similarity between sites. Rhizosphere microbial communities associated with I. versicolor, P. natans, and V. spicata exhibited 33%, 11.2% and 15.6% structural similarity between sampling locations. Functional community characteristics, determined by Biolog (TM) Ecoplate carbon source utilization profiles exhibited by microbial communities from the rhizoplane and rhizosphere, were unique to each site for I. versicolor and P. natans (rhizoplane community only), but not for V. spicata. Assessment of fecal coliforms and fecal indicator microorganisms (Salmonella, Enterococcus and Escherichia coll.) also revealed site-specific differences as well as differences among plant species, most notably the absence of Enterococcus spp. from the rhizosphere of P. natans at both sampling sites. These findings suggest that plant species differ in their ability to recruit root-associated microorganisms, and may be affected differently by variability in environmental conditions, such as site-specific differences in water quality or water chemistry.

AB  - The impacts of fishing activities on ecosystems represent an acknowledged environmental issue, especially considering the increasing demands for the conservation of biodiversity. Submarine canyons are complex environments that can harbor high biodiversity of benthic ecosystems and high biomass of fish species, thus representing preferential fishing areas for bottom trawling fleets. The effects of bottom trawling on the benthic epifauna were investigated over the soft-bottom margins of the Gioia Canyon (Southeastern Tyrrhenian Sea) by means of quantitative analysis of Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) video transects and compared with the recent pattern of trawling intensity, reconstructed through processing of data collected with the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). Four ROV transects were then performed at 320-540 m depth in areas affected by different trawling pressure. The analysis was focused on the bamboo coral Isidella elongate and the sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis, which are considered indicator taxa of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) and relevant in terms of sustainable management priorities. I. elongata only occurred at the two deeper stations, below 400 m depth. This species showed a clear relationship with trawling intensity, since its abundance was significantly higher under low trawling intensity, where coexistence of large (> 20 cm height) and small colonies was observed. The relatively high prevalence of small colonies in areas exposed to higher trawling effort was interpreted as a consequence of the trawling activity that removed the larger colonies. However, the frequent occurrence of dead colonies and the diffuse presence of epibionts (e.g. the anemone Amphianthus dohrnii and the hydroid Clytia linearis) on living colonies indicate stressful conditions for I. elongata even in areas where trawling intensity was lower. Conversely, the relationship between trawling intensity and species abundance was not straightforward for F. quadrangularis; despite the lowest abundance of this species was recorded in areas subject to high trawling intensity, relatively high abundances were observed in areas with intermediate trawling effort. Although such distribution may be driven by other environmental factors, it suggests that vulnerability to bottom trawling can be different for the two species.

AB  - Given the habitat moisture (air humidity or soil moisture) preferences of many forest bryophytes, we explored whether the depth-to-water (DTW) index, derived from remotely sensed Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, was related to the-scale patterns of spatial variation in bryophyte abundance, diversity, and composition. The goal was to assess the utility of the topographic DTW index as a tool to decipher trends in bryophyte assemblages along a site wetness gradient in the boreal mixedwood forest. Discrete Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data were acquired over the entire Ecosystem Management Emulating Natural Disturbance (EMEND) experimental site located in northwestern Alberta, Canada (56 degrees 46' 13 '' N, 118 degrees 22' 28 '' W), based on which we calculated a mathematical index of approximate depth to water at or below the soil surface at 1 m resolution using the Wet-Areas Mapping model. Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) were sampled in permanent sample plots in unmanaged forest stands of varying dominant canopy tree composition. The relationships between DTW and bryophyte cover, richness, diversity, and composition in broadleaf (deciduous)-, mixed, and conifer-dominated boreal forest stands were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models and multivariate analyses. Bryophyte cover was highest in conifer-dominated forest, which occupied the wetter end of the DTW gradient, followed by mixed forest, whereas broadleaf forest, which occupied the drier end of the DTW gradient, had the lowest cover but highest bryophyte diversity. Bryophyte cover in conifer-dominated forests was positively related to site moisture (negatively related to the DTW index). In contrast, bryophyte species richness and diversity were negatively related to site moisture (increased at higher DTW values) in all forest types. DTW explained significant variation in bryophyte species composition in mixed forests, while indicator species analysis identified species with preferences for wet, moist, and dry site conditions in each forest type. Our results corroborate the importance of site moisture as a driver of bryophyte assemblages but, interestingly, there were important differences among forest types, which themselves are distributed across a gradient of site moisture. Our study demonstrates the utility of the topographic DTW index for understanding fine-scale (plot-level) variation in bryophyte assemblages in forested landscapes.

AB  - Continuous excessive application of phosphorus (P) fertilizer and/or manure can lead to P accumulation in soils and progressive saturation of soil P sorption capacities, thus resulting in increased P loss from soil to aquatic ecosystems. Yet the responses of P fractions and sorption characteristics to P fertilization in paddy soil, a special type of arable soil with long periods of waterlogged conditions, are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine the P fractions and its sorption indices in the plow layer of a typical subtropical paddy soil under different fertilization regimes. We selected 15 sites that varied in three fertilization regimes (i.e., chemical fertilizer [CF, n = 6], rice straw [RS, n = 3], and swine manure [SM, n = 6]) with equivalent P input (59 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)) from a long-term field experiment station (initiated in 1981). A sequential fractionation scheme identified that NaOH-extractable inorganic P (NaOH-Pi) was the primary P form in the paddy soil followed by residual P (Pres). The paddy soil that received long-term SM application presented significantly (p < 0.05) higher contents of KCl-extractable P (P-Kq), NaOH-Pi, and total P than the soil that received only CF. In addition, SM significantly increased the proportion of NaOH-Pi, but reduced that of Pres (p < 0.05). In contrast, paddy soil treated with RS incorporation showed a similar allocation of P fractions as in CF treatment. Compared with CF, SM and RS increased the Langmuir P sorption maximum (S,,,) of the paddy soil by 30 and 10%, respectively (p < 0.05). Organic amendments (i.e., SM and RS) significantly increased the contents of amorphous Fe and Al (i.e., oxalate extractable Fe and Al, p < 0.05), and this appeared to contribute mostly to the increased P sorption capacity and variations in P fractions in the paddy soils. Thus, soil P buildup and related environmental assessments need to consider the increment of amorphous Fe and Al in paddy soil due to organic amendments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predictions of change in avian biodiversity often fail to account for the natural dynamism of species assemblages. Information from historical datasets can be useful indicators of how avian communities may change in the future. However, simple comparisons of diversity and abundances over time may overlook additional changes in bird-habitat associations. In 2013, we revisited sites from a unique, highly detailed avian survey from the Willamette Valley, Oregon, conducted in 1952. Our objectives were to quantify and describe the extent of avian community change; relate observed species assemblages to changes in vegetation type and land-use class; and identify species with specific associations to either survey era. Using nonparametric ordination, we assessed whether the distribution of the avian community within the environmental space varied temporally. We used blocked indicator species analysis to identify species with specific association to historical or modern survey eras. Nonparametric permutation procedures identified both plot, each representing a different major habitat type, and year as significant factors defining communities. Year was more strongly related to the second ordination axis than the other environmental variables examined. Ordination of survey sites in species space confirmed modern avian communities were significantly different from their historical counterparts. Bird species richness increased and community composition changed by at least 50% despite the physiognomic characteristics of each plot's habitat and the surrounding landscape remaining comparatively stable. Because of this, we conclude time trumped, or was more strongly associated with community change, than alterations in physiognomic habitat. These results suggest avian communities are naturally dynamic even in areas with relatively stable habitat conditions. Predictions that only address changes in climate, land use, or vegetation cover type may fail to predict changes in avian community composition. Historical datasets are a valuable means of understanding real-world changes in avian communities. We suggest additional factors, such as vegetation structure and microhabitat, may predict fine-scale shifts in avian species assemblages. Nevertheless, major changes in community composition occurred with apparently minor shifts in physiognomic habitat characteristics in our study area.

AB  - The role of aquatic natural organic matter (NOM) in the removal of contaminants of emerging concern has been widely studied. Sulfamerazine (SMR), a sulfonamide antibiotic detected in aquatic environments, is implicated in environmental toxicity and may contribute to the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. In aquatic systems sulfonamides may undergo direct photodegradation, and, indirect photodegradation through the generation of reactive species. Because some forms of NOM inhibit the photodegradation there is an increasing interest in correlating the spectroscopic parameters of NOM as potential indicators of its degradation in natural waters.
   Under the conditions used in this study, SMR hydrolysis was shown to be negligible; however, direct photolysis is a significant in most of the solutions studied. Photodegradation was investigated using standard solutions of NOM: Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM), Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA), Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA), and Aldrich humic acid (AHA). The steady-state concentrations and formation rates of the reactive species and the SMR degradation rate constants (k(1)) were correlated with NOM spectroscopic parameters determined using UV-vis absorption, excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR).
   SMR degradation rate constants (k(1)) were correlated with steady-state concentrations of NOM triplet-excited state ([(NOM)-N-3](ss)) and the corresponding formation rates ((NOM)-N-3*) for SRNOM, SRHA, and AHA. The efficiency of SMR degradation was highest in AHA solution and was inhibited in solutions of SRFA. The steady-state concentrations of singlet oxygen ([O-1(2)](ss)) and the SMR degradation rate constants with singlet oxygen (k(1O2)) were linearly correlated with the total fluorescence and inversely correlated with the carbohydrate/protein content (H-1 NMR) for all forms of NOM. The total fluorescence and EEMs Peak A were confirmed as indicators of O-1(2) formation. Specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) and aromaticity showed potential correlations with the steady-state concentrations of hydroxyl radical ([HO center dot](ss)) and the corresponding formation rates (HO center dot).

AB  - Background: Enantiomers of chiral compounds commonly undergo enantioselective transformation in most biologically mediated processes. As chiral persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are extensively distributed in the environment, differences between enantiomers in biotransformation should be carefully considered to obtain exact enrichment and specific health risks. This review provides an overview of in vivo biotransformation of chiral POPs currently indicated in the Stockholm Convention and their chiral metabolites.
   Methods: Peer-reviewed journal articles focused on the research question were thoroughly searched. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed to identify relevant studies. We mainly compared the results from different animal models under controlled laboratory conditions to show the difference between enantiomers in terms of distinct transformation potential. Interactions with enzymes involved in enantioselective biotransformation, especially cytochrome P450 (CYP), were discussed. Further research areas regarding this issue were proposed.
   Results: Limited evidence for a few POPs has been found in 30 studies. Enantioselective biotransformation of a-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH), chlordane, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), heptachlor, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and toxaphene, has been investigated using laboratory mammal, fish, bird, and worm models. Tissue and excreta distributions, as well as bioaccumulation and elimination kinetics after administration of racemate and pure enantiomers, have been analyzed in these studies. Changes in enantiomeric fractions have been considered as an indicator of enantioselective biotransformation of chiral POPs in most studies. Results of different laboratory animal models revealed that chiral POP biotransformation is seriously affected by chirality. Pronounced results of species-, tissue-, gender-, and individual-dependent differences are observed in in vivo biotransformation of chiral POPs. Enantioselective biotransformation of chiral POPs is dependent on enzyme amounts and activities. However, the role of cytochrome P450 in enantioselective biotransformation has not yet been confirmed.
   Conclusion: Currently available data on biotransformation of chiral POPs provide a preliminary understanding of the fate of chiral compounds in organisms. Further detailed studies of species-dependent biotransformation pathway and molecular mechanism in various animal models should be performed to comprehensively understand chiral POP biotransformation.

AB  - Roads are recognised as having different ecological roles such as barrier, corridor or habitat, but the spatial extent of road effects on plant communities in forests remains unclear. We studied the effect of forest road distance on plant understory diversity at 20 sites in young and adult oak stands in a French lowland forest with a long history of management and road construction. All vascular and bryophyte species were collected at five distances ranging from the road verge to 100 m into the adjacent forest stand. We analysed species composition, individual species response, a priori life-history traits response - life form, habitat preference and dispersal mode - and environmental indicator values in relation to road distance and stand age. Plant composition strongly differed between road verge and forest interior habitats. The main road effect extended less than 5 m into the forest stand. A third habitat was detected at the forest-road edge resulting from the road effect on light and soil conditions, and from edge-specific topography. Non-forest species were almost absent from the forest interior. In contrast, many bryophytes and several vascular plants kept away from the road. We identified a posteriori six species groups that better explained the variability of plant response profiles than a priori life-history traits. Plant response to road distance was also dependent on stand age: some species colonised from the road into the forest interior in young stands following regeneration cutting, while other species displayed the reverse pattern in adult stands once canopy closed above the forest road. Even if the depth of forest road effect measured in lowland managed stands was narrow, building of a new forest road has non-negligible effects on plant population dynamics. Forest managers should take into account the impacts of roads on biodiversity, since the expected intensification of silviculture in response to global changes is set to accentuate the effect of forest roads. We recommend further study on the role of dispersal by vehicles (i.e. agestochory) in road effects. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In eastern Australia, diamonds occur in alluvial deposits overlying Phanerozoic basement. The origin of the diamonds is not known. No feeder pipes of kimberlite or lamproite are known, and none of the usual diamond indicator minerals occurs in association with the diamonds.
   Alluvial diamonds from Wellington, Bingara, Capeton, and Airly Mountain in New South Wales form two distinct groups, here termed A and B. Group A diamonds are similar to those found in kimberlites and lamproites globally and are thought to have formed in Precambrian lithospheric mantle. Group B diamonds have unusual characteristics that indicate the, formed in a subduction environment. Surface features of diamonds of both groups indicate that all were brought to the surface by magmas.
   Group A diamonds are similar in primary crystal form, internal structure, mineral inclusion composition (mainly peridotitic), and carbon isotopes to diamonds found in kimberlitic and lamproitic hosts in Archean arid Proturozoic cratons worldwide. Re/Os ages (3.4 and 2.1 Ga; Pearson et al., 1998) of sulfide inclusions in two Group A diamonds constrain the origin of these diamonds to ancient mantle sources. This, along with the nature of the surface abrasion structures and radiation damage, suggests that the Group A diamonds represent an older group of diamonds that have been in secondary collectors for a significant time. If this is so, it is feasible that the Group A diamonds may have been derived from a number of primary sources, including possible sources in Antarctica.
   Group B diamonds are unlike an other diamond suites worldwide in their combination of shape, surface featured, strained and irregular internal structures, C-13-enrichment, and Ca-rich eclogitic mineral inclusions. The features are best explained as a product of diamond growth under varying P-T conditions in a high P/T dynamic environment such as a subducting slab. The diamonds may well have formed during arc-continent collision at the time of, the development of the New England fold belt. This would explain why the major known concentration of Group B diamonds is within the New England fold belt at Copeton and Bingara, and is consistent with the Phanerozoic ages for diamond emplacement determined from mineral inclusions.

AB  - A catalogue of microbial structural signatures is presented, based upon the coupling of fundamental biogeochemical-microbial processes and local morphogenetic determinants, it summarizes a collection of sedimentary structures obtained from two modern siliciclastic peritidal environments in different climatic zones (temperate humid: Mellum Island, southern North Sea; subtropical arid: coast of southern Tunisia). Textural geometries reveal a high structural diversity, but their determinants are primarily based upon six major parameters: (1) intrinsic biofactors: structural diversification of sedimentary microbial films and mats inherent in the organisms, i.e. their construction morphology, growth, taxis and behaviour, and local abundance of specific morphotypes. Most prominent are the ensheathed filamentous cyanobacteria Microcoleus chthonoplastes and Lyngbya aestuarii, and the sheathless filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria limosa. (2) Biological response to physical. disturbances: sediment supply, erosion and fracturing of surface layers resulting from desiccation cause growth responses of biofilms and microbial mats. (3) Trapping/binding effects: physicobiological. processes give rise to grain orientations and wavy to lenticular lamina, lamina-specific grain arrangements and 'sucrose' calcium carbonate accumulations. (4) Secondary physical deformation of biogenic build-ups: mechanical stresses acting upon sediments overgrown and biostabilized by biofilms and mats produce erosional and overthrust structures. (5) Post-burial processes: textural fabrics that evolve from mechanical effects of gas formation from decaying mate, and features related to the formation of authigenic minerals (calcium carbonates, calcium sulphates, pyrite). (6) Bioturbation and grazing: post-depositional structures, such as Skolithos-type dwellings, traces of burrowing insects, gastropod grazing traces and faecal pellets. In synopsis, the catalogue firstly comprises a sound set of ubiquitous signatures. This uniformity in architectural characteristics is attributed to the presence and local dominance of certain microbes throughout the different settings. The catalogue secondly documents signatures that are extremely sensitive to tidal position, hydrodynamic regime and overall climatic conditions. These. kinds of signature indicate narrow facies zones, which often coincide with the activity or dominance zones of certain organisms. An overview of structures of microbial origin from the fossil record underlines the potential of many of the signatures included in this catalogue to become fossilized and provide strong indicators of former siliciclastic tidal settings.

AB  - In times of climate change, practicing sustainable, climate-resilient, and productive agriculture is of primordial importance. Compost from different resources, now treated as wastes, could be one form of sustainable fertilizer creating a resilience of agriculture to the adverse effects of climate change. However, the safety of the produced compost regarding human pathogens, pharmaceuticals, and related resistance genes must be considered. We have assessed the effect of thermophilic composting of dry toilet contents, green cuttings, and straw, with and without biochar, on fecal indicators, the bacterial community, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Mature compost samples were analyzed regarding fecal indicator organisms, revealing low levels of Escherichia coli that are in line with German regulations for fertilizers. However, one finding of Salmonella spp. exceeded the threshold value. Cultivation of bacteria from the mature compost resulted in 200 isolates with 36.5% of biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) species. The majority is known as opportunistic pathogens that likewise occur in different environments. A quarter of the isolated BSL-2 strains exhibited multiresistance to different classes of antibiotics. Molecular analysis of total DNA before and after composting revealed changes in bacterial community composition and ARGs. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed a decline of the two most abundant phyla Proteobacteria (start: 36-48%, end: 27-30%) and Firmicutes (start: 13-33%, end: 12-16%), whereas the abundance of Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and Planctomycetes rose. Groups containing many human pathogens decreased during composting, like Pseudomonadales, Bacilli with Bacillus spp., or Staphylococcaceae and Enterococcaceae. Gene-specific PCR showed a decline in the number of detectable ARGs from 15 before to 8 after composting. The results reveal the importance of sufficiently high temperatures lasting for a sufficiently long period during the thermophilic phase of composting for reducing Salmonella to levels matching the criteria for fertilizers. However, most severe human pathogens that were targeted by isolation conditions were not detected. Cultivation-independent analyses also indicated a decline in bacterial orders comprising many pathogenic bacteria, as well as a decrease in ARGs. In summary, thermophilic composting could be a promising approach for producing hygienically safe organic fertilizer from ecological sanitation.

AB  - Advances in tag technology now make it possible to monitor the behavior of small groups of individual fish as bioindicators of population wellbeing in commercial aquaculture settings. For example, tags may detect unusual patterns in fish heart rate, which could serve as an early indicator of whether fish health or welfare is becoming compromised. Here, we investigated the use of commercially available heart rate biologgers implanted into 24 Atlantic salmon weighing 3.6 +/- 0.8 kg (mean +/- SD) to monitor fish over 5 months in a standard 12 m x 12 m square sea cage containing similar to 6,000 conspecifics. Post tagging, fish established a diurnal heart rate rhythm within 24 h, which stabilized after 4 days. Whilst the registered tagged fish mortality over the trial period was 0%, only 75% of tagged fish were recaptured at harvest, resulting in an unexplained tag loss rate of 25%. After 5 months, tagged fish were approximately 20% lighter and 8% shorter, but of the similar condition when compared to untagged fish. Distinct diurnal heart rate patterns were observed and changed with seasonal day length of natural illumination. Fish exhibited lower heart rates at night [winter 39 +/- 0.2 beats per min (bpm), spring 37 +/- 0.2 bpm, summer 43 +/- 0.3 bpm, mean +/- SE] than during the day (winter 50 +/- 0.3 bpm, spring 48 +/- 0.2 bpm, summer 49 +/- 0.2 bpm) with the difference between night and day heart rates near half during the summer (6 bpm) compared to winter and spring (both 11 bpm). When fish experienced moderate and severe crowding events in early summer, the highest hourly heart rates reached 60 +/- 2.5 bpm and 72 +/- 2.4 bpm, respectively, on the day of crowding. Here, if the negative sublethal effects on fish that carry tags (e.g., growth rate) can be substantially reduced, the ability to monitor diurnal heart rate patterns across seasons and detect changes during crowding events, and using heart rate biologgers could be a useful warning mechanism for detecting sudden changes in fish behavior in sea cages.

AB  - Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is the main constituent of dissolved organic matter (DOM), also a key indicator of water quality conditions. Accurate estimation of CDOM is essential for understanding biogeochemical processes and ecosystems in marine waters. The use of remote sensing to derive the changes in CDOM is vital technology that can be used to dynamically monitor the marine environment and to document the spatiotemporal variations in CDOM over a large scale. In the present study, we develop a simple approach to estimate the CDOM concentrations based on the in situ datasets from four cruise surveys over the Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS). Eight band combination forms (using Xi as a delegate, where i denotes the numerical order of band combination forms), including single bands, band ratios, and other band combinations by remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), were trained to test the correlations with the CDOM concentrations. The obtained results indicated that X7, i.e., [R-rs(443) + R-rs(555)]/[R-rs(443)/R-rs(555)], was the optimal form, with correlation coefficient (R) values of 0.904 (p < 0.001). The X7-based fitting model was determined as the optimal model by the leave-one-out cross-validation method with relatively low estimation errors (mean relative error, MRE, 20%), and satellite match-up validation with in situ measurements indicated good performance MRE = 20.3%). Moreover, two spatial distribution patterns of CDOM in Jan. 2017 and Apr. 2018 (independent data) retrieved from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data agreed well with those in situ observations. These results indicate that our proposed algorithm is feasible and robust for retrieving CDOM concentrations in this study region. In addition, we applied this method to GOCI data for the whole 2016 year in the BS and YS and produced the spatial distribution patterns from different temporal scales including monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. Overall, the findings of this study motivate the development and application of a simple but effective method of the CDOM estimation for those optically complex turbid coastal waters, like this study water areas.

AB  - Soil quality is defined as the capacity of the soil to perform multiple functions, and can be assessed by measuring soil chemical, physical and biological parameters. Among soil parameters, labile organic carbon is considered to have a primary role in many soil functions related to productivity and environmental resilience. Our study aimed at assessing the suitability of different labile carbon fractions, namely dissolved organic carbon (DOC), hydrophilic DOC (Hy-DOC), permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC, also referred to as Active Carbon), hot water extractable carbon (HWEC) and particulate organic matter carbon (POMC) as soil quality indicators in agricultural systems. To do so, we tested their sensitivity to two agricultural management factors (tillage and organic matter input) in 10 European long-term field experiments (LTEs), and we assessed the correlation of the different labile carbon fractions with physical, chemical and biological soil quality indicators linked to soil functions. We found that reduced tillage and high organic matter input increase concentrations of labile carbon fractions in soil compared to conventional tillage and low organic matter addition, respectively. POXC and POMC were the most sensitive fractions to both tillage and fertilization across the 10 European LTEs. In addition, POXC was the labile carbon fraction most positively correlated with soil chemical (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and cation exchange capacity), physical (water stable aggregates, water holding capacity, bulk density) and biological soil quality indicators (microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and soil respiration).
   We conclude that POXC represents a labile carbon fraction sensitive to soil management and that is the most informative about total soil organic matter, nutrients, soil structure, and microbial pools and activity, parameters commonly used as indicators of various soil functions, such as C sequestration, nutrient cycling, soil structure formation and soil as a habitat for biodiversity. Moreover, POXC measurement is relatively cheap, fast and easy. Therefore, we suggest measuring POXC as the labile carbon fraction in soil quality assessment schemes in addition to other valuable soil quality indicators.

AB  - The turnover rate of labile organic fractions varies continuously due to different soil uses and managements, weather conditions and sampling time. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of different agricultural management, season and soil type on soil organic carbon (SOC) and its different fractions. The study was conducted on four sites located in the Argentinean Pampas. In each site, three treatments were defined: Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Poor Agricultural Practices (PAP) and Natural Environment (NE). During two consecutive years (2010 and 2011) and at two different times (February and September) undisturbed soil samples were taken at 0-20 cm depth. Variables assessed included: SOC and its organic fractions: coarse (POCc) and fine (POCf) particulate organic carbon, SOC associated with a mineral fraction (MOC), total (CHt) and soluble (CHs) carbohydrates, bulk density (BD), and large pores (P->30). Also, indices associated with soil and management variables were determined. SOC reductions caused by agricultural practices were mainly from POCc. This fraction represented 34-52% and 50-74% for PAP and GAP, respectively, of the observed in NE. The carbon pool index (CPI) shows that agricultural treatments induced greater variations in all the labile organic fractions compared with SOC and MOC. In turn, the magnitude of variability was different among fractions, where temporal fluctuations increased according to the following order MOC < SOC < POCf <= CHt < CHs <= POCc. Independently of the soil type, the CPI was a sensitive indicator of soil quality in these systems under no-tillage. The multivariate analysis has proven to be an efficient analytical methodology for the identification of soil indicators that respond to agricultural practices, in which chemical properties (POCf and CHt), physical (BD and P->30), and indices (SOC: clay, structural index and intensification sequence index) were the variables that best explained the total variance of information of the four sites. Therefore, these indicators/indices should be included in any minimum data set for evaluating the agricultural soil quality under no-tillage in the studied area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - By the means of Land Consolidation is understood, in accord with law No. 139/2002 Coll., spending of funds on land consolidations and land offices, provided the accessibility of grounds in public interest. Land consolidations also ensure the conditions for improvement of the ecosystem, protection and reclamation of land resources, waterway management and the increase of the ecological stability of landscape. All mentioned measures are collectively called the Common Measures, rural roads being one of the most significant of these measures as far as the ground accessibility is concerned. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and the Central Land Office (MZe, UPU) statistics, for instance in 2008, over 707.4 million CZK was spent on the common measures projects from the public funds. Of this sum, 82 per cent was spent on financing of the land accessibility projects - rural roads and objects on them. The Cost & Benefit Analysis (CBA) method was applied. The analysis explains step by step what benefits the investment projects bring and to whom, as well as what and from whom it takes something away. Thus defined effects and impacts are aggregated, converted into financial flows and included in the calculation of criteria indicators. These calculations enable to make decision whether the concerned project is in its consequences generally contributive. There is a difficulty in the method - it is applied ex-ante, which usually leads to the exaggerated input parameters, which may be significantly affected by a number of variable effects (time factor, socio-economic impacts, inflation rate, etc.). The ex-post application of the method cannot be objectively used due to the absence of the statistically processed input data for the analysis. Such data must be collected during the operational period of the realized investments. This is caused by the fact that these analyses consider lifetime of these investments in terms of 25-30 years. The UPU statistics, however, say that the operational period of most of realized common measures has not reached one half of their lifetime yet. The ex-ante analysis enables to evaluate the possible difficulty and the general benefit of projects, including their impact on the broad spectrum of subjects.

AB  - Regional-scale databases can be particularly useful for identifying relationships between dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N) leaching in forests and environmental drivers, which in turn allow an assessment of the risk of ecosystem damage, such as forest acidification and eutrophication of downstream water bodies. However, detecting the 'signal' of a significant correlate to N leaching against a background of wide variability in other factors requires a large number of sites, and the validation of models developed requires a similarly large number of independent sites. Here we use two large and fully independent databases of forest ecosystems across Europe to develop and validate indicators of N saturation and leaching. One database was used for model development and the other for validating these models.
   Among 35 variables considered, the most significant indicators of N leaching in the model development database were: the flux of dissolved inorganic N in deposition, mean annual temperature, mean altitude, the site drainage (plot vs catchment), needle- and litter-N concentration, organic horizon C:N ratio, and subsoil pH. Altitude was not a consistent predictor (it was significant in the development database but not in the validation database), and needle and litter N concentration, plot vs catchment, and subsoil pH an showed high intercorrelation with N deposition and so were not significant in models already including N deposition. The most consistent and useful indicators of N leaching were throughfall N deposition, organic horizon C:N ratio and mean annual temperature. Sites receiving low levels of N deposition (<8 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) showed very low output fluxes of N and were simulated separately from more polluted forests. In general, the models successfully predicted N leaching (mean of +/- 5 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) between observed and predicted) from forests at early to intermediate stages of nitrogen saturation but not from nitrogen-saturated sites. Thus, simple relationships developed from combining (1) external drivers (deposition, temperature) and (2) site conditions (nitrogen status of soils) can successfully estimate nitrogen leaching from forests that have not yet been highly damaged by N deposition.

AB  - Rangelands, produced by grazing herbivores, are important for a variety of agricultural, hunting, recreation and conservation objectives world-wide. Typically, there is little quantitative evidence regarding the magnitude of the grazing impact of different herbivores on rangeland habitats to inform their management.
   We quantified the grazing and trampling impact of sheep, cattle, red deer Cervus elaphus, rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, mountain hares Lepus timidus and red grouse Lagopus lagopus on open-hill habitats in 11 areas of upland Scotland. The degradation of heather in upland Scotland Calluna vulgaris-dominated habitats, of conservation significance at a European scale, has been attributed, anecdotally, to increasing sheep and red deer populations.
   Field indicators of habitat condition were used to generate a five-point scale of impact in vegetation polygons of seven habitats. The presence of each herbivore species was attributed on the basis of 'signs' of occupancy. A Bayesian regression model was used to analyse the association of herbivore species with grazing impact on plant communities, controlling for environmental attributes.
   Overall the presence of sheep was associated with the largest increase (7/11 areas) in grazing and trampling impact of all herbivores. Cattle had the second largest impact but generally this was restricted to fewer areas and habitats than sheep. In contrast, impacts associated with wild herbivores tended to be small and only significant locally.
   Although red deer presence was associated with a significantly lower impact than sheep, this impact increased with increasing deer density at both land-ownership and regional scales. For sheep there was little or no evidence of density dependence.
   Synthesis and applications. The higher impact associated with sheep presence probably reflects their greater aggregation because of their limited ranging behaviour, exacerbated by sheep being herded in places convenient for land managers. Consequently, future reductions in sheep numbers as a result of reform of European Union farming policies may limit the extent of their impact, but not necessarily the local magnitude. However, reductions in sheep stocks may lead to increases in deer densities, with greater impact, particularly in heather-dominated habitats. Where habitat conservation is a priority this may well require a reduction in deer numbers.

AB  - Pinus svlvestris var mongolica is a main tree species of the farmland shelter-belt and environmental protection system in the arid region of Northeast China. However, water resource in Shenyang city, Liaoning Province is much short-handed, soil moisture cannot satisfy the water requirements of P. mongolica growth under local natural conditions, more and more trees are being planted which needed to be irrigated, thus studying the transpiration characteristics of such tree species and its relationship with the meteorological factors and growth parameters is very important to the survival of trees in this region. On this background we took a research on the transpiration of indigenous P. mongolica tree species, while simultaneously monitoring the atmospheric and soil moisture contents. In this study, the sap flow rate (J(s)) of selected three 5a of P. mongolica tree samples were measured during 11th May to 15th October in 2019 by using the stem heat balance technique. Finally, we got results as follows: In the whole growing season, P. mongolica consumed water of 953.5 L (average value). Diurnal variation of J(s) fluctuation was transitionally changing in the growing season, adjusting to its way of water consumption. J(s) of P. mongolica tree species varied greatly under different weather, J(s) in rainy days were rather slow both in day and night, which reflect that the dynamic of water absorption diverse in the three trees. The vertical distribution of soil moisture content was observed throughout the whole growing season. In the 0.3-0.4 m soil layer contributed to most of the plant transpiration as the highest coefficient of determination at this layer. The variation in J(s) of P. mongolica could be described by a multiple linear regression against the meteorological variables. The Kendall's tau analysis indicated air temperature (T-a), solar radiation (R-n), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) had great influence on sap flow of P. mongolica. To sum up, in the studied district afforestation was limited to T-a, R-n, VPD and top soil moisture factors.

AB  - Cereal grains provide half of the calories consumed by humans. In addition, they contain important compounds beneficial for health. During the last years, a broad spectrum of new cereal grain-derived products for dietary purposes emerged on the global food market. Special breeding programs aimed at cultivars utilizable for these new products have been launched for both the main sources of staple foods (such as rice, wheat, and maize) and other cereal crops (oat, barley, sorghum, millet, etc.). The breeding paradigm has been switched from traditional grain quality indicators (for example, high breadmaking quality and protein content for common wheat or content of protein, lysine, and starch for barley and oat) to more specialized ones (high content of bioactive compounds, vitamins, dietary fibers, and oils, etc.). To enrich cereal grain with functional components while growing plants in contrast to the post-harvesting improvement of staple foods with natural and synthetic additives, the new breeding programs need a source of genes for the improvement of the content of health benefit components in grain. The current review aims to consider current trends and achievements in wheat, barley, and oat breeding for health-benefiting components. The sources of these valuable genes are plant genetic resources deposited in genebanks: landraces, rare crop species, or even wild relatives of cultivated plants. Traditional plant breeding approaches supplemented with marker-assisted selection and genetic editing, as well as high-throughput chemotyping techniques, are exploited to speed up the breeding for the desired genotx443;pes. Biochemical and genetic bases for the enrichment of the grain of modern cereal crop cultivars with micronutrients, oils, phenolics, and other compounds are discussed, and certain cases of contributions to special health-improving diets are summarized. Correlations between the content of certain bioactive compounds and the resistance to diseases or tolerance to certain abiotic stressors suggest that breeding programs aimed at raising the levels of health-benefiting components in cereal grain might at the same time match the task of developing cultivars adapted to unfavorable environmental conditions.

AB  - Studies of communities of ground beetles (Carabidae) and black beetles (Tenebrionidae) were conducted in central Kazakhstan along 70 degrees E in typical, dry, and desert steppe subzones in 1976-1978 and 2018. Parallel to that, soil-cover studies were conducted and the climate indicators of the studied areas were compared. Despite a considerable change in climate over 50 years, which has been expressed in a rise in temperatures with a simultaneous increase in precipitation, the basic features of soils have not undergone essential changes, but they keep or get strong potentials for solonetz and solonchak elementary soil processes, which are capable of drastically changing the structure of the soil cover. The generality of local fauna of carabids in 1976-1978 was 48-62% and, at the beginning of 21st century, it decreased to 16% in dry steppe and to 7% in desert steppe. In tenebrionids, which are more adapted to aridity, the faunal similarity decreased from 70-75 to 37% in the typical steppe and increased to 87% in the dry steppe. There are more "southern" subarid species in the communities and fewer relatively "northern" boreal and polyzonal species, which disappear completely in dry and desert steppes. The Tencar index that expresses the ratio of the number of individuals and species of arid tenebrionids and more humic carabids is used as an integral zoo indicator of changes in aridity of the environment. In the typical steppe, the index values are low and change little in the long-term dynamics and along the catena. However, in the dry steppe, Tencar index values increased 5 times in 2018 when compared to the middle of the 20th century and in desert steppe they grew by two orders of magnitude. The trigger for changes in the composition and structure of local communities of carabids and tenebrionids is not a change in atmospheric humidity, but a rise in average annual temperatures, which exceeded the global trend values and activated the salinization of soils, creating the conditions for the desertification of the territory and biota.

AB  - Diatoms are useful ecological and paleolimnological indicators routinely used to reconstruct past conditions and monitor environmental change. Despite this, diatom assemblages from lake sediment cores are often difficult to interpret due to a limited knowledge of the ecology of some species, some of which may originate from the adjacent limno-terrestrial landscape. Here, we compare diatom assemblages from two recently published Antarctic lake sediment cores collected from the northeast and southwest sides of Vega Island, Antarctic Peninsula. We further compare the sediment core assemblages with adjacent modern communities inhabiting four different limno-terrestrial habitat types to gauge the importance of landscape connectivity in determining paleo-assemblage structure. We found that diatom assemblage composition was significantly different between the two cores, and our survey of modern habitats further revealed habitat type to be an important factor determining the composition of limno-terrestrial samples. Differences in modern habitats were driven primarily by Chamaepinnularia krookiformis in mosses, Nitzschia paleacea in ponds, and Fistulifera pelliculosa in streams. When modern communities were compared with paleo-assemblages through ordination, the cored lake from the northeast side, which exhibited greater hydrological connectivity with its surroundings, clustered more closely with the adjacent modern samples. Meanwhile, the cored lake from the southwest side, which was more hydrologically isolated, formed a distinct cluster separate from the others. Overall, species richness and diversity were greater on the southwest side of the island than the northeast, and the known distributions of diatom taxa supported the notion that Vega Island was a transitional zone between the Maritime and Continental Antarctic bioregions. These results collectively suggested that while environmental and spatial controls may be influential in determining diatom community composition, the unique hydrogeological setting of individual waterbodies was an important consideration for determining the assemblage structure of lake cores. This paper furthermore expanded ongoing research of diatom diversity and distributions on maritime Antarctic islands, which will improve diatom-based interpretations for regional ecological monitoring and paleolimnology in the future.

AB  - Relevance of the work is caused by the need to assess the impact of natural and technogenic environmental factors affecting the quality of atmospheric air, soil and vegetation as well as the health of the population in urban areas. Deflation or wind erosion is soil destruction under the influence of wind. The territories in the south of Western and Eastern Siberia, the Far East, located in the valleys of large rivers, as well as in agricultural steppe regions, are especially affected by it. Winds during the periods without precipitation, dry sandy deposits along river banks, wind-impact slopes, soils of light particle size distribution, gently sloping terrain, creating conditions for unhindered movement of air flows, contribute to wind erosion. It can be local in nature, in a more active form of dust storms cause great harm to the economy.
   The aim of the research is to evaluate the role of atmospheric dust pollution in urban areas by studying the elemental composition of micro-sized particles using poplar leaves as a biogeochemical tablet.
   The methods. The elemental composition of ash samples of balsamic poplar leaves (Populus balsamifera L.) was studied by instrumental neutron activation analysis, ICP-MS and -AES; the elemental composition of micro-sized particles on the leaf surface - at a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope using a Bruker XFlash 4010 energy dispersive spectrometer; data processing was carried out using of the multivariate statistical methods.
   The results. The paper presents the results of the study of mineral dust from surface air, accumulated on the surface of poplar leaves. A significant contribution to the distribution of rare-earth elements on the territory of settlements located on the banks of the Ob River (Kolpashevo, Kargasok, Strezhevoy; Lake Baikal (Ust-Barguzin and Severobaykalsk), Amur River (Blagoveshchensk, Khabarovsk, Komsomolsk-on-Amur) makes a dust transfer as a result of deflation in the directions of the prevailing winds. Using the indicator Zr/Ce ratio, urbanized areas with active wind erosion were determined. Mineral particles of light and heavy rare earth elements, mainly phosphates (monazite and xenotime), as well as zircons, were found.

AB  - Sandy beaches are the most frequented coastal environments in the world, and they consequently suffer different types of impacts due to the rapid urban occupation and demographic growth in coastal regions, which generate stressful conditions for the resident species and reduce the environmental quality of the beaches for resident species. Crustaceans can be used as reliable bioindicators of human stress, and the amphipod Atlantorchestoidea brasiliensis and the decapod Emerita brasiliensis are highlighted. One tool for evaluating the environmental quality and the instability of individual development is fluctuating asymmetry (FA), which measures small, random deviations from a perfect bilateral symmetry. To evaluate the environmental quality of the beaches, some indices have been developed in recent years; among the most used are the conservation, recreation and urbanization indices, which offer easy-to-use metric for decision makers. This study aimed to quantify and compare the levels of FA in the populations of A. brasliiensis and E. brasiliensis on 14 beaches in Rio de Janeiro State with different levels of urbanization and conservation. For each species, two individual indices and two composite indices of asymmetry were calculated and tested in four bilateral traits. The urbanization, recreation and conservation indices were used to assess environmental quality of the sandy beaches. The results of the present study indicate a complex spatial distribution of FA in relation to the indices of the environmental quality of the beaches. The beaches that obtained the highest values in the conservation index obtained the lowest values of FA for both species. The beaches located in the Metropolitan region, specifically in the city of Rio de Janeiro, generally presented the highest levels of FA for both species. These species are susceptible to different forms of impacts due to their distinct characteristics in feeding behavior, development mode and beach zone occurrence. A. brasiliensis is more susceptible to direct impacts on the beach, such as recreational activities, while E. brasiliensis is more sensitive to impacts on water (contamination and physicochemical changes). Our results indicate that fluctuating asymmetry can be used as a good tool to evaluate impacts on sandy beaches, but additional studies should be conducted to improve the understanding of the spatial distribution of FA on sandy beaches.

AB  - We investigated the ecology of testate amoebae (TA) in a coastal tropical peatland to evaluate their potential as environmental indicators in these ecosystems. At 10 positions in five locations in a transect running into the peatland away from the coast, we measured pore-water pH, pore-water electrical conductivity, soil moisture content (MC), and water-table depth (WTD). The WTD data were collected using dipwells fitted with self-recording pressure transducers that logged at 10-min intervals over a 25-day period. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that hydrological metrics (WTD and MC) were the strongest environmental controls on TA (p < 0.001) in this site, corroborating the single previous study from western Amazonia. Changes in pH and electrical conductivity, reflecting marine influence, were also significant, but less so (p < 0.05; p < 0.01 respectively). Transfer functions for WTD and MC were developed using weighted averaging partial least-squares regression, and were found to perform well under leave-one-out' cross validation (R-2 = 0.80, RMSEP = 4.64 cm; R-2 = 0.89; RMSEP = 1.57 cm). Our results clarify the autecology of several taxa found in tropical peatlands. Centropyxis aculeata is an unambiguous indicator of surface water, Hyalosphenia subflava "minor" (< 60 mu m length) is a dry indicator, whereas Hyalosphenia subflava "major" (> 60 mu m length) lives in wetter conditions. The difference in habitat preference of the two forms of Hyalosphenia subfiava suggests that this taxon is most probably a species complex. We use the new high-quality dataset to test an existing transfer function from western Amazonia: the results show that the previous model has good predictive power for-reconstructing past WTDs in tropical peatlands (r = 0.87; p < 0.005). The reconstruction of sea-level change from tropical coastal wetlands may prove problematic because the key indicators of marine influence, reflected in pH and electrical conductivity, are taxa with weak idiosomic tests that do not preserve readily in the peat archive (e.g. Tracheleuglypha dentata, Trinema lineare). Our work shows the potential of using high-quality hydrological measurements for increasing the precision of transfer function models.

AB  - Sea level is an essential climate variable (ECV) that has a direct effect on many people through inundations of coastal areas, and it is also a clear indicator of climate changes due to external forcing factors and internal climate variability. Regional patterns of sea level change inform us on ocean circulation variations in response to natural climate modes such as El Nino and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and anthropogenic forcing. Comparing numerical climate models to a consistent set of observations enables us to assess the performance of these models and help us to understand and predict these phenomena, and thereby alleviate some of the environmental conditions associated with them. All such studies rely on the existence of long-term consistent high-accuracy datasets of sea level. The Climate Change Initiative (CCI) of the European Space Agency was established in 2010 to provide improved time series of some ECVs, including sea level, with the purpose of providing such data openly to all to enable the widest possible utilisation of such data. Now in its second phase, the Sea Level CCI project (SL_cci) merges data from nine different altimeter missions in a clear, consistent and well-documented manner, selecting the most appropriate satellite orbits and geophysical corrections in order to further reduce the error budget. This paper summarises the corrections required, the provenance of corrections and the evaluation of options that have been adopted for the recently released v2.0 dataset (https://doi.org/10.5270/esa-sea_level_cci-1993_2015-v_2.0-201612). This information enables scientists and other users to clearly understand which corrections have been applied and their effects on the sea level dataset. The overall result of these changes is that the rate of rise of global mean sea level (GMSL) still equates to similar to 3.2mmyr(-1) during 1992-2015, but there is now greater confidence in this result as the errors associated with several of the corrections have been reduced. Compared with v1.1 of the SL_cci dataset, the new rate of change is 0.2mm yr(-1) less during 1993 to 2001 and 0.2 mm yr(-1) higher during 2002 to 2014. Application of new correction models brought a reduction of altimeter crossover variances for most corrections.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) management remains a challenge, even in Europe where several countries now possess capacity to treat all arising MSW, while others still rely on unsustainable disposal pathways. In the former, strategies to reach higher recycling levels are affecting existing waste-to-energy (WtE) treatment infrastructure, by inducing additional overcapacity and this in turn rebounds as pressure on the waste and recyclable materials markets. This study addresses such situations by documenting the effects, in terms of resource recovery, global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED), of a transition from a self-sufficient waste management system based on minimal separate collection and efficient WtE, towards a system with extended separate collection of recyclable materials and biowaste. In doing so, it tackles key questions: (1) whether recycling and biological treatment are environmentally better compared to highly efficient WtE, and (2) what are the implications of overcapacity-related cascading effects, namely waste import, when included in the comparison of alternative waste management systems. System changes, such as the implementation of kerbside separate collection of recyclable materials were found to significantly increase material recovery, besides leading to substantial GWP and CED savings in comparison to the WtE-based system. Bio-waste separate collection contributed with additional savings when co-digested with manure, and even more significantly when considering future renewable energy background systems reflecting the benefits induced by the flexible use of biogas. Given the current liberalization of trade in combustible waste in Europe, waste landfilling was identified as a short-to-medium-term European-wide waste management marginal reacting to overcapacity effects induced by the implementation of increased recycling strategies. When waste import and, consequently, avoided landfilling were included in the system boundary, additional savings of up to 700 kg CO2 eq. and 16 GJ eq. of primary energy per tonne of imported waste were established. Conditions, such as energy recovery efficiency, and thresholds beyond which import-related savings potentially turn into GWP burdens were also determined. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries have traditionally received less research effort than large-scale fisheries and are generally under-studied in Europe. In spite of their comparatively low volume of catches and economic importance, small-scale fisheries are socially important and an integral part of the European coastal zone. Considering the high heterogeneity of situations and the paucity of quantitative data, we used an analytical methodology based on the comparative method. We carried out an analysis of small-scale fisheries (SSFs) in Europe based on a selection of nine case studies. Our objective was to obtain a comprehensive description of small-scale fleets covering different areas/fisheries/species, encompassing the diversity and specific conditions under which SSFs operate, in order to demonstrate the ecological and social sustainability of this often overlooked fisheries segment. A common approach formulated so that the case studies could be compared with the case histories of other competing users, required that for each set of criteria - technical, biological, socio-economic, and institutional - a set of relevant items and indicators was established. An analysis of characteristics common to the selected case studies is conducted and an attempt made to extend our comparisons to the whole of the European Union. Our results show that (as compared with large-scale fleets, their main competitor) small-scale fleets: (i) are composed of smaller vessels and, consequently, travel lower distances to fishing grounds, and are more reliant on coastal areas; (ii) have smaller crews (although the global employment figure is similar to that of large-scale fleets in Europe); (iii) use mostly, but not exclusively, passive gears; (iv) use multi-purpose fishing approaches, and can change the fish species they target during the year; (v) have lower extraction rates; (vi) have lower total capital investments (including fishing rights), turnover and costs; and (vii) have lower fuel consumption, making them less sensitive to changing oil prices. Dependence on subsidies is lower (viii). Involvement in fisheries management is variable, conservation and access regulation measures are largely local in origin. For the selected case studies, the most significant competitors are large-scale fleets, and recreational fisheries, but other sources of interaction (water quality, invasive species, etc.) cannot be ignored.

AB  - Organophosphate herbicides are among the most dangerous agrochemicals for the aquatic environment. In this context. Roundup (R), a glyphosate-based herbicide, has been widely detected in natural water bodies, representing a potential threat to non-target organisms, namely fish. Thus, the main goal of the present study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of Roundup (R) in the teleost fish Anguilla anguilla, addressing the possible causative involvement of oxidative stress. Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of this herbicide (58 and 116 mu g L-1) during one or three clays. The standard procedure of the comet assay was applied to gill and liver cells in order to determine organ-specific genetic damage. Since liver is a central organ in xenobiotic metabolism, nucleoids of hepatic cells were also incubated with a lesion-specific repair enzyme (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase - FPG), in order to recognise oxidised purines. Antioxidants were determined in both organs as indicators of pro-oxidant state. In general, both organs displayed an increase in DNA damage for the two Roundup (R) concentrations and exposure times, although liver showed to be less susceptible to the lower concentration. The enzyme-modified comet assay showed the occurrence of FPG-sensitive sites in liver only after a 3-day exposure to the higher Roundup (R) concentration. The antioxidant defences were in general unresponsive, despite a single increment of catalase activity in gills (116 mu L-1, 3-day) and a decrease of superoxide dismutase activity in liver (58 mu g L-1 3-day). Overall, the mechanisms involved in Roundup (R)-induced DNA strand-breaks showed to be similar in both organs. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the type of DNA damage varies with the concentration and exposure duration. Hence, after 1-day exposure, an increase on pro-oxidant state is not a necessary condition for the induction of DNA-damaging effects of Roundup (R). By increasing the duration of exposure to three days, ROS-depenclent processes gained preponderance as a mechanism of DNA-damage induction in the higher concentration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals in the environment (PIE) are of importance since these compounds are designed to affect biological receptors/enzymes that are often conserved across vertebrate families. Across-species extrapolation of these therapeutic targets suggests potential for impacting amphibia and fish in the aquatic environment. Due to the scarcity of relevant ecotoxicological data, the long-tem impact of PIE remains a research question. Efficient use of mammalian data has been proposed to better understand and predict the potential for a given pharmaceutical to impact the environment. Using a model cardiovascular pharmaceutical (propranolol, a non-specific beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenergic antagonist), the hypothesis that mammalian data can be used to predict toxicity in fish was tested. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum)) have beta-adrenergic signalling mechanisms analogous to human cardiovascular receptors that respond to pharmacological doses of agonists and antagonists. Trout absorbed propranolol from water such that after 40 days of exposure, the linear relationship was [plasma] = 0.59[water] (it = 31, r = 0.96). Growth rate was affected only at very high aqueous concentrations (10-day (NOEC)-N-growth = 1.0 and (LOEC)-L-growth = 10 mg/l). Growth recovered with time (40-day (NOEC)-N-growth = 10 mg/l), suggesting possible adaptation to the pharmaceutical, although the internal plasma concentration in trout exposed to 10 mg propranolol/l of water was higher than the mammalian therapeutic plasma concentration. Additional endpoints suggested subtle changes of liver and heart size at much lower concentrations may have occurred, although these were not concentration-related. There was, however, a dose-dependent effect upon overall body condition. The trout plasma concentrations at these effective aqueous concentrations fell within the range of mammalian effective plasma concentrations, supporting the potential for developing 'read-across' from mammalian pharmacology safety data to fish ecotoxicology. Despite these effects at relatively high concentrations, propranolol is not expected to pose a risk to fish at the concentrations considered to be present in the aquatic environment.

AB  - We described seasonal fish-assemblages in an estuarine marsh fringing Matagorda Bay, Gulf of Mexico. Habitat zones were identified by patterns of fish species abundance and indicator species optima along gradients in salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and depth in our samples. Indicators of the lower brackish zone (lower lake and tidal bayou closest to the bay) were gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) at salinity > 15 parts per thousand, DO 7-10 mg 1(-1), and depth < 0.5 m. Indicators of the upper brackish zone (lake and fringing salt marsh) were pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides) and spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) at salinity 10-20<parts per thousand>, DO > 10 mg 1(-1), and depth < 0.5 m. In the freshwater wetland zone (diked wetland, ephemeral pool, and perennial scour pool), indicators were sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus), rainwater killifish (Lucania parva), mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), and sailfin molly (Poecilia latipinna) at salinity < 5 parts per thousand, DO < 5 mg 1(-1), and depth <greater than or equal to> 1 m. In the freshwater channelized zone (slough and irrigation canal), indicators were three sunfish species (Lepomis), white crappie (Pomoxis annularis), and gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) at salinity < 5<parts per thousand>. DO < 5 mg 1(-1), and depth > 1.5 m. In brackish zones, seasonal variation in species diversity among sites was positively correlated with temperature, but assemblage structure also was influenced by depth and DO. In the freshwater zones, seasonal variation in species diversity among sites was positively correlated with depth, DO, and salinity, but assemblage structure was weakly associated with temperature. Species diversity and assemblage structure were strongly affected by the connectivity between freshwater wetland and brackish zones. Uncommon species in diked wetlands, such as tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) and fat sleeper (Dormitator maculatus), indicated movement of fishes from the brackish zone as the water level rose during natural flooding and scheduled (July) releases from the diked wetland. From September to July, diversity in the freshwater wetland zone decreased as receding waters left small isolated pools, and fish movement became blocked by a water-control structure. Subsequently, diversity was reduced to a few species with opportunistic life histories and tolerance to anoxic conditions that developed as flooded vegetation decayed.

AB  - We examined the effects of light intensity on the metabolism, antioxidant enzymes, and expression of related genes in Haliotis discus hannai Ino, to determine the optimal lighting conditions for aquaculture of these animals. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was significantly lower after 48 h in animals exposed to light intensities of 30 and 60 mu mol/m(2)/s, while lactate dehydrogenase activity and lactic acid content at 96 h were significantly higher compared with animals in the dark or exposed to 5 or 15 mu mol/m(2)/s (both P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents between animals in the dark and those exposed to 5 or 15 mu mol/m(2)/s (P > 0.05) throughout the experiment. However, ROS contents under light intensities of 30 and 60 mu mol/m(2)/s peaked at 12 h, when expression levels of genes encoding catalase (CAT), thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX), sigma-glutathione-s-transferase (GST(S)), and mu-glutathione-s-transferase (GST(m)) also began to increase, and CAT and glutathione peroxidase (GP(X)) activities were significantly higher than in animals in the dark or exposed to 5 or 15 mu mol/m(2)/s (P < 0.05). After a further 12 h, the ROS content at 30 mu mol/m(2)/s began to decrease, and GPX activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content also gradually decreased, followed by increases in ROS and MDA 48 h later, to reach respective peaks at 96 h. Gene expression levels of TPX, GST(S), GST(m), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and CAT began to decrease 72 h later, suggesting that excessive accumulation of ROS may have caused oxidative damage to the tissues. At a light intensity of 60 mu mol/m(2)/s, expression levels of TPX, GST(S), GST(m), and HSP70 genes, total antioxidant capacity, and GP(X) activity peaked at 48 h, and the ROS content was significantly higher than in any other group 48 h later (P < 0.05). However, gene expression levels of TPX, GST(S), GST(m), HSP70, HSP90, and CAT, and reduced glutathione content began to decrease, indicating that the antioxidant system had been unable to perform its normal physiological functions to withstand the long-term stress of adverse environmental factors. These results suggest that the light intensity should be controlled at 5-15 mu mol/m(2)/s during H. discus hannai aquaculture, to maintain the organism's normal physiological metabolism.
   Statement of relevance: The disc abalone Haliotis discus hannai is an economically important shellfish in China, with demand growing for this high-protein and low-fat seafood. In 2014, 11,5397 tons of H. discus hannai were harvested from aquacultural sources, but supply cannot currently meet consumer demand. In recent years, the natural habitat of H. discus hannai has declined as a result of overfishing, marine reclamation, water pollution, among others, leading to a sharp decrease in the numbers of H. discus hannai in the wild. Thus, the development of an aquacultural system for farming H. discus hannai, as well as for its protection in the wild, are a focus of current research.
   Light, including photoperiod, quality and intensity, is one of the key environmental factors influencing the growth, culture and survival of aquatic organisms. Over evolutionary time, organisms have evolved both physiological and behavioral mechanisms that enable them to adapt to diurnal fluctuations in light. In Chinese traditional abalone aquaculture, a sunshade net is usually used because of the photophobic nature of abalone. In particular, the aquaculturist usually provides a darkened setting for adult abalones to increase their food intake rate, facilitate their growth and promote gonadal development. For abalones in their natural environment, the light intensity in the water area is relatively stable, suggesting that there is a key regulative effect of light intensity on their growth and development.
   Gao et al. (2016a, b) found that a dark environment not only adversely affected the daily aquaculture production, but was also associated with a lower growth rate compared with animals reared under higher light intensities, because of lower food conversion efficiency and greater energy losses through excretion and feces. Physiological metabolism and antioxidant defense systems may therefore be key indicators for measuring the suitability of light intensity for aquaculture production. We therefore examined the effects of light intensity on the metabolism and antioxidant defense system, and on the expression of related genes, in H. discus hannai using a light-emitting diode (LED) to replace the conventional fluorescent light source. The results of this study will improve our understanding of the physiological tolerance and antioxidant defense characteristics of abalone under different light intensities, and enable the optimization of environmental light conditions in abalone aquaculture.

AB  - Free-living nematodes from littoral benthie sediments of four lakes, two rivers and a hot spring in Ethiopia are studied. Populations of nematodes encountered are identified to the species level. The general nematode (generic and species) composition of the lakes, rivers and hot spring are appraised by giving special emphasis to the nematodes from L. Tana, i.e. three sites where different environmental factors come into play were considered. Gelda is a site close to a river inlet (River Gelda), Gedero is a site exposed to strong wind action while Zegie is a secluded site protected by a land mass from any strong wind action. Nematode communities were identified using classification and ordination techniques. The identified communities are then characterised with respect to species composition, biomass, density, diversity, size structure, feeding type and maturity index. Also, the vertical distribution of nematodes is examined at the community and species level. An attempt has been made to associate these variations with the considered environmental factors viz. site, water depth, sediment depth, median grain size and percentage of mud in the sediment.
   Median grain size and percentage of mud varied over the three sites with the lowest grain size and the highest percentage of mud in Gelda. The incoming river is regarded responsible for the high mud content at this site. The composition of the nematode communities from the lakes, rivers and hot spring by and large was typically freshwater. The highest number of species (40 species) was recorded from L. Tana (a lake relatively intensively sampled) whereas the lowest number was recorded front the saline lake, Abiyata (2 species). Both species in the latter belong to the genus Monhystrella. The complete dominance of species of this genus in L. Abiyata and its presence in the saline lakes and hot spring is argued to be associated with their opportunistic nature and their high temperature dependency and their capacity to withstand high osmotic stress conditions. The role played by salinity in the distribution of nematodes in inland water bodies is considered vital. The occurrence of two species of the genus Udonchus in River Abbay where an outlet of a waste disposal scheme of a textile factory is situated, and their absence in any other site coupled with the habitual presence of one of the two species in mineral waters are used to argue that the genus may be an indicator of some kind of environmental (chemical?) stress. Five nematode communities are identified in L. Tana, viz. Gelda at 0.5 m, Gelda at 1.5 m, Zegie at 0.5 m, Zegie at 1.5 m and Gedero. The vulnerability of Gedero to strong wind action is maintained to be the main reason for the absence of a significant difference in nematode community at the two water depths at this site. The presence of few dominant species characterised four of the five communities. Factors that account for differences in species composition and abundance are discussed. Local conditions are thought to be important in the different communities in L. Tana. A strategy in niche partitioning is suggested to be the main driving force behind the composition of few most dominant species which (in L. Tana and other reviewed lakes) invariably was a combination of a deposit feeder(s) and an omnivore/predator(s) species. In general, nematode diversity in L. Tana was comparable to that found in oligotrophic and mesotrophic freshwater lakes. Nematode diversity varied over the different communities in L. Tana. The two communities in Gelda were less divers and were composed of smaller species than those communities in Zegie and Gedero, and this is explained by the muddy nature of the sediment in Gelda. Most of the difference in diversity among communities could be explained at the genus level. Density and biomass varied significantly over the five communities, density (m(-2)) was in the range 91 x 10(3)-504.7 x 10(3) and biomass was in the range 0.02-0.33 g dry wt/m(2) (0.01-0.16 gC/m(2)). Deposit feeders dominated in all communities followed by omnivore/predators. Epistrate feeders had the lowest abundance. In all sites, except Gelda at 0.5 m, a large proportion of the nematodes occurred in the uppermost sediment layer (0-1 cm). The number of species also decreased with increasing sediment depth. A relatively higher proportion of nematodes were found in the surface sediment at deeper water depth (1.5 m) than at shallower depth (0.5 in). The vertical profile of biomass followed that of density.

AB  - Streamflow is one the most important variables controlling and maintaining aquatic ecosystem integrity, diversity, and sustainability. This study identified and quantified changes in 34 hydrologic characteristics and parameters at 30 long term (1939-2016) discharge stations in the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf Coast Hydrologic Region (Region 3) using Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) variables. The southeastern United States (SEUS) is a biodiversity hotspot, and the region has experienced a number of rapid land use/land cover changes with multiple primary drivers. Studies in the SEUS have been mostly localized on specific rivers, reservoir catchments and/or species, but the overall region has not been assessed for the long-term period of 1939-2016 for multiple hydrologic characteristic parameters. The objectives of the study were to provide an overview of multiple river basins and 31 hydrologic characteristic parameters of streamflow in Region 3 for a longer period and to develop a conceptual map of impacts of selected stressors and changes in hydrology and climate in the SEUS. A seven step procedure was used to accomplish these objectively: Step 1: Download data from the 30 USGS gauging stations. Steps 2 and 3: Select and analyze the 31 IHA parameters using boxplots, scatter plots, and PDFs. Steps 4 and 5: Synthesize the drivers of changes and alterations and the various change points in streamflow in the literature. Step 6: Synthesize the climate of the SEUS in terms of temperature and precipitation changes. Step 7: Develop a conceptual map of impacts of selected stressors on hydrology using Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework and IHA parameters. The 31 IHA parameters were analyzed. The meta-analysis of literature in the SEUS revealed the precipitation changes observed ranged from -30% to +35% and temperature changes from -2 degrees C to 6 degrees C by 2099. The fiftieth percentile of the Global Climate Models (GCM) predict no precipitation change and an increase in the temperature of 2.5 degrees C in the region by 2099. Among the GCMs, the 5th and 95th percentile of precipitation changes range between -40% and 110% and temperature changes between -2 degrees C and 6 degrees C by 2099. Meta-analysis of land use/land cover show the region has experienced changes. A number of rapid land use/land cover changes in 1957, 1970, and 1998 are some of the change points documented in the literature for precipitation and streamflow in the region. A conceptual map was developed to represent the impacts of selected drivers and the changes in hydrology and climate in the study region for three land use/land cover categories in three different periods.

AB  - This article aims to conceptualize and assess social cohesion in Mexico, taking into account their multilevel and multidimensional nature. To measure social cohesion levels and dimensions, we used the Social Welfare Survey (N = 2871) for the 16 municipalities in Mexico City. Then, we employed the DP2 distance method to construct a social cohesion index. In addition, we define social cohesion degrees (very high, high, medium, and low) to explore the relevance of each indicator. The findings suggest that the objective and subjective indicators at the meso-level has the highest contribution, regardless of the territory or degrees of cohesion. This finding suggests that neighborhoods are well organized for solving everyday problems. Meanwhile, the willingness to help both friends and members of one's network was not a priority, which can be explained by the suspicion toward other people and the prevalent economic conditions.

AB  - In the present study, a modified water quality index (WQI) was used to evaluate the water quality in south coastal aquaculture area of Dalian, Liaoning Province, China. Four main culture areas with 40 sampling stations were covered. Ten variables were selected for principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA), and the major factors affecting water quality were identified. The PCA results showed that these factors were mainly associated with nutrients, natural conditions and organic matter. The modified WQI was calculated to identify the classes of water quality and to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes among the sampling areas. The results revealed that the water quality generally performed the worst in June, and the best in October. The modified WQI proved to be a useful method for water quality classification and characterizing spatial and temporal changes in Dalian aquaculture areas.

AB  - In this study, freshwater snail (Physa acuta) was investigated to determine histopathological effects of CuSO4 on digestive gland, foot, mantle and ovotestis under laboratory conditions. The snails were exposed to different sublethal concentrations of CuSO4 (0.05 mg/L, 0.1 mg/L and 0.2 mg/L) periods of 10, 20 and 30 days. The relationship between CuSO4 concentration and mortality rate in snails was calculated as Y = 8.8 + 125.14X, R-2 = 0.9444. The histopathological examinations revealed that CuSO4 caused significant histopathological changes in all the tissues of the snail. The severity of these lesions in tissues increased with increasing CuSO4 concentration and duration of exposure. The results showed that freshwater snail, Physa acuta can be considered to be a suitable bioindicator to demonstrate the toxic effect of copper in aquatic environments.

AB  - Climate variability and extreme weather events, especially droughts, floods, hailstorms, low temperatures with frost and heat waves have significant negative effects on agriculture in Slovenia and increase its vulnerability. This study took into account the concept of vulnerability of the International Panel on Climate Change. The index of climate vulnerability of agriculture was developed on the basis of three indicators: exposure (climate variability and extreme weather events), sensitivity (threats due to natural conditions, changes in agriculture, vitality of the population) and adaptive capacity (income, sustainable management and natural resources). Climate vulnerability of agriculture was quantitatively analyzed with vulnerability indicators through the statistical regions of the Republic of Slovenia, and thus contributed to the regionally oriented approaches that seek to answer the challenges of climate vulnerability of agriculture in Slovenia. The results show higher climate vulnerability of agriculture in the western and central Slovenia and lower vulnerability in the eastern and northeastern part of the country.

AB  - This paper develops a generic degradation model based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) which predicts the condition of a technical system. Besides handling bi-directional reasoning, a major benefit of this degradation model using a DBN is its ability to adequately model stochastic processes as well as Markov chains. We will assume that the behavior of the degradation can be represented as a P-F-curve (also called degradation or life curve). The model developed here is able to combine information from expert knowledge, any kind of sensor and operating data as well as information from the machine operator. Using the Bayesian approach, uncertain knowledge can be handled appropriately. Thus it is even possible to take into account the environment and stress under which the component or system is operating. Hence, it is possible to detect potential failures at an early stage and initiate appropriate remedy and repair strategies prior to catastrophic failure.

AB  - Water is one of the primary resources provided for maintaining quality of life and social status in urban areas. As potable water is considered to be a primary need, water service has usually been managed without examining the economic and environmental sustainability of supply processes. Currently, due to increases in energy costs and the growth of environment preservation policies, reducing water leakage, energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) production have become primary objectives in reducing the environmental footprint of water service. The present paper suggests the implementation of some performance indicators that show the interdependence of water loss, energy consumption and GHG emission. These indicators are used to compare a few possible mitigation scenarios involving water loss reduction and increasing the system's energy efficiency. The proposed indicators were applied to a complex urban water supply system serving the city of Palermo (Italy).

AB  - Over the last years, many approaches have emerged that attempt to measure the contribution of firms to sustainable development, i.e. corporate sustainability. Our review of existing methodologies for the assessment of corporate sustainability reveals two major shortcomings. First, value creation as a core condition for sustainability as well as for further contributions to economic sustainability is often ignored in these assessments, suggesting that financial and non-financial organizational processes are separable. Second, existing approaches fail to differentiate between the actual contribution of a firm to sustainability on the one hand, and governance-related features aimed at attaining this contribution on the other. We argue that the implementation of sustainability-oriented organizational structures and managerial instruments alone does not necessarily guarantee sustainability performance. Therefore, besides the dimension of current sustainability performance, we introduce the notion of sustainability governance as a second distinct dimension of corporate sustainability assessment.

AB  - In regions with a strong mining tradition and ties, there are numerous waste dumps, many of which are old, even abandoned, without any existing company having the responsibility of reclaiming them. These waste dumps have both an environmental and socioeconomic impact and can even lead to problems of safety. In this article, a simple, fast-to-use method for qualitatively and quantitatively assessing the situation of old waste dumps is presented. It has been applied to existing waste dumps in the region of Asturias and three of the analyzed examples are presented. Thanks to its simplicity, the method can be implemented by non-technical personnel (i.e. non-experts in the specific problems of mining waste dumps) and can be applied in other mining regions. However, the method only constitutes a tool, which cannot replace mandatory construction projects or the obligation to comply with current regulations.

AB  - DNA microarray mounted 85 functional gene sequences related to carbon, nitrogen and sulphur cycles, chemical degradation, metal metabolisms, and energy flows was developed to evaluate the function and status of the environment. Total of 24 river water samples from 6 sampling stations in 2 rivers in 4 seasons were analyzed using constructed DNA microarray. The numbers and constitution of the functional genes were much affected by the seasonal change. Some of the functional genes related to methane oxidation, nitrite reduction, nitrogen fixation, aromatic compounds degradation (catechol 2,3-dioxygenase), alkane degradation (group I and III) and iron reduction were detected in most of all the samples, suggesting that these could be the general functions of the river environment. Some other functional genes related to ammonium oxidation, aromatic compounds degradation (catechol 1,2-dioxygenase) and alkane degradation (group II) can be a certain indicator for the evaluation of the environmental condition.

AB  - Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides that are produced by bacteria and toxic to bacterial strains closely related to the producer strain. It has previously been reported that Bacillus thuringiensis strain NEB17 and Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki BUPM4 produce the bacteriocins thuricin 17 (3,162 Da) and bacthuricin F4 (3,160.05 Da), respectively. Here, we demonstrate that these bacteriocins have functional similarities and show a similar spectrum of antimicrobial activities against indicator strains. We also studied the effects of sterilization methods on the recovery and biological activities of these bacteriocins. They were completely degraded by autoclaving and the two were similarly affected by the tested filter membranes. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyestersulfone (PES), and cellulose acetate (CA) are suitable for filter sterilization of these bacteriocins. The two bacteriocins were stable across a range of storage conditions. These data will facilitate their utilization in food preservation or agricultural applications.

AB  - Case-deleted analysis is a popular method for evaluating the influence of a subset of cases on inference. The use of Monte Carlo estimation strategies in complicated Bayesian settings leads naturally to the use of importance sampling techniques to assess the divergence between full-data and case-deleted posteriors and to provide estimates under the case-deleted posteriors. However, the dependability of the importance sampling estimators depends critically on the variability of the case-deleted weights. We provide theoretical results concerning the assessment of the dependability of case-deleted importance sampling estimators in several Bayesian models. In particular, these results allow us to establish whether or not the estimators satisfy a central limit theorem. Because the conditions we derive are of a simple analytical nature, the assessment of the dependability of the estimators can be verified routinely before estimation is performed. We illustrate the use of the results in several examples.

AB  - This Discussion Paper provides an analysis of the competitiveness of Belarus' dairy sector based on international trade indicators. The ex-post analysis is supplemented by an ex-ante analysis in order to gain detailed insights into the sector's future opportunities and challenges. Systematic access is established through relevant determinants based on Porter's diamond.
   Ex-post analysis results indicate a strong position of Belarus in the international dairy trade although this is limited to homogenous products like milk powder and evaporated milk. Competitive disadvantages were revealed for highly processed dairy products. The ex-ante analysis through Porter's diamond model reveals the necessary prerequisites for potentially successful future developments in the dairy chain. Natural conditions, infrastructure and supporting industries, although able to be improved, have a positive effect on competitiveness. Competitive disadvantages result from a low demand for vertically and horizontally differentiated products, the weak capitalisation and labour situation, and inappropriate policy. These determinants need to be improved urgently otherwise Belarus may forgo its present relatively good position in international dairy markets.

AB  - Twin studies are frequently cited in support of the influence of genetic factors for a wide range of psychiatric conditions and psychological trait differences. The most common method, known as the classical twin method, compares the concordance rates or correlations of reared-together identical (MZ) vs. reared-together same-sex fraternal (DZ) twins. However, drawing genetic inferences from MZ-DZ comparisons is problematic due to methodological problems and questionable assumptions. It is argued that the main theoretical assumption of the twin method-known as the "equal environment assumption" - is not tenable. The twin method is therefore of doubtful value as an indicator of genetic influences. Studies of reared-apart twins are discussed, and it is noted that these studies are also vulnerable to methodological problems and environmental confounds. It is concluded that there is little reason to believe that twin studies provide evidence in favor of genetic influences on psychiatric disorders and human behavioral differences.

AB  - Quality-indicating sexually selected traits may have their honesty maintained by their costs or by an inherent ''revealing'' nature. Long tails in birds are usually considered to be costly ''handicaps'', but may have additional potential as revealing indicators through the incidence of breakage. Magpies Pica pica with unbroken and less abraded tails paired earlier, but did not nest or fledge young earlier than pairs with tails in poorer condition. Pairs mated assortatively by tail quality, and magpies with very broken tails remained unmated. Pairs in which both members had almost undamaged tails fledged more offspring than pairs with poorer tails. Tail quality did not correlate with the extent of any habitat type in the territory. Tail damage thus honestly indicated a magpie's reproductive potential, and the data are consistent with its having a role in mate choice, as a revealing element of tail morphology.

KW  - BASE
AB  - This study is an extension of previous work where acetic acid emanating from degrading photographic films was detected by filter paper impregnated with cresol red indicator. The test was destructive, requiring the removal of a small disk (hole-punch) of film. Here cresol red has been adsorbed onto a polymeric (acrylic-ester) resin to give a non-invasive indicator which could be placed in film cans. The performance of the indicator has been assessed by testing 54 films (housed by the North West Film Archive al the Manchester Metropolitan University) of various conditions when stored at ambient temperature and humidity. The films were tested periodically over a period of 12 months. The trials indicate that the indicator successfully responds to acetic acid within the film storage environment, and that it can be used to alert archivists by identifying the point prior to which films exhibit marked physical and chemical property changes.

The combined information retrieved from free and sulphur-bound carbon skeletons enabled a detailed palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. The biomarker compositions of the marls point to large variations in the composition of species in the water column (e.g. dinoflagellates,diatoms and other algae, cyanobacteria, methanogens, green sulphur bacteria and bacterivorous ciliates) and in contributions from the continent (i.e. land plants) within each marl bed and between marl beds. The marl beds were deposited within a stratified lagoon where anoxic conditions extended into the photic zone for much of the time.

TI  - ASSESSING GLOBAL RIVER WATER-QUALITY - CASE-STUDY USING MECHANISTIC APPROACHES
T2  - ACS SYMPOSIUM SERIES
LA  - English
AB  - Rivers, like the atmosphere and oceans, are integrative and reflect conditions within their boundaries. Critical to an understanding of the role of human activity in environmental change is an understanding of the impact of human activity an river quality and how river quality may be used as an indicator of environmental change. Current data collection practices, based largely on the traditional parametric or ambient fixed-station network approach, do not generally provide the information necessary to relate human activity to quality of river water or to utilize water quality data as an indicator of global environmental change.
   What is needed is an alternative approach which permits development of valid cause and effect relationships. This strategy, one involving intensive surveys, is referred to here as mechanistic. The Willamette River, Oregon, USA, is used as a case study to illustrate quantitative, semi-quantitative and qualitative approaches to mechanistic assessment of river water quality using, respectively, dissolved oxygen depletion, erosion/deposition and potentially toxic trace elements as examples.

AB  - The demand for fish products in Black Sea riparian countries has been intensively growing annually by 4% since 2000. This demand was predominantly covered by importation and/or capture fisheries. To reduce pressure on the wild fish stocks of the shared sea basin, regional and national development plans are aiming to stimulate aquaculture production. However, there is a scarcity of instruments that allow assessment of the situation on the regional level to capture the multidimensional nature of such activity. A Composite Indicator or so-called Index has been recognized as one of the best ways to investigate the complex system statement and reveal areas of concern. The aim of this study was (1) to construct a Composite Indicator, (2) to analyze conditions created for aquaculture establishments, (3) to reveal competitive advantages and pitfalls in each country, and (4) to determine possible drivers of countries with better performance such as Turkey and Bulgaria.

AB  - The paper relies on the newest set of quality of life dimensions defined by the European Commission, in order to achieve a two fold purpose: to obtain a detailed image of European Union countries' synchronization in terms of each quality of life dimension and to create a new, comprehensive metric of a country's overall quality of life by aggregating the information provided by each specific dimension. Thus, our complementary research approach relies on: i) an in-depth exploratory analysis to assess European Union countries' resemblance in terms of quality of life dimensions; ii) the development of a novel rating system, which serves as a barometer for the quality of life status and allows countries' ranking. The findings revealed that increased resemblance between countries appeared for governance and basic rights indicators, productive activity and education indicators, while the highest dissimilarity was present for the living environment indicators and material living conditions indicators.

AB  - Different studies into the notion of quality of employment have proposed several dimensions and various solutions for measuring it. One such measurement proposal is the European Index of Quality of Work. This index comprises information concerning the physical and social environment, the intensity and quality of work time, the different skills involved and how workers influence their jobs, their job prospects and the earnings they receive for their work.
   Based on the components included in this index provided by the European Working Conditions Survey, we propose estimating a synthetic indicator of quality of employment using the P-2 distance methodology. The aim is to offer a robust estimate of the quality of employment, exploring which components carry greater weight when determining quality of employment, and also providing a spatial analysis of employment quality levels from a gender perspective.

AB  - Extended pesticide use might be of high risk for several non-target organisms like earthworms. Herbicides represent a major part of the total pesticides used; however, their effects on soil organisms have been only partially studied. The effects of the herbicides benfluralin, metribuzin and propyzamide at different rates on the survival and weight of earthworms (Octodrilus complanatus) were determined and compared in this study. Our results revealed significant effects of benfluralin, metribuzin and propyzamide on growth and survival of earthworms. Moreover, there was a significant effect of herbicide rate and time after treatment. For several herbicides, the highest weight reduction was obtained for double the recommended rate and was up to 70% compared to the untreated soil. This study highlights the importance of not exceeding the recommended rates of herbicides, while further studies in a range of conditions are certainly required.

AB  - The trace level of metals and particularly radioactive ones should be monitored to evaluate the transfer along the trophic chain, assess the risk for biota and can be used for global changes assessment. Plants respond rapidly to all changes in the ecosystem conditions and are widely used as indicators and predictors for changes in hydrology and geology. In this work we represent our successful development and applications of a methodology for monitoring of stable and radioactive strontium and cesium in marine biota (Black Sea algae's). In case of radioactive release they are of high interest. We use ED-XRF, gamma spectrometers and LSC instrumentation and only 0.25 g sample. Obtained results are compared with those of other authors in same regions. The novelty is the connection between the radioactive isotopes and their stable elements in algae in time and space scale. All our samples were collected from Bulgarian Black Sea coast. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper gives the results of the laboratory experiments on the influence of different concentrations of oil in water environment over the chlorella and daphnia. It is shown that as the oil content in water increases, the intensity of delayed fluorescence of test-culture of chlorella and the survival rate of the daphnia decrease. However, for the chlorella the decrease in fluorescence as the indicator of its photosynthetic activity is observed only at very high concentrations of oil (1000-2000 MPC), whereas the survival rate of the cladocerans begins to drop at 4 MPC. A similar dependence is observed when sunflower-seed oil is introduced into the environment as an imitator of the oil pollution. We suppose that the negative influence of oil over the microalgae and cladocerans is conditioned more by the physical factors than by chemical ones.

LA  - English
AB  - The increased solar cycle activity is followed by long-term anomalies in the surface air pressure that take place in the extra-tropical zone of the Northern Hemisphere in winter. The most important peculiarity is an opposite change in the pressure in the regions that tend to the Icelandic and Aleutian lows. During the 16th-23rd solar activity cycles, two scenarios of pressure change in the high latitudes are observed: (1) an increase at the border between the Arctic and Atlantic Ocean and a decrease at the border with the Pacific; (2) a decrease at the Arctic border with the Atlantic Ocean and an increase at its border with the Pacific. Spatial-temporal peculiarities of natural oscillations adapted to large-scale inhomogeneity in land and ocean distribution in the temperate and high latitudes and, therefore, the Arctic hydrometeorological conditions can be considered as important indicators of solar-terrestrial relations.

AB  - Halorespiring microorganisms are not only able to oxidize organic electron donors such as formate, acetate, pyruvate and lactate, but also H-2. Because these microorganisms have a high affinity for H-2, this may be the most important electron donor for halorespiration in the environment. We have studied the role of H-2-threshold concentrations in pure halorespiring cultures and compared them with mixed cultures and field data. We have found H-2-threshold values between 0.05 and 0.08 nM for Sulfurospirillum halorespirans, S. multivorans and Dehalobacter restrictus under PCE-reducing and nitrate-reducing conditions. The reduction of PCE and TCE can proceed at H-2 concentrations of below 1 nM at a polluted site. However, for the reduction of lower chlorinated ethenes a higher H-2 concentration is required. This indicates that the measured H-2 concentration in situ can be an indicator of the extent of anaerobic reductive dechlorination.

AB  - The slope environments of the arid Western Himalaya are dominated by cryonival processes. Several factors contribute to the zonation of these environments, including altitude (3500-6500 m), topographical and aridity (vs monsoon) gradients, lithostructural and geodynamic context (with the continuing convergence of India and Asia), slope aspect, and proximity to glaciers. Among other landforms, large rock glaciers are prominent. However, although usually considered as good climatic indicators (indicative of discontinuous permafrost), their field identification is not straightforward because their surficial form (lava stream-like debris accumulation) is often similar to some other features such as rockslides and/or debris covered glaciers. From examples taken in Lahul and Ladakh, we show that, in the geodynamically active Himalayan environment, some of these large "rock glaciers" are in fact rockslide features. It is argued that use of their altitudinal extent in order to estimate present and past climatic conditions is likely to be misleading.

AB  - The natural distribution of teak covers discontinuous regions in South and Southeast Asia. These regions are located within the total area of tropical summer-rain climate characterized by distinct rainy and dry seasons. The successful teak plantations are found in discontinuous areas with fertile soils, which are intrazonal and atonal soils derived from limestones, base-rich igneous rocks and alluvial materials. The discontinuous distribution of natural forests and plantations of teak is attributed to the discontinuous occurrence of suitable intrazonal and atonal soils. The dominant trees of natural forests in zonal soil areas under the same climate are deciduous dipterocarp species. The optimum soil conditions for teak growth include good drainage, deep subsoil, slightly acid to alkaline pH and abundance of bases, especially Ca. Emphasis is placed on yield tables and site quality maps for the efficient management of plantations, and on plant indicator methods such as trial planting and plant indicators for site selection.

AB  - Log removal values (LRV) for a range of pathogens in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) were aggregated for 180 sampling events across 11 municipal scale installations. Important correlations were established between LRV for biological (LRVBio) and physical (LRVMem) inactivation with reactor conditions (pH, temperature, solid and hydraulic retention times (SRT, HRT), and mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)), membrane properties (pore size and flux), operational variables and filtrate quality. LRVBio correlated positively and significantly between all microorganism indicators and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), becoming a suitable monitoring technique for biological removal. LRVMem correlated positively for protozoa indicators and bacteria consistent with size exclusion as a predominant removal mechanism. Strong correlations between LRV for protozoa, virus and bacteria indicators were established at lower flux, TMP and MLSS, higher pH and temperature and longer solids and hydraulic retention time. The implications of this study provide important guidance for the validation of MBRs producing safe and consistent recycled water.

AB  - In this study, we used publicly available GIS layers and statistical tree-based modeling (CART and Random Forest) to predict pathogen indicator counts at a regional scale using 88 spatially explicit landscape predictors and 6657 samples from non-estuarine streams in the Oregon Coast Range. A total of 532 frequently sampled sites were parsed down to 93 pathogen sampling sites to control for spatial and temporal biases. This model's 56.5% explanation of variance, was comparable to other regional models, while still including a large number of variables. Analysis showed the most important predictors on bacteria counts to be: forest and natural riparian zones, cattle related activities, and urban land uses. This research confirmed linkages to anthropogenic activities, with the research prediction mapping showing increased bacteria counts in agricultural and urban land use areas and lower counts with more natural riparian conditions.

AB  - This paper applies a stochastic viability approach to a tropical small-scale fishery, offering a theoretical and empirical example of ecosystem-based fishery management approach that accounts for food security. The model integrates multi-species, multi-fleet and uncertainty as well as profitability, food production, and demographic growth. It is calibrated over the period 2006-2010 using monthly catch and effort data from the French Guiana's coastal fishery, involving thirteen species and four fleets. Using projections at the horizon 2040, different management strategies and scenarios are compared from a viability viewpoint, thus accounting for biodiversity preservation, fleet profitability and food security. The analysis shows that under certain conditions, viable options can be identified which allow fishing intensity and production to be increased to respond to food security requirements but with minimum impacts on the marine resources.

AB  - Published results concerning metal levels in feathers of birds of prey were listed and evaluated. Mercury concentrations have been studied most and the background values normally vary between 0.1 and 5 mg/kg dry weight the highest concentrations being in birds from aquatic food chains. Pollution causes elevated levels of mercury in feathers. The concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead and zinc show reasonable variation between species, areas and time periods. Feathers of birds of prey have proved to be good indicators of the status of environmental heavy metal pollution. Special attention should be paid to clean sampling and preparation of samples. Interpretation of the results requires knowledge on food habit, molting and migration patterns of the species. Several species representing different food chains should be included in comprehensive monitoring surveys. Chick feathers reflect most reliably local conditions.

AB  - Through reviewing what is known about the nature, course, and heritability of borderline personality disorder (BPD), we argue for a reconceptualization of this disorder that would lead to its placement on Axis I. Borderline personality disorder is a prevalent and disabling condition, and yet the empirical research into its nature and treatment has not been commensurate with the seriousness of the illness. We not only review empirical evidence about the etiology, phenomenology, and course of the disorder in BPD but we also address fundamental misconceptions about BPD that we believe have contributed to misunderstanding and stigmatization of the disease. Finally, we suggest future directions for research that might permit the identification of core features of this disorder, with a focus on the importance of naturalistic assessments and of assessments through the course of development.

AB  - Lead is ubiquitous in our environment and lead poisoning is a major public health problem worldwide. In this study, to see if intracellular Pb2+ induces the exposure of phosphatidylserine in rat thymocyte membranes, we have examined the effect of PbCl2 on rat thymocytes treated with A23187 using a flow cytometer with appropriate fluorescent indicators under nominally-Ca2+-free condition. PbCl2 at 1-30 muM dose-dependently induced the exposure of phosphatidylserine on outer membranes, associated with increasing the concentration of intracellular Pb2+. The potency of intracellular Pb2+ to induce the apoptotic change in thymocyte membranes seems to be greater than those of intracellular Ca2+ and Cd2+. Results suggest that intracellular Pb2+ triggers apoptosis of rat thymocytes. This action of Pb2+ may be one of mechanisms for the lead-induced changes in immunity. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cross-country studies suggest that countries with greater financial sector competition have higher rates of economic growth. However, it is difficult to 'hold constant' different legal and cultural environments in these analyses, leading some to suggest that this relationship is due less to competition than to differing legal and cultural conditions which favour economic growth. As these differences are small within a country, an interregional analysis may reflect better the relationship between financial market competition and growth. We study five large regions in Spain over 1986-98. Using different indicators of market competition, we analyse changes in regional competition and growth. Granger-causality tests show that differences in competition are not associated with improved regional growth. Although deregulation raised deposit rates and lowered loan rates, these benefits have not markedly influenced regional growth. The positive relationship shown between competitive markets and growth in cross-country studies may instead be due to some unspecified third factor that influences both.

Various economic indicators are used to present a picture of economic evolution and structural adjustment over time. The conformity to changing conditions of the structural composition is analyzed at several levels of aggregation, including the structure of GDP and employment; main economics sectors; industrial value added and employment, as well as export and import composition. Also analyzed are differences between the structure of manufacturing of the South East European countries (Albania, Bulgaria, FYR of Macedonia, and Greece) and the other Central European countries, as well as certain European Union countries. The differences and commonalities among the South East European countries (SEECs) are outlined. The article discusses the potential benefits of a policy of regional cooperation within

AB  - Alteration of paleosols following development and burial is common. Chemical, physical and mechanical processes can weld younger to older soil profiles and affect the accumulation, dissolution, and reprecipitation of mineral material in soils. Soil properties most affected include texture and porosity, and, the content and distribution of soluble salts, amorphous silica, gypsum, carbonate, and clay. Organic matter retention is highly dependent on post-burial biologically controlled oxidation reduction and pH conditions. Processes such as erosion and deposition can truncate profiles or bury them either rapidly or extremely slowly. Effects of these and other processes on soil properties must be examined with care in paleosols that have been buried even for a short interval. This study presents several examples of soil properties which should be evaluated carefully and possibly avoided as indicators in paleoenvironmental reconstruction, paleosol classification, and regional stratigraphic correlation.

AB  - New particle formation (NPF) occurs frequently in various atmospheric environments and it is a major source of ultrafine particles. This study proposes an indicator, I, for the occurrence of NPF in the atmosphere based on the mechanism of H2SO4-amine nucleation. It characterizes the synergistic effects of the governing factors for H2SO4-amine nucleation, including H2SO4 concentration, amine concentrations, the stability of H2SO4-amine clusters, and aerosol surface area concentration. Long-term measurements in urban Beijing were used to validate this indicator. Good consistency was found between this indicator and the occurrence of NPF. NPF was usually observed with I > 1 for typical conditions in urban Beijing. The derivation and expressions of I also indicate a good positive association between the H2SO4 dimer concentration and NPF, as also verified by measurements. I was shown to be also applicable in urban Shanghai. Copyright (c) 2021 American Association for Aerosol Research

AB  - This study concerns the long winter sequences without rain on the scale of the entire Mediterranean basin scale. Objectives are (i) to define theses extreme events as geographical and climatological objects characterized by a location, a spatial extension and a temporal length and (ii) measured impacts of these events on the cereal production in Spain. 76 events of Very Long Dry Spells (eVLDS) are detected over the 1957-2013 period. These eVLDS are grouped into four typical recurrent configurations on the scale of the Mediterranean basin: North-East, West, scattered & localised and South-East. The eVLDS configurations are associated with anticyclonic conditions located about 1 000 km northwest of the impacted areas. The eVLDS have a greater impact on barley, wheat and oat yields (winter crops grown through rainfed agriculture) than rainfall totals and seasonal dry day ratios.

AB  - The availability and low cost of shale gas has boosted its use as fuel and as a raw material to produce value-added compounds. Benzene is one of the chemicals that can be obtained from methane, and represents one of the most important compounds in the petrochemical industry. It can be synthesized via direct methane aromatization (DMA) or via indirect aromatization (using oxidative coupling of methane). DMA is a direct-conversion process, while indirect aromatization involves several stages. In this work, an economic, energy-saving, and environmental assessment for the production of benzene from shale gas using DMA as a reaction path is presented. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to observe the effect of the operating conditions on the profitability of the process. The results show that production of benzene using shale gas as feedstock can be accomplished with a high return on investment.

AB  - The results of a complex investigation of the sulphate and arsenate assemblages forming in the weathering zone of selected ore deposits in the Sudetes are presented. The development of the weathering zone has been characterised in the polymetallic ore deposits at Miedzianka-Ciechanowice and Radzimowice, and the pyrite deposit at Wiesciszowice, which differ in the chemical compositions of the ore and barren minerals and the hydrological conditions. Secondary sulphate and arsenate mineral assemblages vary significantly among the ore deposits under study. Their crystallization is discussed, taking into consideration the stability of particular minerals and the paths of their transformation. It is shown that these minerals have great potential as indicators of weathering processes. A significant role for microorganisms in the formation of the weathering zone of the ore deposits under study is also proven.

AB  - In soils and plants of the southern shrub tundra, 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. Polyarenes in emissions, soil organic horizons, and plants mainly include low-molecular-weight PAHs: naphthalene, fluorine, and pyrene. The contents of the total PAHs in soils and plants exceed the background levels by 3-5 times. The distribution of polyarenes among the organs of the studied plants is nonuniform and depends on the plant species and technogenic load on the area. The studied plants include both hyperaccumulators of polyarenes (Pleurozium schreberi) and indicators of PAHs in the soil (Polytrichum commune). Pleurozium schreberi is the most abundant species in the areas under study, and it accumulates the largest mass fraction of PAHs. The differences in the accumulation of PAHs by the plants of the tundra and taiga zones have been revealed.

AB  - The purpose of this work was to explore the application of microwaves for the regeneration of activated carbons spent with salicylic acid, a metabolite of a common analgesic frequently found in wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry. The exhausted carbon was treated in a quartz reactor by microwave irradiation at 2450 MHz at different temperatures and atmospheres, the regeneration efficiency being highly dependent on the operating conditions. Quantitative desorption of the pollutant was achieved at high temperature and oxidizing atmosphere, with regeneration efficiencies as high as 99% after six cycles. The stripping efficiency was superior to 95% at high temperatures and decreased at 450 degrees C. The incomplete desorption of the adsorbate at low temperature was further confirmed by the changes in the porosity observed by N-2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms. Hence, micropores remain blocked which results in a reduction in loading capacities in successive cycles. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wheat is grown in almost every region. Not only it is very important agricultural grain commodity in Turkey but as well in the world. It is very crucial to determine of the modelling the price of wheat for economic and social development. It is known that the 2008 financial crisis effected drastically on the food prices by real conditions, shrinking Turkish household budgets. Determining the influential factors in the econometric modelling of the wheat price gives more govermental decision effectively and price equalisation. In this study, there are many influential indicators on the price of wheat which cover 5 separate functions: demand, supply, economic (micro and macro), climate change and natural resource. These variables are gathered from different data sources. The variables belonging to these functions are determined by reduction method Factor analysis. After determining the related variables, the VAR analysis was implemented inhere by selected variables.

AB  - Given a hypergraph Gamma = (Omega, chi) and a sequence p = (p(omega))(omega is an element of)(Q) of values in (0, 1), let Omega(p) be the random subset of Omega obtained by keeping every vertex omega independently with probability p(omega). We investigate the general question of deriving fine (asymptotic) estimates for the probability that Omega(p) is an independent set in Gamma, which is an omnipresent problem in probabilistic combinatorics. Our main result provides a sequence of upper and lower bounds on this probability, each of which can be evaluated explicitly in terms of the joint cumulants of small sets of edge indicator random variables. Under certain natural conditions, these upper and lower bounds coincide asymptotically, thus giving the precise asymptotics of the probability in question. We demonstrate the applicability of our results with two concrete examples: subgraph containment in random (hyper)graphs and arithmetic progressions in random subsets of the integers.

AB  - The archaeological site of Hierapolis (Denizli province, Turkey) is unique in terms of the conservation of marbles and travertines. Environmental factors (i.e. interaction with thermal waters, high thermal stress, CO2 degassing) and geological aspects (presence of seismic faults, frequent earthquakes, formation of travertine) play a fundamental role in the durability and conservation state of the stone materials. This paper presents a multi-analytical approach aimed to identify the phenomena and causes of stone decay related to environmental conditions. The analyses of alteration and decay phenomena are discussed together with the monitoring of the main environmental parameters and with analyses of waters and gases present in the archaeological site. Finally, the need of a continuous monitoring of the environmental parameters affecting the archaeological site is stressed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose a microscale phloem-sap-dynamics sensor device to obtain the index of an internal plant condition regarding the transportation of primary photosynthates in phloem, which is an essential indicator of stable crop production under controlled-growth environments. In detail, we integrated a conventional Granier sensor with a thermal-flow sensor and devised an improved sensor device to quantify such index, including the information on velocity and direction of the phloem-sap flow using the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. The experimental results showed that although the proposed sensor device was approximately only 1/10 the size of the conventional Granier sensor, it could generate an output nearly equal to that of the conventional sensor. Furthermore, experiments using mimicked plants demonstrated that the proposed device could measure minute flow velocities in the range of 0-200 mu m/s, which are generally known as the phloem-sap flow velocity, and simultaneously detect the flow direction.

AB  - Groundwater age-defined as the time elapsed since the groundwater entered the subsurface-is a helpful indicator of groundwater quality and renewal. Some tracer-based groundwater age calculations require assumptions about the distribution of ages in the groundwater sample that, unfortunately, cannot be validated. Here, straightforward mixing models are developed that do not require a priori knowledge of age distributions and are able to quantify the fraction of a groundwater sample that recharged more recently than calendar year 1953 (using tritium) or within the past similar to 12 thousand years (using carbon-14). Calculations of young and old groundwater can be used to map groundwater velocities in flow systems driven by diverse climate conditions, groundwater extraction rates, rock types, topographic gradients and plant populations.

AB  - Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) seeds play a significant role in toxicity tests of isolated chemicals, pesticides, and environmental samples. Commonly, the main variables under study are the rate of seed germination and root elongation at the end of five days of exposure. Another organisms used in environmental assessment of soil quality are terrestrial isopods. The parameter evaluated in this assay is usually mortality rate. In this study, we suggest to use the daily number of germinated seeds and wet weight of plants, and feeding measurements (consumption rate, assimilation rate, assimilation efficiency and growth rate) in woodlice (Armadillidium vulgare and Porcellio dilatatus) to detect toxicity of moderately contaminated soil samples. The lettuce seed assay proved to be more efficient in the tested conditions, however, we do not reject the use of feeding parameters in terrestrial isopods in toxicological screening of contaminated soils.

AB  - The cultural life in the Islamic societies has developed under the Islamic culture environment. The Ottoman(the classical period) has taken the associations from the Islamic and Turkish states and developed through the conditions of the era. The Ottoman Palace, which is represented with the power. relations horizontally rather than vertical with the spatial dissociation, defined both the characteristics of the Emperor residence as an identification of central politics, and the difficulty of attainability to the emperor in the area. The outer area that represents the public sphere and the inner part-harem-that represents the privacy are the indicators of a systematic that is organized related to the privacy nearby the social status as an extension of Islamic culture. In this study; the reflection of privacy of Ottoman culture to the Topkapi Palace Harem is investigated. The aim of this paper is to aid the folklore by introducing some parts of the cultural values that are lived in that structure

AB  - Purpose: This research fulfills a void in offender mobility discourse. Metropolitan socioeconomic and spatial structure, defined in crime pattern theory as the urban backcloth, plays a significant role in shaping travel behavior; and yet, current analysis of offender mobility continues to favor individual characteristics to account for travel range.
   Methods: Using a large sample of juveniles, both delinquent and at-risk youth (N=2,552), this study compared the predictive utility of individual characteristics against indicators of urban backcloth.
   Results: Delinquent youth were found to be more sensitive to the environmental conditions exerted by community-level socioeconomic characteristics than their at-risk counterparts. However, two factors-intercity hierarchical structure and motor vehicle access-accounted for travel variability among all youth.
   Conclusions: Offending behavior must be examined within the context of a dynamic environmental context formed by the metropolitan socioeconomic and spatial structure. Delinquents constitute an identifiable subgroup of youth. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A field bioremediation assay using the oleophilic fertilizer S200 was carried out 10 months after the Prestige heavy fuel-oil spill on a beach of the Cantabrian coast (North Spain). The field survey showed that S200 significantly enhanced the biodegradation rate, particularly of high molecular weight n-alkanes, alkylcyclohexanes, and benzenes, and alkylated PAHs, paralleling the results previously found in vitro. The most significant molecular bioremediation indicators were the depletion of diasteranes and C-27 sterane components. Enhanced isomeric selectivity was also observed within the C1-phenanthrenes and dibenzothiophenes. Through the analysis of some target aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons a number of chemical indicators for assessing the efficiency of field bioremediation as well as identifying the source of highly weathered samples collected in the area after the spill are defined.

TI  - Cytogenetic abnormalities revealed in adolescents from Kemerovskaya oblast as indicators of adverse ecological conditions in the region
T2  - GENETIKA
LA  - Russian
AB  - Results of a population and cytogenetic survey conducted on groups of adolescents from ecologically different parts of Kemerovskaya oblast, a large industrialized area in Western Siberia, are presented. Significant intergroup variations in the frequencies of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations were detected. In adolescents from the small miners' towns of Tashtagol and Myski, located in the southern part of the region, the highest frequencies of chromosome aberrations were revealed (5.87 +/- 0.62 % and 6.72 +/- 0.54 %, respectively). The peculiarities of the qualitative spectrum of cytogenetic defects observed suggested that the populations studied were exposed to radiation. The mean frequency of chromosome aberrations in groups of adolescents from Kemerovo, a large center of chemical industry, was equal to 3.49 +/- 0.44 %, which is an additional evidence of mutagenic exposure. Chromosomal mutagenesis in this case is thought to be induced mainly by chemical genotoxic agents. However, the mutagenic effects of low doses of radiation cannot be excluded.

AB  - Activities of erythrocyte aldose reductase were compared in 34 normal subjects, 45 diabetic patients, and nine young men following immersion in water at 25, 39, and 42-degrees-C.  Mean basal enzyme activity was 1.11 (SEM 0.12) U/g Hb and 2.07 (SEM 0.14) U/g Hb in normal controls and diabetic patients, respectively (P<0.0001).  Activities of the enzyme showed a good correlation with hemaglobin A1 (HbA1) concentrations (P<0.01) but not with fasting plasma glucose concentrations.  After immersion at 42-degrees-C for 10 min, enzyme activity was increased by 37.6% (P<0.01); however, the activity decreased by 52.2% (P<0.005) after immersion for 10 min at 39-degrees-C and by 47.0% (P<0.05) at 25-degrees-C.  These changes suggest that heat stress might aggravate diabetic complications, and body exposure to hot environmental conditions is not recommended for diabetic patients.

AB  - The anterior and posterior pileus in 367 specimens of the common lizard Lacerta vivipara, collected mainly in southern Finland, show different types of variation:  geographical in the anterior and largely stochastic in the posterior.  This variation was studied in terms of phenodeviants indicatory of disturbances caused by environmental or genetic stresses during ontogeny, with the following results:  1) the differences in the anterior pileus pattern are probably hereditary, 2) the viabilities of the pileus types vary in different environmental conditions, 3) the postfrontal anomalies are much more common among individuals with a particular pattern called "rectangular" than among the other types, the former thus possibly being connected with some specific system of disturbance particularly susceptible to anomalies, and 4) it seems evident that there are genetically determined interrelations between the anterior and posterior part of the pileus through the mediatory role of the rectangular pattern.  The problem is treated in terms of phenodeviants indicating disturbances caused by environmental or genetic stresses during ontogeny.

AB  - Reliability is widely used as a performance indicator of mining equipment to achieve a cost-effective maintenance plan. Reliability is a function of time as well as environmental and operational factors. Applying an adequate model by taking into account the mentioned factors is vital to ensure an accurate estimation of reliability characteristics. The aim of this study is to investigate the application of mixed frailty model to describe both observed and unobserved heterogeneity in reliability analysis of mining equipment. The capability of the model is assessed using field data from a fleet of dump trucks in an open-pit mine. The results indicate that the proposed model is superior to the traditional Cox model when data are heterogeneous. The results also show that the operator's skill and road conditions have a significant effect on the reliability of dump trucks.

AB  - The trace fossil Macaronichnus segregatis degiberti (7-15 mm in diameter) is recorded for the first time in deep-marine contourites which were deposited in a Late Miocene outer-shelf to upper slope of the Rifian Corridor (Morocco). Macaronichnus is typical of shallow-marine, mainly foreshore environments. It is produced by deposit feeding opheliid polychaetes in high to intermediate latitudes. This record supports the significance of bottom current processes on environmental conditions as a major limiting factor affecting the macrobenthic trace maker community. Mediterranean overflow water during the Late Miocene enabled a high nutrient supply to the seafloor, favouring colonization by Macaronichnus producers. Thus, M. s. degiberti should be used as an indicator for nutrient availability instead of mainly a palaeodepth indicator. This finding provides significant information for oceanographic and environmental reconstructions related to contouritic processes, as well as to contourite characterization.

AB  - Energy balance, simply, is the difference between energy consumed and sum of energy used for maintenance and production. The negative difference indicates body reserves being mobilized, whereas the positive difference indicates body reserves being replenished or increased. Negative energy balance (NEB) is accepted as natural event in dairy cattle because, dry matter intake decrase during the close-up period and increases more slowly than milk yield after parturition. Other than phenotypical changes (body weight and condition score change), metabolic indicators in blood and milk (nonesterified fatty acids, ketone bodies, milk fatty acid composition, and milk fat:protein ratio, etc.) also change, which can be used for estimating severity and duration of NEB. This review emphasizes causes of NEB, metabolic indicators that may be used to estimate NEB, and important points in their interpretations.

AB  - We tested a trait-based approach to link a soil disturbance to changes in invertebrate communities. Soils and macro-invertebrates were sampled in sandy soils contaminated by long-term wastewater irrigation, adding notably organic matter and trace metals (TM). We hypothesized that functional traits of invertebrates depict ways of exposure and that exposure routes relate to specific TM pools. Geophages and soft-body invertebrates were chosen to inform on exposure by ingestion or contact, respectively. Trait-based indices depicted more accurately effects of pollution than community density and diversity did. Exposure by ingestion had more deleterious effects than by contact. Both types of exposed invertebrates were influenced by TM, but geophages mainly responded to changes in soil organic matter contents. The trait-based approach requires to be applied in various conditions to uncorrelate specific TM impacts from those of other environmental factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Life cycle assessment is applied to assess the environmental benefits and trade-offs of a solar-assisted heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system installed in the CIESOL building in Almeria (southeastern Spain). The environmental performance of this system is compared to that of a conventional HVAC system using a heat pump. The study evaluates these systems from cradle to grave, and the impact assessment includes, in addition to the CML2001 method, an impact category dealing with impacts on freshwater resources. The results show that the solar-assisted HVAC involves lower impacts in many impact categories, achieving, as an example, a reduction of 80% in greenhouse-gas emissions. On the other hand, key weak points of this system are the production of capital goods, but specially water use for cooling, due to its high impact on freshwater resources. Minimization of water requirements should be a priority for further development of this promising technology.

AB  - We report the ability to modify microscopic 3D topographies within dissociated cultures, providing a means to alter the development of neurons as they extend neurites and establish interconnections. In this approach, multiphoton excitation is used to focally excite noncytotoxic photosensitizers that promote protein crosslinking, such as BSA, into matrices having feature sizes greater than or equal to250 nm. Barriers, growth lanes, and pinning structures comprised of crosslinked proteins are fabricated under conditions that do not compromise the viability of neurons both on short time scales and over periods of days. In addition, the ability to fabricate functional microstructures from crosslinked avidin enables submicrometer localization of controllable quantities of biotinylated ligands, such as indicators and biological effectors. Feasibility is demonstrated for using in situ microfabrication to guide the contact position of cortical neurons with micrometer accuracy, opening the possibility for engineering well defined sets of synaptic interactions.

AB  - The frequency of chromosome damage was studied in the carriers of virus of the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (Puumala virus) and in noninfected animals from two laboratory colonies and two natural populations of bank vole. In the laboratory colony, where Puumala virus persisted for three years, multiaberrant ("rogue") cells were found in the bone marrow; the mean frequencies of both structural and numeral chromosome abnormalities were significantly enhanced. In the other laboratory colony, no Puumala virus was detected during all 30 years of its existence, but the mean frequencies of structural chromosome damage were increased to the same degree probably due to the prolonged breeding under laboratory conditions, which resulted in suppression of immunity and DNA repair. The voles from the natural populations were more resistant to the clastogenic viral effect, but they also had multiaberrant cells which served as indicators of viral infection. The data obtained support the hypothesis that viral infections increase mutation rate, contributing thereby to the evolution process.

AB  - Field measurements of moisture content of several fine fuels (shrub vegetation and live foliage) were performed in Central Portugal and in Catalunya (NE Spain) for 1-10 years. Seasonal and interannual variation of live fine fuels of several species in two regions of the Iberian Peninsula are analysed. The species were grouped in three sets according to their relatively high, intermediate or low seasonal variability. Meteorological data from nearby stations were collected in each study area and used in the evaluation of some indicators of fuel moisture that are used in the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, namely the Drought Code (DC). It was found that in the summer season the slow response of live fine fuel moisture content (LFFMC) to meteorological conditions, namely to precipitation, was well described by the DC. Empirical correlations between LFFMC and DC for each species and site are proposed.

T2  - REVUE D ETUDES COMPARATIVES EST-OUEST

AB  - The countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have experienced increases in morbidity and mortality in both command and transition periods. These adverse trends in health production have been caused both by deterioration in health conditions (demographic, consumption, environmental) and by problems in medical systems and supporting health institutions, such as pharmacies and pharmaceutical industry enterprises. Determinants of the deficiencies in medical care have been the malfunctioning of command and transition economic systems and the continued low priority status of health sectors. Effective reforms of health institutions would result in improvements in the performance of medical systems and national health indicators. However, health sector reforms in most countries in the 1990s have been flawed in design and implementation and have had modest beneficial impacts. Although health trends in the East have become more positive in recent years, they are unlikely to converge rapidly with those in Western Europe unless health sector institutions in transition countries obtain more resources and improve their efficiency and effectiveness.

AB  - Whether a microbe is free-living or associated with a host from across the tree of life, its existence depends on a limited number of elements and electron donors and acceptors. Yet divergent approaches have been used by investigators from different fields. The "environment first" research tradition emphasizes thermodynamics and biogeochemical principles, including the quantification of redox environments and elemental stoichiometry to identify transformations and thus an underlying microbe. The increasingly common "microbe first" research approach benefits from culturing and/or DNA sequencing methods to first identify a microbe and encoded metabolic functions. Here, the microbe itself serves as an indicator for environmental conditions and transformations. We illustrate the application of both approaches to the study of microbiomes and emphasize how both can reveal the selection of microbial metabolisms across diverse environments, anticipate alterations to microbiomes in host health, and understand the implications of a changing climate for microbial function.

AB  - The vegetation structure is a good indicator of the conservation condition of an ecosystem, since it reflects alterations caused by anthropic action. This study proposes to analyze the phytosociological aspects of the Caatinga domain under anthropic disturbance and their correlations with hydrological variables. Twenty-five 400 m(2) plots were sampled in the municipality of Floresta - PE, Brazil. Phytosociological parameters such as density, frequency and dominance were calculated. The seasonality of plant area index was analyzed for six species. The association between structural characteristics and hydrological variables (throughfall, stemflow and interception loss) in the species was evaluated by multivariate analysis. A total of 930 individuals, six families and 10 species were recorded. The abundance of the species Cenostigma pyramidale in the area may be an indicator of the degree of change in the vegetation. The structural characteristics of the species revealed little association with rainfall partitioning.

AB  - The long-term statistical rule is one of the important questions for stochastic pollution-population dynamical models, thus it would be worth looking for the stationary distribution as an indicator in analysing the effects of toxicant and noises on the variation of population in evolution process. In present paper, we investigate a stochastic single-species model under regime switching in a polluted environment. By use of the ergodic of Markov chain and constructing Lyapunov function, the sufficient conditions for the positive recurrence and ergodic property are established, which imply the existence of stationary distribution of the model. Moreover, the mean and variance of marginal stationary distribution are estimated. Our analysis indicates that the coloured noise and toxicant may play an important role in determining the shape of stationary distribution and its statistics characteristics. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to support our theoretical results.

AB  - A stabilized discontinuous Galerkin method is developed for general hyperelastic materials at finite strains. Starting from a mixed method incorporating Lagrange multipliers along the interface, the displacement formulation is systematically derived through a variational multiscale approach whereby the numerical fine scales are modeled via edge bubble functions. Analytical expressions that are free from user-defined parameters arise for the weighted numerical flux and stability tensor. In particular, the specific form taken by these derived quantities naturally accounts for evolving geometric nonlinearity as well as discontinuous material properties. The method is applicable both to problems containing nonconforming meshes or different element types at specific interfaces and to problems consisting of fully discontinuous numerical approximations. Representative numerical tests involving large strains and rotations are performed to confirm the robustness of the method. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Microtubule dynamics in neurons play critical roles in physiology, injury and disease and determine microtubule orientation, the cell biological correlate of neurite polarization. Several microtubule binding proteins, including end-binding protein 3 (EB3), specifically bind to the growing plus tip of microtubules. In the past, fluorescently tagged end-binding proteins have revealed microtubule dynamics in vitro and in non-mammalian model organisms. Here, we devise an imaging assay based on transgenic mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein-tagged EB3 to study microtubules in intact mammalian neurites. Our approach allows measurement of microtubule dynamics in vivo and ex vivo in peripheral nervous system and central nervous system neurites under physiological conditions and after exposure to microtubule-modifying drugs. We find an increase in dynamic microtubules after injury and in neurodegenerative disease states, before axons show morphological indications of degeneration or regrowth. Thus increased microtubule dynamics might serve as a general indicator of neurite remodelling in health and disease.

AB  - Commercial buildings play a major role in determining U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, yet surprisingly little is known about the environmental performance of different buildings at a point in time or how the same buildings perform over time. By exploiting a unique panel of commercial buildings from a major electric utility, we study the association between a building's electricity consumption and the physical attributes of buildings, lease incentive terms, indicators of human capital, and climatic conditions. We find that buildings that are newer and of higher quality consume more electricity, contrasting evidence for the residential sector. However, using our panel data set, we document that newer buildings are most resilient when exposed to hotter weather. Those buildings that have a building manager on-site and whose tenants face a positive marginal cost for electricity also demonstrate a better environmental performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper we compare two approaches for uncertainty propagation in a model for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). A purely Probabilistic (PMC) and a Hybrid probabilistic-possibilistic Monte Carlo (HMC) method are considered in their application for the estimation of the ground level concentration of dioxin/furans emitted from a waste gasification plant. Under the condition of insufficient information for calibrating the estimation model parameters, HMC is shown to be a valid way for properly propagating parameters uncertainty to the model output, without adopting arbitrary and subjective assumptions on the input probability distribution functions. In this sense, HMC could improve the transparency of the EIA procedures with positive effects on the communicability and credibility of its findings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of sex factor is widely recognized in various diseases, but its molecular basis, particularly how sex-biased genes, those with sexually dimorphic expression, behave in response to toxico-pathological changes is poorly understood. In this study, zebrafish toxicogenomic data and transcriptomic data from human pathological studies were analysed for the responses of male- and female-biased genes. Our analyses revealed obvious inverted expression profiles of sex-biased genes, where affected males tended to up-regulate genes of female-biased expression and down-regulate genes of male-biased expression, and vice versa in affected females, in a broad range of toxico-pathological conditions. Intriguingly, the extent of these inverted profiles correlated well to the susceptibility or severity of a given toxico-pathological state, suggesting that inverted expression profiles of sex-biased genes observed in this study can be used as important indicators to assess biological disorders.

AB  - A new multiple-effect desalination system in vacuum powered by geothermal energy considered as clean and renewable natural energy resource is proposed. Every effect includes an evaporator and a condenser which are composed of heat pipes to work in vacuum. The performance of one effect was studied by employing a mathematical model based on energy and mass balance equations. The performance of system was evaluated through several indicators: performance ratio, heat transfer area of per-water production, and coefficient of performance. The results showed that freshwater production ratio increased with the geothermal water flow and geothermal temperature, but could not increase with the condensation vacuum enhancing. In conclusion, the analysis has shown that geothermal resource in the temperature range of 50-100 degrees C has a good potential to power seawater vacuum desalination system. It would be beneficial for people in the areas with abundant seawater/brackish water resources and good geothermal conditions.

AB  - The targeted selective treatments (TST) aim at reducing the number of anthelmintic treatments but also to maintain productivity of animals. The aim of this work was to assess the validity of pathophysiological indicators for detecting individually ewes in need for treatments in two regions of Morocco with different management and climatic environment (Chaouia plain-seven farms, and Middle-Atlas-three farms). Although resistance to benzimidazoles was already present the same drug was used for TST. The indicators tested were: FAMACHA (c) (associated with anaemia), DISCO (diarrhoea score), and BODCON (body condition score). Only FAMACHA (c) and DISCO indicators were well correlated to the EPGs. DISCO only did permit a substantial reduction (up to 85%) of the number of treatment and EPG (nematode eggs per gramme) remained low on average (less than 160). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Russian experience of the local reconstruction of the Eurasian steppe climate during the last 5000 years based on geoarchaeological approaches is reviewed. Examples of traditional palaeoclimatic reconstructions in Russia based on organic matter, highly soluble salts and gypsum content and location of salts and gypsum horizons in the profile of buried soils are given. Pedogenic carbonate as a palaeoclimatic indicator is considered. The possibilities of the quantitative reconstruction of the palaeoprecipitation based on magnetic properties of buried soils are observed. The innovative approach of palaeoclimatic reconstruction based on soil microbiology methods is reviewed. The problem of temporary transformation of palaeoclimatic indicators in buried soils is shown. A methodology for the interpretation of palaeoclimatic indicators of buried soils for a local palaeoclimatic reconstruction is given.

AB  - Due to their high phenotypic plasticity, the expression of secondary sexual characteristics is particularly sensitive to stress. Here, we investigated the expression of two conspicuous visual signals in great tits (Parus major) in a metal pollution gradient. In three study sites with marked differences in metal contamination (mainly lead, cadmium, copper and zinc), we compared melanin and carotenoid colouration of great tits. While carotenoid colouration (yellow breast) was negatively related to metal pollution, the size of a melanin trait (breast stripe) was larger in the most polluted sites. Environmental pollutants not only affect the expression of conspicuous signals but may even enhance, directly or indirectly, a signal of male quality such as breast stripe. Our results also support the multiple messages hypothesis predicting that different signals highlight different aspects of geno- and phenotypic condition of the bearer.

KW  - CULTIVATION
AB  - Environmental certification is becoming the main toot for applications of sustainable development principles. The European Regulation Emas and the international standard ISO 14001 both require for certification, to perform environmental management system to prevent environmental impacts and to continuously improve environmental performance. For a good environmental performance evaluation (EPE), certification needs to use scientific methodologies and to interface with scientific research; here we proposed emergy analysis as a valid method for EPE and emergetic environmental performance and condition indicators (EPIs, ECIs) to monitor a territorial system: Ravenna province (Italy). Together with emergy indicators were selected other indicators for a deeper EPE: emitted/adsorbed CO2, energy consumptions, air and water pollution measures. The paper showed that Ravenna system has a good environmental performance and demonstrated how different indicators from the most advanced chemical research (chemical-physical, analytical, etc.) contribute to a complete EPE of a complex territorial system and are useful for environmental certification and sustainable development.

AB  - Two antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli strains and two host-specific coliphage strains were evaluated in a shallow-placed low pressure distribution (LPD) system placed in a soil that was unsuitable for a conventional system because of shallow depth to a restrictive soil horizon. Four independent LPD subsystems were installed with loading rates of 4.5, 5.7, 9.0, (loading rates based on Virginia regulations), and 17.5 L d-1 m-2; narrow trench design). The evaluation was conducted under different moisture and temperature conditions (summer 1989, and the winter 1990) and focused on the fate and transport of the biological tracers below each subsystem. All subsystems performed equally well with respect to hydraulic performance and retention of the biological tracers. Results indicated that > 99.9% of the bacterial and coliphage tracers were retained within the subsystems during the summer of 1989, and > 99% were retained during the winter of 1990.

AB  - Occurrence and coexistence of benthic communities of 9 stations in the northern limb of Cochin backwaters where an industrial belt (mostly chemical industries) is located are studied. Polychaetes with 30 species are the most common among groups present at all the stations. Capitella capitata which showed high density near the effluent discharge site is proposed as an indicator of pollution. Dendronereis aestuarina present at all stations and in high densities at sts 5, 6 and 8, can be considered as a pollution resistant species. Lycastis indica, Paraheteromastus tenuis, Telehspia annandalei, chironimid larvae and Pendora flexosa present at st 8, even-though in very low numbers, can be treated as pollution tolerant species. The number and the size of the clusters show a steady decline from sts 1 to 8. Maximum affinity is for adjacent stations and never exceeded 60%. Negative affinity indices obtained are deemed indicative of the varied environmental conditions. Results indicate limited spatial migration and possible niche separation.

AB  - A transport system is planned and operated to provide safe, efficient, effective, social and environmentally friendly services to its users - passengers and freight/cargo shippers. These service attributes have also become increasingly important for supporting the future development of contemporary society. At the same time, the system and its modes has been frequently affected by different internal and external disruptive events, usually resulting in the deterioration of the planned performance of transport services. To successfully cope with such conditions, the transport system must be sufficiently reliable, that is, resistant to damage or capable of providing services with a level of performance as close as planned while being affected at the same time. This paper deals with an approach to analysing and modelling the reliability of transport services. This includes elaboration of a concept of reliability, development of analytical models for reliability indicators, and application of these models of indicators to selected cases of road and rail transport services.

AB  - An experimental fire was conducted in 2016, in the Pinelands National Reserve of New Jersey, to assess the reliability of the fire pattern indicators used in wildland fire investigation. Objects were planted in the burn area to support the creation of the indicators. Fuel properties and environmental data were recorded. Video and infrared cameras were used to document the general fire behavior. This work represents the first step in the analysis by developing an experimental protocol suitable for field studies and describing how different fire indicators appeared in relation to fire behavior. Most of the micro- and macroscale indicators were assessed. The results show that some indicators are highly dependent on local fire conditions and may contradict the general fire spread. Overall, this study demonstrates that fire pattern indicators are a useful tool for fire investigators but that they must be interpreted through a general analysis of the fire behavior with a good understanding of fire dynamics.

Moreover, products applied to preserve outdoor built heritage and their preliminary performance tests often turn out to be improper. In such context, the paper reports the outcomes of the methodology adopted to assess the durability and efficiency of nano-based consolidating products utilized for the conservation of carbonate artworks, performing field exposure tests on Carraramarblemodel samples in different sites in the framework of the EC Project NANOMATCH. Surface properties and cohesion, extent and penetration of the conservative products and their interactions with marble substrates and environmental conditions are here examined after outdoor exposure for eleven months in four different European cities and compared with the features of undamaged and of untreated damaged specimens undergoing the same exposure settings.

AB  - This study was based on sedimentary midge (Diptera: Nematocera) assemblages from multilake datasets along environmental transects from Finland (regional), southern Finland (semiregional), and Helsinki district (local) and an intralake dataset from eastern Finland (site-specific). The aim was to examine scale-dependencies in midge distribution. The results imply that distribution and abundance of midge taxa are related to scale: on the regional scale the forcing factors are related to prevailing climate conditions, on semiregional scale they are related to water quality, on more local scales predation pressure is the key variable and on site-specific scales habitat characteristics determine the species assemblages. Although the number of study sites was not equal and not all environmental parameters were possible to measure from all spatial scales, it is apparent that caution is required in midge-based environmental assessments, because changes in faunal composition are driven by factors operating at different spatial scales.

AB  - Fungal spores are an important component of bioaerosol and also considered to act as indicator of the level of atmospheric bio-pollution. Therefore, better understanding of these phenomena demands a detailed survey of airborne particles.
   The objective of this study was to examine the dependence of two the most important allergenic taxa of airborne fungi Alternaria and Cladosporium on meteorological parameters and air pollutant concentrations during three consecutive years (2006-2008). This study is also an attempt to create artificial neural network (ANN) forecasting models useful in the prediction of aeroallergen abundance.
   There were statistically significant relationships between spore concentration and environmental parameters as well as pollutants, confirmed by the Spearman's correlation rank analysis and high performance of the ANN models obtained. The concentrations of Cladosporium and Alternaria spores can be predicted with quite good accuracy from meteorological conditions and air pollution recorded three days earlier. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Water quality in chloraminated distribution systems is affected by microbial activity, particularly due to nitrifiers that accelerate chloramine decay. in summer, continuous thermal stratification increases retention time and lowers chloramine residual in some parts of a system service reservoir (tank), relative to fully mixed conditions. According to temperature and chemical indicators, cooling in winter destratifies these reservoirs naturally. Traditional (chemical) indicators of nitrification also suggest that destratification occurs with respect to microbiological activity. in contrast, the microbial decay factor (F(m)) method, which separates microbiological and chemical decay in bulk water, identifies strong microbial stratification, even in winter. F(m) can also be used to predict the exacerbated loss of chloramine residual in the following summer, which enables early intervention by system managers to minimise such loss, and so maintain an adequate residual through the distribution system.

TI  - Agricultural research for development in the Mexican highlands: Collaboration between a research team and campesinos
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Despite important technological achievements, agricultural research in Mexico has had little impact on the improvement of rural livelihoods in the mountains of Central Mexico. The reason for this is its failure to focus on the development of highland campesino agriculture. The Centro de Investigacion en Ciencias Agropecuarias (CICA, Research Center in Agricultural Science) of the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico has set itself the objective of using research to improve living conditions in campesino households and communities. This places CICA at the interface between research and development. A participatory research project on the management of agrodiversity by indigenous campesinos in San Pablo Tialchichilpa, in the mountains of the State of Mexico (figure 1), underlines the importance of taking into account all environmental, social, economic and technological aspects of campesino agriculture as well as the interactions between these elements. Without a more profound understanding of these elements, research cannot contribute to improving campesino livelihoods in a sustainable way.

AB  - Velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.) was used as a bioindicator to examine factors (temperature, soil moisture, soil incorporation) which might influence clomazone {2-[(2-chlorophenyl)methyl]-4,4-dimethyl-3-isoxazolidinone} volatilization. Young plants were periodically exposed to atmosphere inside boxes containing clomazone-treated soil. Exposed plants were returned to the greenhouse for 5 to 7 d, and new leaves were assayed for chlorophyll. Maximum chlorophyll inhibition occurred in velvetleaf exposed during the first 2 wk after clomazone application. Reductions in degree of bleaching were first observed in plants exposed in the treatments with lower soil moisture (2% moisture at 19 days after clomazone treatment, DAT; 9% at 42 DAT). The least amount of clomazone was measured in soils incubated in the 35 degrees C treatment, indicating elevated temperatures enhanced volatilization, and may have contributed to the increased chlorophyll content observed observed earlier than other temperatures. The effect of herbicide incorporation was not conclusive. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd

TI  - Environmental magnetic implications of greigite (Fe3S4) formation in a 3 my lake sediment record from Butte Valley, northern California
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
LA  - English
KW  - TRANSITION
AB  - Authigenic greigite (Fe3S4) has been identified in several horizons of lake beds in a 102-m core from Butte Valley, northern California, using mineral magnetic methods and x-ray diffraction analysis. The presence of greigite has several implications for the paleoenvironmental record from Butte Valley. First, its occurrence in 2.5 - 3.0 Ma strata confirms that greigite can persist in the geological record for long periods of time. Second, the detrital mineral magnetic record may be partially obscured by the presence of authigenic greigite and care must be taken in interpreting magnetic variations in the greigite-bearing zones as paleoclimate proxies. Third, differences in the timing of remanence acquisition for authigenic and detrital phases may compromise studies of high-frequency geomagnetic field variations. Fourth, greigite may also be significant as a paleoenvironmental indicator of lake and sediment chemistry, The magnetic detection of greigite may therefore provide important information about paleolimnological conditions.

AB  - In this work, two kinds of water-soluble chitosan derivatives (succinylated chitosan and hydroxypropyl chitosan) were used as substrates to prepare indicator label for detecting CO2 concentration. The mixed-dyes of bromocresol blue and methyl red indicators were investigated and the results of SEM test revealed that the mixed indicator could be uniformly dispersed in the transparent membranes. The color differences of the indicator label under different environmental conditions (humidity and temperature) were highly correlated with the CO2 concentration. The values of label membranes' color difference (delta E) showed a good linear relationship with the CO2 content. Subsequently, these label membranes were successfully applied to reveal the evolution of the CO2 content in fruit packaging to indicate the freshness of fruit. Therefore, these chitosan derivative-based indicator label membranes assume a promising application prospect in the future.

AB  - Polyhydroxybutyrate production in the bacteria Azohydromonas lata DSM1123 has been regarded as growth-associated based on batch experiments. However, growth association can only be confirmed under chemostat culture. In this work, an experimental approach followed by Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) modeling was used to analyze the behavior of this strain under glucose, oxygen, and nitrogen-limited conditions. The model allowed the identification of candidate enzymes constraining the flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the role of ATP synthase as the key flux controlling enzyme for the respiratory metabolism, in terms of its share of the total metabolically active protein. The results presented in this work and the model developed could assist in the economic and environmental assessment of new continuous processes to produce PHB and other metabolites in A. lata DSM1123, a strain capable of hydrogen use and CO2 fixation.

AB  - To promote the recycling of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP), catalytic cracking of hazardous gases generated by thermal decomposition from epoxy-based CFRP composites was performed. We aimed for selective phenol recovery and hazardous gas removal using a zeolite catalyst. The BEA-type zeolite with Si/Al = 92.5 showed high conversion and low naphthalene selectivity. Thermal decomposition at 500 degrees C produced bisphenol from the epoxy resin in the CFRP. Then, bisphenol was decomposed into phenol, cresol, and methylbenzofuran over the zeolite catalyst. However, naphthalene was formed under long contact time conditions. The temperature for catalytic cracking could be decreased to 350 degrees C, which was lower than that for the CFRP thermal decomposition (around 500 degrees C). Therefore, the process of selective phenol recovery and hazardous gas removal from CFRP thermal decomposition gas can be driven by the waste heat generated during CFRP thermal decomposition.

AB  - A preliminary assessment of conditions for the industrial manufacture of a new cementitious system based on clinker-calcined clay and limestone, developed by the authors, referred as "low carbon cement" is presented. The new cement enables the substitution of more than 50% of the mass of clinker without compromising performance. The paper presents the follow-up of an industrial trial carried out in Cuba to produce 130 tonnes of the new cement at a cement plant. The new material proved to fulfill national standards in applications such as the manufacture of hollow concrete blocks and precast concrete. No major differences either in the rheological or mechanical properties were found when compared with Portland cement. Environmental assessment of the ternary cement was made, which included comparison with other blended cements produced industrially in Cuba. The new cement has proven to contribute to the reduction of above 30% of carbon - emissions on cement manufacture.

AB  - In this article we analyse the effects of the Liberal Revolution in rural areas of Southern Spain. Several hypotheses are posited on the interaction among equity in the distribution of agricultural income, production and environmental effects during the 19th century. We focus on the case of Montefrio, located in the province of Granada. First, the evolution of land use is analysed and agricultural production is estimated between the mid-18th and early 20th century. The varying rates of population growth in this period are shown as well as their interaction with land use. Then the effects of the liberal land reform are presented, taking into account the distribution of land ownership, livestock and agricultural work. Finally we assess social and environmental consequences using a series of indicators. As a result, it is clear that there was a deterioration in living conditions in the late 19th century despite the improved distribution of land ownership.

AB  - Successful identification of specularities in an image can be crucial for an artificial vision system when extracting the semantic content of an image or while interacting with the environment. We developed an algorithm that relies on scale and rotation invariant feature extraction techniques and uses motion cues to detect and localize specular surfaces. Appearance change in feature vectors is used to quantify the appearance distortion on specular surfaces, which has previously been shown to be a powerful indicator for specularity (Doerschner et al. in Curr Biol, 2011). The algorithm combines epipolar deviations (Swaminathan et al. in Lect Notes Comput Sci 2350:508-523, 2002) and appearance distortion, and succeeds in localizing specular objects in computer-rendered and real scenes, across a wide range of camera motions and speeds, object sizes and shapes, and performs well under image noise and blur conditions.

AB  - Environmental pollution by anti-influenza drugs is increasingly recognized as a threat to aquatic environments. However, little is known about empirical data on risk effects posed by environmentally relevant concentrations of anti-influenza drug based on recently published ecotoxicological researches in Taiwan. Here we linked ecotoxicology models with an epidemiological scheme to assess exposure risks of aquatic organisms and environmental hazards posed by antiviral oseltamivir (Tamiflu) use in Taiwan. Built on published bioassays, we used probabilistic risk assessment model to estimate potential threats of environmentally relevant hazards on algae, daphnid, and zerbrafish. We found that Tamiflu use was unlikely to pose a significant chronic environmental risk to daphnia and zebrafish during seasonal influenza. However, the chronic environmental risk posed by Tamiflu use during pandemic was alarming. We conclude that no significant risk to algal growth was found during seasonal influenza and high pandemic Tamiflu use. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To assess the likely effects on three coexisting species of Australian freshwater fish of riparian loss, we examined the temperature, light, and habitat preferences of each species in relation to commonly documented effects of riparian degradation on stream environments. Such effects include reduced shade, instream structure, and water depth and increased temperature and invasive instream vegetation. Xiphophorus helleri, Gambusia holbrooki, and Melanotaenia duboulayi differed significantly in mean swimming depth, preferences for light and habitat, and in their patterns of behavioural change through the day. Values of interspecific spatial overlap (25-58%) indicated that the overall environmental preferences of G. holbrooki, X helleri, and M. duboulayi were reasonably distinct. Habitat alterations associated with riparian removal are likely to favour the exotic species G. holbrooki over the native species M. duboulayi, but the results for X. helleri suggest that not all poeciliid species are strong indicators of degraded conditions.

AB  - The need for regulatory models for predicting the impact of atmospheric emissions, both for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies and in the frame of Air Quality Management Plans (AQMP), is well known to the Italian technical-scientific community, and is acknowledged also by decisionmakers. Some specific features of the Italian territory, e.g. complex orography, land-sea discontinuity and very low wind-speed, make it very difficult to propose simple semi-empirical models originally conceived for homogeneous and stationary conditions. Moreover, for some pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, ozone and fine particulates, physical-chemical processes also need to be considered. This situation, shared with several other countries, particularly of the Mediterranean area, makes it very challenging to combine reliability with simplicity. This paper describes the activities that are being undertaken in Italy for setting up a national system for atmospheric dispersion regulatory models, taking into account the above mentioned issues.

AB  - The aim of the research was to determine the values of selected antioxidant indicators in horse and the possibility of the modulation of the antioxidant system. The research was performed at early spring in a group of horses kept in similar feeding and environmental conditions. Catosal was administered i.m. at a daily dose of 20 mi per animal for 6 days. Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, total antiozidant status and ceruloplasmine, malondialdehyde and ascorbic acid levels were measured. Furthermore haematological parameters were determined. Determinations were performed before Catosal was administrated and at the 2nd and 7 th days after the last injection. Results showed a significant temporal rise of the superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity. A week after the last injection of Catosal a significant rise in the total antioxidant status, ceruloplasmine level and the number of erythrocytes was ascertained. At the same time an improvement of the horses general health status indicated by increased appetite and more vivid temperament was also observed.

AB  - This paper investigates linkages between ICTs, passenger transportation, and environmental sustainability with regard to a panel dataset of 46 countries over the years 1998-2016. Telephone and internet penetration are employed to measure ICTs, while environmental damages are proxied in terms of three different indicators related to carbon emissions coming from different sources. The empirical methodology employs the 2-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) with the consideration of two empirical specifications: without and with conditioning variables (per capita GDP growth, urbanization, and energy consumption). The findings show that the association between ICTs and passenger transportation activity can positively affect environmental sustainability with regard to carbon emission reductions. Second, the adoption of the telephone in the road transport sector is more efficient than the internet in reducing carbon emissions. Third, internet connectivity is better employed in the air and rail passenger sectors. Public policies and their effective implementations are discussed.

AB  - To understand the health impact represented by exposure to current atmospheric pollution in China, an environmental health indicators (EHIs) system of atmospheric pollution was established. The EHIs were based on comprehensive consideration of environment, population, economy and diseases associated with atmospheric pollution. An EHIs evaluation system of atmospheric pollution, based on corresponding EHIs data collection and weighting coefficients determined using principal component analysis, was applied to major provinces and regions in China to evaluate the environmental health status. Results showed that the EHIs of atmospheric pollution in Central and East China were low, indicating a serious environmental health condition. Prevention and management of atmospheric pollution in these regions should be strengthened and protective measures taken to improve human health. Compared with other methods, the EHIs evaluation system was more intuitive, which facilitated users to identify the environmental health status and provided support for health management and pollution prevention.

AB  - The European Union is made up of countries that differ significantly in their economic development. In order to develop tailored strategies for their development, it should be possible to quantify the condition at a desired point in particular time. Again, on this basis, the process of economic development can be quantified and thus typicalities identified. The process is characterized by several parameters: intensity, which reflects the quantitative side of the development process; homogeneity reflecting upon the qualitative side of the development process, and dynamics, integrating development intensity and homogeneity into one generalizing mean. The values of the economic development process make it possible to divide all the countries of the European Union into three levels. This distinction allows for a differentiated analysis of the effects of economic development of countries in terms of their social, environmental and other development.

AB  - Biochar has seen an explosion of research over the past decade as an environmentally sustainable material for enhancing agricultural yields, treating wastewater, and sequestering atmospheric carbon. In contrast, there is a lack of research into the social and economic sustainability of biochar. To address this gap, we propose environmental justice (EJ) indicators as a proxy for social and economic considerations when siting biochar production facilities. Specifically, we develop a siting index for a biochar pyrolysis facility using low-cost, carbon-neutral solar energy. This siting index provides a framework for analyzing potential facility locations based on both technical and environmental and energy justice considerations. Results indicate that EJ analyses may influence the planning processes for industrial facility siting and that incorporating EJ into siting decisions would represent a commitment to environmental sustainability as well as the social and economic conditions of communities.

AB  - Recent technology developments have turned present-day unmanned systems into realistic alternatives to traditional marine animal survey methods. Benefits include longer survey durations, improved mission safety, mission repeatability, and reduced operational costs. We review the present status of unmanned vehicles suitable for marine animal monitoring conducted in relation to industrial offshore activities, highlighting which systems are suitable for three main monitoring types: population, mitigation, and focal animal monitoring. We describe the technical requirements for each of these monitoring types and discuss the operational aspects. The selection of a specific sensor/platform combination depends critically on the target species and its behaviour. The technical specifications of unmanned platforms and sensors also need to be selected based on the surrounding conditions of a particular offshore project, such as the area of interest, the survey requirements and operational constraints.

AB  - Ketone bodies such as beta-hydroxybutyrate are important indicators of metabolic condition in birds and are linked to a suite of ecologically relevant factors including migratory decision-making, hunger level and ectoparasite load. Portable point-of-care (POC) devices designed to measure ketones in humans offer a cheap and easy solution to field physiologists in comparison with previous laboratory methods; however, their accuracy for use in birds has received scant attention. Here, we assessed the accuracy of a POC ketone meter (FreeStyle Precision Neo, Abbott, IL, USA) using samples from intermittently fed Red Junglefowl Gallus gallus. Although the device overestimated ketone levels in comparison with laboratory-derived values, random error was low and laboratory vs. device values correlated well, indicating that the Precision Neo is of sufficient accuracy for use in the field and is a pragmatic choice for avian physiologists.

AB  - In this research, the amine functionalized magnetic silica-based nanocomposite as a solid-phase extraction adsorbent coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography was applied for the preconcentration and determination of Sudan dyes in environmental waters and a food sample. The synthesized core-shell Fe3O4@silica nanoparticles were functionalized with amino groups and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. The experimental parameters optimized and under the best conditions, the sorbent was successfully used to extract the target analytes. The result showed that a good linearity with a r-value of greater 0.990, and the limits of detection were from 0.082 to 0.12 mu g L-1. The relative recoveries obtained by analysing the spiked water samples were in the range of 90-102% and the relative standard deviations were between 0.590 and 7.94%.

AB  - Processes for the removal of organic micro-pollutants (OMPs) from wastewater treatment plant's (WWTPs) effluents have been tested over decades, and have recently found their way into practice. Operators of WWTPs are confronted with the question of efficiency and the choice of economical process (combination). So far, a systematic approach regarding the selection of the appropriate process (combinations) is missing. There is no information available which technology is best suited for removal of OMPs and other conventional pollutants for good conditions in waterbodies. This study evaluates 52 pilot and full-scale studies regarding their removal efficiencies of various OMPs by advanced processes (adsorption and ozonation) in combination with/without filtration. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the complex state of knowledge and show that technical synergy effects enable the reduction of a wide range of OMP in combination with other conventional parameters, e.g. solids and phosphorous.

AB  - Anatomical characteristics of Ferula iliensis leaf blades of different age from three different populations; growing in the eastern part of Zaliliyskiy Alatay (Big Boguty Mountains, Kazakhstan); were analyzed. In all the plants from investigated populations a single type of blade formation and xero-mesomorphic structure was determined. The planar polarity of the blade showed multilayer of palisade mesophyll, a characteristic for all plants. Most of the covering hairs on the pubescent leaves are located on the lower side of the blades. The leaf type in general is xero-mesomorphic. The differences are mainly of quantitative character and are related to the environmental conditions of the plants. The leaf structure reflects the result of plant adaptation to various environmental factors, so the information on the leaf structure complements the environmental characteristics of the plants and improves the idea of its range of plasticity.

AB  - Metabolic footprints provide metrics for the magnitudes of ecosystem functions and services provided by component organisms of the soil food web. Nematodes occupy various trophic roles and perform important functions within the web. They are convenient indicators of similar functions performed by other organisms in the web and are well-documented indicators of ecosystem condition. The generally vermiform shapes of nematodes, and the standardized morphometric characteristics used in their description, facilitate assessment of body volume and weight. Prescribed coefficients allow calculation of their carbon metabolism. Their production of body structure and eggs can be standardized for life course duration. Consequently, standardized metabolic activity levels, attributable to the abundance of nematodes performing various functional roles, can be calculated from existing and accessible morphometric data. Metabolic footprints of nematode assemblages provide measures of ecosystem services performed by each functional guild. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Focusing critically on the effects of the conditions for foreign direct investment on sustainable growth in the recipient country, this paper analyzes the potential for investments in environmental innovations in India. The definition of sustainability applied in this paper incorporates economic development and investment which promotes environmentally and socially friendly production and innovation. As the Indian economy experienced strong growth in GDP in recent years, but is still lagging behind in providing the basic needs of clean water, clean air and proper waste management for households and companies, the necessity for sustainable development exists. From a methodological point of view this paper uses macroeconomic data to evaluate quantitatively the potentials and needs of Indian states. This results in a state ranking showing the potential for sustainable development in selected Indian states, based on economic and environmental indicators.

AB  - Salt cedars (Tamarix) are invasive halophytic species and heavy water consumers. However, Tamarix possesses interesting characteristics accounting for its opportunistic and resilient abilities: analogous to a miniature photodesalinization machine, it thrives on saline soils toxic to most plants. Here we observe, document, and reveal the salt separation process of T. ramosissima. Specimens were cultivated under controlled artificial conditions, then analyzed by microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Tamarix ramosissima is shown to produce varied morphologies of salt crystal aggregates from vesiculated trichomes and possess the ability to separate anions and cations. Sodium chloride, potassium chloride (KCl), and potassium sodium sulfate [K2.25Na1.75(SO4)2] were major exuded salt crystal phases, with smaller quantities of other phases present. Compositions of crystals exuded by individual plants were consistent with compositions of the soils they grew on. Although T. ramosissima may be an invasive nuisance, it may possess other worthwhile attributes such as the potential to be a viable phytoremediator and environmental indicator.

AB  - While benthic algal biomass is one of the most commonly measured variables within littoral communities, it is also one of the most poorly characterized. The use of chlorophyll a as an estimate of biomass, while easy and inexpensive, can be affected by changes in environmental conditions and algal community composition. Biovolume-based measurements often have high variability and are affected by changes in cell volume due to preservation. Using 12 years of data from the Experimental Lakes Area (northwestern Ontario, Canada) as well as short-term surveys and experimental Studies from the Experimental Lakes Area and the Canadian Rocky Mountains, we demonstrate that biovolume and chlorophyll a are often decoupled in the littoral zone of temperate oligotrophic lakes. We recommend that researchers revisit the limitations of both metrics and specifically caution against the use of chlorophyll a as a biomass indicator when light, temperature, or species composition vary significantly.

AB  - The origin of millet from Neolithic China has generally been accepted, but it remains unknown whether common millet (Panicum miliaceum) or foxtail millet (Setaria italica) was the first species domesticated. Nor do we know the timing of their domestication and their routes of dispersal. Here, we report the discovery of husk phytoliths and biomolecular components identifiable solely as common millet from newly excavated storage pits at the Neolithic Cishan site, China, dated to between ca. 10,300 and ca. 8,700 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP). After ca. 8,700 cal yr BP, the grain crops began to contain a small quantity of foxtail millet. Our research reveals that the common millet was the earliest dry farming crop in East Asia, which is probably attributed to its excellent resistance to drought.

AB  - Peracarid crustaceans inhabit many marine benthic habitats and are good indicators of environmental conditions. There is, however, a lack of information about diversity and distribution of peracarid crustaceans on the shallow subtidal sediments of the Galician rias. In the summer of 1997, 27 subtidal stations were sampled in the Ria de Aldan, a ria on the southern margin of the mouth of the Ria de Pontevedra (Galicia, NW Spain). A total of 16,191 peracarid individuals were collected, comprising 125 species belonging to five orders. Amphipods were dominant in number of species and individuals, followed by isopods and cumaceans. Multivariate analyses of these data indicated that depth and sediment granulometry were major determinants of distribution and composition of peracarid assemblages in the ria.

AB  - This research builds upon previous cross-national studies of deforestation. In doing so, I examine how various world-systems indicators interact with political conditions within a nation. I test the hypothesis that repressive nations create a "good business climate" for multinational capital, which, in turn, affects deforestation. This "good business climate" consists of economic incentives (e.g., tax holidays), regulatory concessions (e.g., environmental law exemptions), and imposed political stability (e.g., outlawing strikes, protests, and unions). The results indicate that export partner concentration, commodity concentration, multinational corporate penetration, and International Monetary Fund conditionality increase deforestation more at higher rather than at lower levels of repression. I also confirm previous findings that gross domestic product per capita decreases deforestation, indicating that richer nations are able to externalize their environmental costs onto poorer nations. I conclude with the theoretical implications of this research, policy implications, and possible directions for future research.

AB  - Almost two thousand mandibular teeth of the short-necked giraffid, Sivatherium hendeyi, from Lange-baanweg, South Africa, were examined for dental pathologies. Enamel hypoplasia is present in 0 to 34 percent of deciduous teeth and 40 to 75 percent of permanent teeth. No linear enamel hypoplasias were found in the deciduous teeth. while 20 to 35 percent of the permanent teeth have this defect. The linear defects at the base of the first molar are thought to relate to stress associated with weaning. The defects in the later erupting permanent teeth are, however, widely distributed over tooth crowns. Several linear defects are present on some teeth suggesting that these stress episodes were periodic. We propose that poor environmental conditions, possibly seasonal nutritional stress, are responsible for the observed enamel hypoplasia in the permanent dentition of S. hendeyi. This study provides new insight into the current understanding of the paleoenvironment at Langebaanweg, South Africa.

AB  - This study was aimed at confirming that auditory event related potential (ERP) abnormalities are indicators of vulnerability to schizophrenia. Auditory ERP performances were assessed at Fz, Ct, and Pt, with an oddball paradigm, in 21 clinically stable patients with schizophrenia, 21 of their healthy biological full siblings and 21 control subjects. The evoked response did not differ between the three groups on N200 waves. Compared to controls, patients with schizophrenia exhibited reduced amplitudes of N100 and P300, and prolonged latency of P300, while their siblings showed prolonged latency of P200 and P300. Among the patients with schizophrenia, ERP abnormalities did not correlate with age, clinical state, duration of illness or antipsychotic treatments. Although other conditions also accounted for alterations of the same type, ERP abnormalities may represent a neurobiological marker of the genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia, independent of phenotypic expression.

AB  - The middle to late Caradoc Bad Cache Rapids Formation of Southampton Island consists of three "members": a locally present thin siliciclastic unit, overlain by a highly fossiliferous wackestone, capped by a mudstone, all deposited in a broad, shallow shelf setting. This formation is, possibly unconformably, overlain by the early Ashgill Boas River Formation, comprising a lower carbonate mudstone and an upper oil shale, deposited in a local, shallow subtidal, restricted basin during a transgression. Early to middle Ashgill strata of the Churchill River Formation are made up of a lower unit with coral-bearing wackestone, representing a return to normal marine conditions, and an upper unit of noncoralliferous wackestones, indicating a regional shallowing. The latter is capped by the Sixteen Mile Brook oil shale. The middle to late Ashgill Port Nelson Formation contains evaporite casts and algal laminites, suggesting a sabkha environment. Mound-like structures in this formation may have resulted from solution collapse brought about by the removal of evaporites after lithification.

AB  - Potential intensity (PI), an upper thermodynamic limit of tropical cyclone (TC) intensity, is a useful index in TC statistical forecasting. This study evaluated the relationship between the current intensity of TCs and four PI indexes calculated with different sea surface indicators over the Western North Pacific (WNP) from 2009 to 2016. To mirror the degree of sea cooling caused by TCs, three sea surface temperature (SST) indicators (pre-SST, 80 m depth mean sea temperature, and dynamic mixed mean sea temperature) were compared with real-time SST obtained from HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) data. The results showed that four versions of PI all overestimated the current intensity of developing TCs. In contrast, when a TC at its strongest or in its weakening stages in a favorable atmospheric environment, pre-sea conditions were strongly correlated with TC intensity. For strong TCs, the ocean-coupled PI index was best able to describe TC intensity.

AB  - Driving fatigue results in the decline of driving performance and it is one of the major causes of fatal accidents. The paper aims to explore the relationship between physiological signals and driving performance under fatigue conditions. 30 drivers were selected to participate the experiment in driving simulator. The experiment started at noon and required each subject to drive 40 min in a monotonic environment. Physiological parameters including Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiograph (ECG), eye movement and heart rate were collected. Additionally, data of driving performance like steering wheel frequency, speed were recorded throughout the whole experiment, which were used to measure temporal deterioration of drivers performance. A stepwise model was developed to evaluate the association between steering wheel frequency and driver EEG. The result shows that the frequency of steering wheel is correlated with the low-frequency EEG signals. It also indicates that delta wave can be used as an alternative index of steering frequency to predict and evaluate driving performance.

AB  - This study, based on the water quality monitoring data of Meizhou Bay from 2005 to 2016, conducted an environmental quality assessment of the water pollution condition by adopting the comprehensive evaluation and the eutrophication evaluation. The results of the comprehensive evaluation from 2005 to 2016 showed that the water quality index(WQI) was between 0.40 and 1.04, and the water quality in Meizhou Bay was clean for all years except for 2016, during which the bay was lightly polluted. The results of the eutrophication index (EI) from 2005 to 2016 showed that the EI was between 0.02 and 0.34, indicating that the water in Meizhou Bay was oligotrophic. From the perspective of the environmental quality evolution of this marine area, both of the quality evaluation indexes, i.e., WQI and EI, showed a steady upward trend, which should be addressed by the relevant authorities.

AB  - The degradation mechanisms of faecal pellets are still poorly understood, although they determine their contribution to vertical fluxes of carbon. The aim of this study was to attempt to understand the microbial (bacteria and protozooplankton) degradation of faecal pellets by measuring the faecal pellet carbon-specific degradation rate (FP-CSD) as an indicator of pellet degradation. 'In situ' and 'culture' pellets (provided by the grazing of copepods in in situ water and in a culture of Rhodomonas sp. respectively) were incubated in seawater from the chlorophyll a maximum and 90 m depth, and in filtered seawater. When microbes were abundant (at the chlorophyll a maximum), they significantly increased FP-CSD. In addition, culture pellets had a higher FP-CSD than in situ pellets, suggesting that the results obtained with culture pellets should be treated with caution when trying to extrapolate to natural field conditions.

AB  - We examined life history traits of Phoxinus tennesseensis (Tennessee dace), a globally vulnerable (G3) upper Tennessee River drainage endemic, in 2 populations in Northeast Tennessee. The spawning season lasted from Apr. to Jun. Spawning occurred over the nests of Semotilus atromaculatus (creek chub) and Campostoma anomalum (central stoneroller), where large spawning aggregations of dace gathered over host species nests. Phoxinus tennesseensis populations have 4 size classes that are indicators of age classes. The mean life span of P. tennesseensis about 2 y with 1st y fish constituting a majority of the population. Fecundity samples indicate that females produce 398 to 721 ova that were 0.9 to 1.5 mm in diameter. Phoxinus tennesseensis has the lowest fecundity when compared to closely related congeners and inhabits the smallest headwater streams that frequently experience reduced or no-flow conditions. These characteristics probably contribute to its very limited distribution and small population sizes, and make the few remaining populations very vulnerable to environmental disturbances.

AB  - Welfare of cultivate fish at high-density represents an important concern for modern aquaculture. The behaviour of European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and seabream (Sparus aurata) reared in cages was studied in a fish farm of northern Sardinia (Italy) in autumn 2006 to test whether captive condition had an effect on the movement patterns of these two species. Video images recorded before, during and after the manual feeding distribution allowed us to collect data on different behaviours of captive fish. Thus, behaviours indicating the position of fish in the water column, swimming direction and possible aggressive behaviours (aggression, direction change and collision) showed juveniles and adults of seabass and seabream were overall affected by feeding rhythms and captive overcrowding. Seabream had a major tendency to swim towards the bottom and higher frequency of horizontal swimming and collisions than seabass. The overall behavioural difference between two species was explained in terms of their differences in ecological features in the wild.

AB  - Recent trends in environmental assessment theory and practice indicate a growing concern with collaboration and learning. Although there are few examples of the institutional, organizational, and socio-political forms and processes required to foster this collaboration and learning, the establishment of an environmental planning, management, and assessment regime in Canada's Northwest Territories offers useful insights. Consequently, this paper identifies and examines the institutional, organizational, and socio-political conditions that have encouraged more collaborative forms of environmental assessment practice in the Northwest Territories. Key issues highlighted include: (1) the development of decentralized regulatory organizations more responsive to changing circumstances; (2) strategies for more effective communication and participation of community interests; (3) efforts to build a collaborative vision of economic and social development through region-specific land use plans; (4) the integration of knowledge frameworks; and (5) a concern with the capacity required to encourage effective intervention in the assessment process.

AB  - The influence of the pH of precipitation and the ionic medium nature on the composition, surface charge, and kinetic sorption characteristics of aluminum oxyhydroxides formed by alkaline hydrolysis of an aqueous solution of aluminum nitrate was studied. The methods of drop titration with alkali, argentometric titration, point of zero charge, and indicator reactions of heterogeneous hydrolysis were used. The composition of the freshly precipitated hydrogels of aluminum(m) oxyhydroxide, rate constants of heterogeneous hydrolysis of the IrCl62- ions as indicator reactions, and the pH of the point of zero charge were determined. The rate of indicator reactions (as for other oxyhydroxide hydrogels) depends strongly on the pH of precipitation. However, it is lower than the rates characteristics of iron(m) and chromium(in) oxyhydroxides obtained under similar conditions. The pH of the point of zero charge for the alumogels in a chloride medium is 8.3 and that in a sulfate medium is 9.5.

AB  - Paleoecological studies indicate environmental changes during selected time horizons within the Upper Cretaceous sediments from three localities of the Gosau Group in Austria. Foraminiferal assemblages were studied from the localities Grunbach-Neue Welt, Weissenbachalm and Spital am Pyhrn. Paleobathymetric changes have been reconstructed using plankton/benthos ratio, percentual abundances of selected genera and species diversity. Three depth levels with three groups of dominating species were recognized from the Late Turonian to Early Santonian sediments of the Grabenbach Formation at Weissenbachalm locality. From the Grunbach-Neue Welt area the Grunbach Formation (Early Campanian) and Piesting Formation (Late Campanian-Early Maastrichtian) comprise transitional assemblages from shallow-water, neritic marls to bathyal hemipelagics and turbidites. The character of foraminiferal assemblages of the Weisswasser Formation indicates shallow-water shelf conditions during Late Santonian and Early Campanian. The deeper water Wurberg Formation contains richer foraminiferal assemblages with higher species diversity.

AB  - The search for extraterrestrial life may be facilitated if ecosystems can be found on Earth that exist under conditions analogous to those present on other planets or moons. It has been proposed, on the basis of geochemical and thermodynamic considerations, that geologically derived hydrogen might support subsurface microbial communities on Mars and Europa in which methanogens form the base of the ecosystem(1-5). Here we describe a unique subsurface microbial community in which hydrogen-consuming, methane-producing Archaea far outnumber the Bacteria. More than 90% of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences recovered from hydrothermal waters circulating through deeply buried igneous rocks in Idaho are related to hydrogen-using methanogenic microorganisms. Geochemical characterization indicates that geothermal hydrogen, not organic carbon, is the primary energy source for this methanogen-dominated microbial community. These results demonstrate that hydrogen-based methanogenic communities do occur in Earth's subsurface, providing an analogue for possible subsurface microbial ecosystems on other planets.

AB  - Environmental assessments of proposed infrastructure projects include an appraisal of the vibration that would be generated by potential construction methods. This paper considers one part of that process: prediction of groundborne vibration from percussive piling. Various methods for predicting the magnitude of the groundborne vibration generated by percussive piling have been described in the literature. In general, the accuracy of the predictors is limited. The paper investigates the reasons for this, through the development of theoretical models and analysis of field data from an extensive programme of on-site vibration monitoring. It is found that some widespread assumptions about the relationship between the energy rating of a percussive piling hammer and the vibrational energy developed in the ground are invalid. Ground conditions are shown to have a dominant influence on the magnitude of the groundborne vibration generated by percussive piling, and piling vibration predictors which take no account of soil type yield considerably less accurate estimates than site-specific predictions.

AB  - A characteristic succession of sedimentary structures was observed in elastic Silurian tempestites of the Murzuk Basin, of southwest Libya. The structures ("Manchuriophycus" syneresis cracks, "Astropolithon" load cracks, palimpsest ripples, "Kinneyia" microfault sets, and millimeter ripples) occur in sandstones and siltstones that show evidence of unusual cohesive behavior (cracks resulting from shrinking or degassing; resistance to erosion). In a sequence ranging from fully aerobic sandstones to anoxic graptolite shales, these structures characterize several zones of increasing redox stress, which correspond to ichnofacies zonation. It is postulated that microbial mats develop on the sediment surface whenever grazing and burrowing are suppressed. Depending on local conditions, biomats were leathery, felt-like, or gel-like. The observed matground structures resulted from the interaction of storm waves with microbial stabilization of progressively finer-grained sediments. Whereas such structures were ubiquitous in Precambrian clastics, they became restricted to hostile environments in the Phanerozoic, where they can be used to indicate environmental (mostly redox) stress, and possibly hydrocarbon potential, in sandstones and siltstones lacking other indicators.

AB  - To realize the quality evaluation of the soil environment and the remediation of heavy metal pollution, firstly, the pollution sources and quality evaluation methods of the soil environment are analyzed and discussed through the research methods of searching literature and materials, comparison and actual investigation. Secondly, the common pollution sources in the soil and the remediation methods currently used are listed, and the solutions are proposed. Finally, the land conditions in area A are investigated on the spot, and the results show that copper (Cu), arsenic (As), and mercury (Hg) in the soil of area A are polluted to varying degrees. Through the soil environmental quality assessment, it is found that copper element is heavily polluted. Using chemical remediation methods and montmorillonite and kaolinite as modifiers can effectively increase the pH of the soil, which reduces the content of copper in the soil, realize the restoration of the soil in area A, and effectively control heavy metal pollution.

AB  - C-phycocyanin (C-Pc), a photosynthetic pigment for use as a fluorescent indicator or in pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic products, exists in a phycobilisome complex with allophycocyanin (APC), phycoerythrin (PE), and linker polypeptides. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to quantify phycobilisome composition in an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrum. In this study, derivative analysis of UV-vis spectra was successfully applied to display the distinct wavelengths at which C-Pc, APC, and PE have maximal peaks. In all samples, C-Pc of the largest portion had a "zero-crossing" first order, APC did not have a zero-crossing first order, and PE did not have first derivative for zero crossing or local minimum from the 500 and 700 nm, respectively. The results show that derivative analyses coupled with signal smoothing can be applied to elucidate the composition of phycobilisome under various conditions including purification and environment.

AB  - The production of Hazel planting material grafted on Turkish Hazel rootstocks in the Faculty of Agriculture nursery Rimski Sancevi had commenced in 1989. Preliminary research in the selection of Turkish Hazel parent trees for seed production and collection dates back to 1983. Quality seeds are a prerequisite for the successful production of seedlings. In the agro-ecological conditions of the nursery, monitoring of the one- and two-year-old Turkish Hazel seedling growth indicators demonstrated that one-year-old plants were not viable rootstocks. However, two-year-old seedlings, based on the development of the root neck and the achieved plant height, showed potential for grafting Hazel on Turkish Hazel rootstocks. In the first ten days of April 2010, tongue grafting was performed. The grafting success ranged from 53.10% on the rootstock A(1) for the decorative form Corylus avellana Atropurpurea', to 92.60% on the rootstock B-9 and Tonda Gentile Rornana variety.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the extent and geographical pattern of intraspecific chemical and genetic variability of the lichen Hypogymnia physodes by comparing populations from different habitats. We analyzed the secondary lichen substances and their relative concentrations using HPTLC and HPLC in samples collected from sites with different environmental conditions. We identified seven lichen substances: the cortical atranorin and chloroatranorin, and the medullary physodalic, physodic, protocetraric, 3-hydroxyphysodic, and 2'-O-methylphysodic acids. The samples were uniform qualitatively, which means that H. physodes has only one chemotype. We detected quantitative chemical differences between the samples without any geographical pattern. We investigated 21 samples in order to study the connection between genotypic diversity of populations and geographical distribution. We determined the sequences of live loci (ITS, nucSSU, nucLSU, mitSSU, EF1 alpha). We found no significant genetic differentiation among populations collected from different areas.

AB  - The intertidal vegetation of the "Abra de Bilbao" (Basque coast, N Spain),vas studied following a pollution gradient. Under the effect of pollution, several signs of alteration are detected in the vegetation, which responds by simplifying its structure. Species,which require high quality environmental characteristics such as Cystoseira tamariscifolia, Cystoseira baccata, Bifurcaria bifurcata, Gelidium sesquipedale, Gigartina pistillata and Laurencia obtusa disappear, whereas Corallina elongata, Chondria coerulescens, Caulacanthus ustulatus and Gelidium pusillum become dominant in successive steps as pollution increases. In general, large perennial algae are replaced by small turfing algae, In addition, an intensification of the herbivorous activity (mainly limpets) occurs on the soft caespitose vegetation. Species richness and algal abundance suffer a reduction. In the most degraded environmental conditions, vegetation is replaced by filter-feeders (mussels and barnacles), and cyanobacteria proliferate. Pollution also alters the zonation pattern reducing in the number of vegetation belts. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Revised Universal Sail Loss Equation (RUSLE) is a practical and increasingly popular choice to provide soil-loss estimates in the preparation of environmental impact assessments, reclamation plans, and post-reclamation site evaluations for land subjected to mining and construction. A factor-by-factor comparison of the Universal Soil Lass Equation (USLE) and RUSLE versions 1.04 and 1.06 illustrates the ways in which version 1.06 has been modified and improved to accommodate the special conditions of mining, construction and reclamation lands. The effects of several erosion- and sediment-control materials and practices are included in the C and P factors. The program computes sediment-delivery ratios that include consideration of sediment characteristics. Despite its limitations, we believe that RUSLE 1.06 is the best currently available technology for soil-lass estimation an mining, construction, and reclamation lands. The USLE and RUSLE version 1.04 no longer should be used for this purpose.

AB  - The present study aims at contributing to the knowledge of the spatial variability of coralligenous reefs through the evaluation of patterns ranging from local to biogeographic scale around the island of Sardinia. The coralligenous reef assemblages of six areas were studied through a hierarchical sampling design: three sites per area were selected, in each site three plots were sampled and in each plot ten photographic samples were collected. The structure of coralligenous reefs across closed biogeographic regions is described, highlighting that nearly pristine assemblages, although characterized by similar high diversity, can be either dominated by animals, such as gorgonians and bryozoans, or macroalgae. The observed variations seem largely related to biogeographic patterns rather than spatial distance, supporting the need to identify specific reference conditions to assess the ecological quality of this habitat depending on the biogeographic area to be monitored.

AB  - The changing manufacturing economy has received scant attention in research on environmental inequalities, even though manufacturing work in the United States has dropped precipitously since the mid-20th century. I integrate manufacturing decline in metropolitan areas into the study of environmental inequality by using data on industrial air pollution in 1990, 2000, and 2010. I test to see if an indicator of change in the number of manufacturing workers in a metropolitan area from 1970 to each of the three study years is associated with more or less industrially produced toxic emissions. Findings show, somewhat counterintuitively, that metropolitan areas that have had a larger drop in manufacturing work are linked to greater industrial air pollution and that these findings hold in all U.S. regions except the West. Implications focus on how the indelible imprint of manufacturing history may condition contemporary pollution levels.

AB  - Regulation of plasma membrane curvature and composition governs essential cellular processes. The material property of bending rigidity describes the energetic cost of membrane deformations and depends on the plasma membrane molecular composition. Because of compositional fluctuations and active processes, it is challenging to measure it in intact cells. Here, we study the plasma membrane using giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs), which largely preserve the plasma membrane lipidome and proteome. We show that the bending rigidity of plasma membranes under varied conditions is correlated to readout from environment-sensitive dyes, which are indicative of membrane order and microviscosity. This correlation holds across different cell lines, upon cholesterol depletion or enrichment of the plasma membrane, and variations in cell density. Thus, polarity- and viscosity-sensitive probes represent a promising indicator of membrane mechanical properties. Additionally, our results allow for identifying synthetic membranes with a few well defined lipids as optimal plasma membrane mimetics.

AB  - In this study, the hybrid of combination-mixed data sampling regression model and back propagation neural network (combination-MIDAS-BP) is proposed to perform real-time forecasting of weekly carbon prices in China's Shenzhen carbon market. In addition to daily energy, economy and weather conditions, environmental factor is introduced into predictive indicators. The empirical results show that the carbon price is more sensitive to coal, temperature and AQI (air quality index) than to other factors. It is also shown that the forecast accuracy of the proposed model is approximately 30% and 40% higher than that of combination-MIDAS models and benchmark models, respectively. Given these forecast results, China's government and enterprises can effectively manage nonlinear, nonstationary, and irregular carbon prices, providing a better investing and managing tool from behavioural economics.

AB  - Air pollution sources in indoor area are one of the main factors for reducing indoor air quality of locations. In the current research, factors affecting indoor air quality and its symptoms are evaluate as case study in an office building in Mashhad (Iran). In order to conduct this descriptive-analytical study, gas pollutants affecting indoor air quality were determined using portable analysis systems. Alberta Indoor Air Quality Toolkit was used in order to study sick building syndrome. Findings indicated that 21% of staffs viewed labor environment conditions as inappropriate and they were mostly compliant about feeling of dusty air, fatigue and headache. In addition, findings showed that O-3, VOC, PM10, PM2.5, CO, CO2 parameters, Formaldehyde, temperature, sound and humidity were at standard level. Indicators of indoor air quality, in addition to the stress and depression interference on employee performance and satisfaction were at acceptable level. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - This paper illustrates the concept of the natural yield curve and how to measure it. The natural yield curve extends the idea of the natural rate of interest defined at a single maturity to one defined for all maturities. If the actual real yield curve matches the natural yield curve, the output gap will converge to zero. An empirical analysis using data for Japan shows that past monetary easing programs expanded the gap between the actual real yield curve and the natural yield curve mainly for short and medium maturities and led to accommodative financial conditions. By contrast, the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing policy has expanded the gap for long maturities as well as short and medium maturities. The natural yield curve is expected to provide a useful benchmark in the conduct of both conventional monetary policy and unconventional monetary policy aiming to influence the entire yield curve.

AB  - This article reviews evidence of how starch granules associated with archaeological artefacts provide an insight into the use of plants by our ancestors for food, medicines and cultural activities. The properties of starch relevant to archaeological contexts, methods for examining ancient starch and the types of environmental conditions that would promote survival of starch granules over hundreds of thousands of years as part of the archaeological record, are considered. Starch granules identified in dental calculus are clear indicators of the individual having consumed starchy food as part of the diet. However, surviving starch granules may be only a tiny fraction of those consumed over a lifetime and not necessarily representative of foods that were in the diet. A hypothesis, based on a combination of archaeological, physiological and genetic evidence, that plant foods containing high quantities of digestible starch were essential for the evolution of the modern human phenotype, is discussed.

AB  - This paper analyses disparities in walking conditions in neighbourhoods with different incomes and urbanization levels in Praia, the capital of Cabo Verde islands. Walkability is measured considering factors relevant to a semi-arid, post-colonial, fast growing, middle-income African city. The estimated indicators measure the availability of destinations accessible on foot and the quality of the walking experience. The study found that high income neighbourhoods have the lowest overall provision of pedestrian space and protection from traffic (in more urbanized areas) and the lowest walking accessibility to people, shops, and leisure areas (in less urbanized areas). Low income neighbourhoods have the highest environmental risks (in more urbanized areas) and the highest slopes, lowest provision of formal pedestrian space, and lowest accessibility to jobs, facilities, and bus stops (in less urbanized areas). The results provide insights into the type of public policies needed to improve walkability in the different parts of the city.

AB  - Traditional climate classification or regionalization characterizes the mean state of climate condition, which cannot meet the demand of addressing climate change currently. We have developed a climate change classification method, as well as the fundamental principles, an indicator system, and mapping techniques of climate change regionalization. This study used annual mean temperature and total precipitation as climatic indices, and linear trend and variation change as change indices to characterize climate change quantitatively. The study has proposed a scheme for world climate change regionalization based on a half century of climate data (1961-2010). Level-I regionalization divides the world into 12 tendency zones based on the linear trend of climate, level-II regionalization resulted in 28 fluctuation regions based on the variation change of climate. Climate change regionalization provides a scientific basis for countries and regions to develop plans for adapting to climate change, especially for managing climate-related disaster or environmental risks.

AB  - Thirteen samples were collected from three coastal bays of northeastern Sardinia (Gallura). Bays are areas of mixed siliciclastic-carbonate sedimentation. Seagrasses and algae, widely distributed in the shallow-water environments, contribute to the carbonate factory. Near-shore benthic foraminifers (111 species, 50 genera), occurring in the shallower water areas of Posidonia oceanica, were taxonomically identified and the assemblages were investigated by statistical analysis to determine if any groups of samples or species correlate with a specific subenvironment. Dominant taxa are phytophilous and three main assemblages were identified: the Lobatula lobatula/Elphidium crispum assemblage and Lobatula lobatula/Peneroplis pertusus assemblage are linked to the distribution of P. oceanica, whereas the Peneroplis/Quinqueloculina assemblage reflects oligotrophic conditions and a mixed algal/Posidonia substrate. Taxonomic abundance and diversity appear to be mainly controlled by the type of phytal substrate.

AB  - Departing from a theoretical methodology, we estimate empirically an index of adaptive capacity (IAC) of a fishing community to the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs). We carried out household surveys, designed to obtain information for indicators and sub-indicators, and calculated the IAC. Moreover, we performed a sensitivity analysis to check for robustness of the results. Our findings show that, despite being located between two MPAs, the fishing community of Bazan in the Colombian Pacific is highly vulnerable and that the socioeconomic dimension of the IAC constitutes the most binding dimension for building adaptive capacity. Bazan is characterized by extreme poverty, high dependence on resources, and lack of basic public infrastructure. Notwithstanding, social capital and local awareness about ecological conditions may act as enhancers of adaptive capacity. The establishment of MPAs should consider the development of strategies to confer adaptive capacity to local communities highly dependent on resource extraction.

AB  - Public employment was traditionally seen as a 'good job', and governments were seen as 'model' employers. That reputation has faded in recent years due to factors including public management reforms that changed traditional public service employment. This research considers how the Australian public service labour market fared compared to the private sector during the global financial crisis. The research compares public and private sector outcomes in Australian states, focusing on two indicators of the size of the public service and wage outcomes. It finds that the global financial crisis did not enhance job prospects or conditions in Australian state public services, and potentially further detracted from public perceptions of governments as 'model' employers and the desirability of public service jobs. The crisis also highlighted the institutional tensions and complexities of the contemporary public employment environment.

AB  - Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based molecular biosensors serve as important tools for studying protein activity in live cells and have been widely used for this purpose over the past decade. However, FRET biosensors are rarely used in the context of the live organism because of the inherent high cellular complexity and imaging challenges associated with the three-dimensional environment. Here we provide a protocol for using single-chain intramolecular FRET-based biosensors in early development. We provide a general protocol for FRET ratio imaging in embryos, including the data-acquisition conditions and the algorithm for ratio image generation. We then use the pRaichu RacFRET biosensor to exemplify the adaptation and optimization of a particular biosensor for use in live zebrafish embryos. Once an optimized biosensor is available, the complete procedure, including introduction of the probes into embryos, imaging and data analysis, requires 2-3 d.

AB  - As bio-indicators, bilateral asymmetry and fault bar formation have been found to be correlated with environmental quality, body condition, and individual fitness. Although commonly used as indices of the same parameters, it is not clear whether asymmetry and fault bars are equivalent measures of developmental history. We tested the possible relationship between these two metrics by measuring the degree of asymmetry and the number of fault bars in the wing and tail feathers of migrating White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) at Long Point Bird Observatory on Lake Erie, Ontario, during October 2004. Within individuals, we found no relationship between the occurrence of fault bars and degree of bilateral asymmetry. In addition, individuals with higher fat scores had more symmetrical wings than individuals with lower scores, but did not have fewer fault bars. Together, these results suggest that fluctuating asymmetry and fault bar occurrence should not be used interchangeably as bio-indicators.

AB  - This paper offers an interpretation of Plato's Cratylus 427d1-431c3 that supports a reading of the dialogue as a whole as concluding in favour of a conventionalist account of naming. While many previous interpretations note the value of this passage as evidence for Platonic investigations of false propositions, this paper argues that its demonstration that there can be false (or incorrect) naming in turn refutes the naturalist account of naming; that is, it shows that a natural relation between name and nominatum is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for reference. Socrates secures this outcome by using demonstratives and their concomitants to show how any putative natural imitative link between name and object may be overridden. Furthermore, Socrates' employment of demonstratives and context-dependent statements in his case-studies of false naming speaks in favour of a reading of this passage as primarily focussing on naming rather than on propositions in general.

AB  - Soil hydrologic coefficients, also called hydrolimits, are soil water contents defined for certain values of water potentials. Closer attention is paid to three hydrolimits: field capacity, point of decreased availability, and wilting point. The hydrolimits can be found by various ways. Their assessment under natural conditions should be seen as laboratory assessment of hydrolimit values or use of soil water retention curves for reading of hydrolimits. Therefore, some methods for indirect assessment of the water retention curve from actually mapped soil characteristics such as soil texture, bulk density and calcium content were devised. They are generally called pedotransfer functions (PTFs). Aim of the study is to calculate values of some important hydrolimits using PTFs. The hydrolimits calculated by this way are compared to hydrolimits determined from another measured water retention curves. The presented study documents an efficiency and promptness of PTFs use for a region of interest for dynamics evaluation of water storage in the soil aeration zone considering the water supply of plants.

AB  - Background: Radioactive contamination and chemical pollution of the environment can affect the processes of carcinogenesis, including the formation of malignant neoplasms of the ovaries in women. We used the data of official state statistics for 2000-2020 to test the hypothesis about the effect of radioactive contamination (following the Chernobyl disaster) and chemical pollutants on the incidence of ovarian malignancies in the female population of the Bryansk region. Methods: A variety of statistical approaches were used to estimate the incidence of ovarian malignancies, including the Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman's rank correlation test and linear regression. Results: We did not establish statistically significant differences in the frequency of primary morbidity of women with malignant neoplasms of the ovaries, regardless of the environmental conditions of living. Furthermore, no significant correlations were found between the frequency of primary morbidity of ovarian malignancies, both with the level of contamination by Cesium-137 and Strontium-90, and air pollution with volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. A statistically significant increase in the long-term trend in the frequency of ovarian malignant neoplasms was revealed in the areas of chemical pollution (p = 0.02), however, in other territories, no statistically significant regularities were established. The forecast of the frequency of newly diagnosed malignant neoplasms of the ovaries on average in the Bryansk region shows an increase of 12.4% in 2020 in comparison with the real data for 2020, while the largest increase in predicted values is recorded in the territories of radioactive contamination (by 79.6%), and the least in the combined territories (by 6.9%). Conclusions: The results obtained indicate the need for further work to understand the trends in the presence/absence of independent and combined effects of pollutants and the growth of oncogynecological pathology from the perspective of assessing the distant and regional metastasis, histological and immunohistochemical profile of a specific malignant ovarian neoplasm with levels of environmental contamination.

AB  - Mires or peatlands host unique biodiversity and provide many valuable ecosystem services. Mires often undergo different development phases during their evolution. Two mire phases that have clearly divergent hydrological regimes and characteristic biotas are minerotrophic fen and ombrotrophic bog. Open mires can be overgrown by trees and develop into peatland forests. Mire development trajectories are expected to be associated with three major factors-post-glacial isostatic uplift, autogenic succession and climate-induced changes. Understanding long-term mire development is important for the conservation planning of these threatened habitats. We use data from modern pollen samples to characterize differences between the pollen signal and to identify indicator pollen taxa for three mire development phases-open fens, forested fens and bogs. The modern reference samples are then used to support the interpretation of the sediment records in terms of mire development phases and related biodiversity changes in six mires within a 20 x 30 km area in western Saaremaa, Estonia. Palynological richness and phylogenetic diversity (PD) as well as Ellenberg indicator values are compared throughout the 10,000-year history of the Saaremaa mires. Pollen of herbaceous taxa discriminates between open fens, forested fens and bogs, and indicator pollen taxa can be associated with each mire phase. In general, the fen phases of the mires show higher richness and PD than the bog phases but there is considerable variation between the sites. The mire diversity peaks are often associated with transitional periods when high local community heterogeneity allows the coexistence of high numbers of taxa from different phylogenetic lineages. Synthesis. When the initiation of mires in isostatic land uplift areas is closely related to water-level changes and the position of the sites in relation to the sea, the development of mires and their biodiversity in the late Holocene is associated with local conditions but mediated by climate. The ongoing rapid climate change is likely to accelerate changes in existing mires, and while the transitional periods are characterized by high diversity, these periods are temporary, and the overall diversity of mires can be expected to decrease.

AB  - This study compared light and dark disinfection of faecal bacteria/viral indicator organisms (E. coli and MS2 (fRNA) bacteriophage) and human viruses (Echovirus and Norovirus) in Wastewater Treatment Pond (WTP) mesocosms. Stirred pond mesocosms were operated in either outdoor sunlight-exposed or laboratory dark conditions in two experiments during the austral summer. To investigate wavelength-dependence of sunlight disinfection, three optical filters were used: (1) polyethylene film (light control: transmitting all solar UV and visible wavelengths), (2) acrylic (removing most UVB <315 nm), and (3) polycarbonate (removing both UVB and UVA <400 nm). To assess different dark disinfection processes WTP effluent was treated before spiking with target microbes, by (a) 0.22 mu m filtration to remove all but colloidal particles, (b) 0.22 mu m filtration followed by heat treatment to destroy enzymes, and (c) addition of Cytochalasin B to supress protozoan grazing. Microbiological stocks containing E. coli, MS2 phage, Echovirus, and Norovirus were spiked into each mesocosm 10 min before the experiments commenced. The light control exposed to all sunlight wavelengths achieved >5-log E. coli and MS2 phage removal (from similar to 1.0 x 10(6) to <1 PFU/mL) within 3 h compared with up to 6 h in UV-filtered mesocosms. This result confirms that UVB contributes to inactivation of E. coli and viruses by direct sunlight inactivation. However, the very high attenuation with depth of UVB in WTP water (99% removal in the top 8 cm) suggests that UVB disinfection may be less important than other removal processes averaged over time and full-scale pond depth. Dark removal was appreciably slower than sunlight-mediated inactivation. The dark control typically achieved higher removal of E. coli and viruses than the 0.22 mu m filtered (dark) mesocosms. This result suggests that adsorption of E. coli and viruses to WTP particles (e.g., algae and bacteria bio-flocs) is an important mechanism of dark disinfection, while bacteria and virus characteristics (e.g. surface charge) and environmental conditions can influence dark disinfection processes.

AB  - Simple Summary Scientific interest in animal welfare was initially driven by popular emotional, ethics and political concerns. It has now become an important societal question and all the stakeholders agree on the necessity to rely on unambiguous scientific evidence for evaluation and making decisions. Animal welfare is defined as a chronic state reflecting an animal's subjective perception of its situation indicated by behavioural, postural and physiological parameters. Because of their multiple statuses (as farm, leisure, sport or pet animals), horses experience a large variety of more or less adequate environmental conditions that present risks of impairing their welfare. The aim of this review is to disentangle welfare parameters and to differentiate reliable animal-based indicators of horses' welfare from potential signals of acute sickness, discomfort, temporary states of pain, stress or emotion that are not based on popular beliefs in order to provide the equine industry with appropriate guidelines and recommendations. Animal welfare is defined as a chronic state reflecting an individual's subjective perception of its situation. Because it is possible to be in a good welfare state and nevertheless experience acute fear or pain, and conversely, short-term positive emotions can be experienced during impaired welfare states, welfare as a chronic state has to be clearly distinguished from temporary states related to emotions, pain or stress. The evaluation of non-verbal individuals' welfare state, particularly in interspecific situations, is a real challenge that necessarily implies animal-based measures and requires multidisciplinary scientifically validated measures. In the last decade, studies investigating horses' welfare flourished together with new measures that were not always scientifically tested before being used. At a time were legal decisions are made on animal welfare, it is crucial to rely on reliable welfare indicators in order to prevent false evaluation. The aim of this review is to identify the scientifically tested and reliable indicators of horses' welfare (e.g., body lesions, apathy, aggressiveness, stereotypic behaviours) from signals of temporary states related to acute pain emotions or stress and from popular beliefs, in order to give the scientific community and the horse industry accurate evaluation tools.

AB  - Objective: This paper proposes a multi attribute decision support model in a supply chain in order to solve complex decision problems. The paper provides a platform to ease decision process through the integration of quality function deployment (QFD) and grey relational analysis (GRA) in demonstrating main supply chain drivers under fuzzy environment.
   Methodology: The proposed method is important because of several points: First of all, in a supply chain system, evaluation factors are not really independent and must be addressed in relation to the external factors such as customer requirements. Hence, we have applied QFD tool. Second, due to the constant uncertainty in the supply chain environment, fuzziness among the factors has to be considered. So, an interval valued fuzzy model was implemented. Third, to examine the proposed decision system in reality, it was applied in Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) project.
   Contribution: An integrated version of QFD and GRA is presented. It is assumed that QFD can act to measure optimal solutions based on the distance to ideal solutions. In an interval-valued fuzzy environment the enormous volume of computation by Euclidean distance doesn't allow decision makers to obtain the results easily. This drawback is addressed using gray relational analysis. The gray relational coefficient is integrated to the fuzzy QFD to measure the distance of potential solutions from ideal solutions. This integration facilitates decision making process in further problems once big data are available
   Results: To obtain the importance degrees of logistic indicators in the supply chain, expert team considered the environmental, social & cultural, and economic factors as external dimension of the QFD. The other dimension of QFD includes supply chain drivers such as quality, environmental management system, supply chain flexibility, corporate social responsibility, transportation service condition, and financial stability. The decision model is solved and the ranking of indicators is achieved. A sensitivity analysis helps to test and check the performance of the decision model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Modern theories view human capital as the main source of economic growth. Managing the concentration of human capital to form new growth centers, provided by the Concept of the strategy of Russia's spatial development, requires the use of effective institutions. The authors' method of studying the responses of socio-economic systems to changes in the institutional conditions of human capital increment helps determine the ranking of the impact of material and institutional factors applying the methodological tools of regression analysis using dummy variables. Moreover, the study based on the proposed method makes it possible to take into account the heterogeneous nature of the socio-economic space of Russian regions in the context of human-oriented development paradigm in assessing the effectiveness of institutions based on comparative analysis of standardized coefficients of institutional variables in the regression models of the managed characteristics of human capital by regional clusters. The testing of the methodology on the example of institutional impact on the reproductive increment of the quantitative component of human capital in Russian regions for 2005-2015 has revealed the great importance of the institutional factor which ranks second by the influence of all independent variables. The estimation of heterogeneity of the socio-economic space of Russian regions was carried out using the methods of factor analysis of twelve factor-indicators of territories' attractiveness for the population, which helps form seven clusters. The characteristic of clusters is provided with the use of the author's method of a three-component vector of socio-economic territorial development. The study revealed the direct impact of the socio-natural component of regional clusters on the institutional response of socioeconomic systems and the reverse impact - of the economic and inclusive component. The results can be used as analytical materials to justify the institutional measures for concentrating human capital in the planned centers of economic growth and forecasts of the need for developing the social infrastructure in the regions. The application of the developed methodological approach can be extended to the study of the impact of other institutions on the socio-economic processes.

AB  - In Italy most of the habitats hosting terricolous lichens are found in the Alps and along the coasts, but some lichen-rich plant communities are also present in the Po Plain. We report a study of terricolous lichen communities found in dry grasslands attributed to Spergulo vernalis-Corynephoretum canescentis in the western Po Plain (Northern Italy), in accordance with the Braun-Blanquet approach. Releves (138) were carried out in several developmental stages of the Corynephorus grassland. They were sorted manually and analyzed using ANOSIM, non-parametric MANOVA and PCA. Indicator species of the groups were found by means of INDVAL and SIMPER analyses and literature. Seven lichen vegetation types were distinguished. These were attributable to 4 described associations: Stereocauletum condensati, Cladonietum foliaceae (in which we found 3 subassociations: typicum, cladonietosum furcatae and cladonietosum subrangiformis), Cladonietum mitts and Cladonietum rei, and to one impoverished community (Cetraria aculeata community). Ordination of floristic variables showed several overlaps between communities, underlining the depleted floristic conditions found in the study area, where several species occur in many communities and other species are very rare, and thus play a minor role in the differentiation of the lichen vegetation types. Overlaps are also referable to intermediate conditions between one community and another, reflecting dynamic relationships, with Stereocauletum condensati, Cetraria aculeata community and Cladonietum foliaceae typicum having the most distinct pioneer character and Cladonietum mitts being the most evolved. Ordination of ecological variables based on the indices of substrate pH, light and humidity requirements and tolerance to eutrophication showed several overlaps between the communities, found to be from acidophytic to subneutrophytic, from rather to very photophytic, from mesophytic to rather xerophytic and from anitrophytic to slightly nitrophytic. Rarity in Italy and conservation needs are discussed in detail, also in comparison with the situation of the same communities in central European Corynephorus grasslands. These grasslands and their typical lichen communities are rare in Italy and, though somewhat depleted, they are the habitat of several threatened lichen species at the southern margin of their distribution range. Therefore management plans should always consider both the cryptogamic and the vascular plant communities.

AB  - Combined sewer systems collect surface runoff as well as wastewater of industrial and domestic origin. During periods of heavy rainfall the capacity of the sewer system is exceeded and the overflow is discharged into receiving waters without any treatment. Consequently, combined sewer overflow (CSO) is considered as a major source of water pollution. This study investigates the effectiveness of a retention soil filter (RSF) for the removal of micropollutants as well as facultative pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria from CSO. The removal of organic group parameters like total organic carbon was excellent and the removal efficiency for micropollutants of the RSF and the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which treats wastewater of the same origin during dry and normal weather conditions, was comparable. Compounds of high environmental concern like estrogens or certain pharmaceuticals, e.g. diclofenac, were completely eliminated or removed to a high degree during RSF passage. RSF treatment also reduced the number of E. coli, enterococci and staphylococci by 2.7, 2.2 and 2.4 log-units (median values), respectively. Obviously, some Staphylococcus species can better adapt to the conditions of the RSF than others as a shift of the abundance of the different species was observed when comparing the diversity of staphylococci obtained from the RSF influent and effluent. RSF treatment also decreased the absolute number of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The percentage of antibiotic resistant E. coli and staphylococci isolates also decreased during passage of the RSF, whereas the percentage of resistant enterococci did not change. For E. coli ampicillin and for enterococci and staphylococci erythromycin determined the antibiotic resistance level. The results demonstrate that RSFs can be considered as an adequate treatment option for CSO. The performance for the removal of micropollutants is comparable with a medium sized WWTP with conventional activated sludge treatment. The number of facultative pathogenic and antibiotic resistant bacteria was considerably decreased during RSF passage. However, as RSF effluents still contained antibiotic resistance genes and traces of micropollutants; receiving waters may still be at risk from negative environmental impacts.

AB  - Forage chicory is a productive forage resource for eastern North America; however, many soils in the region are acidic and deficient in P and might restrict the widespread use of forage chicory. There is no published information on response of forage chicory to P, or P acquisition strategies for morphologically different chicory cultivars. The literature suggests the following null hypothesis: "specific root length (SRL) will increase with P deficiency". We conducted controlled environment experiments using nutrient culture to determine plant mass, mineral composition, and root morphology of three forage chicory cultivars (Grasslands Puna (GP), LaCerta (LC) and Forage Feast (FF)) as a function of P supply, and test the null hypothesis with chicory. Phosphorus increased chicory growth irrespective of cultivar. Root morphology differed among cultivars independent of P supply with FF producing about twice the taproot mass of GP or LC. Root morphology was also impacted by P supply and the specific interactions between P and cultivar. Total root length and surface area of GP increased, and did not change in LC or FF under -P conditions. Thus, the null hypothesis must be rejected. Results suggest at least two different plant responses to -P conditions in chicory that seem to be attributes of specific cultivars: (a) increase in root length of the 0.28 mm root class (GP); (b) decrease in non-taproot mass density with -P and no change in root length or ratios between diameter classes (LC). The change in root length of small diameter class roots, as observed for GP, is typical of the responses to -P described in the literature. The decrease in root density seen with LC is probably an anatomical response that is not coupled with any observable morphological response. We conclude that use of the above null hypothesis as a paradigm for plant root response to P deficiency must be rejected. The routine use of specific root length as an indicator of environmentally induced changes in root system function is precluded by the presence of anatomical and physiological changes (adaptations) that have no concomitant gross morphological changes.

AB  - Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS), which are ethanol metabolites, are direct indicators of ethanol intake; they have been studied in a variety of biological samples in forensic science. It is necessary to analyze ethanol metabolites to determine whether the ethanol detected in autopsy cases was due to alcohol consumption before death or due to the ethanol produced from post-mortem decay. In general, EtG and EtS are detected in the blood together with ethanol; however, it may be difficult to secure blood depending on the extent of decay. Therefore, the aforementioned method should be replaced by detecting the ethanol metabolites using tissue biological samples. In this study, we determined the optimal experimental conditions for detecting EtG and EtS from spleen samples using Liquid Chromatography - Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Herein, the test method was validated, and an analysis method was applied to the actual autopsy cases.

AB  - Storms strongly affect coral reefs; one unstudied but potentially important outcome may be a decrease in herbivory, presumably through changes to freshwater, sediment and nutrient influx. Algal turfs are sensitive early indicators of reef condition, and experimental evidence demonstrates low sediment loads and strong herbivory maintain short, healthy turf. While unknown, storms likely disrupt these controlling forces. We have observed storms that generate frequent, visible sediment plumes in Moorea, French Polynesia. To evaluate the effects of storms on herbivory, we conducted a set of field experiments manipulating herbivore access to naturally occurring turf under three rainfall regimes: no rain, light rain, and heavy rain that generated a plume event. We found strong effects of herbivores except following the storm, indicating disruption of typically strong top-down control by herbivores on algal turfs. Further research into the underlying mechanisms is critical as storm intensities and watershed development increase in many tropical regions.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to provide an efficient framework to study the relationship between happiness and eco-innovation, measured by eco-efficiency, considered as a subset of the wider question concerning the relationship between happiness and innovation. The conceptual background describes how happiness can be linked to environmental innovations, drawing potential relations among happiness, environment and innovations. An analytical model derives the relationship between happiness and eco-efficiency from a generic utility function. The empirical focus is on the effects of environmental innovation on population well-being for ten European countries over the period 1981-2011. Environmental innovation is measured by an eco-efficiency indicator (the percentage of total energy from combustible renewables and waste). Results from a panel data model show a positive correlation between eco-efficiency and happiness, linking countries' general well-being to environmental conditions, the pace at which they adopt eco-innovations, and the relative efficacy of the latter.

AB  - In this paper we report results on benchmarking a HRP-2 humanoid robot. The humanoid robots of this serie are known to be very robust. They have been successfully used by several research groups for the design of new motion generation algorithms. As such it is a reference in the category of electrically driven humanoid robot. As new humanoid robots are continuously built it is interesting to compare the performances of these new prototypes to those of HRP-2. This benchmarking study was realized through a campaign of measurements in an advanced equipped testing laboratory that provides a well adapted controlled environment. We have investigated the effect of temperatures variation on the robot walking capabilities. In order to benchmark various environmental conditions and algorithms we computed a set of performance indicators for bipedal locomotion. The scope of the algorithms for motion generation evaluated here ranges from analytical solution to numerical optimization approach, enabling real-time walking or multi-contacts motions.

AB  - We study the nature of motion in a 3D potential composed of perturbed elliptic oscillators. Our technique is to use the results obtained from the 2D potential in order to find the initial conditions generating regular or chaotic orbits in the 3D potential. Both 2D and 3D potentials display exact periodic orbits together with extended chaotic regions. Numerical experiments suggest that the degree of chaos increases rapidly as the energy of the test particle increases. About 97 % of the phase plane of the 2D system is covered by chaotic orbits for large energies. The regular or chaotic character of the 2D orbits is checked using the S(c) dynamical spectrum, while for the 3D potential we use the S(c) spectrum, along with the P(f) spectral method. Comparison with other dynamical indicators shows that the S(c) spectrum gives fast and reliable information about the character of motion.

AB  - A species of Dechlorospirillum was isolated from an Fe(II)-oxidizing, opposing-gradient-culture enrichment using an inoculum from a circumneutral, freshwater creek that showed copious amounts of Fe(III) (hydr)oxide precipitation. In gradient cultures amended with a redox indicator to visualize the depth of oxygen penetration, Dechlorospirillum sp. strain M1 showed Fe(II)-dependent growth at the oxic-anoxic interface and was unable to utilize sulfide as an alternate electron donor. The bacterium also grew with acetate as an electron donor under both microaerophilic and nitrate-reducing conditions, but was incapable of organotrophic Fe(III) reduction or nitrate-dependent Fe(II) oxidation. Although members of the genus Dechlorospirillum are primarily known as perchlorate and nitrate reducers, our results suggest that some species are members of the microbial communities involved in iron redox cycling at the oxic-anoxic transition zones in freshwater sediments.

AB  - The three global observing systems (the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS); the Global Oceanographic Observing System (GOOS);. and the, Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS)) are designed to detect and assess, global change. A land-based coastal observing system initiative under GTOS is at the beginnings and will lead toward the integration of terrestrial and freshwater observations with marine observations under the auspices of coastal GOOS. The GTOS infrastructure already builds on national, regional and global programs for terrestrial observations, but more emphasis is needed on the unique circumstances of coastal ecosystems. Coastal GTOS will use the observing system philosophy and infrastructure to identify and improve access to data and information about coastal change; assist users to make that access systematically; ensure that appropriate measures are being or can be made; and integrate terrestrial observations with marine observations. Key variables have been defined for GTOS. But major challenges include evaluating these and others for coastal ecosystems and identifying the indicators of coastal condition that operate at appropriate scales. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Two approaches to immobilize complex-forming analytical reagents (PAN, PAR, Xylenol orange, Brombenzothiazo, Crystal violet, Cadion, and Sulfochlorophenolazorhodanine) for the preparation of new sorbents and indicator powders are suggested: on-line coating of reversed-phase silica gel by reagents or doping of porous sol-gel silica with reagents. The retention of Ag, Cd, Cu(II), Co(II), Fe(III), Mn(II), Ni, Pb, and Zn on the sorbents developed was investigated. Quantitative sorption and desorption conditions were optimized. Procedures for the determination of Cd, Cu(II), Fe(III), Pb, and Zn with flame atomic absorption, spectrophotometric, and diffusion scattering spectrometric detection were elaborated. Detection limits for Cd, Cu(II), Fe(III), Pb, and Zn were 3 mu g/L, 6 mu g/L, 5 mu g/L, 40 mu g/L, and 1 mu g/L, respectively. The procedures were used for the analysis of various real samples, e.g., natural and waste waters, and food.

AB  - To improve multiple heterointerface coupling efficiencies and efficiently engineer the pore structure of porous carbon, a kind of magnetic cobalt nanoparticles embedded porous carbon framework, derived from economical biomass, was designed in the present study. The resulting magnetic embedded porous carbon framework showed exceptional dielectric responses and a significant polarization effect because of the higher contact surface utilization than the ordinary loaded structure. The effective absorbing bandwidth covers 6.6 GHz with a thickness of 2.3 mm, indicating its capacity to address the increasingly problematic electromagnetic (EM) pollution issue. Meanwhile, the magnetic embedded structure with the carbon framework could protect the embedded particles from common corrosion issues, even after a long time environmental adaptability assessment in the lab and faintly acid condition. This work highlights a potential strategy for the design and synthesis of high-performance carbonaceous EM absorbers. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lung dysfunction causes significant mortality and morbidity and is a key organ in post-mortem investigation. Post-mortem (PM) medical imaging is being increasingly used, with computed tomography (CT) the most widespread modality. PMCT is used either as a supplement or an alternative to autopsy, especially in cases where autopsy is not possible or undesirable. Unfortunately, natural PM-processes in the lung obscure radiological interpretation in the dead, which accordingly is very different from the living. Interpretation of PMCT therefore requires special training and experience. The lung is also relatively difficult to examine during conventional autopsy, but diagnosis is improved by histological processing to allow ex vivo identification of infections and other pathological conditions. PMCT can examine the lung in-situ and is even superior to autopsy in certain aspects (especially for pneumothorax, small nodules and showing extent of abnormalities). Ventilated PMCT can be used to mimic clinical breath-hold procedures to improve overall pulmonary imaging quality.

KW  - INDUSTRY
AB  - In the era of industry 4.0, mechanical indicators are in great demand for providing reliable information in a harsh environment with a self-powered signal transmission ability for connecting into a centralized automatic control network of ships, trucks, and factories. In this work, based on the principle of nanogenerator, we report a block-inserting mechatronic (BIM) panel employed as not only a mechanical indicator with long operation lifetime, versatile adaptability, and improved reliability under harsh working conditions, but also an active electronic sensor for self-powered liquid information indicating and sensing. The methodology of block-inserting assembly significantly simplifies the processing costs and difficulties, which facilitates length-customization of the whole device. When equipped with the BIM panel, computer control and monitoring systems realize wireless control and real-time monitoring of liquids in miscellaneous industrial applications. This work lays the foundation of nanogenerator-based sensors applied in industrial systems, which will strongly promote the progress of industry 4.0, smart cities, and transportation.

AB  - A statistical oil spill risk forecast model in support of emergency response and environmental risk assessment is presented by combing the deterministic model, probabilistic strategy and frequency estimation. When applied to evaluate various potential spill sources (oil port, fairway, anchorage and pipeline) in the Zhoushan offshore area, the model provides the probability of slick spatial position, oil slick thickness, and exposure duration of floating slick. An oil spill risk map is generated after integrating multiple spill sources, which is a powerful tool for identifying high-risk areas and developing contingency plan. Impact scope and damage degree vary among different sources because of special local topographical, hydrological, and meteorological conditions, where generally exists high pollution intensity of point-source and wide range of line-source. Huge Changjiang River runoff prevents coastal sea in the north from being contaminated by spilled oil from the southern Zhoushan offshore area.

AB  - To promote the practical application of N-guanylurea dinitramide (GUDN), it is necessary to identify the thermal kinetics and evaluate thermal hazards of GUDN under various environmental conditions. In this study, we present that the thermal decomposition of GUDN is a typical autocatalytic reaction and the model-based kinetics was established by simultaneous fitting of a series of nonisothermal DSC data at different heating rates, which can be described as a generalized autocatalytic model, expressed as d alpha dt=2.29x1023exp-225240/RT >alpha 1.47+0.59e-18300RT. The reaction model exhibits a reasonable fitting to the experimental results with a high correlation coefficient R-2 of 0.9994. Based on the established kinetic model, important thermal safety indicators, such as the time to conversion limit, adiabatic time to maximum rate, and self-accelerating decomposition temperature, were simulated, providing important basis concerning the thermal hazard of GUDN in practical applications.

AB  - This paper contributes to research on neighborhood effects and knowledge about the conditions associated with community-level patterns of police behavior by examining whether levels of violence, racial and ethnic composition, and socioeconomic disadvantage are associated with officer-involved shootings in Houston, TX. In addition, drawing from the ecological theory of policing, this study explores whether spatial heterogeneity exists in the observed relationships. Poisson regression models reveal that community violence and neighborhood racial and ethnic context are meaningful indicators of on-duty officer-involved shootings. Socioeconomic disadvantage did not emerge as a significant variable in the models estimated. Results from Geographically Weighted Poisson Regression (GWPR) models indicate statistically significant spatial variation in the effects for all the key community factors. The findings highlight the importance of local context for developing a greater understanding of police violence across the urban landscape.

AB  - The modern agglomerations development remains under the influence of current global trends: economic, environmental/climate, social, technological, geopolitical ones. At least six forces are expected to further disrupt the urban mobility landscape, especially coastal one. From self-driving vehicles and the sharing economy, to vehicle electrification, mobile computing, the Internet of Things and Block-chain technologies, each of these trends is quite significant on its own. The actions undertaken by city authorities aim at focusing citizens' attention on the need to improve air quality, decrease congestion in city's main streets, invest in one's health and physical condition, which increases the level of quality of life, and in turn provides the city with considerable economic benefits. The purpose of the paper is to explore global trends shaping life quality in coastal agglomerations with a special regard to sustainable mobility and to present the ISO 37120 - a tool allowing measurement, based on the indicators, of the cities resilience and performance.

AB  - The article examines the institutional process in a regional economy connected with the infrastructure development. We use the neoinstitutional approach to study factors that influence the behavior of government and business in their interaction in the economy. We also use statistical methods to analyze the dynamics of socio-economic development indicators of the subjects of the Russian Federation as well as the results of measures to attract private investment into infrastructure, including the PPP. We chose the city of Moscow and the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District as two empirical case studies which differ in economic and geographic conditions, but both demonstrate success in attracting private investment and implementing infrastructure projects. Our conclusions are consistent with a theory that asserts the primacy of institutional environment in relation to project implementation. We make also some practical recommendations for the development of the institutional environment which are acceptable for all regions solving similar problems of infrastructure development.

   Based on this revision, we are going to analyzing critically some of the most influential measure indicators of WB proposed during last two decades. Two are the main conclusions of our work: one is that indicators proposed lacks of integration of multiple WB dimensions that can offer a precise idea of the multidimensionality of the concept; second, an accurate, integrate and rigorous WB concept and measurement is an essential condition for effective and fair public policy.

It was worked with a zeolitic volcanic tuff cropped out from Macicas area, Romania, and a synthetic anionic exchanger Amberlite A-21. A groundwater and surface sources of drinking water from lalomita-Muntenia (Romania) catchment were analysed, with iron and manganese contents (0.2527-0.3059 mg Fe-tot/L, 0.0234 mg Mn/L), COD (14.530-17.064 mg KMnO4/L), chlorides contents (170.95 mg/L), pH=7.70, and with electrical conductivity of 1433-1451 mu S/cm. The ionic exchange process has been achieved in batch and continuous-flow conditions. The process was realized in static regime, with good results, the highest efficiencies for iron and manganese ions removal being 99% and 79-95%, respectively.

AB  - This special issue examines new trends in phytolith scholarship and assesses the future direction of this field of research. The papers presented represent a broader shift in phytolith research into a new phase called the "Period of Expanding Applications". It is characterized by 1) a rapid increase in the number of phytolith publications; 2) a diversification of research topics; 3) a reassessment of the use of radiocarbon and other isotopes in phytoliths; 4) the development of digital technologies for refining and sharing phytolith identifications; 5) renewed efforts for standardization of phytolith nomenclature and laboratory protocol; and 6) the development of the field of applied phytolith research. This paper argues that interdisciplinary collaborations and a continued effort to understand the basics of phytolith production patterns are essential for the growth of the discipline and its application in archaeological studies.

AB  - The elemental distributions in optic tectum of brains of wild Liza aurata a teleost fish captured in polluted and reference coastal areas were assessed quantitatively by nuclear microscopy providing insights into brain vulnerability to metal pollution. Elemental maps enabled us to visualize optic tectum layers and identify cellular arrangements. Whereas Cl, K and Ca contents identify meninges, the Ca, Fe and Zn concentrations distinguish the underneath grey matter, white matter and inner cellular layers. Exposed animals showed significantly decreased P concentrations and increased contents of Cu, Zn and Ni in all brain structures. These changes highlight homeostasis modification, altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier and suggest risk for neurological toxicity. Our study initiated for the first time an inventory of physiological measures containing images and elemental compositions of brain regions of fish exposed to different environmental conditions. This will help defining total and local brain vulnerability to metals and pollution levels.

AB  - Zero valent iron (ZVI; Fe(0)) has been successfully employed for the transformation and subsequent detoxification of a wide range of environmental contaminants, including chlorinated organics, heavy metals, nitroaromatics and, to some degree, perchlorate. The combined use of ZVI plus controlled release carbon has been shown to generate environmental conditions defined herein as in situ chemical reduction (ISCR) that facilitate the microbiological, chemical and/or physical destruction of various contaminants. In this context, the salient features of ISCR are: (i) its low redox potential; and (ii) its propensity to produce H-2. In this paper we discuss the thermodynamics of these characteristics (with special emphasis on ZVI reactions) and provide representative case studies documenting the safe and effective use of ISCR technology to rapidly remove halogenated organics from impacted subsurface environments.

KW  - LOW-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE
AB  - In the present paper the formation of space charge in irradiated low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was investigated using the pulsed electroacoustic (PEA) technique. Specimens of LDPE, similar to 100 mu mm thick, were irradiated to various doses at room temperature in a Co-60 gamma source in one of three different environments: ambient room air, oxygen-free nitrogen and vacuum. The results obtained indicate that the space charge distribution is dependent on the irradiation environment. There is a large concentration of positive charge evident in the sample irradiated in air compared to very little for material irradiated in either vacuum or nitrogen under similar conditions. This indicates that the presence of oxygen during irradiation, and thereby oxidation itself, has a major influence on the mechanism by which space charge evolves. Thus the monitoring of space charge may in itself be an indicator of the degree of oxidation and of aging in a material. The evolution of space charge and its decay are discussed.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are characterized by a hierarchy of their processes, differentiated according to a space and rime scale. Thus, the hierarchy theory can be applied, which allows conclusions about self-organization, stability conditions, and the reaction to disturbances. Process patterns allow to judge whether a process is undisturbed or disturbed. This is demonstrated by growth patterns in the root, stem and canopy domain. Defoliation indicates that disturbances have reached the level of the whole tree. The monitoring of defoliation should be continued as an indicator for destabilization. Base saturation is a pattern for the storage and buffer function of the soil in respect, to nutrients and acid load. On more than half of the forest soils in Germany base saturation is too low even at greater soil depth. This, together with elevated nitrogen deposition, is taken as criterion for risks in respect to stand development and regeneration. Measures for the stabilization of forest ecosystems are mentioned.

AB  - This paper represents an approach to discerning the kind of climatic signal that land snails might record. The study uses previous analyses of the Achenheim molluscs, whose time series can be compared with ice-core records or marine records. Terrestrial molluscs are characteristic of the environment in which they live, mainly mirroring prevailing climate and vegetation. As a result of this relatively close connection between biotope and mollusc assemblages, reconstructions of past environments can be made that agree generally with results from pollen analyses. In this way, malacofaunas in loess sections permit determination of environmental variability and climatic change. Loess deposits, however, correspond to a particular environment. Decreasing or increasing dust deposition affects the molluscan assemblages by altering the environmental conditions for better or for worse. The variation in the mollusc diversity index in Achenheim shows a striking correspondence with dust-flux variation. There is only a low correlation between diversity index and temperature, precipitation or moisture estimates.

AB  - This paper describes field and laboratory tests of ACSR conductors and related line items from many of Ontario Hydro's older transmission lines.  A non-destructive corrosion detector was modified for live line measurement of the loss of galvanizing from the steel cores of the ACSR conductors.  Samples of conductors tested in the field have also undergone laboratory metallurgical investigation, and tests of fatigue, tensile strength, torsional ductility and electrical performance.  Extensive environmental studies identified corrosion products of ACSR conductors, the atmospheric factors responsible for corrosion, and the mechanisms by which corrosion takes place.  It is concluded that the corrosion detector serves as a useful indicator of impending end of conductor life while the torsional ductility tests serve as a more precise condition indicator and can provide a guide for scheduling conductor replacement.  Test results and details of their interpretation are given in the companion paper "Aged ACSR Conductors, Part II - Prediction of Remaining Life".

AB  - In order to fully alleviate the practical economic pressure of port construction projects and establish a relatively good cost control environment, a budget control method for port construction projects based on BIM technology is proposed. Taking the selected area as the target research scope, through the definition of representative cost engineering, the standardized port construction cost budget price information is collected, and then the budget item rate conditions supported by BIM technology is combined to calculate the budget control weight of port construction cost required for practical processing, the construction of the BIM technology-based port construction cost budget control method is completed. The experimental results show that after applying the engineering cost budget control method, the related attributes between the various budget control indicators in the port operation area of Z province have become clear, and the overall cost control effect is gradually approaching the ideal level.

AB  - Herein, we develop a facile method for selective and sensitive detection of hydroxylamine (HA) based on the in situ formation of DNA templated copper nanoparticles (DNA-CuNPs) as fluorescent probes. It is firstly found that HA as a reducing agent can play a key role in the in situ formation of fluorescent DNA-CuNPs. This special optical property of DNA-CuNPs with (lambda(ex) = 340 nm, lambda(em) = 588 nm) with a mega-Stokes shifting (248 nm) makes it applicable for the turn-on detection of HA. In addition, this fluorescent method has several advantages such as being simple, rapid, and environmentally friendly, because it avoids the traditional organic dye molecules and complex procedures. Under optimized conditions, this platform achieves a fluorescent response for HA with a detection limit of 0.022 mM. Especially, successful detection capability in tap waters and ground waters exhibits its potential to be general method.

AB  - The potential of TiO2-based photocatalysts in mitigating the effects of environmental pollutants is evident in the scientific literature but the large-scale implementation of photocatalytic concretes still appears limited, despite the current global concerns over urban NOx pollution. Improvements in cost-effectiveness are required to enhance the case for a photocatalyst-modified infrastructure and this must address catalyst efficiency, catalyst loading and performance durability. This paper compares photocatalytic efficiencies of supported TiO2 on mortar surfaces with the more conventional TiO2 dispersed in mortar. The influences of environmental conditions, such as NO concentration and flow rate, UVA light intensity and relative humidity, on photocatalytic performance are also investigated using photonic efficiency as an indicator. The supported TiO2 shows greater degradation of NOx (De-NOx), at about 9 times higher than TiO2 powder dispersed in the mortar, ca. 150 times higher utilization efficiency, than that of TiO2 in traditional photocatalytic mortar (with 5% loading).

AB  - Scholars have long argued that economic downturns intensify racial discord. However, empirical support for this relationship has been mixed, with most recent studies finding no evidence that downturns provoke greater racial animosity. Yet most past research has focused on hate crimes, a particularly violent and relatively infrequent manifestation of racial antipathy. In this article, we reexamine the relationship between economic downturns and racial acrimony using more subtle indicators of racial animosity. We found that during economic downturns, Whites felt less warmly about Blacks (Studies 1 and 2), held more negative explicit and implicit attitudes about Blacks, were more likely to condone the use of stereotypes, and were more willing to regard inequality between groups as natural and acceptable (Study 2). Moreover, during downturns, Black musicians (Study 3) and Black politicians (Study 4) were less likely to secure a musical hit or win a congressional election.

AB  - Iron oxides are environmental indicators and influence on physical and chemical behavior of soils. This research aimed to identify and characterize pedogenic iron oxides in soils of the Acre state. Brazil. The soils developed from sedimentary rocks of the Solimoes Formation. New), one samples of subsurface horizons were collected from ten soil profiles. Soil samples were analyzed by x-ray diffractometry associated to selective chemical dissolutions. Fe contents in the clay minerals (Fes), in the pedogenic iron oxides (Fed) and in the poorly crystalline oxides (Feo) were determined. The Al3+-substitution and the mean crystal diameter of goethite and hematite were estimated. Soils presented low contents of Fes and Fed. The Fed/Fes ratio indicated soils in the intermediate stage of weathering, with dominance of goethite, hematite and maghemite. This condition of weathering was confirmed by the higher frequency of goethites and hematite with intermediate Al( )(3+)substitution. Goethites have isodimensional forms and hematite have flat plaques forms.

AB  - Long-term Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data have inherent noise due to clouds and poor atmospheric conditions that limit its applicability for environmental applications. This study was carried out with an objective of noise removal and reconstruction of time series MODIS EVI data (16 day) for the period 2010-2014 using de-noising algorithms. Relative evaluation of de-noising algorithms for smoothing temporal data with ideal noise free data is not possible in actual scenario. Hence, synthetic signals were generated and introduced Gaussian noise at different variance levels for evaluation purpose. Spatial analysis was carried out by introducing noise at different variance levels into the noise free EVI images from the raw EVI stacked image. Spatio-temporal analyses of noise signals in the reconstructed EVI images were evaluated in terms of performance indicators, namely Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Mean Square Error.

The analyses revealed that higher trait EI was associated across the days with higher PA, but not with NA. Moreover, diurnal sAA levels were lower in the high trait EI group than in the low trait EI group on the intervening non-working day, and this difference between the EI groups continued to show a tendency to significance on working day 2. The results indicate that higher EI may be related to the preservation of higher levels of PA and lower levels of sympathetic activity in recovery in the naturalistic condition.

AB  - The Richelieu River, Quebec, is a highly-regulated waterway subject to numerous anthropogenic influences from municipal effluents and agricultural activities. Parasite communities in 234 spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius) were examined from 4 localities in late spring 2003 and 2004. Component species richness varied between 15 and 18 species in 2003 but declined to 9 to 13 in 2004, while total parasite abundance was consistently lower in 2003. Parasite component community similarity among localities could not be directly linked to available upstream water quality measurements or anthropogenic activity and was best explained by precipitation. Total precipitation in May 2003 was approximately 40% more than in May 2004, presumably altering patterns of runoff, river flow rates, and water quality. This study suggests that fish parasite species composition and richness in the Richelieu River are influenced by environmental parameters which in turn ultimately are driven by a combination of climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities in the watershed.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the potential toxic effects of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) on tissues of clam Venerupis philippinarum using parameters of antioxidant defenses and oxidative stress. Antioxidant biomarkers including ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH), as well as DNA damage and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in gills and digestive glands of V. philippinarum, were analyzed after a 1-, 3-, 6-, 10-, and 15-day exposure to seawater containing HBCD at environmentally related concentrations, respectively. The results showed that the activity of most antioxidant enzymes increased, and different trends were detected with exposure time extending. The oxidative stress could be obviously caused in the gills and digestive glands under the experimental conditions. This could provide useful information for toxic risk assessment of environmental pollutant HBCD.

AB  - Different loads of municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) were applied to hyper saline salt lake soil under laboratory conditions to monitor biological soil quality Microbial biomass-C (MBC), catalase, dehydrogenase, urease, alkaline phosphatase arylsulfatase, and beta-glycosidase activities were analyzed following 14, 30, and 50 days of incubation In general, MBC and the oxidoreductase and hydrolase enzyme activities were significantly enhanced by addition of MSWC at 20 and 40 t ha (1) doses, but they decreased at 120 t ha (1) Overall, the results show that the addition of MSWC to hyper saline soils can improve soil biological quality, in spite of its high salt content, which is an important step in any attempt to use them as biosaline agricultural soils However, substances such as heavy metals in MSWC could limit the use of compost for this purpose, consequently analysis of MSWC is recommended prior to its use

AB  - Vehicle-induced emissions constitute a major source of air pollutants, particularly in urban areas, where heavy traffic is common occurrence. Contaminated air can flow into enclosed micro-environments, including vehicle compartments. Among various exhaust emissions, carbon monoxide (CO) was the first indicator examined in passenger compartments. This paper presents a critical review of worldwide research work conducted to characterize CO exposure inside vehicles. Measurement methodologies for field testing are presented alongside impacts of various factors on in-vehicle CO exposure, including outdoor CO levels, roadway type, ventilation mode, weather conditions, and vehicle characteristics. Results of in-vehicle CO exposure measurements in various cities are compared. Modeling efforts to characterize in-vehicle CO exposure and relate it to potential explanatory factors are also discussed. Based on the review findings, limitations and future needs are defined.

AB  - The thermodynamics of dissolution of non-reactive gases in water under ambient conditions is of importance for the description of the properties of small hydrophobic solutes, and they are also of interest for environmental assessments. The review published in 1977 by Wilhelm, Battino and Wilcock (Chem. Rev. 77:219-262, 1977) constitutes a milestone in this field. However, a number of new data have been published since then, including both solubility and calorimetric determinations. We have analyzed the new data for 27 binary systems reported in the literature at the time of writing this article. Whenever solubility and calorimetric data both exist they have been fitted together. There are, however, systems for which only one type of new thermodynamic information is available; these systems were also analyzed using procedures that are described in this work.

AB  - Multigaussian kriging is used in geostatistical applications to assess the recoverable reserves in ore deposits, or the probability for a contaminant to exceed a critical threshold. However, in general, the estimates have to be calculated by a numerical integration (Monte Carlo approach). In this paper, we propose analytical expressions to compute the multigaussian kriging estimator and its estimation variance, thanks to polynomial expansions. Three extensions are then considered, which are essential for mining and environmental applications: accounting for an unknown and locally varying mean (local stationarity), accounting for a block-support correction, and estimating spatial averages. All these extensions can be combined; they generalize several known techniques like ordinary lognormal kriging and uniform conditioning by a Gaussian value. An application of the concepts to a porphyry copper deposit shows that the proposed "ordinary multigaussian kriging" approach leads to more realistic estimates of the recoverable reserves than the conventional methods (disjunctive and simple multigaussian krigings), in particular in the nonmineralized undersampled areas.

TI  - Precipitation augmentation by a new method of cloud seeding in northern Kyushu (2)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
LA  - English
AB  - In order to solve draught problems, a precipitation augmentation experiment based on a new airborne liquid carbon dioxide (LC) seeding at low level of supercooled convective clouds, was carried out in the northern Kyushu, February 2, 1999.
   On this day, a cold air mass began to flow from the Siberia toward the Japanese Islands. This wind was very strong and cloud bands consisting of many cumuli ranged at constant interval above the Genkai Sea. Under the weather condition, three seedings were carried out. The second and third seedings resulted in rainfall of approximately 1.3 million tons during the lifetime of the seeded cumuli.
   At the same time, unique, large mushroom-shaped radar echoes were discovered in the range height indicator (RHI) scans of Kyushu University (KU) radar for the plan position indicator (PPI) echoes near the maxima, which has never been observed among natural clouds.
   Based on the observations, the optimum design of seeding operation for winter season is discussed.

AB  - Delayed luminescence (DL) is gradually used in various detection of biological systems as a rapid detection technique, however, its biological mechanism was still not clear. In this study, a new model of DL detection system for liquid biological samples is established to investigate the DL emission of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells cultured in different glucose concentrations. We analyzed the relationship between the DL emission and cell growth, cell vitality, mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), oxygen consumption rate (OCR), as well as mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) in S. cerevisiae cells cultured with 0.01, 0.05, 0.15, 3, 10 and 20 g/L glucose respectively. It was found that the DL emission had strong correlation with mitochondrial morphology, OCR, and MMP. The results suggested that DL is an indicator of mitochondria status under different glucose supply conditions, and may be an effective method to detect mitochondrial metabolism related disorders.

TI  - Cryogenic cave carbonate and implications for thawing permafrost at Winter Wonderland Cave, Utah, USA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Winter Wonderland Cave contains perennial ice associated with two types of cryogenic cave carbonate (CCC) formed during the freezing of water. CCCfine is characterized by relatively high delta C-13 values, whereas CCCcoarse exhibits notably low delta O-18 values indicating precipitation under (semi)closed-system conditions in a pool of residual water beneath an ice lid. Previous work has concluded that CCCcoarse forms during permafrost thaw, making the presence of this precipitate a valuable indicator of past cryospheric change. Available geochronologic evidence indicates that CCC formation in this cave is a Late Holocene or contemporary process, and field observations suggest that the cave thermal regime recently changed in a manner that permits the ingress of liquid water. This is the first documented occurence of CCCcoarse in the Western Hemisphere and one of only a few locations where these minerals have been found in association with ice. Winter Wonderland Cave is a natural laboratory for studying CCC genesis.

AB  - Offshore production system is predicted to increase in the near future driven by the lack of coastal space and lower environmental impacts.
   The aim of this paper has been to evaluate the economic performance of offshore production system respect to inshore one, by comparing net present value (NPV), discounted payback time (DPBT) and internal rate of return (IRR) of two Italian mariculture farms that produce European sea bass.
   Results showed a better economic profitability of offshore farm, even if sensitivity analysis revealed that financial indicators of both aquaculture production systems have been very sensitive to market condition changes. So, offshore production system could represent an opportunity for fish farmers to increase their profitability, obtaining a more sustainable production and avoiding possible conflicts with other human activities in coastal areas.

AB  - Our findings indicated that many of the reviewed studies assumed wrongly that the system was at steady state or could be described by a single-pool approach. To select the correct model, exact knowledge of C input rates and several data points are needed from the beginning of the experiment. For steady-state conditions an apparent temporal change of MRT computed from a single-pool model is thus a clear indicator that a two-pool approach must be chosen. The errors made by the wrong choice of model varied with the length of the experiment and usually resulted in an over-estimate of MRT by a factor of 1.15 for some data published on physical size separates, but by a factor of up to 11 for individual microbial biomarkers such as muramic acid.

With respect to temperature, 24 of 31 species reported in the literature coincided with our values (20-27 degrees C, mesothermal or euthermal). 37 of 41 species with published pH data have been reported as alkaliphilous, alkalibiontic or indifferent to pH, corresponding to conditions in the Huasteca. With respect to salinity 23 of the 36 species are reported from low salinity habitats (oligohalobous or halophilous). Lastly, with respect saprobity, 38 species with reports in the literature has been found in habitats with low concentrations of organic matter (mesosaprobic, oligosaprobic, saproxenous and saprophobic). The importance of these characteristics to use the species as ecological indicators is discussed.

AB  - The purpose was to determine the extent to which the relatively sparse lichen flora on the trunks of Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) can serve as an indicator of air purity. The percentage cover and condition of the lichens were recorded in sample plots from which lichens (Hypogymnia physodes) and pine needles were collected for chemical analysis. Clear differences in pollution tolerance were found between the species, Platismatia glauca and H. tubulosa being the most sensitive of the macrolichens and H. physodes and Parmeliopsis ambigua the most tolerant. With decreasing distance from the city centre the numbers of macrolichen species and their size and percentage cover diminished, changes in their external appearance became more marked and the concentrations of impurities in the lichens and pine needles increased. Pendulous lichens of the genus Bryoria occurred on fairly polluted plots, but their maximum lengths remained small. No actual 'lichen desert' could be discerned, however. The interaction of air pollutants with other environmental factors is discussed.

AB  - Batch and continuous culture experiments were conducted with the L-lysine producer Corynebacterium glutamicum to characterize fermentation yields and rates, as well as the relationship between biomass catalytic activity toward L-lysine production and on-line respiratory measurements. Experimental correlations suggested that improved fermentation performance (yield, productivity, and titer) could be achieved through fed-batch cultivation of the organism under conditions of restrained growth, utilizing respiratory measurements as a metabolic activity indicator for feed rate control. Two different control schemes were developed for maximization of the fermentation yield and maximization of the fermentation productivity. Both strategies were successful in maintaining the yield and specific productivity at high levels for extended times, thus resulting in significant improvements in the overall fermentation yield, volumetric productivity, and titer. It was thus demonstrated that proper environmental control can be an effective means of manipulating microbial metabolism to favor metabolite overproduction.

AB  - The paper addresses Locke's analysis of the federative power, presented as a distinct constitutional category separate from both the ordinary and special or prerogative powers of the executive in that it relates to the 'external' capacities of the state. The operation of the federative is marked by the interplay of prudence and law. Locke acknowledges the prudential element, but seems on one reading to downplay the juridical dimension. That reading does not fit well with Locke's designation of making treaties or compacts (foedera) as the power's central feature, nor with his account of natural law as a moral condition that includes the capacity to incur binding obligations. The federative should be seen rather as the part of the constitution through which the state's external agency is exercised and the location of the state's duties in respect of the law-generating activities in the international sphere. Its institutional specification should be framed accordingly.

AB  - In this article, starting from several indicators that provide an overview of the economic ecosystem of Constanta County, we analyze their evolution in the period 2000-2019, the existence of change points and the influences between these data series. We verified several hypotheses and formulated models that explain the variability of the data. Our conclusions emphasize the importance that tourism has on the economical development of Constanta County. Since the welfare of the county in the studied years, measured in terms of Gross Domestic Product, is found to be inversely correlated to the degree of entrepreneurship recorded expressed as personal businesses and family associations, this raises concerns regarding the overall conditions for local businesses. It is interesting to note that the number of graduates in a year leaves its mark on the economic ecosystem only in 2, 3, 5 years. Changing something takes time, stability and continuity in our decisions and actions.

AB  - Estuaries provide valuable ecosystem services but are threatened by eutrophication caused by increasing nutrient concentrations and climatic factors. We tested the hypothesis that cool and rainy weather in midsummer has a stronger stimulatory effect on indicators of eutrophication in the Neva Estuary than warm weather. The analysis showed that the concentration of total phosphorus in the estuary was positively correlated with the amount of precipitation and the number of rainy days in the region. Significant positive relationships were found between precipitation in midsummer and chlorophyll concentrations and plankton primary production in the upper part of the estuary. Chlorophyll concentrations and plankton primary production were higher in years with a rainy and cool July than in years with warm and dry July. Such conditions could negate existing measures to improve water quality in the Neva Estuary, meaning that greater effort will be needed.

AB  - The territory of Romania presents a high diversity of ecological conditions determined by the variability of the atmospheric and edaphic factors, which strongly influence the agricultural production. Due to increasing land use pressures, soil quality assessment studies have been undertaken over time to fuel the increase in crop productivity concomitantly with the development of good agricultural practices. The local wheat crop is predominantly covered by native varieties, obtained by the Romanian researchers. The main use of wheat is represented by the production of bakery, and the quality of the final product is directly influenced by the physicochemical of the raw materials. Unlike most scientific studies that assess the yields according to soil quality, this paper identifies the suitable areas for wheat cultivation according to the quality of the product, the productivity per hectare and the average price of the production, using principal component analysis and clustering techniques.

Performed results are based on conducted tests in climatic chamber in the Military Medical Academy Institute of Hygiene in Belgrade. Ten male test subjects were subjected to exertional heat stress test consisted of walking on motorized treadmill at a speed of 5 km/h in hot environment. Tests were performed with and without cooling system. As a physiological strain indicator the following parameters have been determined: mean skin temperature, tympanic temperature, heart rate and sweat rate. Results confirmed that cooling vest worn over the clothes was able to attenuate the physiological strain levels during exercise, when compared to identical exposure without the cooling system.

AB  - Germination ability is regulated by a combination of environmental and endogenous signals with both synergistic and antagonistic effects. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent dormancy-releasing agent in many species, including Arabidopsis, and has been suggested to behave as an endogenous regulator of this physiological blockage. Distinct reports have also highlighted a positive impact of NO on seed germination under sub-optimal conditions. However, its molecular mode of action in the context of seed biology remains poorly documented. This review aims to focus on the implications of this radical in the control of seed dormancy and germination. The consequences of NO chemistry on the investigations on both its signaling and its targets in seeds are discussed. NO-dependent protein post-translational modifications are proposed as a key mechanism underlying NO signaling during early seed germination.

AB  - We present an ostracod record covering the past two millennia from an 8.25-m core taken from Lake Qarun, in the Faiyum Depression of Egypt. The occurrence of ostracod species in the lake is controlled primarily by variations in solute composition, which are in turn related to shifts in catchment land use. At times when the Faiyum Depression supported thriving agriculture, lake water contained Na+-Cl- brine, and Cyprideis torosa dominated the ostracod assemblage. When the Faiyum Depression experienced periods of environmental and economic decline, lake water contained Na+-HCO3 (-) brine, and Limnocythere inopinata dominated. The relative abundance of other ostracod species provides additional information about past conditions in Lake Qarun including salinity and lake level changes. Overall, the ostracod assemblages provide evidence for human influences in the Faiyum, which extend back before instrumental or detailed observational records began.

Copper(II) solution was employed as the titrating agent. The results obtained by using these electrodes were compared with those obtained by application of a platinum electrode under the same conditions, and good agreement, reproducibility, and accuracy were obtained. The results deviated by 0.16-0.50% from those obtained by using a platinum electrode. All the electrodes showed a relatively fast response time and can be used without any time limit or without considerable divergence in the potentials. The potential jumps at the titration endpoint obtained in the titration of some compounds by using a pyrite electrode are higher than those obtained by application of platinum as the indicator electrode.

AB  - A land quality indicator, defined as a ratio between actual and potential production of wheat under Dutch conditions with acceptable leaching of nitrates and risks, is proposed. Production was simulated for 30 years, expressing temporal weather variability, using a wide range of nitrogen fertilization scenarios and including nitrate leaching to the groundwater. Yields were calculated considering probabilities ('implied risks') that yield potentials were not reached and that nitrate leaching exceeded environmental threshold values. Calculations were made for a prime agricultural soil in the Netherlands (loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Fluvaquent) comparing fields having had long-term organic- and conventional management. Quality indicators were consistently higher for the land with organic management. The proposed calculations are reflected in a graph with production and associated nitrate leaching rates and their probabilities of exceedance. The graph provides a framework. A single land quality indicator can be derived only after decisions on risk acceptability have been made. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monitoring of indirect and industrial dischargers, respectively, makes an important contribution to the safe and environmentally sound operation of wastewater systems. As a result of local framework conditions, there is a wide range of monitoring practices across Germany. In a benchmarking project, ten sewerage operators and monitoring bodies representing large German cities have collected data on their work and discussed their practices. The results show that the extent of monitoring is between 244 and 1,457 monitoring points per sewer network (given as 15th and 85th percentile). The median value of the specific expense is 689 EUR per monitoring point and year. In relation to the total wastewater fee volume, the median expense is 0.71%. The subprocess 'sampling' was examined more closely. By means of detailed process mapping and regression analyses, it can be shown that on-site activities and tours have the largest share of working time (total of 72%) and thus the greatest leverage in optimisation measures. Various examples are given.

AB  - When estimating the distance for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), we always suppose that a fixed curve model exists between the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and communication distance. But there exist some negative factors in practice, which makes this assumption to contradict with the situation in real communication environment. It results in large distance estimation error with low efficiency. Thus, a lightweight WSN communication distance estimation method is presented, which is called distance estimation using distribution-based fingerprinting. First, we considered the uncertainty in RSSI values, and got the fingerprinting relationship in terms of RSSI data distribution, which is gained through a statistical calculation. Then, a data matching algorithm is implemented to estimate the communication distance. Finally, RSSI values in different conditions are utilized to validate this method. Experimental results demonstrated that the new method can obtain better results with high efficiency than other related methods, and can be applied in WSN localization system.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential element, known to bioaccumulate to toxic levels in aquatic environments. Here, we tested the toxic and physiological stress response of goldfish, Carassius auratus exposed to different concentrations of Se for 120 h. At the end of the experiment, the toxic stress indicators [metallothionein (MT), aminotransferase/aspartate (AspAT and AlaAT), and gill Na+/K+-ATPase] and other stress-related parameters [corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) mRNA and activity and/or plasma ACTH, cortisol, glucose, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and muscle lipid peroxidation (LPO)] were significantly higher in specimens exposed to 3 and 4 mg/L of Se than in those exposed to lower concentrations (0 and 2 mg/L). These results indicated that 3 and 4 mg/L Se concentration can induce an acute toxic and physiological stress response in aquarium conditions.

AB  - The decisive influence of Late Quaternary sea level changes on the geological evolution of the coastal plain and adjacent continental shelf around the world has long been recognized. Coastal environments evolve actively during transgressive regressive cycles whose development depends on sea level and sediment supply variations. The interaction of these variables was key to the current morphological and sedimentological configuration of coastal regions. Particularly, the estuarine system of Bahia Blanca (Argentina) presents various types of deposits and marine fossil accumulations, such as paleochannels in the subbottom, sand-shell ridges and extensive layers with fossils in life position. These features are important geological indicators, because its analysis allows us to define different paleoenvironmental conditions that prevailed during the coastal evolutionary process.

AB  - This article illustrates the interconnectedness of science and politics through a case study of old-growth forest conflict in Finnish Upper Lapland. It demonstrates the ways in which "traditional science" has failed to settle the decades-long conflict between state forestry and traditional Sami reindeer herding, and discusses the potential of democratization of science through more inclusive forms of knowledge production. The analysis, which is based on qualitative interview data, shows that a traditional science focus on biological indicators and mathematical modeling has provided only a partial account of the reindeer herding-forestry interactions by ignoring the local, place-specific practices that are equally important in understanding the overall quality of pasture conditions in Upper Lapland. It concludes that an inclusive inquiry, structured according to the principles of joint fact-finding, could create a more policy-relevant, and also more scientifically robust, knowledge basis for future forest management and policy decisions.

AB  - HLA-G is a non-classical HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) molecule characterized by limited tissue distribution under normal physiological conditions and low variability at both DNA and protein levels. Several studies suggest that HLA-G could play a role, as an immunoregulatory molecule, in situations as diverse as transplantation, cancer, viral infections and inflammatory diseases. A total of 237 individuals from 21 South American tribes speaking nine different linguistic families were studied in relation to the 14 bp insertion/deletion polymorphism at the HLA-G gene. A consistent (seven in nine) excess of heterozygosity in samples classified by language was obtained. Our data supply evidences for balancing selection acting at the HLA-G 14 bp INDEL region. Enhanced fetal survival in a pathogen-rich environment may account for these findings.

AB  - We measured cadmium and lead concentrations in two littoral plants (Phragmites australis Cav. Trin ex. Steudel and Typha angustifolia L.) collected in June and September 2007 from five selected lakes in the Poznan city area, and also in sediment and water samples from the same places. We determined the metal concentrations in rhizomes and leaves, and in sediment and water from the littoral and near the bank zone. Only low levels of the heavy metals were found. Pb and Cd concentrations were higher in water collected from the bank zone than from the littoral zone. Pb and Cd accumulation was noted in sediments. Heavy metal levels were higher in rhizomes than in stems and leaves. The studied aquatic macrophytes may be bioaccumulators and bioindicators of Pb and Cd in freshwater in natural conditions, even when concentrations are low.

AB  - In the light of sustainable development requirements, environmental psychology has an increasing role to play in addressing people-environment congruity. People-environment congruity refers to the interrelation between the individual and his or her (especially: residential) environment, considering the match between individual life satisfaction and objective standards of living. Promoting human wellbeing requires looking beyond singular effects of environmental features and considering people's overall relationship to their environment. This leads us to look at the residential environment as the place where people-environment congruity is crucial, and to propose a framework of analyses of the conditions of congruity between objective and subjective assessment of environmental stressors in relation to the individual and social expression of well-being. The paper concludes with the implications of people-environment congruity for research and policy-making about sustainable development. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using the epilithic diatoms as indicators of environmental conditions, 10 lakes in the High Tatra Mountains were characterised with regard to their stage of acidification. The diatom communities were diverse; 2 10 taxa were found, including 27 species of north and alpine preference. On the basis of cluster analysis, two groups of lakes were distinguished. The first group included shallow, moderately acidified lakes (Dlugi and Zmarzly Gasienicowy lakes), where acidophilous organisms prevailed, with Achnanthes marginulata being the most numerous. The structure of the diatom community in Dlugi lake was stable over 4 years of observations and did not show any progress in acidification. The second group included mostly very deep, non-acidified lakes where circumneutral organisms prevailed, and among them Achnanthes minutissima was dominant in most cases. The diatom community structures mostly confirmed the status of the lakes studied as judged from their water chemistry.

AB  - The impact of air pollution on the genetic material of bioindicator plant species was assessed by cytogenetic analysis of shallots (Allium cepa L. var. ascalonicum), exposed at eight sampling plots in the vicinity of major Slovene local emission sources in 1999. At each sampling plot the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (CA) was determined under field conditions and clay pot experiments. No significant differences in the frequency of total CA could be found among localities in the clay pot experiment. However, in the field experiments the frequency of CA significantly differed among sampling plots. The relatively high frequency of CA indicates that the test plants were exposed to mutagenic or genotoxic substances; consequently, our results confirmed the impact of environmental pollution on the genetic material of the shallot.

AB  - To understand benefits of integrating management at landscape scales, we estimated cost and projected integrated outcomes for three alternatives for public land management in the interior Columbia River basin over 100 years, Effectiveness was measured in terms of costs and trends of long-term (100 years) land and fire management, landscape health, and reduction of risks across several broad aquatic, terrestrial, landscape, and socioeconomic indicators. Lowest costs with most positive cumulative trends for these variables occurred where alternatives "step down" assessment and planning from broader scales, focusing restoration efforts sufficiently to overcome opposite effects of traditional reserve protection or commodity management strategies. Integrated management implemented at interconnected scales appears to have multiple positive outcomes. Landscape health, conditions for native fish and wildlife species and jobs from restoration activities can improve, while risks to firefighters and property decline. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Anthropogeneous changes of soil properties in forest eco-systems which are close to the conurbation are shown at the example of Berlin Pine stands. The soils in the Berlin forests are characterized by increased biological activity, forced decomposition, and an overall improved supply with nitrogen. In general, the growth of Berlin Pine stands increased in the last decades. The increased supply with nitrogen is regarded as a major cause of this fact. Under athropogeneously changed sire conditions, the water budget is increasingly important to the growth and the vitality of the trees. The interdependence of growth, the thinning of treecrowns, and site characteristics can be described by means of statistical models in which the plant available soil water is a central control variable. It can be demonstrated that treecrown thinnings which can be observed have to be interpreted as indicator for the mean site specific waterstress.

AB  - Eleven Norway spruce Picea abies (L.) Karst. forests in the boreal zone of Sweden were studied to investigate the effects of selective cuttings on wood-inhabiting fungi from the families Polyporaceae, Hymenochaetaceae and Corticiaceae (Basidiomycota). The II sites constitute a gradient from extensively logged to semi-natural forests. Old selective leggings that occurred about 100 years ago have significantly decreased the availability of large and highly decayed logs. Based on fruit bodies, both the total species number as well as the number of threatened species decreased with increasing degree of cutting.
   Some of the occurring wood-inhabiting fungi are commonly accepted as indicator species of forests with old-growth conditions. These species showed pronounced preferences for well decayed and large logs. They were also more frequent in the less affected sites and became rarer with increasing degree of cutting; they therefore seem to be good indicators of forests less affected by logging.

AB  - Twins in naturally deformed coarse-grained limestones of the northern Subalpine Chain (France) show a direct relationship of twin width and intensity (number of twins per mm) to the peak metamorphism under diagenetic and anchimetamorphic conditions.  The transition from dominant thin twinning to dominant thick twinning occurs between a mean vitrinite reflectance (Ro) of 1.60 and 2.60, or temperatures of between 150 and 200-degrees-C.  Below the transition temperature, increasing strain is apparently accommodated by adding new twins, and above the transition temperature, increasing strain is accommodated by twin widening.  Similar transitions from thin to thick twinning with increasing metamorphism are also present in the Helvetic Alps, the Prealps, and the Central Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province.  These data for naturally deformed limestones support the interpretation from experimental studies of a temperature effect on twin width and intensity and indicate that the twinning in the northern Subalpine Chain occurred at or near peak metamorphism.

AB  - This paper presents the palynological results obtained from the Late Pleistocene deposits of Lake Magadi, Kenya (1-degrees-50'S, 36-degrees-18'E, 600 m), today located in the most arid region of East Africa. It documents the vegetational and climatic environment of the lake for two well defined periods: the Pleistocene-Holocene transition before 10 800 +/- 120 B.P., and the last glacial episode dated 17 710 +/- 220 B.P.. Compared with modern pollen data from the region, the microflora show the occurrence of an open vegetation. But the scarcity or absence of arid pollen indicators suggests more humid conditions than today, a conclusion that is confirmed by lithological and sedimentological analysis. The Holocene is missing and the most humid episode is registered between 12 000 and 10 000 B.P.. Highest allochtonous pollen input indicates an increased runoff, mostly related to higher rainfall during that period. The palynological results questionned the 17 000 B.P. C-14 ages for the bottom of the core.

AB  - In this research, a new drought monitoring approach with an adaptive index-Vector Projection Analysis (VPA) and Vector Projection Index of Drought (VPID)- was developed that considers multiple drought indicators in various climate zones across the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and East Asia. A major advantage of VPA is that it uses multiple dependent variables (i.e., surface-based drought indices) and multiple independent variables (i.e., satellite-derived drought factors) to capture varied climate and environmental characteristics. Therefore, the VPA-based indices can be adopted for different drought types (i.e., meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts) depending on the user's selection of drought factors and indices. In VPA, the weights of each drought factor are generated through correlations (r) between each dependent variable and a satellite-derived drought factor that is obtained from the new generation sensor systems, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM). Three schemes of VPID with different combinations of variables focused on integrated-, short-, and long-term drought (VPIDinte, VPIDshort, and VPIDlong, respectively) were evaluated over the CONUS and East Asia. All three schemes showed good agreement with surface-based drought indices resulting in averaged r (from 0.42 to 0.68) across both study areas. While VPIDshort or VPIDlong were more correlated with short (1-3 months) or long (9-12 months) term surface-based drought indices, VPIDinte provided a more generalized (i.e., integrated from 1 to 12 months) index that is suitable for varied drought conditions. The spatial distributions of drought from VPIDs agreed with United States Drought Monitor (USDM) data and Emergency Events Database across East Asia for both extreme drought and normal conditions. In particular, the drought areas of VPIDinte corresponded with the USDM results with r = 0.83 and root mean square error = 9.4%. Crop yield trends were also consistent with the VPIDs results in most years for both study areas. The proposed approach, VPA and VPID, can be adopted for any region with different combinations of surface-based drought indices and satellite-derived drought factors.

AB  - Despite serious health and environmental burdens associated with air pollution by NOx, the emission ceilings have been systematically exceeded in big European cities for several years. Photocatalytic technology can be an efficient solution for the removal of chemical air pollutants. Because diesel engine exhaust is the main source of NO(x)emissions, the application of a photocatalyst onto road pavement appears to be an effective NO(x)abatement method due to the large surface area, proximity to the emission source, and relatively good solar irradiance. Several laboratory-scale studies provided evidence demonstrating that most harmful contaminants can be readily mineralized. Furthermore, several projects were aiming to scale up this technology to pilot and real scales. Although the photocatalytic performances of selected materials in real urban environments were determined in some of these studies, the data are not conclusive for evaluating the overall performance because other material characteristics relevant to their functionality were not assessed. The lack of conformity criteria suitable for the evaluation of the overall performance of photocatalytic pavement under real operational conditions has generated skepticism and mistrust among public authorities and relevant stakeholders, which constrains the widespread implementation of this promising technology. In this context, the project LIFE-Photoscaling was focused on developing a new holistic conceptual framework to assess the photocatalytic pavement performance using the decision tool "Photoscaling Decision Maker" based on a set of quantitative indicators. For this purpose, a large volume of data obtained for 10 types of photocatalytic pavement materials was systemized on both the laboratory and pilot plant scales and three main indicators were defined: (1) photocatalytic performance effectiveness, (2) intrinsic performance, and (3) undesired secondary effects. Each top-level indicator includes several low-level subindicators associated with specific material characteristics. Finally, the ranges of the main indicators and subindicators and methods for their assessment were determined. These methods include standard, adopted, and original characterization techniques, which were selected based on the criteria such as simplicity, cost- and time-effectiveness, and relevance regarding the operational conditions.

AB  - The postmortem microbiome plays an important functional role in host decomposition after death. Postmortem microbiome community successional patterns are specific to body site, with a significant shift in composition 48 h after death. While the postmortem microbiome has important forensic applications for postmortem interval estimation, it also has the potential to aid in manner of death (MOD) and cause of death (COD) determination as a reflection of antemortem health status. To further explore this association, we tested beta-dispersion, or the variability of microbiomes within the context of the "Anna Karenina Principle" (AKP). The foundational principle of AKP is that stressors affect microbiomes in unpredictable ways, which increases community beta-dispersion. We hypothesized that cases with identified M/CODs would have differential community beta-dispersion that reflected antemortem conditions, specifically that cardiovascular disease and/or natural deaths would have higher beta-dispersion compared to other deaths (e.g., accidents, drug-related deaths). Using a published microbiome data set of 188 postmortem cases (five body sites per case) collected during routine autopsy in Wayne County (Detroit), MI, we modeled beta-dispersion to test for M/COD associationsa priori. Logistic regression models of beta-dispersion and case demographic data were used to classify M/COD. We demonstrated that beta-dispersion, along with case demographic data, could distinguish among M/COD - especially cardiovascular disease and drug related deaths, which were correctly classified in 79% of cases. Binary logistic regression models had higher correct classifications than multinomial logistic regression models, but changing the defined microbial community (e.g., full vs. non-core communities) used to calculate beta-dispersion overall did not improve model classification or M/COD. Furthermore, we tested our analytic approach on a case study that predicted suicides from other deaths, as well as distinguishing MOD (e.g., homicides vs. suicides) within COD (e.g., gunshot wound). We propose an analytical workflow that combines postmortem microbiome indicator taxa, beta-dispersion, and case demographic data for predicting MOD and COD classifications. Overall, we provide further evidence the postmortem microbiome is linked to the host's antemortem health condition(s), while also demonstrating the potential utility of including beta-dispersion (a non-taxon dependent approach) coupled with case demographic data for death determination.

AB  - Concerns about the welfare of lactating sows housed in farrowing crates have emerged because crates physically restrict the sows and possibly compromise their behavior and comfort. The aim of this study was to identify how the opening of a hinged farrowing crate on different days (4 or 7) post-farrowing impacts sow welfare. A total of 36 sows were studied. The sows were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatment groups: PC- crate remained closed until weaning (n = 13), T4- crate was opened on day 4 post-farrowing (n = 12), and T7- crate opened on day 7 post-farrowing (n = 11). Three different types of welfare indicators were used: behavioral (activity, posture and location-direction inside the pen), physical (udder and body lesions, lameness and body condition score) and physiological (salivary cortisol concentration). On days 3-8 post-farrowing, sow behavior was captured by continuous video recording of each individual sow daily from 6:00 h to 18:00 h. Sow behavior was observed using instantaneous recording (with a 2-minute fixed sampling interval) and focal animal as the sampling route. Salivary samples were also collected on these same days at 8:00 h. Lameness and body condition score (BCS) were evaluated when the sows were moved to farrowing pens and again when they were weaned, while skin lesions were evaluated on those days as well as on days 4 and 7 post-farrowing. After opening the crates (either at 4 or 7 days post-farrowing), we observed that sows utilized the additional space provided to them. Sows exhibited a - 5 fold average increase in the number of different orientations and positions that they occupied in the pen after the crate was opened. Furthermore, sows also spent more time active and performing motivated behaviors such as interacting with their piglets and exploring the environment. Sows kept in pens with open crates also had less teats lesions on day 21 post farrowing compared to sows remaining in closed crates. Salivary cortisol concentration differed only on day 5 as the mean concentration for T4 was greater than T7, but neither differed from PC. Taken together, both behavioral and physical measures of welfare employed in this study indicate that the opening of a hinged farrowing crate contributes to improving the welfare of lactating sows.

AB  - Social structures of group-living farm animals can have important implications for animal welfare and productivity. Understanding which factors can have an effect on social behaviour is thus important in order to develop the best management strategies in livestock industries. Here, we studied the social network structure of a flock of 84 Poll Dorset ewes and collecting dyadic associations data through the use of proximity sensors during two study periods. First, we analysed the social structure of ewes at a group-level, by analysing the community structure, and at individual-level, by determining whether the ewes showed social differentiation in their association patterns. Second, we measured for the contribution of genetic relatedness, age, weight, reproductive status and previous management sub grouping on social associations to test for homophily effects. Lastly, we evaluated whether social clustering was influenced by the stocking density of individuals in a field, and by weather parameters, through the use of two climatic indices, the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI) and the Wind Chill Index (WCI). Our results showed that the pairwise associations between ewes are not-random and highly heterogeneous, both in total time spent in contact and in contacts duration. There was no evidence that ewes were subdivided into social communities, and at individual level, they showed markedly differentiated social relationships, demonstrating preferences in social ties. However, the factors that influenced the preferred social interactions between individuals changed over time. In the first study period ewes tended to maintain the social bonds formed in previous management sub grouping, most likely due to a social familiarization resulting from repeated interactions with the same individuals. In the second study period similarity in age influenced the strength of associations among ewes. We found no significant influence of reproductive status, weight (as an indicator of body size) and genetic relatedness on proximity associations in either study period. Moreover, our results showed the tendency of the ewes to form social clusters varied in relation to animals' density, and Wind Chill Index (WCI). The identification of conditions that modify the social behaviour of sheep is critically important in order to implement management and productivity strategies and our results highlight how flock social structure can change depending on environmental and social contexts.

AB  - Governments worldwide are cognizant of the deficiencies of measuring quality of life according to gross domestic product; consequently, they have created indicators of citizen well-being that can be applied in governmental policy. To improve citizens' lives, governments should create an environment with maximal quality of life, ideal material living conditions, and sustainable well-being and determine the true needs of citizens. This paper proposes a hybrid multiple-attribute decision-making model with a modified PROMETHEE method that can identify practical performance-improvement strategies for the sustainable development of a better life by accounting for the complex dependencies among the indicators. In the proposed model, an influential network relation map is first obtained using the DEMATEL method to delineate the interrelationships among the indicators. Second, to address the feedback and dependence concerns associated with interrelationships among criteria, the influence weights are identified through the DANP method. Finally, the degree of preference is determined through the modified PROMETHEE method and combined with the influence weights to calculate flow indicators, which facilitate attaining the aspiration level. The aspiration level is set and an aspiration alternative is identified as an improvement benchmark to facilitate continual melioration and sustainable development of a better life. This model uses the OECD well-being indicators consisting of 11 dimensions and 24 criteria to measure material living conditions (namely housing, income, jobs) and quality of life (namely civic engagement, community, education, environment, health, life satisfaction, safety, and work-life balance). An empirical case study was performed to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model by using questionnaire data of six cities in Taiwan. Our results prove that the proposed model (aspired-worst as benchmark) outperforms the traditional model (max-min as benchmark) and that it can obtain more realistic net flows and an improvement benchmark to conduct ranking, selection, and continual improvement for facilitating sustainable development of a better life.

AB  - Widespread Lower Triassic microbial carbonates occur after the end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) and are commonly attributed to reduced metazoan competition after the EPME, or to paleoceanographic conditions that suppressed metazoan abundance and increased ocean carbonate saturation. Testing these hypotheses requires direct spatial (versus temporal) linkages between Lower Triassic microbial deposits and lithologic or geochemical proxy evidence for environmental perturbations. This study uses facies within and associated with an extensive Lower Triassic (Smithian) microbial carbonate mound complex, which developed across a > 400-km-wide middle-to-inner shelf in southern Utah, U.S.A., to assess potential controls on microbial carbonate development.
   Middle-shelf microbial mounds (1-2 m tall) are composed of stromatactis-rich peloidal boundstones that are laterally linked by microbial intermound beds. Inner-shelf microbial mounds (< 1 m) are composed of microbial laminites that are linked by flat-lying microbial laminite intermound beds. Both mound types nucleated atop non-mound microbial carbonates in deep-to shallow-subtidal environments and aggraded during sea-level rise. During sea-level fall, mounds broadened, shortened, and terminated growth when higher current energies inhibited substrate stability and mat nucleation. Middle- and inner-shelf mound morphologies and facies differences reflect across-shelf accommodation space variations and proximity to nearshore terrigenous sediment influx.
   Sparse, but persistent benthic fauna and bioturbation in all microbial facies and the lack of lithologic indicators of bottom-water anoxia indicate sufficient O-2 levels to support animal life. The broad Utah shelf study area implies that shelf-edge, upwelling-derived, carbonate-saturated waters did not control microbial carbonate precipitation. Regional controls on microbial mound complex development include deposition during sea-level rise along a wide shallow shelf that maximized the areal extent of clear-water, low-energy subtidal environments and promoted growth of prolific photosynthesizing microbial communities. Probable global controls include the post-EPME reduction in skeletal metazoan competition, which permitted microbial mats to flourish, and elevated global-ocean carbonate saturation states and promoted extensive carbonate precipitation.

AB  - Coastal barriers store depositional records of past environmental conditions, such as sea level, wave climate and sedimentary regime. The embayed highstand coast of southeast Australia features a diverse range of coastal sand barriers, suggesting varying depositional responses to Holocene environmental conditions. In particular, the varying chronologies of prograded-barrier strandplains along a passive margin, with a predominantly autochthonous sedimentary regime, raises questions about relative sea-level change, and sediment sharing within and between compartments during the Holocene. Here we apply detailed geological data and geochronology from the Holocene prograded-barrier system at Tuncurry, within a morphodynamic modelling approach, to investigate the depositional response of the coastal system to possible drivers of strandplain growth, including: (1) forced regression driven by mid- to late-Holocene relative sea-level fall; (2) time-varying external sand supply via the alongshore transport system; and, (3) shoreface sand supply in response to disequilibrium morphology and stable sea level, Comparison between the simulated depositional response of the coastal system and the geological records suggests that progressively weakening and depth-decaying shoreface sand supply, in response to disequilibrium morphology, was the primary driver of Holocene strandplain growth. Alongshore sand transport into the Tuncurry compartment via a headland-attached shelf sand body may have provided a secondary sand source, although the simulated barrier-shoreface evolution precludes a dominant external sand supply. Mid- to late-Holocene sea level-fall from a highstand level within the range of uncertainty in available indicators (1.5 m above present), could only have contributed a minor portion of strandplain growth, by process of forced regression. The simulations demonstrate the potential sensitivity of strandplain chronologies to the sampling location (i.e. shoreface or dune facies), which emerges from coupled barrier-shoreface evolution that may support time-decaying volumetric growth and steady shoreline progradation simultaneously. Shoreface sand supply driven by the ongoing relaxation of disequilibrium morphology may persist at subtle rates (1-2 m(3)/m/yr) today on some southeast Australian beaches, promoting shoreline stability, and potentially moderating initial shoreline response to sea-level rise.

AB  - To characterize water quality in terms of dissolved elements and to investigate both the origin of the water and the source and behavior of groundwater contaminants in Metro Manila, 33 water (groundwater and surface water) samples were analyzed for ion and element concentrations, H and 0 isotope ratios (delta D-H2O and delta O-18-H2O), SO42- isotope ratios (delta S-34-SO42- and delta O-18-SO42-), and Sr isotope ratio (Sr-87/Sr-86). The chemical measurements showed that the primary important environmental concerns within Metro Manila are groundwater salinization for both shallow and deep aquifers, and As concentrations (up to 22.5 mu g/L) in shallow groundwaters. Comparison of SO42- and Sr isotope values with possible source materials revealed that contamination by man-made materials such as fertilizers and detergents are present in some shallow groundwaters. Shallow groundwater having higher delta D-H2O and delta O-18-H2O values (av. -44.parts per thousand +/- 5.6 parts per thousand and -6.8 parts per thousand +/- 0.6 parts per thousand respectively, n = 15) than deep groundwater (ay. -48 parts per thousand +/- 4.4 parts per thousand. and -7.4 parts per thousand +/- 0.7 parts per thousand , respectively, n = 7) suggests that the origins of H2O in both groundwaters are different from each other. Since the mixing of shallow and deep groundwater does not commonly occur under Metro Manila, the contaminants in the shallow aquifers are unlikely to be transported into the deep aquifers. Sulfate reduction by bacterial activity was observed for some groundwaters, resulting in a maximum elevation in delta S-34-SO42- values of around 10 parts per thousand . By using SO42- isotope ratios as an indicator of changes in redox conditions and Sr isotope ratio as a source indicator, it was shown that As was dissolved from unconsolidated sedimentary deposits of volcanic origin which enclose shallow unconfined aquifers, but was not the result of changes in redox conditions. The study demonstrated that multi-isotope ratios are useful for evaluating water quality problems in urban groundwaters. 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hyperarid polar desert of the McMurdo Dry Valleys contains an abundance of aeolian sedimentary deposits, the largest in Antarctica, providing a unique setting for studying cold climate aeolian processes and dune morphology. Meteorological controls on sand transport and changes in dune morphology were monitored for 11 days in November-December 2004 on a barchan dune in the Victoria Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys. Sand transport in this environment was found to be influenced by, (1) interparticle cohesion (ice-bonding); (2) diurnal variations in the speed of thermally driven easterly valley winds due to reduced solar heating by 'night'; and (3) topographically modified foehn southwesterly winds. The threshold entrainment velocity during easterly valleys winds was 5.3 ms(-1) (at 0.4 m) +/- 0.21 m s(-1). Warm, dry and gusty fochn southwesterly winds were found to promote aeolian processes by dislodging surface sediments, with dune morphology responding rapidly. Importantly, no diurnal signal in sand transport was observed under these conditions when wind speed and sand transport occurred independently of solar heating. Measured changes in dune morphology indicate that the dune field of the Victoria Valley under current environmental conditions is in dynamic equilibrium, with frequent up-valley sand transport by thermally generated valley winds balanced by less frequent but greater magnitude down-valley sand transport by moderate to strong foehn southwesterlies. This results in little net movement of dunes and subsequent change in the position of the dune field. Accordingly, we believe that regional-scale shifts in climate that cause change in the synoptic circulation patterns of the Ross Sea region that affect the frequency of either the up-valley easterlies or down-valley foehn winds will result in a net change in the morphology of the Victoria Valley's dune field. Such change in circulation may become apparent early as change in the morphology of the Victoria Valley sand dunes. We therefore suggest this site should be monitored as an indicator site for identifying change in regional weather and climate. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This research was aimed to determine the relationship between some nitrogen (N) indicators (plant N status and soil characteristics) and yield and quality of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) cropped in a winter greenhouse. Therefore, it was studied the possibility: i) to evaluate the potential of the indicators as a tool to predict plant yields; ii) to avoid salt accumulation in the soil and nitrate pollution; iii) to find the best N fertilization rate and application time, The experiment was carried out in Mediterranean environment in a complete randomized block experimental design with four replications. Based on different conductivities of irrigation water, two extreme N fertilizing levels (unfertilized control and N 500 kg ha(-1)) were compared with a treatment at low environmental impact (N 100 kg ha(-1)). Plant characteristics (number of both flowers and fruits setting, fruits maturity), soil parameters (nitrate content, electrical conductivity, pH) and plant N status (petiole nitrate concentration, leaf SPAD readings) were recorded during the tomato cropping cycle. At harvest, yields (total, marketable, green and overripe) and fruit quality (morphological and chemical parameters) were determined. The results highlighted that petiole nitrate concentration, nitrate content and electrical conductivity of the soil can be considered reliable diagnostic indicators to develop a recommended N level in greenhouse tomato crops. No significant difference among treatments was found in SPAD readings, due to the specific conditions of greenhouse (low daylight). Nitrate content and electrical conductivity in the soil were significantly greater in the highest N fertilization level during the whole growing cycle and at final harvest (13.7 and 3.7 times the unfertilized control, respectively), indicating that a share of N fertilizer remained in the soil, with a possible accumulation or leaching. Conversely, the lower N fertilization treatment showed no significant difference in soil nitrate and only a slight increase in electrical conductivity in respect to the control. No significant yielding difference was found between the two N fertilization treatments, but they showed an increase of about 17% in total yield, compared to unfertilized treatment. The results of this research pointed out that the treatment with N 100 kg ha(-1) seems to allow a good balance among productivity, quality, plant nitrate utilization and pollution risks.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to define the quality of life (QOL) and the quality of working life (QOWL) conceptions and their components, to establish the quality of life evaluation and to report the results of the employee's quality of working life research.
   Quality of life is influenced by an individual's physical and mental health, the degree of independency, the social relationship with the environment and other factors. Quality of life could be defined as an individual's satisfaction with his or her life dimensions comparing with his or her ideal life. Evaluation of the quality of life depends on one's value system.
   The quality of working life could be defined as work place strategies, processes and environment combination, which stimulates employee's job satisfaction. It also depends on work conditions and organization's efficiency.
   The quality of life model includes seven factors and indicators to represent these factors. This model was used in the study. The objective of the study was to evaluate the quality of life and the quality of working life value of the particular organization's employees.
   26 men and 15 women working in the middle-sized industrial organization were surveyed. They were asked to evaluate seven domains of QOL and QOWL: physical state, material state, emotional state, social relationship, education and self-improvement, self-expression and leisure, safety and environment.
   The study enabled to find out that the employees are more satisfied with quality of life (3.47 points) than quality of working life (3.45 points). The respondents are least satisfied with their material state. Quality of life directly correlates with quality of working life (r = 0.76). Employees quality of working life value and their seven factors have a moderately correlation (r = 0.55-0.66). While quality of life highly correlates with physical state (r = 0.84), material state (r = 0.71). Social - demographic elements have less influence on quality of life and quality of working life estimation.
   The research findings show that studied organization has possibilities to increase its employees' quality of life and loyalty by improving working conditions and environment. High value of the quality of working life directly influences higher quality of life.

AB  - This article presents the studied results of the biological properties and biosafety indicators of probion strains isolated from drone milk of honey bee (Apismellifera). It was established that the isolated cultures of microorganisms (Bifidobacterium asteroides strain DFM5, Fructobacillus fructosus strain DF74, and Lactobacillus kunkeei strain DFM21) reacted differently to aggressive media, with the best tolerance to experimental biological fluids being shown by strain intact. As a result of repeated reseeding, antibiotic resistance in each culture was increased. The isolated cultures of microorganisms have low toxicity for laboratory animals, both in acute and in chronic experience, since prolonged use of microbial compositions does not negatively affect the general condition of mice, their clinical status, morphological and biochemical blood parameters, and there are no negative effects on organs and tissues of experimental animals.

AB  - Changes of the climate regime due the temperatures, sunstroke and rainfall, fall within the global context, but with the specifics of the geographical area where the vineyard is located. The study carried out between November 2015 and October 2018 in the Murfatlar vineyard showed that the average global temperature value increased, and during the vegetation period there was a pluviometric excess and an increase in the frequency of extreme phenomena as a consequence of climate change. From climatic point of view, during the vegetation period in the years 2016 and 2017 high heliothermal resources were recorded, and the year 2018 was characterized by a poor heliothermal regime. The effects of these changes were significantly reflected in the quantity and quality of grape production in Murfatlar vineyard varieties: 'Columna', 'Mamaia' and 'Feteasca neagra', demonstrating that there is an interference between the environmental factors and the obtained production.

AB  - Sediment cores are used to reconstruct the chronological evolution of contamination in impacted areas while deep core levels may be considered as reference conditions for the assessment of environmental status. For this purpose, the collection of undisturbed cores is essential. Vibro and gravity corers are the most used devices for environmental research. In this study, chemical (Ba, Hg and PCBs) and grain size data obtained by means of gravity (SW-104) and vibro (Rossfelder (R)) corer from 3 stations of the heavily contaminated Augusta harbor (Sicily, Italy) were considered. Their vertical profiles were compared considering the different technical characteristics of corers, in order to highlight differences in data acquisition. Results showed that, for areas characterized by high sedimentation rates, the vibrocorer is the best choice for the higher penetration capacity. No significant differences were recognized for sediment compaction and potential downward drag of the contaminants.

AB  - Urban renewal provides valuable opportunities for sustainable development. Sustainability assessment is considered a useful tool in ensuring sustainable development in practice. Although a number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential of urban renewal, studies on sustainability assessment in urban renewal at a neighborhood scale are often ignored. However, urban renewal is normally accompanied by many social, economic, and environmental conflicts among various stakeholders. The present paper proposes a framework for assessing neighborhood sustainability to support urban renewal decision making in high-density cities such as Hong Kong. This framework includes two components: (1) sustainability and building condition and (2) a decision-making matrix for urban renewal strategies. A case study was conducted to illustrate how this framework can be applied in the decision-making process of urban renewal projects. The results are expected to provide references for urban renewal decision making in high-density cities.

AB  - Environmental changes in the northern Antarctic Peninsula provide a sensitive local indicator of climate warming. A consequence of these changes is the activation of surface and subsurface hydrological cycles in areas where water, in colder conditions, would remain frozen. This paper analyses the effects of hydrological cycle activation at Cape Lamb, Vega Island. The conclusions are based on hydrochemistry and isotope interpretation of 51 representative water samples from precipitation, streams, lakes, ice, snow and groundwater. Based on these results relationships between the different components of the hydrological cycle are proposed. This paper highlights the important contribution of groundwater to surface water chemistry, the disconnection of the lakes from the overall flow, the lack of an ocean spray signature in surface water and groundwater and the significant influence of windblown dust in the composition of the analysed waters.

AB  - Earlywood, latewood, total ring width and cross-sectional earlywood vessel lumen areas were measured in twenty-one Fraxinus nigra trees located in the southern boreal region of Quebec, Canada. Two of the trees survived a severe fire in 1923 during which year almost no latewood was produced. In 1924 both trees produced rings with a strong decrease in the size of the largest earlywood vessels. This synchronized size decrease in cross-sectional earlywood vessel lumen area was not observed in other years and is likely a response of the trees to either direct injury or changes in environmental conditions associated with fire. Vessel characteristics in ring-porous species have the potential to be used in conjunction with other indicators of fire to extend fire history reconstructions on a spatial scale.

AB  - As important environmental features, mixing properties of inland water bodies in unsteady flow conditions are investigated. Time-dependent motion, often resulting in chaotic behavior, requires the Lagrangian description of the transport. As a simple example, unsteady hydrodynamics driven by periodical wind forcing in a simplified shallow lake geometry is considered to explore the main chaotic properties. In the modelled flow field methods identifying strong and weak shearing sub-regions are proposed and applied as mixing indicators. These include the determination and inter-comparison of the finite size Lyapunov exponents (FSLE), the residence time, and the implementation of the so-called leaking method. Coherent structures as stable and unstable manifolds are also identified, playing the role of Lagrangian barriers that hinder local transversal material transfer, and avenues that significantly channel transport. The primary effect of turbulent diffusion on the FSLE fields is also demonstrated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deals with the problem of damage detection using output-only vibration measurements under changing environmental conditions. Two types of features are extracted from the measurements: eigenproperties of the structure using an automated stochastic subspace identification procedure and peak indicators computed on the Fourier transform of modal filters. The effects of environment are treated using factor analysis and damage is detected using statistical process control with the multivariate Shewhart-T control charts.
   A numerical example of a bridge subject to environmental changes and damage is presented. The sensitivity of the damage detection procedure to noise on the measurements, environment and damage is studied. An estimation of the computational time needed to extract the different features is given, and a table is provided to summarize the advantages and drawbacks of each of the features studied.

AB  - Nitric oxide has been reported to act as a signalling molecule in different plant tissues and to participate in a variety of physiological processes. It is produced by different enzymes and sources. The root-specific plasma membrane-bound enzymes forming NO from the substrates nitrate and nitrite are of particular interest because roots serve as interfaces between plants and the soil. The co-ordinated activity of the root-specific plasma membrane-bound nitrate reductase (PM-NR) and nitrite:NO reductase (NI-NOR) suggests that NO might also be involved in root signalling and development. The rate of enzymatic production of this NO depends largely on the environmental conditions, mainly the availability of nitrate and oxygen and it is proposed that this NO plays a role during anoxia as an indicator of the external nitrate availability and in regulating symbiotic interactions at the root surface.

AB  - The vegetation of semi-natural grasslands under modem, cereal/forage cropping in Finnish Karelia (n = 11) and old fashioned animal husbandry in adjacent Russian Karelia (n = 11) was compared in terms of their species composition. Each grassland site was paired with one in the other country which was as similar as possible in respect to its natural conditions. The species composition indicated differences in management between the two countries. The mean number of species was 45.5 in the Finnish sites and 52.6 in the Russian sites. A total of 12 species exhibited a statistical difference in their indicator values between the two countries. Traditional grassland species (e.g. Leontodon hispidus, Dianthus deltoides), indicating grazing, hay making and old settlement, occurred more often in Russian sites, while species related to nutrient enrichment and cultivation (e.g. Urtica dioica, Elymus repens) were more characteristic of Finnish sites.

AB  - Salmonella regulates transcription of many of its genes in response to environmental conditions encountered inside or outside the eukaryotic cells it infects. In this paper, we examined Salmonella typhimurium gene expression within epithelial cells, by using bacterial luciferase as a reporter. We focused on gene expression controlled by Salmonella rfa promoter, using lac promoter as a control. We observed down regulation for both promoters during the initial 2 h of invasion. The decreased levels of luciferase activity appeared to be due to metabolic changes, since we observed similar results with tissue culture medium alone. Gene expression stabilized to a new steady state for the Salmonella rfa promoter, while a lac promoter activity steadily decreased. Bacterial luciferase activity was a good indicator of intracellular numbers and allowed us to detect as few as 1000 bacterial cells/infected monolayer. Both promoters were not dependent on host protein synthesis for expression.

AB  - In precision farming, accurate estimation of canopy nitrogen concentration (CNC) is valuable for effective crop growth monitoring and nitrogen (N) fertiliser management. To date, many canopy multispectral indices have been proposed as indicators for CNC; however, many of these indices have also shown sensitivity to biomass and their performance drops at high biomass levels. Dependence on growth stage, season, or other environmental conditions limits their efficacy as generalized CNC indices. The objectives of this study were to assess the robustness of popular CNC indices across a wide range of biomass levels and fertiliser application levels; and for two contrasting seasons ? winter and summer. To achieve this, we analysed the efficacy of seven canopy nitrogen indices, including canopy chlorophyll content index (CCCI), together with eleven other commonly used spectral indices. We used canopy level solar-induced hyperspectral reflectance data acquired using a hand-held optical spectroradiometer across four growth stages in winter (May-June 2018) and four in summer (January-February 2019) from an experimental field of irrigated perennial ryegrass with variable N application in Victoria, Australia. The field contained 40 plots, each with one of eight different N treatments. Almost all the indices exhibited similar correlation to CNC (%) when applied to individual stages (days) in both winter and summer; however, relationships between CNC and individual indices varied significantly between stages. We obtained similar results for canopy biomass. When the data across the entire range of growth stages and seasons were combined, the correlations between most canopy nitrogen indices and CNC became weak (R-2 < 0.25, 0.9% < RMSE < 1.0%). PRI exhibited the highest correlation with CNC (R-2 = 0.58, RMSE = 0.7%) for the combined data set. Even so, PRI?s association with CNC and canopy biomass changed with the season. Most indices responded to both CNC and biomass simultaneously, and this confounds the estimation of CNC due to strong but growth stage specific relationships between CNC and canopy biomass. This study shows that it is important to consider a wide range of conditions when evaluating multispectral CNC indices.

AB  - Introduction: This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the safety performance of workers in Indian construction industry. The key indicators to measure the safety and health conditions are identified and prioritized on the basis of the importance in the establishment of safe and healthy work environment.
   Design/methodology/approach: From the literature review and inputs from the construction managers, key safety indicators were identified. The prioritization was accomplished using multi-criteria ranking method (MCRM). Dominance-based Rough Set (DRSA) is used for the ranking of indicators. It is based on Rough set theory which draws motivation from the indiscernibility relation between the objects. The importance of each indicator is assessed by MCRM method in the contribution towards establishing a safe workplace environment from different perspectives in a construction industry that includes management from top, middle and low-level management.
   Findings: The role and involvement of management in the operations and constant interaction with workers were found to have a significant impact on the safety performance of the firms. Imparting necessary safety training to the employees and promoting a friendly atmosphere at the workplace aids in building the confidence of the workers that subsequently make them safety compliant. Dedicated staff to ensure that the workers are following safety protocols enlisted in safety manuals acquires an important place in the measurement of the safety performance of the firms.
   Practical implications: The findings of the current study will help the senior management in the small scale Indian construction industry to gain a perspective to- wards the assessment of safety condition in the firms and establishing an efficient and easy-to-use safety assessment framework. It will also be useful for middle and low-level management, since they should read the results as a positive effect of their constant interaction with workers. Management is suggested to design a well-organized and detailed manual that documents the safety-related information including the proper use of safety equipment and emergency procedures.
   Originality/value: This paper proposes a safety framework for small-scale Indian construction industry for calibration and benchmarking safety performance of the employees. The mathematical foundation of the framework is the multi-criteria ranking based on Dominance based Rough set approach.

AB  - The atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing meaningfully in recent years and is involved in climate change. The conventional approaches to reduce atmospheric CO2 need significant area of storage related with high costs of monitoring, operation, and maintenance. The microalgae based CO2 capture is an environmentally sustainable choice and the captured CO2 is not required to dispose further. However, culture conditions of microalgae are very important to maximize CO2 biofixation rate. Therefore, this study is aimed to investigate the factors of CO2 biofixation rate utilizing Chlorella vulgaris microalgae in an in-house fabricated microreactor (a hybrid microfluidic-differential carbonator, mu-DC). Initially, the microalgal capability of biofixation was investigated at different independent variables: volume % of CO2, light intensity, and inlet ratio of microalgae to media. The effects of these variables were analyzed using full factorial design (FFD) and found that light intensity had less impact compared to others, while both CO2 concentration and mciroalgae to media ratio were found to be significant factors. The response surface methodology (RSM) with face centered central composite design (FC-CCD) and desirability function based approaches were then used for both single- and multi-objective optimization. In multi-objective optimization, the optimized conditions were: 6% CO2 in air and 0.018 microalgae to media ratio, at which specific growth rate (SGR) of 0.766 d(-1), cell counts of 24.36 x 10(3) and CO2 biofixation rate of 0.2416 gL(-1)d(-1) with high overall desirability value (D > 0.7). The values of the coefficient of determination (R-2) for the fitted models were found to be more than 80 %. The predictive models were evaluated further based on other performance measuring indicators or error terms (e.g., relative error, mean absolute error, root mean square error) and these values were found apparently to be low, indicating that the model predictions were closer to the experimental results. ANOVA analyses showed that all developed models were statistically significant (p- values < 0.05). The results are in good agreement with literature reports.

AB  - Infrequent but high energy storm events can radically modify coastlines, at times displacing significant sediment volumes and changing shoreline configuration. More frequent and stronger Atlantic storms over the last 40 years have heightened the potential risk to coastal environments, population and infrastructure. Understanding local environmental forcing conditions and associated variables involved in coastal impact and response, can better inform future coastal management planning. This study examines the coastal impacts of two separate storms that occurred at Five Finger Strand, on the northwest Irish coast, in late 2017 (Storm Ophelia) and mid-2018 (Storm Hector). Using forcing parameters (wind speed and direction, wave heights and wave run up) along with 3D topographic surveys, impacts are examined for both storm events. For Storm Ophelia, shore-oblique to shore-parallel waves (2 m in height) coincident with low tide (similar to 0.8 m) were recorded. This resulted in minimal erosional impact which was corroborated by a new proxy storm impact index, "Storm Dune Trimming" (value of > 0.03) as well as a sediment displacement volume of 8,300 m(3), largely confined to the intertidal area with only limited foredune edge erosion. Storm Hector, on the other hand, a lower energy event than Storm Ophelia, resulted in much more pronounced sediment displacement (13,400 m(3) in the intertidal area) and significantly more dune scarping (Storm Dune Trimming > 0.09) due to better synchronicity of forcing factors such as high tide level, high wave heights and onshore wind direction. We conclude that storm energy is not always a direct indicator of coastal impact and that synchronicity of local forcing factors and antecedent beach conditions appears to be the most relevant in actual coastal response on sandy beaches. This study, therefore shows the importance of particular environmental parameters and their simultaneous timing in forcing change and is an important insight into which parameters may be more risk-relevant in producing erosion along many sandy, dune-fringed coasts of NW Europe.

AB  - Simple Summary The transport of livestock by sea (live export') is an important contemporary animal welfare issue in Australia. There is particular concern for the effects of heat load on the welfare of sheep being shipped live from Australia to the Middle East during the Northern Hemisphere summer. To reduce bias in a contentious context, we performed a systematic review of the literature relevant to Australian sea transport, heat load, and livestock. We discuss the factors contributing to harmful heat load, pathways for mitigating risks and existing knowledge gaps. We identified several areas requiring research to address these knowledge gaps.
   Abstract The transport of animals by sea (live export') is one of the most important current animal welfare issues in Australian society. Recent media attention has highlighted concerns regarding the effects of high environmental temperature and humidity on the welfare and mortality of sheep being shipped live from Australia to the Middle East, especially during the Northern Hemisphere summer. To improve understanding of how and why harmful heat load occurs, we systematically reviewed Australian research into heat load and sea transport. High thermal load occurs during the sea transport of sheep and cattle from Australia when animals are subject to hot and humid environmental conditions and cannot remove heat generated by metabolic processes in the body, potentially also gaining heat from the environment. Several approaches have been proposed to mitigate these risks, including avoidance of voyages in hot seasons, selection of heat-resistant livestock breeds, reducing stocking density, and improved ventilation. We identified a lack of scientific literature relating to heat load in animals transported by sea and considerable potential for bias in the literature that was found. We identified the following priority research areas: (i) experimental manipulation of variables thought to influence the incidence and severity of harmful heat load, including sheep density; (ii) further assessment of the Heat Stress Risk Assessment (HSRA) model used to predict heat load events, and (iii) development of a suite of animal welfare indicators that may allow identification of at risk' sheep before they reach debilitating heat load condition. Addressing these knowledge gaps will assist efforts to reduce the frequency and intensity of harmful heat load events.

AB  - The article deals with the condition of the Russian state and society in Putin's period. For the analysis, various international ratings and alternative assessments are used by the author. As an indicator of the quality of the state and publicity, their attitude toward objective information on the economic situation is suggested. According to the Russian tradition, the stateis treated as an important instrument of economic development. During the analyzed period, the role of the state has significantly increased, as a reaction to the negative consequences of its weakening in the 1990s. The nature and development of the Russian state was greatly influenced by the views and actions of V.V. Putin. The impact of Putin's life experience on his economic perspectives is analyzed. Putin'sprogram article written on the eve of the presidential elections of 2000 is considered. The author shows that the main directions of economic policy in Russia were outlined in the subsequent period. Putin's regime is characterized as a soft authoritarianism. The differences betweenthe indicators of the economic development of the Russian Federation and those of the successful countries adopted soft authoritarianism are explained. Political stability is noted among the positive consequences of soft authoritarianism in the economic field. Among the negative consequences, the lack of strategic thinking, the clan influences and the associated unsuccessful personnel policy, huge amounts of corruption are highlited. Dmitry Medvedev's different perspectives on the economy and society are identified, as a reaction to the economic failures that emerged during the 2008 crisis. A failure in their implementation is stated. The exhaustion of the positive influence of the Russian state on the economy is noted. The legislative and judicial power of The Russian Federation are analyzed: in an authoritarian regime, they ceased to be independent and positive. The state of public institutions is considered. Their degradation is stated. It is concluded that at present Russia lives in an creativeless institutional wilderness. Unsatisfactory state of the institutions is due to the consequences of the late Soviet legacy, the mistakes of the 1990s and the demographic crisis of the XX century, the degradation of education, culture and science.

AB  - In the framework of the ICON project (Integrated Assessment of Contaminant Impacts on the North Sea), muscle tissue from a total of 135 common dab (Limanda limanda) (20-28 cm total length) was collected in seven offshore sampling areas in the North Sea, at Iceland and in, the Baltic Sea during Aug/Sept and December 2008 for a chemical mercury speciation analysis by means of gas chromatography and detection by cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (GC-CVAFS). There was a highly significant correlation between concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg+) and inorganic mercury (Hg2+) in individual fish, and the mean ratio of MeHg+ compared to Sigma Hg (MeHg+ He+) was 94.0%. The results revealed statistically significant differences in concentrations of MeHg+ and Hg2+, respectively, between sampling areas. Mean concentrations in the German Bight (North Sea), in Icelandic waters and in Mecklenburg Bight (Baltic Sea) were low (MeHg+: 0.023-0.036; Hg2+: 0.001-0.002 mg/kg wet weight), while concentrations in dab from the Dogger Bank, Firth of Forth and the vicinity of the Ekofisk oil field (all North Sea) were significantly higher (MeHg+: 0.059-0.101; Hg2+; 0.003-0.004 mg/kg wet weight). Statistical correlation analysis on effects of host-specific factors revealed that neither length, weight, age, sex nor condition factor showed a significant relationship with Hg concentrations. However, Hg concentrations were significantly correlated with the Fish Disease Index (FDI), indicating a relationship between Hg concentrations and the health status of dab. Multiple linear regression analysis aiming to find factors affecting Hg concentrations revealed that only the sampling area had a highly significant main effect on Hg concentrations, and in some cases, additionally the condition factor contributed significantly to the final model. From the results, it cannot be excluded that elevated Hg concentration recorded in dab were linked to discharges from offshore oil and gas installations and that Hg affected the health status of dab.

AB  - Reliability of terrestrial ecosystem models highly depends on the quantity and quality of the data that have been used to calibrate the models. Nowadays, in situ observations of carbon fluxes are abundant. However, the knowledge of how much data (data length) and which subset of the time series data (data period) should be used to effectively calibrate the model is still lacking. This study uses the AmeriFlux carbon flux data to parameterize the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) with an adjoint-based data assimilation technique for various ecosystem types. Parameterization experiments are thus conducted to explore the impact of both data length and data period on the uncertainty reduction of the posterior model parameters and the quantification of site and regional carbon dynamics. We find that: (1) the model is better constrained when it uses two-year data comparing to using one-year data. Further, two-year data is sufficient in calibrating TEM's carbon dynamics, since using three-year data could only marginally improve the model performance at our study sites; (2) the model is better constrained with the data that have a higher "climate variability'' than that having a lower one. The climate variability is used to measure the overall possibility of the ecosystem to experience all climatic conditions including drought and extreme air temperatures and radiation; (3) the U.S. regional simulations indicate that the effect of calibration data length on carbon dynamics is amplified at regional and temporal scales, leading to large discrepancies among different parameterization experiments, especially in July and August. Our findings are conditioned on the specific model we used and the calibration sites we selected. The optimal calibration data length may not be suitable for other models. However, this study demonstrates that there may exist a threshold for calibration data length and simply using more data would not guarantee a better model parameterization and prediction. More importantly, climate variability might be an effective indicator of information within the data, which could help data selection for model parameterization. We believe our findings will benefit the ecosystem modeling community in using multiple-year data to improve model predictability.

AB  - Conditions of electrodeposition, i.e. a potential window of the process, addition of water, the current density. and morphology of substrate electrodes (Pt, Pt/TiO2, Au). were shown to influence strongly ion-exchange properties of polypyrrole (PPy) synthesized in propylene carbonate (PC), doped with ClO4- or p-toluenesulfonate (TOS-). "Electrochemical porosity" and redox activity of PPy films were compared to the characteristics of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). A molecular indicator of the PPy film structure packing was bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI-). Ion-exchange properties of PPy were found to be almost independent of chemical composition of the polymer, described in the literature as PPy(I), PPy(II). PPy(III). Instead, micro- and nanoscopic morphology of the polymer film and a molecular level packing of the polymer chains as well as the counterion nature are of the foremost importance. The polymer film structure/properties are shown to change upon prolonged redox/ionic stimulations. Lithium exchange between PPy films and contacting phases (PC electrolyte, TiO2) proceeds in addition to the anion exchange, the latter being a dominant process under conditions of the reversible electrochemical p-doping of PPy, although diffusion coefficients of PC solvated lithium ions in PPy are higher than diffusion coefficients of perchlorate, p-toluenesulfonate or bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anions. The highest flux of Li+ ions into/out of the PPy phase takes place about -1.0 V vs Ag/Ag+ which is clearly evidenced by the cathodic/anodic CV peaks. Cation transport phenomena can be analyzed independently from anion transport when observed at a longer time scale (low values of potential scan rate) as each prevails at different redox states of the polymer. However, in a shorter time scale (v >= 10 mV s(-1)), the opposite fluxes of cations and anions were observed to interfere. Furthermore, a net uptake of propylene carbonate by the as grown PPy film occurs at initial cycles of the cation uptake causing irreversible swelling of the polymer phase. Mechanisms of the redox process and accompanying mass transport involving PPy films were investigated using comparatively three techniques: cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM).

AB  - Current fisheries management policies generally require an assessment of stock status, which is a difficult task when population and fisheries data are limited. Three simple metrics based on catch length compositions (i.e., that reflect exclusive take of mature individuals, P-mat; that consist primarily of fish of optimal size, the size at which the highest yield from a cohort occurs, P-opt; and that demonstrate the conservation of large, mature individuals, P-mega) can be used to monitor population status relative to exploitation. The metrics (collectively referred to as P-x) were intended to avoid growth and recruitment overfishing, but there was no quantitative linkage to stock status and calculation of future sustainable catches. We attempt to make this connection by exploring the relationship of P-x measures to fishing mortality and spawning biomass (SB). The relationships are compared specifically to the current target reference point (0.4 times the virgin, or unfished, SB [SB0]) and limit reference point (0.25SB(0)) used for the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery by using simulations based on a deterministic age-structured population dynamics model. Sensitivity to fishery selectivity, life history traits, and recruitment compensation (steepness) is explored. Each P-x measure showed a wide range of possible values depending on fishery selectivity, steepness, and the ratio of the length at maturity (L-mat) to the optimal fishing length (L-opt). Although the values of P-x may be compatible with sustainable fishing, these values are not always sufficient to ensure stock protection from overfishing. Moreover, values for P-x cannot be interpreted adequately without knowledge of the selectivity pattern. A new measure, P-obj (the sum of P-mat, P-opt, and P-mega), is introduced to distinguish selectivity patterns and construct a decision tree for development of stock status indicators. Heuristic indicator values are presented to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Although several caveats remain, this approach builds on the recommendations of previous literature by giving further guidance related to interpreting catch length composition data under variable fishery conditions without collecting additional information. It also provides a link to developing harvest control rules that inform proactive fisheries management under data-limited conditions.

AB  - 1 Unravelling which factors affect where tropical trees grow is an important goal for ecologists and conservationists. At the landscape scale, debate is mostly focused on the degree to which the distributions of tree species are determined by soil conditions or by neutral, distance-dependent processes. Problems with spatial autocorrelation, sparse soil sampling, inclusion of species-poor sites with extreme edaphic conditions, and the difficulty of obtaining sufficient sample sizes have all complicated assessments for high diversity tropical forests.
   2 We evaluated the extent and pervasiveness of habitat association of trees within a 10 000 km 2 species-rich lowland landscape of uniform climate in south-west Amazonia. Forests growing on two non-flooded landscape units were inventoried using 88 floristic plots and detailed soil analyses, sampling up to 849 tree species. We applied single-species and community-level analytical techniques (frequency-distributions of presence records, association analysis, indicator species analysis, ordination, Mantel correlations, and multiple regression of distance matrices) to quantify soil/floristic relationships while controlling for spatial autocorrelation.
   3 Obligate habitat-restriction is very rare: among 230 tree species recorded in greater than or equal to 10 localities only five (2.2%) were always restricted to one landscape unit or the other.
   4 However, many species show a significant tendency to habitat association. For example, using Monte Carlo randomization tests, of the 34 most dominant species across the landscape the distributions of 26 (76.5%) are significantly related to habitat. We applied density-independent and frequency-independent estimates of habitat association and found that rarer species tend to score higher, suggesting that our full community estimates of habitat association are still underestimated due to the inadequate sampling of rarer species.
   5 Community-level floristic variation across the whole landscape is related to the variation in 14 of 16 measured soil variables, and to the geographical distances between samples.
   6 Multiple regression of distance matrices shows that 10% of the floristic variation can be attributed to spatial autocorrelation, but even after accounting for this at least 40% is attributable to measured environmental variation.
   7 Our results suggest that substrate-mediated local processes play a much more important role than distance-dependent processes in structuring forest composition in Amazonian landscapes.

AB  - The Arctic Ocean is an early warning system for indicators and effects of climate change. We use a novel combination of experimental and time-series data on effects of ocean warming and acidification on the commercially important Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) to incorporate these physiological processes into the recruitment model of the fish population. By running an ecological-economic optimization model, we investigate how the interaction of ocean warming, acidification and fishing pressure affects the sustainability of the fishery in terms of ecological, economic, social and consumer-related indicators, ranging from present day conditions up to future climate change scenarios. We find that near-term climate change will benefit the fishery, but under likely future warming and acidification this large fishery is at risk of collapse by the end of the century, even with the best adaptation effort in terms of reduced fishing pressure.

AB  - Socioeconomic inequities in the health outcomes of rheumatic diseases, including pain, have been well documented across countries and study designs. Nevertheless, health disparities remain surprisingly-poorly understood in the rheumatic diseases, owing both to the complex nature of those disorders, and to methodological challenges surrounding the evaluation of social class and of its ties to health. Methodological difficulties in measuring SES can complicate interpretation of results to understand mechanisms of these associations. Current research on associations between SES and pain in rheumatic diseases are summarised in this article. Our review indicates that inequalities in pain in patients with OA and RA with low individual SES are strong and well-established, although associations in other rheumatic conditions and with community or childhood SES are less well-established. Further, the range of proposed mechanisms underlying disparities is broad, encompassing numerous indicators of SES, such as occupation, income, and education and varying widely by disease.

AB  - Dispersing and non-dispersing individuals often differ in phenotypic traits (e.g. physiology, behaviour), but to what extent these differences are fixed or driven by external conditions remains elusive. We experimentally tested whether differences in nest-defence behaviour between dispersing and non-dispersing individuals changed with local habitat quality in collared flycatchers, by providing additional food during the nestling rearing period. In control (non-food-supplemented) nests, dispersers were less prone to defend their brood compared with non-dispersers, whereas in food-supplemented nests, dispersing and non-dispersing individuals showed equally strong nest defence. We discuss the importance of dispersal costs versus adaptive flexibility in reproductive investment in shaping these differences in nest-defence behaviour between dispersing and non-dispersing individuals. Irrespective of the underlying mechanisms, our study emphasizes the importance of accounting for environmental effects when comparing traits between dispersing and non-dispersing individuals, and in turn assessing the costs and benefits of dispersal.

AB  - Sensory, physicochemical, and microbiological changes of channel catfish patties stored under controlled freezing-point storage (CFPS) conditions at -1.5A degrees C for 10 weeks were analyzed to determine useful parameters for freshness evaluation and shelf-life determination. The sensory parameters of aerobic mesophilic and psychrophilic bacterial counts, physicochemical parameters of thiobarbituric acid, total volatile basic nitrogen, chewiness, ATP-ase activity, and the lightness parameter L* were correlated with storage time. Vacuum-packaged patties containing a cryoprotectant, natural antioxidants, and an antimicrobial mixture stored at -1.5A degrees C exhibited an extended shelf-life from a conventional 1-2 weeks to 6 weeks. Parameters that were correlated with storage time can be used as indicators of quality degradation of patties. CFPS combined with vacuum packaging offers an effective approach to extension of catfish product shelflife.

AB  - Passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags can be used to overcome environmental variations caused by individual fish tanks during family selection of the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), which thus permits growth comparisons among different families under identical environmental conditions. Power analysis was used to analyse variations in various growth performance measures during PIT-tag-assisted family construction of channel catfish, and this allowed sample sizes to be estimated. The experimental data suggested that, for a particular fish species, when having a low variation coefficient of fish body weight at the time of PIT marking and maintaining consistent individual sizes, the sample size required during a family growth experiment could be effectively reduced. This present study lays a theoretical foundation for analyzing variations in growth performance indicators and estimating the sample sizes during PIT-tag-assisted family construction of fish experiments.

AB  - The actual knowledge about the freshwater algae of Mexico is very uneven from various points of view, despite its recognized potential as indicators of environmental conditions and to be the basal part of trophic chains in aquatic environments. The largest number of records of algae is in the central area of the country, with five states comprising more than 56% of total number of records. The Bacillariophyta are the group with the highest number of records, both nationally and by number of states. To this inequality, must be added that there is generally a poor level of documentation of species. There are records with the species name only and whose description or illustration has not been possible to locate, even with the recent documentary search resources. The graphical review presented highlights the degree of knowledge we have of the algae by states, taxonomical groups and the most studied environments; the discussion is supported with some analysis of the causes that affect the poor knowledge of freshwater algae in Mexico.

AB  - Urban trees, especially those growing in close proximity to roads, suffer from different kinds of stress. Most of roadside stress factors are impossible to be avoided therefore the selection of tolerant tree species and cultivars is of high importance. In our research we used the activity of photosystem II and chlorophyll relative content to monitor physiological state of 8 species and cultivars growing in urban environments in Warsaw. We compared young trees growing 2-3 m away from the road and others growing minimum 8 meters away. The experiment allowed us to indicate the most tolerant taxa to roadside conditions: Gleditsia triacanthos, Pyrus calleryana 'Chanticleer', Platanus x hispanica 'Acerifolia' and Acer campestre. We found that Quercus rubra is relatively tolerant. Tilia x europaea 'Pallida', Tilia cordata 'Greenspire' and Ginkgo biloba should not be planted in harmful habitats.

AB  - A diesel fuel spill at a concentration of 1 L m(-2) soil was simulated on a 12 m(2) plot of agricultural land, and natural attenuation of aliphatic hydrocarbons was monitored over a period of 400 days following the spill after which the aliphatic hydrocarbon concentrations were found to be below the legal contamination threshold for soil. The main fraction of these compounds (95%) remained at the surface layer (0-10 cm). Shortly after the spill (viz. between days 0 and 18), evaporation was the main origin of the dramatic decrease in pollutant concentrations in the soil. Thereafter, soil microorganisms used aliphatic hydrocarbons as sources of carbon and energy, as confirmed by the degradation ratios found. Soil quality indicators, soil microbial biomass and dehydrogenase activity, regained their original levels about 200 days after the spill. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although there is a growing body of research examining public perceptions of global climate change, little work has focused on the role of place and proximity in shaping these perceptions. This study extends previous conceptual models explaining risk perception associated with global climate change by adding a spatial dimension. Specifically, Geographic Information Systems and spatial analytical techniques are used to map and measure survey respondents' physical risk associated with expected climate change. Using existing spatial data, multiple measures of climate change vulnerability are analyzed along with demographic, attitudinal, and social contextual variables derived from a representative national survey to predict variation in risk perception. Bivariate correlation and multivariate regression analyses are used to identify and explain the most important indicators shaping individual risk perception. Analysis of the data suggests that the relationship between actual and perceived risk is driven by specific types of physical conditions and experiences.

AB  - This work provided additional information for a better interpretation of lichen diversity values in biomonitoring studies of air pollution. The effects of 12 predictive variables were estimated for the Genova province (NW Italy) by means of a non-parametric model. The diversity of epiphytic lichens was strictly correlated with mean annual rainfall and mean annual temperature. Different variables were found to affect the lichen diversity in urban vs. forested areas. In urban areas, air pollutants, mainly SO(2), are still the main limiting factor, even if under ameliorating conditions this relationship becomes less significant. In forested areas, harvesting and forest fires showed a predominant effect, suggesting the need to develop a more defined sampling protocol to estimate atmospheric pollution in such ecosystems.

AB  - Prospects of using different alkaline phosphatases bearing zinc and magnesium ions in their catalytic and allosteric sites, respectively, in pharmaceutical and clinical analysis were demonstrated. Also their application for the determination of zinc in insulin to control injection quality and magnesium in human urine for the diagnosis and treatment of magnesium deficiency was shown. The reaction of P-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis was chosen as an indicator. The choice of appropriate alkaline phosphatase was substantiated, the influence of the nature of buffer solutions on the behavior of the enzyme-metal systems was studied, and the conditions of the indicator reaction proceeding in the presence of sample matrixes were optimized. Simple, rapid, sensitive, and selective enzymatic procedures for determining zinc and magnesium based on their inhibiting and activating effects on the catalytic activity of alkaline phosphatases from seal and chicken intestine, respectively, were developed.

AB  - The use of Mya arenaria as a new sensitive biomonitor of butyltins pollution in the oceanic system was investigated. Field survey indicated that much higher levels of butyltin compounds were found in M. arenaria compared with the other species investigated. Using Mytilus edulis as a control organism, a 28 days exposure of tributyltin chloride (TBT) to M. arenaria for accumulation and subsequent 28 days breeding in clean seawater for elimination were conducted under laboratory conditions in order to confirm its high accumulation ability and characterize its kinetic behavior to TBT. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) of M. arenaria ranged from 15538 to 91800 after 28 days exposure. The rapid uptake and low rate to eliminate TBT of M. arenaria displayed first-order kinetics. M. arenaria shows potential as a new bioindicator to monitor TBT pollution in marine environment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Groundwater sampling and geophysical methods determined a serious contamination problem associated with refilled exploitation sites at the Cal Dimoni area, Llobregat delta, Barcelona, Spain. To characterise this process, hydrogeochemical analyses were performed and showed the following modifications to groundwater chemical composition: increasing pH values, changing redox conditions, significant increases in total organic carbon (TOC) and certain trace elements, and high groundwater conductivity values. Major ion content accumulations were found under the refilled area. In contrast, elements involved in the oxidation-reduction processes, such as iron, manganese and nitrates, clearly diminished. Electromagnetic prospecting methods were also performed and delineated the contamination plume extent. These methods also showed separate sources of contamination, one clearly related to the groundwater-refilled zone leachate interaction, another as a consequence of the manure-accumulation surface site. Geochemical and geophysical methods have shown similar results for locating groundwater contamination sources, and for determining leachate generation mechanisms and flow paths.

AB  - A survey carried out in 1999, in the same way as in 1994, indicated that the composition of oligochaete and chironomid communities changed during this period in response to the decrease of phosphorus concentrations in the water of the western basin (the Little Lake) of Lake Geneva (Switzerland and France). Chironomid larvae were present in 66 % of 159 sites in 1999 against 40 % in 1994 whereas the abundance of oligochaetes decreased. In addition, the relative abundance of taxa indicator of oligotrophic conditions (Micropsectra and Spirosperma velutinus) was greater in 1999. According to these changes, the biological recovery of deep sediment was in 1999 mid-way between the meso-eutrophic state prevailing around 1980 and the oligotrophic state prevailing before 1950. However, the extent of recovery was not the same in the three basins of the Little Lake: it varied according to the intensity of organic deposition.

AB  - Fishes after harvest are contaminated with undesirable microorganisms during the stages of handling and curing. The microbial status of three environmental areas like drying ground, soil and sea-sand was assessed to determine the major microbial contamination points (MMP). Certain physical, chemical and microbial quality parameters of the cured fish from the same sites have also been reported. Occurrence of faecal streptococci in more numbers and from more sites than coliforms suggests that they are better indicators of sanitary conditions, Coagulase positive staphylococci were found to occur from drying grounds, soil and in cured product samples. Eighty percent of the cured product samples harboured this bacterium with a mean count of 1.48 log(10) cfu/g of the sample. The order of occurrence of different bacteria from three MMP was found to be drying ground, soil and sea-sand, except faecal coliforms in sea-sand and coagulase positive staphylococci in soil and sea-sand sources.

AB  - Several indices can predict the long-term fate of emerging infectious diseases and the effect of their containment measures, including a variety of reproduction numbers (e.g. R-0). Other indices evaluate the potential for transient increases of epidemics eventually doomed to disappearance, based on generalized reactivity analysis. They identify conditions for perturbations to a stable disease-free equilibrium (R-0 < 1) to grow, possibly causing significant damage. Here, we introduce the epidemicity index e(0), a threshold-type indicator: if e(0) > 0, initial foci may cause infection peaks even if R-0 < 1. Therefore, effective containment measures should achieve a negative epidemicity index. We use spatially explicit models to rank containment measures for projected evolutions of the ongoing pandemic in Italy. There, we show that, while the effective reproduction number was below one for a sizable timespan, epidemicity remained positive, allowing recurrent infection flare-ups well before the major epidemic rebounding observed in the fall.

AB  - The proteolytic changes under in vitro digestive conditions were examined by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Kjeldahl determination of nitrogen, and fluorescamine analysis to evaluate the level of free amino terminal groups as an indicator of the degree of proteolysis. The protein and fat components of cheese digesta were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Cheese disintegration and subsequent release of proteins and polypeptides was quantified after each of three in vitro digestion phases: oral, gastric (pepsin, pH 2), and intestinal (pancreatic enzymes, pH 6.8). Most of the disintegration of the cheese protein matrix ((similar to)75%), proteolysis, and protein release occurred during the intestinal digestion phase. Fat aggregate release from the cheese matrix mostly occurred in the gastric and intestinal digestion phases, and globules became more spherical after the gastric phase. Proteolysis took place primarily in the gastric and intestinal phases. These results show the importance of microstructure and the digestive environment on the release of cheese components.

AB  - A steady-state Aspen Plus model of municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion has been developed to simulate the influence of operating conditions and hydrodynamic parameters on the concentrations of air pollutants and performance indicators. To simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics, a FORTRAN subroutine was coupled to Aspen Plus software. Model validated against the experimental data is available in the literature and found to be in good agreement. Results showed that the operating pressure has a negligible influence on gas composition and performance indicators, but it plays a major role in the commercialization of thermal conversion of carbon-based fuels due to a significant reduction in the capital costs. It was also concluded that as the U-mf increases from 1.2 to 2.5, the concentrations of pollutants released increase, probably due to a considerable decrease in the rate of reactions involved, especially at the end of combustor.

AB  - We report the record of two members of one of the most destructive insect pests of turfgrasses from the Late Pleistocene of the Pampean region. The presence of Cyclocephala signaticollis and Diloboderus abderus 12,000 years BP enables us to consider them as paleobio-indicators besides studying them as agricultural pests. This work constitutes the very first record of the genus and species, and the first Quaternary record of Dynastinae in South America. Moreover, this is one of the first paleoentomological studies that take in consideration beetles as bioproxies for the Quaternary of Argentina, and allows us to adjust the paleoclimatic inferences made for the region. This finding argues against the classic interpretations that indicate arid environmental conditions in the Pampean region during the first pulses of post-glacial climate recovery.

AB  - Recent advances in genetically encoded fluorescent probes have dramatically increased the toolkit available for imaging the intracellular environment. Perhaps the biggest improvements have been made in sensing specific reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox changes under physiological conditions. The new generation of probes may be targeted to a wide range of subcellular environments. By targeting such probes to compartments and organelle surfaces they may be exposed to environments, which support local signal transduction and regulation. The close apposition of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with mitochondria and other organelles forms such a local environment where Ca2+ dynamics are greatly enhanced compared to the bulk cytosol. We describe here how newly developed genetically encoded redox indicators (GERIs) might be used to monitor ROS and probe their interaction with Ca2+ at both global and local level.

KW  - EMISSIONS
AB  - The rapid rise in shale gas production has affected the role and importance of regulatory policy at all levels of government. As the primary regulator in this area, state level regulatory changes are particularly significant. As shale gas production increases, some states are updating their regulations, while others maintain dated rules, put in place prior to hydraulic fracturing that may or may not address environmental issues specific to modern shale gas development or recent concerns about environmental impacts. Our research finds that state regulation is remarkably heterogeneous. Regulatory heterogeneity includes heterogeneity in the stringency of state regulations. Though heterogeneity in state regulation is not inherently good or bad, our limited data suggests that the heterogeneity is neither explained by differences in state conditions, nor does it necessarily reflect indicators of regulatory capture. The paper also compares the use of regulations to use of liability law, voluntary practices, and information provision. In addition, it identifies new activities being regulated and areas where additional regulation may be needed.

AB  - Measuring the quality of life in municipalities entails two empirical challenges. First, collecting a set of relevant indicators that can be compared across the municipalities. Second, using an appropriate aggregating tool in order to construct a synthetic index. This paper measures the quality of life for the largest 643 Spanish municipalities using Value Efficiency Analysis (VEA). The indicators used cover aspects related to consumption, social services, housing, transport, environment, labour market, health, culture and leisure, education and security. Superefficiency VEA scores are also computed in order to construct a complete ordered ranking of the quality of life. The results show that the Northern and Central regions in Spain attain the highest levels of quality of life, while the Southern regions report low living conditions. It is also noticeable that none of the 10 biggest Spanish cities appear in the TOP50 ranking of quality of life.

AB  - F(l)uctuating asymmetry (FA) represents random, minor deviations from perfect symmetry in paired traits. Because the development of the left and right sides of a paired trait is presumably controlled by an identical set of genetic instructions, these small imperfections are considered to reflect genetic and environmental perturbations experienced during ontogeny. The current paper aims to identify possible neuroendocrine mechanisms, namely the actions of steroid hormones that may impact the development of asymmetrical characters as a response to various stressors. In doing so, it provides a review of the published studies on the influences of glucocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens on FA and concomitant changes in other health and fitness indicators. It follows the premise that hormonal measures may provide direct, non-invasive indicators of how individuals cope with adverse life conditions, strengthening the associations between FA and health, fitness, and behavior.

AB  - Participatory approaches in environmental knowledge production are commonly propagated for their potential to enhance legitimacy and quality of decision-making processes, especially under conditions of uncertainty. This paper describes the development of the Stakeholder Participation Guidance for the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency as an attempt to put the rather theoretical ambitions of the participation literature into practice. The study includes an analysis of theories of new production of knowledge' and of the agency's position as an intermediary organization between science and policy, together with its participatory activities, to date. The Guidance is meant to suit different contexts, products and modes of assessments by the agency. Therefore, it cannot be a like a recipe book, but is intended to support and guide project leaders in their choices around stakeholder participation. The paper emphasizes the context dependency of participatory knowledge production and stresses the importance of reflection and transparency regarding the role of scientific advisors in the science-policy process.

AB  - Photoperiod controls many developmental responses in animals, plants and even fungi. The response to photoperiod has evolved because daylength is a reliable indicator of the time of year, enabling developmental events to be scheduled to coincide with particular environmental conditions. Much progress has been made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the response to photoperiod in plants. These mechanisms include the detection of the light signal in the leaves, the entrainment of circadian rhythms, and the production of a mobile signal which is transmitted throughout the plant. Flowering, tuberization and bud set are just a few of the many different responses in plants that are under photoperiodic control. Comparison of what is known of the molecular mechanisms controlling these responses shows that, whilst common components exist, significant differences in the regulatory mechanisms have evolved between these responses.

AB  - Turbulence data have been sampled on the Nansen Ice Sheet, a coastal area of Antarctica, in order to study how and at which scales topographic inhomogeneities and gravity waves propagation affect the turbulence structure of a stably stratified boundary layer. Spectral analysis of wind velocity components evidences an energy excess in the horizontal components due to a shift of the turbulence spectral maximum towards a lower frequency. The shift is proportional to the characteristic vertical length scale of topography. A sharp secondary energy maximum in the low-frequency subrange has been frequently evidenced by spectral analysis. It is prevalently observed in strongly stable stratification and the energy is often supplied by the gravity waves propagation, resulting from the univocal response of cospectral wave activity indicators. In weakly stable conditions, the secondary energy maximum is prevalently less pronounced and broadened over a larger frequency range. The cospectral wave indicators do not give a univocal response on the nature of the fluctuations, resulting from the non-linear interaction between waves and turbulence.

AB  - The atmosphere constitutes an important sink for many volatile and semivolatile organic compounds (Part II). Even non-volatile compounds may enter the troposphere due to incomplete burning of fuel and industrial, agricultural and traffic-related processes. Depending on vapour pressure, temperature and content of aerosol particles, chemicals prefer the free gas phase, the surface of the particles, or both compartments. Polar compounds (low Henry-coefficient) may dissolve in cloud-and fog droplets. Clearly, the prefered compartment influences the dominant abiotic degradation path; In this paper, a survey is given about the distribution and degradation pathways of chemicals in the troposphere. In the free gas phase of the troposphere, the reaction with OH-radicals is the dominant degradation path. In addition, the reactions with ozone and nitrate-radicals, and direct photochemical reactions also play a role in abiotic degradation. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The masses of some large Pleistocene species of the fossil family Glyptodontidae (Mammalia; Xenarthra) were estimated from the volumes of models. Their centres of mass were also estimated. Dimensions of limb bones and limb muscles were used to assess the athleticism of these species, using an approach previously applied to dinosaurs. The femora show higher athletic indicators (even when supporting the whole weight of the animal) than humeri in the quadrupedal stance. II is therefore proposed that performing strenuous locomotor activities bipedally was not only possible but even advantageous for minimizing risk of bone failure. The muscular dimensions analysed are consistent with this conclusion. The possible biological meaning of these mechanical results is considered. Since the smaller and older (early Miocene) glyptodont Propalaehoplophorus does not share this condition, it is suggested that it was developed later in the history of the group, perhaps as a feature related to the acquisition of large size.

AB  - Naturally present gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGTP) in whole and skim milk was inactivated by heat treatment at > 79 degrees C for 16 s. Of the total activity in whole milk, 72% was found in the skim milk fraction. Little seasonal variation was noted in either whole or skim raw milk over a period of 300 days. Using a commercially available test kit for GGTP, as little as 0.1% raw milk or cream could be detected in pasteurized skim milk and butter. An alternative GGTP method examined was less sensitive than the commercial method. However, it was necessary for cream products with low GGTP activity since cream interfered with the commercial assay. No reactivation of GGTP was found in whole milk or butter under a variety of conditions. Commercial milk and cream samples were negative for GGTP activity. The results suggest that GGTP analysis could be useful for monitoring the heat-treatment given to fluid milk products.

AB  - Research Highlights:This research presents a novel approach for comparing structural carbon allocation to tree growth and to climate in a dendrochronological analysis. Increasing temperatures reduced the carbon proportion of wood in some cases.Background and Objectives: Our goal was to estimate the structural carbon content of wood within hybrid white spruce (Picea glauca(Moench) xengelmannii(Parry) grown in British Columbia, Canada, and compare the percent carbon content to wood properties and climate conditions of the region. Specific objectives included: (i) the determination of average incremental percent carbon, ring widths (RW), earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW) widths, cell wall thickness, and density over time; (ii) the determination of differences between percent carbon in individual forest stands and between regions; and (iii) the evaluation of the relationships between percent carbon and climate variation over time.Methods:Trees were sampled from twelve sites in northern British Columbia. Wood cores were analyzed with standard dendrochronology techniques and SilviScan analysis. Percent structural carbon was determined using acetone extraction and elemental analysis for 5 year increments. Individual chronologies of wood properties and percent carbon, and chronologies grouped by region were compared by difference of means. Temperature and precipitation values from the regions were compared to the carbon chronologies using correlation, regression, and visual interpretation.Results:Significant differences were found between the percent structural carbon of wood in individual natural and planted stands; none in regional aggregates. Some significant relationships were found between percent carbon, RW, EW, LW, and the cell wall thickness and density values. Percent carbon accumulation in planted stands and natural stands was found in some cases to correlate with increasing temperatures. Natural stand percent carbon values truncated to the last 30 years of growth was shown as more sensitive to climate variation compared to the entire time series.Conclusions: Differences between the stands in terms of structural carbon proportion vary by site-specific climate characteristics in areas of central interior British Columbia. Wood properties can be good indicators of variation in sequestered carbon in some stands. Carbon accumulation was reduced with increasing temperatures; however, warmer late-season conditions appear to enhance growth and carbon accumulation.

AB  - The relevance of the research consists in determining the age of mollusks in the Green fjord bay of West Spitsbergen Island and physical and chemical parameters of their habitant environment in conditions of the threat of destruction of geological outcrops as a result of actively developing processes of coastal thermo-abrasion and man-made load of "Arcticugol" combine.
   The main aim of the research is to reconstruct physical and chemical parameters of mollusks habitant environment in Holocene based on determination of mollusks species and research of isotope-geochemical composition of shells and their host rocks.
   Methods. Mollusk species were identified using morphological method and decomposition of shell samples - by acid dissection. Content of microelements and microelements was determined on Aurora Elite inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) and on LabCenter XRF-1800 wavelength X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and stable isotope ratios - on Finningan MAT253 mass spectrometer. Age of mollusk shells was identified on liquid low-background scintillation counter.
   Objects of the research are quaternary sediments of the coastal cliff of Finniset cape (Green fjord bay, West Spitsbergen Island), shells of bivalve mollusks and their fragments.
   Results. The authors have identified the detected macrofauna complexes represented by bivalve mollusks (Hiatella erotica, Mytilus edulis, Tridonta borealis, Mya truncata) and the age of fossil shells of marine mollusks for Finniset cape, which are from 7970 to 8050 years old. It was established that the mollusks found in lower layers lived in a wormer climate than those found in the overlying layers. The authors reconstructed redox conditions using Ni/Co ratios ranging from 1,5 to 9 units and V/Cr less than 2 units. Content of the U was detected in range from 0,2 mg to 4 mg. An analysis of the Cu/Cr ratio in the outcrop shows that the distance from the area of denudation to the sedimentation area changed insignificantly. Zn concentration in sediments indicates the temporal regression of the sea and predominance of continental sedimentary regime over sea regime. Determination of Mn content in mollusk shells shown, that they lived in coastal-marine zone with high oxygen content.

AB  - The system of foresight methods is most often used to solve research problems that are distinguished from the continuity of historical chronology. The aim of our study is to search for new approaches to measuring, assessing and forecasting the economic and financial potential of the agricultural sector, in order to develop an adequate public administration strategy. We have set the task to answer what effect this trend will have for the agricultural sector and the economy of Ukraine in the coming years. We used normative-system analysis - an approach that allows to identify measures that stimulate or limit the implementation of a particular scenario for a particular research subject. This method is aimed at formulating policies and foresight strategies, which are implemented by calculating the financial potential of the agricultural industry. The basis of the research was the hypothesis that the financial potential of the macro level should be analyzed according to the current foresight strategy method, which involves (i) identifying the object of forecasting (agrarian sector), (ii) determining the essential conditions (targets that the financial potential for sustainable development should correspond to), (iii) scanning the environment (what resources and types ofpotential are related to financial), and (v) identifying alternatives and possible future scenarios (building a balance sheet of financial resources). The results of the statistical analysis suggested that the main determinants of the financial potential are: the volumes, structure, and proportions of reproduction. Furthermore, the efficiency and strength of financial potential are compared with the main macroeconomic indicators of rural development. The results revealed that the necessity of state regulation of financial flows connected with the agrarian sector is substantiated by monitoring the process offorming financial flows in a number of key parameters with the aim of observing the equivalence of all management forms to financial resources. This research contributes to the previous literature on Ukraine context, where we proposed ways to improve the quality offinancial potential, the conditions for its formation and distribution and redistribution in accordance with the National Concept for the Development of the Agrarian Sector (2015). Additionally, this research will pave the way for the adaptation of foreign experience, including international comparisons offinancial flows and state support.

AB  - The 2.7-3.0 Ga North Caribou greenstone belt (NCGB), host to the Musselwhite BIF-hosted gold deposit, possesses abundant shear zones on its northern margins, which appear to have formed under amphibolite facies conditions. Protracted deformation and regional metamorphism are coeval with widespread magmatism and accretion events during crustal amalgamation of the Western Superior Province, and are responsible for folding the ore-hosting BIF and channeling fluids. The importance of shear zones in behaving as conduits for fluids during the tectonic evolution of the NCGB is not well known and their relationship with metamorphism is equivocal, yet higher-grade, syn-to post-tectonic metamorphic minerals seem to correlate with loci of higher strain. Structural analyses support oblique transpressive collision that produced steeply-dipping planar and shallowly-plunging linear fabrics with dominant dextral kinematics, that trend broadly parallel to the doubly arcuate shape of the belt. Electron backscatter diffraction analyses were conducted on strategic samples across one shear zone in order to characterize crustal conditions during transpressive deformation. The Dinnick Lake shear zone cuts through mafic metavolcanics and at its core is an L-tectonite granite composed of recrystallized quartz. Whole rock geochemistry shows little variation in Ca, Na, Mg and K (often used as indicators of hydrothermal alteration) from surrounding less deformed units, suggesting deformation in a dry environment. Microstructural analysis indicates subgrain rotation recrystallization and deformation by prism a- and c-slip in quartz, as well as aligned hornblende that suggest deformation temperatures above 500 degrees C. Quartz in mafic rocks along the margins of the shear zone also exhibits a basal a-slip component, indicating a slight decrease in strain or temperature. Although the NCGB exhibits some first-order evidence of vertical tectonism (dome and keel geometries), the dominant strain record within shear zones is that of horizontal (oblique transpressive) displacement. This is in agreement with other greenstone belts in the Western Superior Province where vertical tectonism and horizontal tectonism were coeval. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past two decades, our understanding of the endocannabinoid system has greatly improved due to the wealth of results obtained from exploratory studies. Currently, two cannabinoid receptor subtypes have been well characterized The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CBI) is widely expressed in the central nervous system, while the levels of the cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) in the brain and spinal cord of healthy individuals are relatively low. However, recent studies demonstrated a CB2 upregulation on activated microglia upon neuroinflammation, an indicator of neurodegeneration. Our research group aims to develop a suitable positron emission tomography (PET) tracer to visualize the CB2 receptor in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases. Herein we report two novel thiophene-based C-11-labeled PET ligands designated [C-11]AAT-015 and [C-11]AAT-778. The reference compounds were synthesized using Gewald reaction conditions to obtain the aminothiophene intermediates, followed by amide formation. Saponification of the esters provided their corresponding precursors. Binding affinity studies revealed K-I-values of 3.3 +/- 0.5 nM (CB2) and 1.0 +/- 0.2 (CB1) for AAT-015. MT 778 showed similar KI-values of 4.3 0.7 nM (CB2) and 1.1 +/- 0.1 mu M (C131). Radiosynthesis was carried out under basic conditions using [11Cliodomethane as methylating agent. After semi-preparative HPLC purification both radiolabeled compounds were obtained in 99% radiochemical purity and the radiochemical yields ranged from 12 to 37%. Specific activity was between 96 and 449 GBq/mu mol for both tracers. In order to demonstrate CB2 specificity of [11CJAAT-015 and [11C]AAT-778, we carried out autoradiography studies using CB2-positive mouse/rat spleen tissues. The obtained results revealed unspecific binding in spleen tissue that was not blocked by an excess of CB2-specific ligand GW402833. For in vivo analysis, [C-11]AAT-015 was administered to healthy rats via tail-vein injection. Evaluation of the CB2-positive spleen, however, showed no accumulation of the radiotracer. Despite the promising in vitro binding affinities, specific binding of [C-11]/W-015, and [C-11]AAT-778 could not be demonstrated.

AB  - Background: In this Research, oyster shell supported zero valent iron nanoparticles were prepared and applied for the removal of natural organic matters (NOMs) from aqueous solutions under different experimental conditions.
   Methods: The nanoadsorbents prepared by wet impregnation method, then characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, X-Ray Fluorescence and BET analysis. Adsorption test was done in a batch reactor and the effects of different parameters such as initial adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dose, adsorption kinetic, pH, and temperature on removal of NOMs (humic acid as the indicator) were studied.
   Results: Results showed that particle size of nanoadsorbent was in the range of 60-83 nm, and surface area and micropore volume as 16.85 m(2)/g and 0.021 m(3)/g, respectively; the main elements of adsorbent were Ca, O, Fe and Na and lime, as high as about 94.25% was the main structural component of the total weight. Produced nanoadsorbent was not soluble in water. It was also shown that by increasing the nanoadsorbent dose from 0.5 to 5 g/100 ml, the removal of humic acid increased from 62.3% to 97.4%. An inverse relationship was found between initial concentration and adsorption capacity, so that a decreasing rate of 33% for humic acid removal was observed by increasing pH from 5 to 10. Temperature increase from 25 degrees C to 40 degrees C, resulted in an increase in humic acid removal from 76.8% to 91.4% and its adsorption on the adsorbent could be better described by Freundlich isotherm (n = 0.016, K-f = 0.013 and R-2 = 0.74). The most fitted adsorption kinetic model was pseudo-second order model.
   Conclusions: The chemical structure of nanoadsorbent was proper and free from harmful substances. Despite the relative good condition of the effective surface, due to the large size of the shell, the overall micropore volume was low. Hence the qualitative characteristics the adsorbent caused the absorption capacity of humic acid to be low (0.96 mg/g).

AB  - The objective of the present work was to assess the potential of brackish water finfish to improve bottom soil conditions and thereby increase the growth and production of Penaeus monodon (tiger prawns). Experimental tanks with a bottom area of 6 m(2) were stocked with shrimp (6 shrimp/m(2)) and finfish (3 fish/m(2)), and fed a commercial diet. Five triplicate treatments (four experimental and one control) were executed. The four finfish selected for the experiment were: Etroplus suratensis (pearlspot), Mugil cephalus (mullet), Chanos chanos (milk fish) and Oreochromis mossambicus (tilapia).
   Bottom soil properties indicative of mixing and redox conditions were evaluated. Bottom soil cores were taken from the experimental tanks and sectioned to 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-7 cm layers. Organic carbon (OC), easily oxidized matter (EOM), exchangeable ammonium (NH4-N), total dissolved sulfides, soluble manganese and soluble iron were determined as the indicators of anaerobic metabolites. Fluorescent stained sand particles (luminophores) were added to the bottom soil as bioturbation tracers. Tracer analysis results indicated that particles were displaced down to 7 cm depth in tanks with tilapia. In Etroplus and shrimp combination tanks, particles were displaced to depths of 3 cm, suggesting that the stirring activity of tilapia and Etroplus was effective down to 7 cm and 3 cm, respectively. Evaluation of chemical parameters revealed a significant decrease in the concentrations of anaerobic metabolite indicators for all fish co-stocking, but particularly in Etroplus and shrimp combination tanks. In addition, co-stocking, especially with Etroplus, led to more intensive degradation of the organic matter and significant lowering of the EOM fraction. Assessment of growth parameters also revealed higher growth rate (P<0.05) and survival (97 +/- 4) in the Etroplus shrimp combination treatment. These results confirmed the effect of finfish on bottom soil bioturbation, especially with Etroplus co-stocking. Two types of bioturbation were identified: 1) site specific digging and soil displacement in the case of tilapia, and 2) continuous stirring, re-suspension and resulting oxidation in the case of Etroplus. Technologies for the evaluation of the effects of finfish bioturbation are proposed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Aral Sea Basin is a critical area for studying the influence of climate and anthropogenic impact on the development of hydrographic conditions in an endorheic basin. We present organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst analyses with a sampling resolution of 15 to 20 years from a core retrieved at Chemyshov Bay in the NW Large Aral Sea (Kazakhstan). Cysts are present throughout, but species richness is low (seven taxa). The dominant morphotypes are Lingulodinium machaerophorum with varied process length and Impagidinium caspienense, a species recently described from the Caspian Sea. Subordinate species are Caspidinium rugosum, Romanodinium areolatum, Spiniferites cruciformis, cysts of Pentapharsodinium dalei, and round brownish protoperidiniacean cysts. The chlorococcalean algae Botryococcus and Pediastrum are taken to represent freshwater inflow into the Aral Sea.
   The data are used to reconstruct salinity as expressed in lake level changes during the past 2000 years. We quantify and date for the first time prominent salinity variations from the northern part of the Large Aral Sea. During high lake levels, I caspienense, representing brackish conditions with salinities of about 10-15 g kg(-1) or less, prevails. Assemblages dominated by L. machaerophorum document lake lowstands during approximately 0-425 AD (or 100? BC-425 AD), 920-1230 AD, 1500 AD, 1600-1650 AD, 1800 AD and since the 1960s. Because salinity in the Aral Sea is mostly controlled by meltwater discharges from the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers, we interpret changes in salinity levels as a proxy for temperature fluctuations in the Tien Shan Mountains that control snow melt. Significant erosion of marine Palaeogene and Neogene deposits in the hinterland, evidenced between 1230 AD and 1400 AD, is regarded as sheet-wash from shore. This is controlled by the low pressure system that develops over the Eastern Mediterranean and brings moist air to the Middle East and Central Asia during late spring and summer. We propose that the recorded environmental changes are related primarily to climate, but perhaps to a lesser extent by humancontrolled irrigation activities. Our results documenting climate change in western Central Asia are fairly consistent with reports elsewhere from Central Asia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the tropics, onion (Allium cepa L.) bulbs are usually stored in shelters under ambient conditions resulting in severe storage losses. This study was aimed at determining whether variation in bull) storability exists among short-day onion cultivars and whether the trait can be improved through conventional breeding. Twelve onion cultivars with different degrees of storability were selected from preliminary experiments. Bulbs of selected cultivars were grown and stored for 3 months under ambient conditions. Observations were made on disease incidence at harvest, percentage diseased bulbs, and storage disease incidence of bacterial soft rot [BR (Pseudomonas gladioli pv. alliicola Burkholder)], black mold [BM (Aspergillus niger Tiegh.)], and fusarium basal rot (Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.:Fr. f. sp. cepae) after 3 months of storage. Data on bulb characteristics such as bulb fresh weight (FW), dry matter (DM) content, total soluble solids (TSS), and pyruvic acid content were recorded at harvest. Mean storage losses of cultivars ranged from 21% to 99% over 3 years. Diseases were the major causes of storage losses, with BR and BM being the most predominant. Performance of most traits (including storage losses) was significantly influenced by year (Y), cultivar (G), and Y x G interaction. Heavy rainfall during bulb development in 1997 may have contributed to higher disease incidence at harvest, higher percentage of diseased bulbs during storage, and lower DM, and TSS of the cultivars. Cultivars with good storability, such as 'Red Pinoy' and 'Serrana', were less sensitive to stressful environments and high disease pressure. Incidence of storage diseases was significantly correlated with DM (r = -0.65 to -0.84) and TSS (r = -0.66 to -0.87), as well as incidence of BR (r = 0.57 to 0.94) in each year. Thus, they could be good indicators for evaluating storability. Cultivars with good storability tended to have small bulbs, as average bulb FW was positively correlated with incidence of storage diseases. Disease incidences on 'Red Pinoy' and 'Serrana', both in the field and in storage, were significantly lower than in the other cultivars, indicating they are tolerant to major storage diseases and that they could be used as donor parents for genetic improvement of onion storability.

AB  - The petrological and mineralogical characteristics of the unusual CM2 chondrite, Bells, have been investigated in detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron microprobe analysis (EPMA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Bells is a highly brecciated chondrite which contains few intact chondrules, a very low abundance of refractory inclusions, and is notable in having an unusually high abundance of magnetite, which is disseminated throughout the fine-grained matrix. Fragmental olivines and pyroxenes are common and, based on compositional data, appear to have been derived from chondrules as a result of extensive brecciation. The fine-grained mineralogy of matrix in Bells differs considerably from other CM chondrites and has closer affinities to matrix in CI chondrites. The dominant phases are fine-grained saponite interlayered with serpentine, and phases such as tochilinite and cronstedtite, which are typical of CM chondrite matrices, are entirely absent. Pentlandite, pyrrhotite, magnetite, anhydrite, calcite, and rare Ti-oxides also occur as accessory phases.
   Based on its oxygen and noble gas isotopic compositions (Zadnik, 1985; Rowe et al., 1994), Bells can be considered to be a CM2 chondrite, although its bulk composition shows some departures from the typical range exhibited by this group. However, these variations in bulk chemistry are entirely consistent with the observed mineralogy of Bells. The unusual fine-grained mineralogy of Bells matrix can be reasonably attributed to the combined effects of aqueous alteration and advanced brecciation in a parent body environment. Extensive brecciation has assisted aqueous alteration by reducing chondrules and mineral grains into progressively smaller grains with high surface areas, which are more susceptible to dissolution reactions involving aqueous fluids. This has resulted in the preferential dissolution of Fe-rich chondrule olivines, which are now completely absent in Bells although present in other CM chondrites. The formation of saponite in Bells probably resulted from the dissolution of relatively silica-rich phases, such as pyroxene and olivine, that were derived from chondrules. The result of such dissolution reactions would be to increase the activity of silica in the fluid phase, at least on a localized scale, stabilizing saponite in preference to serpentine. An increase in aSiO(2) would also have destabilized preexisting cronstedtite which may have reacted to form magnetite and Mg-Fe serpentine under conditions of constant fO(2).

AB  - Biogenic amines (BAs) represent a considerable toxicological risk in some food and feed products. They are formed under unhygienic conditions during storage and processing; therefore, an increase in the concentrations of those metabolites is related to putrefaction. Because BAs are thermostable, they remain in food and feed that have undergone heat treatment. There are several toxicological effects, especially caused by histamine, when high concentrations of BAs are ingested by humans, depending on the food itself and also on individual susceptibility and individual health status. The present paper reviews the main BAs in meat products, their use as spoilage indicators, the risk on human health and also the contamination of by-product meals. Furthermore, we highlight the state of art regarding impact of BAs on poultry, meat and eggs.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss gender disparities in children's wellbeing using the Integrated Fuzzy and Relative (IFR) methodology adapted to the framework of the Capability Approach. The aim is to obtain insights into the multidimensional nature of children's wellbeing by considering seven children's capabilities. The study is conducted using cross-sectional data from the 2009 European Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) referring to four Southern European countries: Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain. The role of gender in children's wellbeing is investigated by using two different perspectives at the household level: the gender of single parents and the gender of the children. The results indicate that there is a gender effect from both the investigated perspectives. Thus, our findings suggest that dimension-specific and gendered policies are needed to improve children's wellbeing.

AB  - Tiger beetles typically have specific habitat requirements and because of this, and their ease of identification, can serve as useful indicators of ecosystem condition. However, in northern Ontario, Canada, especially the Far North, distribution information for tiger beetles is generally historic or lacking. We conducted tiger beetle inventories across northern Ontario, including the remote Far North, in an attempt to provide updated distribution information on species known from or adjacent to Ontario. Here, we report several new range extensions for tiger beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Cicindelinae) in Ontario, including Cicindela tranquebarica Herbst, Cicindela longilabris Say, Cicindela duodecimguttata Dejean, and Cicindela repanda Dejean. We also confirm and provide updates for the distribution of several additional species collected in previous studies. Several other previously reported species were not located in this study. Our efforts provide a contemporary update on the ranges and distribution of these beetles.

AB  - Diagnostic methods used in the contemporary medical practice consist of a combination of distressing invasive (bronchial biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage) and semiinvasive (induced sputum technique) methods. Monitoring of specific molecules produced during pathological processes in biological matrices is a relatively new technique which represents an alternative, entirely non-invasive and comfortable method. The principle is based on the quantification of specific substances - "biomarkers", which are considered to be objectively measurable indicators of a physiological/pathological condition of the organism. In contrast with non-specific matrices such as blood plasma (reflecting the state of the whole organism), the exhaled breath condensate is a specific matrix. Concentration levels of biomarkers in the latter matrix point at pathological processes only in the airways and lungs. Typical molecules to be monitored include hydrogen peroxide, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, lipoxins and prostanoids.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermoregulatory response of dairy buffaloes in pre-milking and post-milking. To identify animal thermoregulatory capacity, skin surface temperatures were taken by an infrared thermometer (SST), a thermographic camera (MTBP) as well as respiratory rate records (RR). Black Globe and Humidity Index (BGHI), radiating thermal load (RTL) and enthalpy (H) were used to characterize the thermal environment. Artificial Neural Networks analyzed those indices as well as animal physiological data, using a single layer trained with the least mean square (LMS) algorithm. The results indicated that pre-milking and post-milking environments reached BGHI, RR, SST and MTBP values above thermal neutrality zone for buffaloes. In addition, limits of surface skin temperatures were mostly influenced by changing ambient conditions to the detriment of respiratory rates. It follows that buffaloes are sensitive to environmental changes and their skin temperatures are the best indicators of thermal comfort in relation to respiratory rate.

AB  - The insurance market belongs to the dynamically developing branches of the national economy even in the period of the debt crises. Vast damages, which arise as a consequence of natural catastrophes, object risks or as a result of subject risks are stimuli for the growing interest of all economic subjects operating not only in insurance market but also in the national economy. The insurance industry performs its basic functions accumulation, redistribution, stimulation and control functions in complex economic conditions. The significance of the control function increases in direct proportion to a complicated economic-social situation since the level of insurance fraud also occurs in that period. This paper addresses the development of the insurance market in the Slovak Republic, Poland and Ukraine. We focused our attention on selected important indicators, namely: concentration index, written premium, penetration, insurance density, technical reserves and investment activity of commercial insurance companies.

AB  - One of the important aspects of species' survival is connected with global climate changes, which also conditions the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Poikilotherms are exposed, as other species, to climatic influence, especially due to their physiological peculiarities such as important stages of their life cycle: hibernation, shedding, and active phase. The immune system serves as an accurate indicator of the health status and stress levels in these species. This study aimed to monitor the changes of innate (leukocyte subpopulations and total immune globulins) and adaptive immunity (in vitro leukocyte blast transformation) of two viper species, V. berus berus and V. ammodytes ammodytes, endemic in Europe and spread in different regions of Romania during their three major life cycles, hibernation, shedding, and active phase. The results indicated that seasonal variance and cycle rather than species and regional distribution influence the functionality of the immune system.

AB  - Soil structure exerts important influences on edaphic conditions and the environment. It constitutes a fundamental soil property correlated to many other soil properties. In this study, generalised dimensions of soil structure are computed from data obtained by 2D image analysis of soil samples irrigated with wastewater for 30 and 50 years. The samples analysed show suitable scaling properties. The generalised dimensions Dq appear defined with R-2 greater than 0.89 in the range of moment order (q) between -10 and +10. The variation of Dq with respect to q and the shape of the multifractal generalised spectrum reveal that soil structure has properties close to multifractal self-similar measures. These results show that multifractal analysis is an appropriate toot for characterising soil structure and thus may be used as an indicator of soil structure as well as for deriving important soil physical properties.

This methodology was established according to the geotectonic features of the seismic-active Vrancea zone and Provita de Sus landslide area. Subsequently, a specific approach regarding the electromagnetic precursory parameters, selected according to the temporal invariability criterion for a 2D geoelectric structure in non-seismic condition, taking into consideration their daily mean distribution versus intermediate depth seismic events recorded simultaneously, was elaborated. A similar electromagnetic technique conveying to additional parameters and models concerning the evolution in time of the landslide phenomena was also imposed, so that a disaster forecasting become possible.

AB  - Uranium mining and processing at Lagoa Real (Bahia, Brazil) started in 2000. Hydrogeochemical monitoring carried out from 1999 to 2001 revealed generally good quality of the water resources outside and inside the mineralized area. No chemical contamination in waters for domestic uses was observed. Hydrochemical characteristics did not vary significantly after 1 year of U exploitation, as compared to premining conditions. Due to the short time of mining, the results cannot exclude future variations in water quality. Leaching experiments helped to describe processes of ore and waste degradation, Sulfate was identified as an indicator for different types of contamination. Potential hazards related to local climate (hot rainy season) were identified. They indicate that tailings derived from the ore processing, destabilized by sulfuric acid attack, may induce acidification and salinization in the surrounding environment. Another potential source of environmental impact could be linked to local radium-rich mineralization, originating radon emission.

AB  - There are more than 20,000 uncontrolled sanitary landfill areas in Brazil. The paper reports an integrated study undertaken to develop an environmental assessment of the uncontrolled sanitary landfill area of the city of Pocos de Caldas, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A number of remedial alternatives were evaluated. The USGS modular 3D finite difference groundwater flow model (Modflow) and Modular 3D Finite Difference Mass Transport Model (MT3D) software were used to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport modelling, as well as to predict changes due to the proposed remediation measures. The remedial alternatives considered for normal conditions from 20 to 40 year periods were waste removal, vertical cut-off barriers, extraction wells and top capping. The results indicated that extraction wells and waste removal are the best alternatives because they significantly reduce both the extension and levels of the contamination plume even after 5 years. The extraction well proved a less expensive remedial alternative than waste removal.

AB  - Pine latewood width, density, and stable carbon isotope ratios were measured at two sites, separated in altitude by 400 m, close to the forest limit on a south-facing slope in the western French Alps. The signal to noise ratio in the delta(13)C series from each site is higher than that of either of the growth proxies. When the sites are combined, the high-frequency climate signal in the delta(13)C series is enhanced, whereas in both the ring width and density series it is weakened. Because regional climate dominates over local site condition S, delta(13)C ratios from long pine chronologies will provide a better indicator of past climate than either ring widths or densities. At dry Alpine sites, delta(13)C values are controlled mainly by stomatal conductance, which is linked to summer moisture stress and thus antecedent precipitation.

AB  - We examined the relationship between breeding success and juvenile sex ratio in two gamebirds with differing degrees of sexual size dimorphism. We used breeding success as an indicator of the level of environmental stress the birds had experienced. Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus and Black Grouse T. tetrix wing samples were collected from hunters in northern Sweden during 1977-86. In both species, annual juvenile sex ratio (percentage of mates) increased with annual breeding success, i.e. with reduced environmental stress. We attribute this to the higher energy requirements during growth, vulnerability to environmental stress, and mortality of juvenile males compared with females, especially under adverse conditions. Moreover, the relationship between breeding success and juvenile sex ratio was stronger in Capercaillie than in Black Grouse. This reflects the higher degree of sexual size dimorphism in Capercaillie, and consequent larger mortality difference between juvenile males and females.

AB  - Historically, the phytoplankton community of Lake Kinneret, Israel, has been dominated by the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense and other edible species that are important in the lake's food web. However, major changes have occurred both in external nutrient loading and in the water column chemistry of the lake since the mid-1980's. Epilimnetic particulate nitrogen: particulate phosphorous (PN:PP) ratios have declined, and measurements of seston chemistry suggest that the intensity of seasonal nitrogen limitation has increased. The phytoplankton community also was altered in 1994 and 1995 by a lake-wide summer invasion of the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum. This abrupt change in phytoplankton community structure is consistent with the development of conditions increasingly N-deficiency and P-sufficiency in the water column, which should favor cyanobacterial dominance.

AB  - Cathodoluminescence (CL) examination of Recent biogenic carbonates shows that they are often luminescent regardless of their mineralogical composition (calcite v. aragonite), habitat (marine v. fresh water), way of life (sessile v. vagile) or environment (hyper- v. hyposaline water).  Thus, the presence of luminescence in biogenic particles is not a reliable indicator of diagenetic alteration as some authors have suggested.  In addition, CL can reveal variations in the mineralogy of shell material (e.g. regenerated calcitic v. primary aragonitic) and can highlight growth-related structures.  Manganese (Mn2+) is the most likely activator of this luminescence, and its content in the shells of benthic organisms seems to be linked to growth rate, ontogeny, open sea conditions, bathymetry and salinity.  In neritic environments the Mn2+ content and the CL of molluscs and foraminifera appear to increase with decreasing salinity.  This study indicates that CL may be an important tool for the determination of environmental and ontogenetic parameters in biogenic carbonates in addition to its current use in diagenetic studies.

AB  - The authors used Mindlin's equation, and calculated the natural mode of a circular plate with a solid shaft under the boundary condition of a fixed inner diameter.  As the result, the calculated natural frequency of the low mode of the thick circular plate differed greatly from the one measured by modal analysis.  The causes were analyzed on the (1,0) mode of vibration, which had the biggest error, of 78 percent.  It was revealed that the elastic deformation on the boundary between the circular plate and the solld shaft, and the bending deformation of the shaft had a strong influence on the natural frequency.  By taking both influences into account, the natural frequency of the (1,0) mode was corrected to within a 5 percent error.

AB  - The Southern Ocean is experiencing rapid and profound changes in its physical and biogeochemical properties that may influence the distribution and composition of pelagic plankton communities. Coccolithophores are the most prolific carbonate-producing phytoplankton group, playing an important role in Southern Ocean biogeochemical cycles. However, knowledge is scarce about the record of (sub-)fossil coccolith assemblages in the Southern Ocean, which constitute invaluable indicators for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. This study investigates coccolith assemblages preserved in surface sediments of southernmost Chile and across the Drake Passage that were retrieved during R/V Polarstern expedition PS97. We focused on the coccolith response to steep environmental gradients across the frontal system of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and to hydrodynamic and post-depositional processes occurring in this region. We used statistical analyses to explore which environmental parameters influenced the coccolith assemblages by means of cluster and redundancy analyses. We specifically assessed the morphological diversity of the dominant taxa, i.e. Emiliania huxleyi, emphasizing biogeographical variability of morphotypes, coccolith sizes and calcite carbonate mass estimations. High coccolith abundances and species diversity compared to studies in the same area and in other sectors of the Southern Ocean occur, with a high species richness especially south of the Polar Front. While the surface sediments offshore Chile and north of the Polar Front provide suitable material to reconstruct overlying surface ocean conditions, further factors such as temporary thriving coccolithophore communities in the surface waters or transport of settling coccoliths via surface and bottom currents and eddies influence the (sub-)fossil coccolith assemblages south of the Polar Front. Additionally, deeper samples in the southern part of the study area are particularly affected by selective carbonate dissolution. We identified five E. huxleyi morphotypes (A, A overcalcified, R, B/C and O) and estimated coccolith carbonate masses on the basis of scanning electron microscope images. E. huxleyi morphologies reflect diverging biogeographical distributions, trending towards smaller and lighter coccoliths to the south and emphasizing the importance of documenting those morphologies in relation to changing environmental conditions to assess their response to projected environmental change in the Southern Ocean.

AB  - Severe convective windstorms and tornadoes regularly hit the territory of Russia causing substantial damage and fatalities. An analysis of the climatology and formation environments of these events is essential for risk assessments, forecast improvements and identifying of links with the observed climate change. In this paper, we present an analysis of severe convective windstorms, i.e., squalls and tornadoes reported between 1984 and 2020 in the Perm region (northeast of European Russia), where a local maximum in the frequency of such events was previously found. The analysed database consists of 165 events and includes 100 squalls (convective windstorms), 59 tornadoes, and six cases with both tornadoes and squalls. We used various information to compile the database including weather station reports, damage surveys, media reports, previously presented databases, and satellite images for windthrow. We found that the satellite images of damaged forests are the main data source on tornadoes, but their role is substantially lower for windstorm events due to the larger spatial and temporal scale of such events. Synoptic-scale environments and associated values of convective indices were determined for each event with a known date and time. Similarities and differences for the formation conditions of tornadoes and windstorms were revealed. Both squalls and tornadoes occur mostly on rapidly moving cold fronts or on waving quasi-stationary fronts, associated with low-pressure systems. Analyses of 72-h air parcel backward trajectories shows that the Caspian and Aral Seas are important sources of near-surface moisture for the formation of both squalls and tornadoes. Most of these events are formed within high CAPE and high shear environments, but tornadic storms are generally characterised by a higher wind shear and helicity. We also differentiated convective storms that caused forest damage and those did not. We found the composite parameter WMAXSHEAR is the best discriminator between these two groups. In general, storm events causing windthrow mainly occur under conditions more favourable for deep well-organised convection. Thus, forest damage can be considered as an indicator of the storm severity in the Perm region and in adjacent regions with forest-covered area exceeding 50%.

AB  - The inadequate treatments given to the served waste water which are disposal to the rivers and sea coast are the major sources of faecal Microorganisms and enteric bacterial pathogens. They are among the most serious effects of water pollution bringing risks on public health. None of the current methods for detection of pathogens offer real-time on site solutions, are capable of delivering a simple visual detection signal, or can be easily instrumented as an indicator of the presence of a pathogen in water. The use of lipid vesicles incorporating Polydiacetylenes (PDAs) for the development of biosensors for "real-time" detection of pathogens has become an alternative, due to its potential for simple colorimetric response against harmful environmental effectors. However, its actual application in the field has been complicated because lipid vesicles are unable to respond specifically to environmental changes. In this paper, we report several experimental trials leading to improved response in the detection of flagellated pathogens in drinking water. Chromatic biomimetic membranes of TRCDA/DMPC and TRCDA/DMPC/Tryptophan were used in agar and liquid media, which were challenged with different amounts of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. In addition, the effect of some divalent cations on the interaction with vesicles TRCDA/DMPC was investigated. The results indicated an improvement in the response times, both visually and quantitatively, through the use of TRIS-EDTA and proper growing conditions for E. coli and Salmonella. With the application of both conditions, it was possible by incubation at 35 degrees C to promote bacterial growth, therefore avoiding a dramatic effect on the colour change over control samples which may invalidate the test. Our experiments indicated that the minimum bacterial concentration necessary to produce the transition from blue to red on the vesicles as biosensor approaches 10(8) CFU/ml within 4 hrs, faster than traditional methods such as MPN or plate count agar.
   We present here incubations of samples of contaminated water at 35 degrees C, in agar plates containing chromatic biomimetic membranes of TRCDA/DMPC. A measurable colour transition is obtained within a reaction time of four hrs, which compares favourably with detection times between seven to 24 hrs corresponding to available tests.

AB  - This study describes the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of the canopy reflectance. water use and water status of Midknight Valencia citrus trees under semi-arid conditions. Hyperspectral canopy reflectance data was collected on 30 trees at monthly intervals over a period of 16 months in a commercial orchard in South Africa. The mean canopy reflectance in the wavelength range 350-2500 nm followed a clear seasonal trend influenced by environmental conditions and tree phenology. Mean monthly reflectance peaked in summer(similar to 22%) while the lowest value (similar to 15%) was reached in winter with the seasonal changes in the sun's position accounting for a significant proportion of the variations. A sensitivity analysis of a Penman-Monteith transpiration model showed that water use by individual trees changed by up to 13% when the canopy reflectance was varied over the seasonal range of measured values. This suggested that the seasonal changes in tree water use influenced the seasonal trend of the canopy reflectance. Thus monitoring the canopy reflectance of citrus trees could offer information on the tree water status. To test this, sap flow data of water uptake and loss by the trees were compared with the canopy spectra. Sap flow data showed a heavy reliance by the citrus trees on the internally stored water with up to 25% of the daily total transpiration withdrawn from the trees' internal water storage pools when soil water was limited. This depletion of internally stored water, and hence the change in tree water status, was detected using spectral indices based on the first order derivatives of the canopy reflectance centered at two and, at most, four spectral bands. We conclude that even if citrus trees are evergreen, their canopy reflectance changes significantly throughout the year with a considerable impact on tree energy balance and water use. In addition, the contribution of the internally stored water to daily transpiration is a possible indicator of drought stress for citrus trees detectable from changes in canopy reflectance and it has potential applications in irrigation scheduling using canopy level spectral information.

AB  - Effluent from a large combined sewer overflow (CSO) in Boston and receiving waters near the CSO outfall were sampled during dry and wet weather conditions. Surficial sediments were also collected from the vicinity of the CSO and at nearby sites. The samples were analyzed for a variety of organic constituents including organic carbon and nitrogen, linear alkylbenzenes (LABs), coprostanol and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). As judged by the presence of waste-specific markers (LABs, coprostanol), the CSO effluent contains sewage under both dry and wet weather conditions. When rainfall occurs, the concentration of suspended solids and all organic constituents in the particulate phase increase, ultimately approaching those characteristic of untreated sewage. The concentrations of LABs and PCBs in the effluent are strongly correlated, indicating that PCBs in the CSO are derived from sewage inputs. During heavy rainfall, the vast majority (> 90%) of the hydrophobic organic substances are associated with suspended particulate matter, whereas during dry weather, a significant fraction resides in the operationally defined 'dissolved' phase. Estimates of the mass emission rates of CSO constituents show that > 70% of the suspended particles and > 90% of the particulate organic carbon, hydrocarbons and trace organics are discharged during wet weather. Particles in the receiving water appear to be strongly influenced by the CSO effluent during wet weather. Concentrations of PCBs in surficial sediments near the CSO are correlated with those of coprostanol and the LABs, indicating that these compounds are derived from similar sources. Based on the observed correlations, approximately 60-80% of the sedimentary PCBs originate from sewage. Comparison of Sigma LAB/coprostanol ratios of effluent particles, surficial sediments and sewage sludges suggest that the vast majority of the marker compounds and the PCBs in sediments are not from the CSO, but are derived from one of two sewage treatment plants that discharged sludge into the harbor until 1991. The sludge-derived contaminants were probably carried by tidal currents into Dorchester Bay and deposited in shallow, quiescent embayments where sedimentation is favored. These results illustrate the potential importance of long-range transport of waste-derived contaminants in urban harbors and their rapid accumulation in localized depocenters.

AB  - Here, the virucidal effect of calcium bicarbonate with a mesoscopic structure (CAC-717) on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was determined. Assays showed that CAC-717 had a strong virucidal effect on all examined SARS-CoV-2 isolates, including variant strains. The viral infectivity decreased within 15 s, and the virucidal activity of CAC-717 at a 1:49 ratio was similar to that of ethanol disinfectant. CAC-717 neutralization eliminated this virucidal effect, indicating that the alkaline condition of CAC-717 is important for virus inactivation and is an indicator of its mesoscopic structure and virucidal activity. The virucidal effect was observed in the presence of organic matter (bovine serum albumin). CAC-717 is a non-invasive and non-flammable substance with a low environmental burden, and its usefulness as a novel disinfectant has been confirmed.

AB  - The OH-induced reactions are the most important reactions for the degradation of pharmaceutical and personal care proucts (PPCPs) in advanced oxidation process (AOP) systems. In this work, the transformation mechanisms of a typical PPCP, ketprofen (KP), are investigated in detail by combined density functional theory (DFT) simulations and laboratory experiments. We find that Habstraction pathways are preferred in the OH-initiated reactions, and the influence of the hydrogen bond between the OH radical and the carboxyl group cannot be neglected. The subsequent decarboxylation and decomposition reactions are likely to occur. In addition, under highly acidic condition, the protonation of the carbonyl group in KP or in other benzophenone-like compounds might inhibit the decomposition reactions. Meanwhile, the simulation results are well supported by the Fenton experiments.

AB  - Actually, cultivators are increasingly arranging innovative high technical and scientific estimations in the aim to enhance agricultural sustainability, effectiveness, and/or plant health. Innovative farming technologies incorporate biology with smart agriculture: computers and devices exchange with one another autonomously in a structured farm management system. Throughout this structure, smart agriculture can be accomplished; cultivators decrease plantation inputs (pesticides and fertilizers) and increase yields via integrated pest management and/or biological control. The emerging concept of remote sensing may provide a framework to systematically consider these issues of smart farming technology and to embed high-tech agriculture better. The impact(s) may be beneficial depending on how tools, such as data mining, and imagery technologies, such as picture treatment and analysis, are applied. Remote sensing technology is discussed in this review and demonstrates its possibility to create novel opportunities for scientists (and agronomists) to explore aspects of biological phenomena that cannot be accessed through usual mechanisms or processes.

AB  - Environmental health is strongly related to the quality of basic sanitation services. Those services must provide a better quality of life for people and the environment. This research has developed an indicator (environmental health indicator - EHI) for assessing basic health conditions in Campina Grande, PB (Brazil). Its starting point is an adaptation of a known EHI developed by CONESAN (Sao Paulo, Brazil) in 1999. EHI can be a planning tool and a public environmental management tool for priorities decision-making related to basic health services. It should guide governmental policies and civil society in several decision-making processes for a better quality of life in cities. First, EHI/CG values were developed and spatialized by census track for the whole city. Second, in a validation method, two additional indicators (environmental comfort and reservoir capacity) were developed in a different scale (urban fraction). Four pilot areas were chosen based on the highest and the lowest EHI/CG values for the whole city.

AB  - The effectiveness of removing indicator bacteria from domestic sewage using a vertical flow filter filled with natural materials has been analysed. The count of Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria was measured in raw and treated sewage and effectiveness of their removal under variable conditions of hydraulic load and depending on the filter filling (type, size and filling proportions) was assessed. A single-layer sand or zeolite filter was the most effective in reducing bacterial contamination. The sand-filled filter allowed the removal of 99.993-99.997% of Escherichia coli and the one filled with fine zeolite of 99.995%. The principal component analysis was used to comprehensively evaluate the filter performance. Three principal components were identified and they were responsible for 81% of raw data variability. The effectiveness of indicator bacteria removal depended mainly on the filling grain size and did not on filling proportions or its type.

AB  - We report here on a light addressable potassium (K+) sensor where light illumination of a semiconducting silicon electrode substrate results in a localized activation of the faradaic electrochemistry at the illuminated spot. This allows one, by electrochemical control, to oxidize surface bound ferrocene moieties that in turn trigger K+ transfer from the overlaid K+-selective film to the solution phase. The resulting voltammetric response is shown to be K+-selective, where peak position is a direct function of K+ activity at the surface of electrode. This concept was used to measure extracellular K+ concentration changes by stimulating living breast cancer cells. The associated decrease of intracellular K+ level was confirmed with a fluorescent K+ indicator. In contrast to light addressable potentiometry, the approach introduced here relies on dynamic electrochemistry and may be performed in tandem with other electrochemical analysis when studying biological events on the electrode.

AB  - Uric acid is the end-product of purine metabolism and a major antioxidant in humans. Most of the uric acid produced from the catabolism is readsorbed into the blood circulation system after primary filtration and partial secretion by the kidney. Uric acid levels in physiological fluids such as plasma and urine serve as valuable indicators for certain clinical conditions. An elevated uric acid in urine or serum can affect renal function and blood pressure, which is an indicator of gout, cardiovascular and renal diseases, hypertension, etc. Low uric acid levels may be associated with molybdenum deficiency, copper toxicity and worsening of multiple sclerosis. Therefore, detection of uric acid level dissolved in human physiological fluids is indispensable for diagnosis of patients suffering from these disorders associated with altered purine biosynthesis and catabolism. In this article the studies of detection methods for uric acid in biological samples in recent years are reviewed.

AB  - Plant-associated bacteria are important for the growth and health of their host, but little is known about its functional diversity and impact on ecosystem functioning. We studied bacterial nitrogen fixation and methane oxidation from indicator Sphagnum mosses in Alpine bogs to test a hypothesis that the plant microbiome contained different functional patterns depending on their functions within the ecosystem. A high abundance and diversity of nitrogenase genes were detected, mostly specific for each Sphagnum. In contrast, methanotrophs formed highly similar patterns despite a high abundance and diversity of methane monooxygenase genes. Our hypothesis was supported by these contrasting functional patterns together with the result that the Sphagnum sporophyte contained a high proportion of specific diazotrophs (45.5%) but no potential methanotrophs. While essential for plant growth under nutrient-limited conditions, nitrogen-fixing bacteria were highly specific and transferred with the sporophyte unlike the ubiquitous methanotrophs which are important for the climate-relevant ecosystem itself.

AB  - A novel principle, device and method of electrophoretic acid-base titration (EABT) was developed based on the concept of moving neutralization boundary (MNB). The core component of EABT device is the electrophoretic tube set above operating platform, and the movement of MNB during a certain time has direct relation with the concentration of acid or alkali. A series of experiments were conducted with the device. The results revealed (1) there was a good linearity between the moving distance of MNB and natural logarithmic concentration of HCl under the optimized conditions, and the linearity relationship could be well used to determine the concentration of acid; (2) different indicators had no obvious effect on EABT analysis, distinguishing strong influence on the judgment of equivalence-point titration in the classic volumetric analysis; (3) the RSD values of intra-day and inter-day runs were less than 1.6% and 3.8%, respectively, indicating good precision and stability.

AB  - The proposed European Union indicators for defining areas less suitable for agriculture in Slovenia are not entirely appropriate because taking them into account would omit some distinctly and clearly unsuitable areas - for example, Suha krajina (Dry Carniola) and Bela krajina (White Carniola) and farmers would be unjustifiably financially harmed. In such a case, every European Union member state has the right to propose an additional indicator to reduce such discrepancies. With regard to actual natural conditions, in Slovenia especially some karst landscapes would be unjustifiably omitted, and so we have proposed a karst indicator as an additional criterion based on the distribution of karst (i.e., carbonate) rocks. Through spatial coverage of karst rocks and soils, we determined whether more reasonable and less strict application of European criteria regarding soil could be satisfactory for better results in defining areas less suitable for agriculture in Slovenia.

AB  - The methodology, measurements and processing from fire behaviour experiments for the ignition and spreading in Pinus halepensis and Pinus pinaster forest litter are presented in this study. The experiments were carried out in laboratory conditions using a specifically designed set up. The basic independent variables in the course of the experiments were the slope angle of the work plane, the airflow velocity and the fuel moisture content. To provide a quantitative assessment for the effects of parameters on the fire spread and the flame angle during the experiments, statistical processing based on the regression analysis has been carried out. The developed model equations described the terrain slope and wind velocity as determining factors for the examined characteristics. The information acquired in these experiments assist in establishing quantitative relationships between important fire behaviour descriptors and its environment for the formulation of a model predicting fire spreading into surface fuel beds.

AB  - Transgenic products and the creation of new organisms with innovative transgenic traits generally raise risk assessment concerns because of potential risks to nontarget organisms. Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and Japanese government regulations require scientific environmental risk assessments of living modified organisms prior to release to avoid adverse effects on the environment. Soil microorganisms, such as the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aid in plant nutrient acquisition and protection from environmental stresses such as salt stress. In this study, we used a salt-tolerant transgenic Eucalyptus camaldulensis transformed with the mangrin gene from a mangrove plant and evaluated the interactions between environmental stress-tolerant transgenic plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Our results indicated that these transformants were substantially equivalent to nontransformants in terms of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization under both saline and nonsaline conditions, and that the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization could potentially enhance the salt tolerance of the transgenic plant.

AB  - Machine tool (MT) production is at the centre of most durable goods manufacturing and is in many ways, an indicator of a country's industrial prowess. Over the past three decades, the machine tool sectors of Japan and the United States have followed distinctly different trajectories. This paper compares and contrasts the performance and characteristics of the MT industries of both countries, with particular attention paid to several embedded differences in each country's manufacturing conditions at various levels. Once the world leader, the US MT industry is in a period of decline, despite signs of a rebound during the 1990s. Japanese MT producers continue to be among the world leaders in terms of both sales and technology, in the face of a recent domestic economic slowdown well over a decade long. The paper concludes with a discussion of the industry's future prospects.

AB  - A relational database linking benthic diatom records, taxonomic nomenclature including synonyms, and corresponding environmental data has been built in MS Access. It allowed flexible and long-term use of a relatively important amount of data (similar to 3000 records) gathered in the framework of the EC-funded PAEQANN project, gathering precise and documented information both about benthic diatoms and quantitative or semi-quantitative environmental data. Such a database has been shown to be a useful tool for the definition of benthic diatom typology at a multi-regional scale, the prediction of the impact of environmental characteristics on the structure of diatom communities, and additionally for a new insight on the auto-ecology of some taxa. This database could serve as a template for further work on diatoms and, after some implementation, on other freshwater communities. It could also be the basis for wider typology of stream diatoms, extended to other regions.

AB  - Constant efforts are ongoing for the development of new imaging methods that allow the investigation of molecular processes in vivo. Protein-protein interactions, enzymatic activities and intracellular Ca2+ fluxes, have been resolved in cultured cells using a variety of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) detection methods. However, FRET has not been used so far in conjunction with 3D intravital imaging. We evaluated here a combination of multiphoton microscopy (MPM), method of choice for non-destructive living tissue investigation, and FRET imaging to monitor calpain proteolytic activity in living mice muscle. We show that kinetics of ubiquitous calpains activation can be efficiently and quantitatively monitored in living mouse tissues at cellular level with a FRET-based indicator upon calcium influx. The ability to visualize calpain activity in living tissue offers a unique opportunity to challenge remaining questions on the biological functions of calpains and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of calpain inhibitors in many degenerative conditions.

AB  - Recent academic literature has increasingly placed more emphasis on the importance of the quality of life factor to local economic development. High environmental quality, culturally desirable working and living conditions, and convenient local amenities are believed to be vital to foster economic growth and job creation by retaining local businesses and attracting inward investment. However, there is another argument that the initial attractiveness of the growing agglomeration economies will soon turn out to suffer from the negative impacts of growth in terms of a deteriorating quality of life. This paper aims to explore empirically the views of policy-makers in two English regions over the contribution of quality of life factors to the process of local economic development. It then uses a set of indicators to examine statistically the relationship between quality of life and other local economic development factors of 363 local authority areas in England.

AB  - Fossil ostracod faunas from outcrops located at Punta Rasa Cape, in the south of Samborombon Bay, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, reveal mixo-euryhaline paleoenvironments close to cal 400 yr AD. Reconstruction of paleoenvironments and hydrodynamic patterns is based on the recombination method of known associations. On the basis both of the known ostracod associations and distribution patterns of thanatocoenoses (in situ as well as allothanacoenoses), a tidal flat in connection with the open Sea is proposed, such as an open bay developed behind of a barrier spit. Tidal channel migration processes are! responsible for the faunal distribution patterns. Comparison of the fossil data with modern zoogeographical provinces shows little difference suggesting that the influence of southern cold waters (Malvinas Current) was stronger close to cal 400 yr AD than it is today.

AB  - The Caquella rock glacier (5960-5400 m ASL), approximately one kilometre long, is an important active rock glacier in the intertropical zone. In the arid high mountain environment of Bolivia, glaciers are absent. Rock glaciers represent, with salt lakes, the best indicators of climate variability. Moreover, they act as water reservoirs in the present hydrological cycle in which precipitation is very low. Direct observations and geoelectrical soundings make it possible to identify interstitial ice in the permafrost. Nevertheless, the resistivity curve profile, the ice distribution in the debris mass as well as observations from the surface topography provide clear evidence that this rock glacier is in a degradation phase. The Caquella rock glacier probably originated in the early Holocene. The presence of a recent moraine in the upper part suggests that the ELA lowered to the rock glacier surface during the Little Ice Age. The climatic conditions producing the degradation have occurred during this century. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The chronostratigraphy of the coastal dunes on the western side of northern Cape York differs from the general pattern of dune emplacement identified on easterly facing coasts across northern Australia. Two episodes of dune emplacement are suggested by morphology prior to the establishment of the modern foredune. TL dating and comparative soil profile development indicate the possibility of three episodes. Based on a small number of TL dates, it is possible to associate dune emplacements at about 11,200 yrs B.P., 8300 yrs B.P. and 5200 yrs B.P. with shoreline disturbance and the destruction of shoreline vegetation by rising sea level. Stabilisation of the 11,200 yrs B.P. unit may be due to a short marine regression roughly around the time of the younger Dryas. The 8300 yrs B.P. unit probably stabilised due to changed environmental conditions, and the 5200 yrs B.P. unit represents the cessation of post-glacial sea-level rise in northern Australia.

AB  - Despite the creation of a variety of environmental building tools, it remains difficult to select existing tools or to develop new tools to address specific needs in many regions. This is largely due to insufficient transparency and complexity surrounding existing tools as well as the vague understanding of regionally specific conditions and requirements. An approach is proposed for developing regionally specific environmental building tools for China. Two new conceptual frameworks are established to classify environmental building tools and their related factors. Based on the new frameworks, a survey was conducted to understand local Chinese architects' perceptions about the relative importance of environmental building factors, and their expectations about the character, orientation, function and styles of environmental building tools in China. Based on these results, a suite approach to developing regionally specific environmental building tools is proposed and the implications of their applications in China are considered.

AB  - I assessed the relationship between ostracod occurrence and ecological variables in the Yumrukaya reedbeds (Bolu, Turkey), describing how differences in water conditions affected the composition of ostracod assemblages in this small freshwater wetland. Between May 2000 and July 2002, seven ostracod taxa (Cypridopsis vidua, Ilyocypris bradyi, I. gibba, Heterocypris incongruens, Eucypris virens, Candona neglecta, Pseudocandona sp.) were collected. All the ostracods had cosmopolitan characteristics, with broad ranges of tolerance to the variations in ecological variables and the capacity to either resist desiccation or to recolonize newly flooded habitats. The number of ostracods found in Yumrukaya reedbeds was about 50% lower than the average number of ostracods in similar sized habitats of Turkey. The Unweighted Pair Group Mean Averages (UPGMA) clustering analysis based on presence/absence data displayed three groups of ostracods and suggested that cosmopolitan species might have similar life cycles and ecological preferences. Correlation analyses indicated that salinity and percent oxygen saturation were significantly associated with species richness.

AB  - This paper studies the effects of lubricants on the failure and reliability of cams. Experimental investigations of the influence of lubricants on cam failure have been carried out at a metalworking factory. This paper presents following:
   - A classification of industrial oils for cams. To establish this classification, two essentials of parameters have been taken into account: the environment (ambient temperature) and the cam operating conditions (load and sliding velocity).
   - A flowchart of lubricating oil selection procedure for cams as a function of all relevant influencing factors.
   - An analysis of the symptoms and the causes of failure of machine tool cams.
   - An analysis of the average life and curves of cam reliability of machine tools as a function of tribological properties of some industrial oils.
   The obtained results have proved that the tribological properties of lubricants has a great influence on:
   - reduction of failures,
   - extension of the life and
   - increase of the reliability of cams. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshwater shortage and pollution, and low coverage rates of adequate water infrastructures, pose serious obstacles to development in many countries. This analysis first briefly reviews current hypotheses and empirical evidence, and constraints in data availability and consistency. Econometric and neural network models are applied to a large number of indicators for developing and transition economies, with a view to examining the relationships among macroeconomic and environmental conditions, water infrastructure development, and availability, demand and quality of water resources. The principal components analysis suggests a trade-off between per capita internal freshwater and groundwater resources, on the one hand, and access to improved water supply services, on the other. Among other results, regression and neural network models indicate that access to these services has been lagging behind in some poor and scarcely populated countries. Less explained outlying cases are represented by heterogeneous groups of countries in terms of geographical location and other development features.

AB  - Dark-colored mudstones of the upper Triassic Kossen Formation from the Gailtal Alps (Karnten, Austria), collected in the vicinity of the village Naggl, are characterized by high maturity of organic matter and high contents of generated hydrocarbons. The results from gas chromatography suggest that expulsion of low-molecular weight hydrocarbons has already occurred. A major contribution of marine algae to the organic matter as well as a varying input of land plant detritus deposited within carbonate source rocks under oxygen-deficient conditions is proposed. High amounts of sulfur-bearing aromatics in some samples argue for an early diagenetic incorporation of sulfur into the biomass. This process requires bacterial sulfate reduction and deficiency of Fe(II) for sulfide precipitation in the sedimentary environment. Maturity assessments based on the methylphenanthrene index (MPI 1) are consistent with vitrinite reflectance data from the sample locality (Ro between 0.9 and 1.0 %).

AB  - The multidimensional illustrative dictionary of meta-indicators includes lexemes, phraseological units and word combinations that regularly explicate metatext in A. Wierzbicka's interpretation.
   The aim of the article is to substantiate the expediency of the composition of the dictionary entry and the depth of the description of its components (zones, lexicographic parameters) and to show the dependence of the lexicographic type of meta-indicators on the number of lexicographic parameters and their specifics.
   Each lexicographic type of metatextual indicators is a group of dictionary units selected on the basis of a set of interconnected integral and differential heterogeneous lexicographic parameters, description zones. Variants of dictionary entries represent three lexicographic types of meta-indicators: connectors (takim obrazom 'this way', prezhde vsego 'first of all', slovom 'in a word', itak 'so', nakonets 'finally', vo-pervykh 'firstly'), quasiperformatives (povtoryu 'I'll repeat', dobavlyu I'll add') and semasiological metaelements (v pryamom smysle 'literally', v polnom smysle slova 'in the full sense of the word', v plokhom smysle slova 'in a bad sense of the word', obrazno govorya 'figuratively speaking').
   The dictionary entry is considered as a text consisting of several zones. A zone is understood as a compositional part of a dictionary entry that has a length from a word to a complex syntactic unit, represents areas of the description of a dictionary unit in a certain aspect, is characterised by the integrity of the representation of this information and contains one (or more) lexicographic parameter.
   Dictionary entries have the same set of mandatory lexicographic parameters and differ in the number of zones and optional lexicographic parameters.
   Obligatory parameters include the following zones: the title with mandatory (spelling) and optional (information on the variation of the meta-indicator expression and on the grammatical paradigm of some vocabulary units) parameters; the scope of operation with mandatory parameters (distribution characteristic of the dictionary unit, the scope of its operation, the range of the meta-indicator); the status in the language system with mandatory (grammatical qualification of the dictionary unit) and optional (prosody, punctuation and functional homonymy) parameters; semantics with mandatory (interpretation, pragmatic program, functional-stylistic) and optional (synonyms, negative material) parameters. "Formal functions" is an optional zone.
   In the dictionary of meta-indicators a dictionary entry includes up to seven zones and 14 lexicographic parameters that reflect the word-and text-centered, systemic-structural approaches to the study of metatext and naturally connect information of different sections of linguistics and semiotics.
   Lexicographic units of the same type have minor variations of the set of lexicographic parameters quantitatively (1-2), e.g., dictionary entries of connector meta-indicators may vary in the presence / absence of the functional homonymy zone in lexical units.
   Different types of lexicographic meta-indicators are identified based on (1) the number of zones and lexicographic parameters; (2) differential lexicographic parameters.

AB  - This work was carried out within the framework of a scientific investigation of the environmental condition of the Taparua project zone in Tunisia after the completion of the depollution activities. It deals with the evaluation of heavy metal contents in the subsurface of the artificial seabed sediment. The thermal decomposition, mercury amalgamation and atomic absorption results were rather comforting as the heavy metal rates were below the detection limit (Cr, Pb, Cu, Cd and Hg) or at most below the limits fixed by the local standards (Zn and Ni) except for some locations in or around the channels that connect to the beach (Ni). Thus, it is clear that the source of this contamination with Ni in specific locations is not from the quality of sediment used for the coast reclamation works but rather anthropic.

AB  - Two scenarios for the biogas production using Banana Peel as raw material were evaluated. The first scenario involves the stand-alone production of biogas and the second scenario includes the biogas production together with other products under biorefinery concept. In both scenarios, the influence of the production scale on the process economy was assessed and feasibility limits were defined. For this purpose, the mass and energy balances were established using the software Aspen Plus along with kinetic models reported in the literature. The economic and environmental analysis of the process was performed considering Colombian economic conditions. As a result, it was found that different process scales showed great potential for biogas production. Thus, plants with greater capacity have a greater economic benefit than those with lower capacity. However, this benefit leads to high-energy consumption and greater environmental impact.

AB  - The concept of soil health has been extensively reviewed in the scientific literature, but there is only patchy and inconsistent information available to farmers and growers who are concerned about the declining condition of their soils and are looking for appropriate test methods and management interventions to help reverse it. Although there are well-established laboratory methods for soil chemical analysis, and a range of laboratory and field methods for measuring soil physical properties, only now are methods starting to emerge for soil biological analysis. This study provides an overview of the methods that are currently available commercially (or are close to commercialization) for farmers and growers in the UK. We examine the science underpinning the methods, the value of the information provided and how farmers and advisors can use results from such assessments for informed decision-making in relation to soil management.

AB  - The objective of this study is to measure the city of Tehran's environmental quality in 2006 (the last census year). Primarily, with a comparative analysis of a variety of urban sustainability indicator models, a collection of 54 indicators have been chosen and categorized as indicators of increase or decrease in urban environmental quality in the form of a simple mathematical model. Based on the aforementioned model, Tehran's environmental quality in 2006, having obtained a score of 59.5%, has been evaluated as "middle ranking". After continuing the evaluation more meticulously, it became known that the individual healthcare indicator with a 91% score and the safety and security indicator with a 19% score had the highest and lowest quality respectively in the city. Repeating this evaluation in the future will show the condition of the city's movement toward establishing a sustainable city. Furthermore, it will clearly demonstrate the reasons affecting the high or low speed of this movement.

AB  - This study evaluated the utility of remotely sensed data to estimate forest maturity within Charles County, MD. We calculated tree canopy height using airborne scanning LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data over the entire county, and compared this to crown top height, stand age, and other data collected from randomly selected plots on the ground. Canopy height was a strong predictor of forest age, and we improved predictive power by including other variables such as land cover, slope, stream proximity, wetlands, and floodplains. These comparisons allowed us to construct a spatial model classifying forest in the study area into three age categories: <= 30 years old, 30-70 years old, and >70 years old, corresponding to young, intermediate, and mature. This spatial model was used to help characterize ecosystem condition and wildlife habitat, and help prioritize conservation decisions in the study area. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Screening soil samples collected from a diverse range of slightly alkaline soil types, we have isolated 22 competent phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB). Three isolates identified as Pantoea agglomerans strain P5, Microbacterium laevaniformans strain P7 and Pseudomonas putida strain P13 hydrolyzed inorganic and organic phosphate compounds effectively. Bacterial growth rates and phosphate solubilization activities were measured quantitatively under various environmental conditions. In general, a close association was evident between phosphate solubilizing ability and growth rate which is an indicator of active metabolism. All three PSB were able to withstand temperature as high as 42A degrees C, high concentration of NaCl upto 5% and a wide range of initial pH from 5 to 11 while hydrolyzing phosphate compounds actively. Such criteria make these isolates superior candidates for biofertilizers that are capable of utilizing both organic and mineral phosphate substrates to release absorbable phosphate ion for plants.

AB  - Phenological stages are the result of biorhythms and environmental factors, these last are probably the same ones that caused, during evolution, adjustments of the species to different climate. The present study was carried out in a Phenological Garden located in central Italy ( Perugia, Umbria Region) which contains indicator species, common to all International Phenological Gardens. The aim of this study was to determine and analyse the average trends of development of eight plant species and their phenological adjustment to the Mediterranean environment, over a nine- year period ( 1997 - 2005). The results of the statistical analyses show a strong relationship between the temperature trends and vegetative seasonal evolutions interpreted by phenological data for all the species considered. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the plants studied may approach or close completely the timing gaps eventually created during the first phenological phases, adjusting thus the beginning of subsequent phenophases.

AB  - Video recordings have become a common method For monitoring the benthic environment around salmon farms, but generally they are only assessed qualitatively. We made a quantitative assessment of video recordings and compared the results with benthic invertebrate faunal data from the same sites. Transects around two Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) farms were videoed, with environmental variables that clearly showed change with levels of organic enrichment ranked according to their degree of occurrence. These variable included Beggiatoa cover, pellets and faeces, sediment colour, and abundance of flora and fauna. Analysis of the data by multivariate statistics indicated that quantitative data from video recordings can clearly detect major organic enrichment. but that they are not as sensitive as benthic infaunal data to lower levels of disturbance, This assessment technique H;ill need to be tailored to different environmental conditions, but shows promise for long-term monitoring programs.

AB  - Despite popular articles and books, researchers have failed to examine how office clutter emerges and potential mediators underlying clutter in personal workspaces. We hypothesized that workers whose jobs require them to deal with a heavy volume of work at a rapid pace would be more likely to experience job strain (i.e., emotional exhaustion), which, in turn, depletes their energy and makes workers more likely to delay decisions. Decisional procrastination (indecision) was expected to increase office clutter, which itself is a physical stressor. Data from an Internet survey with 290 U.S. office workers recruited through Prolific Academic supported the hypotheses. This study is the first to examine clutter as a physical stressor in the workplace. A greater understanding of the factors that promote office clutter might help organizations and workers address sources of workspace conditions and personal habits that impede productivity and well-being.

AB  - It is essential to know the ecological tolerance of Anadenanthera peregrine (L.) Speg seedlings regarding the light and edaphic conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of substrates and shading levels on the emergence and quality of A. peregrine seedlings. The seeding was done in two substrates: 100% Dystroferric Red Latosol (DRL) and DRL + commercial substrate (1:1, v/v). The species were kept under four shading levels: 0% (direct sunlight), 30%, 50% and 70%. The highest speed and shortest emergence time of A. peregrine occurred in DRL. The highest growth characteristics of aerial part, xylopodium and roots occurred under direct sunlight and DRL. The productions of fresh and dried masses of different vegetative organs, physiological and Dickson quality index were higher in DRL and direct sunlight. The A. peregrine seedlings in 100% of DRL and direct sunlight showed more viable morphophysiological and quality indicators for their production.

AB  - The reconstitution is a pedotecnique producing environmental proper and fertile Technosols, applying chemical-mechanical treatment to alluvial sediments, degraded soils and pedomaterials included waste by different productive processes. By means of reconstitution, the environmental restoration of the covering degraded soil of a closed landfill near Piacenza is made (LIFE10 ENV/IT/000400 NEW LIFE). In order to assess this environmental restoration, LCC and FCC are calculated on 5 soil samples before and after reconstitution. The results, which highlight the transition from worst to best LCC and FCC classes show how reconstitution was able to convert the environmental and agronomic conditions from soil have very severe limitations that restrict the choice of plants or require very careful management, and that limit or restrict its use mainly to pasture, range, forestland, or wildlife food and cover, to soil have moderate limitations that restrict the choice of plants or that require moderate conservation practices or have optimum fertility.

AB  - Against the improvement of science and technology, earthquake is one of natural disasters that human cannot predict. Researchers indicated that there are many earthquake precursors. One of these precursors is a change in radon concentration in thermal waters about of active faults. Most of radon monitors cannot detect radon concentration in water directly, and they can detect radon concentration in air. Therefore, radon molecules should be separated from water and transferred to air. In this study, a bubbling system was used for the transfer of radon from water to air. Mathematical and neural network modeling of this system has been performed. The time constant parameter as an indicator of the separation rate was less than 20 min in most of experimental conditions. After validation of the models with experimental data, the effects of water and air flow rates and water temperature on the speed response of this system have been studied.

AB  - Numerous researchers have questioned the use of the unemployment rate as an explanatory factor in econometric studies which address the relationship between the economy and crime. This paper presents the findings from an exploratory study which sought to test the efficacy of the unemployment rate for predicting reported property crime rates and to identify other economic indicators which may also prove to be useful for predicting crimes with economic under tones or motives. Specifically, larceny-theft, burglary, motor vehicle theft, robbery, fraud and embezzlement. Given the exploratory nature of the study seven stepwise regressions were computed with unemployment emerging as a significant predictor for only one of the criminal offenses. Findings identified other useful economic variables, such as average wage and salary disbursements, supplemental security income receipts, the consumer price index and per capita personal income which should be considered in lieu of unemployment rates.

AB  - The task of providing leading indicators of catastrophic regime shifts in ecosystems is fundamental in order to design management protocols for those systems. Here we address the problem of lake eutrophication (that is, nutrient enrichment leading to algal blooms) using a simple spatial lake model. We discuss and compare different spatial and temporal early warning signals announcing the catastrophic transition of an oligotrophic lake to eutrophic conditions. In particular, we consider the spatial variance and its associated patchiness of eutrophic water regions. We found that spatial variance increases as the lake approaches the point of transition to a eutrophic state. We also analyze the spatial and temporal early warnings in terms of the amount of information required by each and their respective forewarning times. From the consideration of different remedial procedures that can be followed after these early signals we conclude that some of these indicators are not early enough to avert the undesired impending shift.

AB  - The familiarity of mankind with gypsum and its simple composition are in contrast with the frequent mistakes reported for its behavior and role in nature. Gypsum has been studied as a raw material, as a rock constituent, as an indicator of geological and archaeological conditions, and from other points of view. However, its role in Earth surface processes, its relationship to life through calcium in the equilibrium of carbonates and its structural water molecules, seems overlooked. Moreover, errors of gypsum formulation, analysis, and behavior obscure some of its roles within nature. The semi-solubility of gypsum explains its actions in many soils. The softness, fragility, and crystal water of gypsum are often nor considered. Routinely drying at 105 degrees C and pulverizing samples for lab analyses casts suspicion on all analytical results because gypsum becomes anhydrite and/or bassanite at this temperature. Specific physicochemical models are needed to predict the behavior of soils mainly composed of gypsum.

AB  - The influence of environmental factors on the disappearance of microbiological faecal pollution indicators and dermatophyte fungi indicators on sand to be used for beach nourishment is studied. For that purpose, sand was collected and submitted to experimental studies for 65 days. Heavy metals, total organic carbon (TOC), volatile solids, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) content, as well as, granulometric distribution of the sand were analyzed to guarantee its adequacy for the experiment. Sand was disposed in trays, inoculated with previously characterized wastewater (20%, v/w), and placed in an outdoor area. The trays were exposed to different environmental conditions of depth and movement of the sand (shallow trays with movement versus deep trays without movement), exposure to direct sun radiation (with versus without exposure) and moisture (daily watered with de-ionised water versus not watered). Faecal coliforms, enterococci and dermatophyte fungi indicators were analyzed during the experiment.

AB  - Glacial landform mapping is one of the primary inputs for the reconstruction of past glacial environments and processes, potentially inferring maximum ice sheet extent and dynamics. Depositional landforms (e.g. drumlins, end moraines, ribbed moraines, eskers) are often used to infer former ice sheet conditions, with erosional indicators receiving less attention. For nearly 200 years, striae (linear, subglacial erosional marks on bedrock up to several metres long) have been recorded as evidence for former ice flow direction. Cumulative data collection by many researchers in Ireland since similar to 1850 has led to a large published and unpublished archive of striae observations. This research has collated over 5000 individual observations from Geological Survey of Ireland maps and memoirs, the published (peer-reviewed) literature, and unpublished work (theses and fieldnotes). These records are now unified in a single database, georeferenced to the Irish National Grid, with the accuracy of individual observations qualitatively assessed.

AB  - Primary production, respiration, and net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) are useful indicators of ecosystem level trophic conditions within estuaries. In this study, dissolved oxygen data collected every half hour between January 1996 to December 1998 by the National Estuarine Research Reserve System Wide Monitoring Program were used to calculate primary production, respiration, and net ecosystem metabolism. Data from two sites at each of 14 Reserves were analyzed. On average, three quarters of the data available could be used to calculate metabolic rates. Data from two of the Reserves were used to evaluate the assumption of homogeneity of water masses moving past the oxygen sensor. Temperature was the single most important factor controlling metabolic rates at individual sites, although salinity was also important at about half the sites. On an annual basis, respiration exceeded gross primary production demonstrating that all but 4 of the 28 sites were heterotrophic.

AB  - The aim of the work is to analyze and summarize the literature data regarding the morbidity of pharmacists in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine the prospects for further research in this direction.
   Results. The catastrophic spread of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19) across the planet has become a challenge to the resilience of healthcare systems around the world. Pharmacists, as part of the healthcare professional team, have a unique role in the ongoing global fight against the pandemic. At the same time they are directly influenced by adverse environmental factors. Based on the literature data integration, it was determined that pharmacists are exposed to psychological stress, they are susceptible to allergic, ontological diseases, as well as diseases of the musculoskeletal system, and to primary varicose veins of the lower extremities. In addition, when providing pharmaceutical care, pharmacists may be at a very high risk for COVID-19.
   A review of scientific professional literature over the past 5 years has shown the lack of targeted research concerning the structure and level of morbidity with temporary disability of pharmacists in Ukraine and in other countries of the world. This fact and previously conducted studies give grounds to assert that there are significant difficulties in providing, collecting, accumulating and analyzing indicators of morbidity with temporary disability of pharmacists in Ukraine both at the state level and at the level of individual pharmaceutical enterprises.
   Today, we need to develop a methodology for assessing the relationship between the morbidity of pharmacists and their working conditions, and to find fundamentally new approaches to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection. This should result in improvement of the working conditions in the pharmaceutical sector and in the health care sector in Ukraine.
   Conclusions, Analysis and summary of literature data on the morbidity of pharmacists in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have revealed the need for further scientific research regarding the substantiation of factors affecting the structure and level of their incidence. The pandemic has created a need to develop scientifically based measures to increase the resilience of workers in the pharmaceutical health sector of Ukraine to the negative factors of the working environment impact on their life and health.

AB  - The 'green infrastructure typology' (GIT) scheme is a standardised framework to map and classify urban landscapes into 34 standard classes, each defined by a specific land cover composition and spatial configuration of vegetation. Previous studies have confirmed that GIT classifications can be successfully derived from airborne remote sensing data; nonetheless, the promotion of the GIT scheme as a framework for the assessment of ecosystem services such as 'climate moderation' requires further validations using a range of study areas with different vegetation conditions, and datasets from different seasons and times of the day. This study expands on previous research and evaluates the quality of thermal delineations by examining the spatio-temporal patterns and intra-/inter-typology differences of land surface temperatures (LSTs) using Sydney as case study. Further, this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the classification framework and methods for mapping and assessing the thermal conditions of green infrastructure (GI). Evidence indicates a strong spatial dependericy of LSTs that may have significant implications in the interpretation and precision of numerical or predictive models. Results for spatial clustering demonstrate that the GIT scheme can be implemented for a rapid identification of hotspots to prioritise urban areas for heat mitigation. Statistical results confirm that LST differences among GIT classes are statistically significant for different times of the day and seasons. Significant thermal contrasts were found for most GITs at daytime (86.9% in summer and 85.5% in winter) and night-time (80.9% in summer and 73.8% in winter). Temperature differences are more distinguishable in summer and daytime, due to longer solar exposure of surfaces. It was found that the cooling effects of pervious surfaces, water and trees are significantly disturbed by transmission of heat from surrounding impervious materials. Despite good thermal differentiations among GITs, a considerable intra-variability of LSTs was detected in classes with a large proportion of impervious materials with contrasting radiative properties. This causes numerous complexities and challenges that should be explored by future studies.

AB  - The mineralogical and chemical compositions of Lower Carboniferous (Tournaisian) marine black shale from the Kowala quarry, the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland, were investigated. This study focuses on disturbances in palaeoenvironmental proxies caused by palaeoweathering, which progressively changed the major and trace element abundances. Palaeomagnetic investigations reveal that the Devonian- Carboniferous succession was weathered during the Permian-Triassic by the infiltration of oxidizing fluids related to karstification following post-Variscan exhumation. The weathering process led to vermiculitization of chlorite, partial dissolution of calcite and replacement of pyrite by hematite and goethite. Moreover, the concentrations of some trace metals, including Co, Cu, Pb, Mo, Ni, As and U, significantly decreased. Consequently, some elemental abundance ratios that are used as environmental proxies, including U/Fh, Ni/Co and V/Cr, were altered. Elements that are bound to iron sulphides (e.g., Mo) appear to be especially prone to mobilization by even a lightly weathered black shale. The documented weathering, including changes in elemental concentrations, can potentially create misinterpretations of the.original palaeoenvironmental conditions. In addition, the palaeoweathering of the studied samples appears to have substantially changed the carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and molybdenum stable isotope values. The nitrogen and molybdenum stable isotope ratios, in particular, appear to be most sensitive to the effects of weathering and therefore are good indicators of (palaeo)weathering processes. The major cause of these changes is the decay of organic matter and pyrite. For the organic carbon stable isotopes ratios, the main factor that controlls this process appears to be the preferential degradation of labile organic matter. A combination of the total organic carbon (TOC), total sulphur (TS) content, Mo concentration and stable isotope compositions seems to be the most useful for identify (palaeo)weathering. Our results suggest that reductions in TS and Mo in tandem with diminished Mo stable isotope values in the absence of obvious changes to the TOC content provide the most compelling evidence of (palaeo)weathering.

AB  - This work continues the analysis of assemblages of ostracoda from the Middle Sarmatian deposits of the Borisphen Gulf of the Eastern Paratethys. Ivanova at al. (2007), Bondar (2015) present data on the history of the study of Sarmatian ostracods, on the factual data, methods of study, and lithological and palaeontological description of the composite Sarmatian sections of the marginal parts of the Borisphen Gulf. This publication presents a palaeoecological analysis of the ostracod assemblages, which contributes to the description of the shallow-marine environment which existed in the Middle Sarmatian basin. The material studied consists mainly of benthic ostracods, closely associated with the near-bottom environment of the basin. This makes them a reliable indicator of the palaeoecological environment. Any changes of the living environment is leaded to restructuring of the entire ostracod assemblage. The main environmental factors, influencing the systematic and quantitative composition, and the domination of one taxa over others, include water depth, salinity, hydrodynamic conditions in the basin, temperature conditions, substrate type, and organic carbonate and oxygen content of the water. The reconstruction of the palaeoenvironment is based primarily on the actualistic approach, where the environmental parameters of modem communities are extrapolated to the ancient fauna with certain assumptions. A total of 16 species of ostracod, belonging to 6 genera of 6 families, were identified in the Middle Sarmatian deposits. Investigation of these ostracod assemblages included taxonomic, quantitative, taphonomic and palaeoecological analyses. The palaeoecological analysis of ostracods from the deposits of the marginal parts Middle Sarmatian sea demonstrates that the assemblages developed in the more or less favorable environments of a warm shallow basin (deep up to 20 m, temperature about 20 degrees C). Limited diversity of the species, abundance of certain specimens, large and heavy shells of ostracods are typical of the shallowest parts of a basin with active hydrodynamic environments (Aurila). The highest taxonomic diversity of the ostracod associations was encountered in the fairly shallow and calm environments with low sorting of substrate and weak near-bottom hydrodynamics (Loxoconcha, Leptocythere). The salinity of the basin was unstable. So there are Cyprideis torosa, Cyprinotus luminosus in the assemblages.

AB  - Background: In clinical practice, laboratory results are often important for making diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic decisions. Interpreting individual results relies on accurate reference intervals and decision limits. Despite the considerable amount of resources in clinical medicine spent on elderly patients, accurate reference intervals for the elderly are rarely available. The SENIORLAB study set out to determine reference intervals in the elderly by investigating a large variety of laboratory parameters in clinical chemistry, hematology, and immunology.
   Methods/design: The SENIORLAB study is an observational, prospective cohort study. Subjectively healthy residents of Switzerland aged 60 years and older were included for baseline examination (n=1467), where anthropometric measurements were taken, medical history was reviewed, and a fasting blood sample was drawn under optimal preanalytical conditions. More than 110 laboratory parameters were measured, and a biobank was set up. The study participants are followed up every 3 to 5 years for quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. The primary aim is to evaluate different laboratory parameters at age-related reference intervals. The secondary aims of this study include the following: identify associations between different parameters, identify diagnostic characteristics to diagnose different circumstances, identify the prevalence of occult disease in subjectively healthy individuals, and identify the prognostic factors for the investigated outcomes, including mortality.
   Discussion: To obtain better grounds to justify clinical decisions, specific reference intervals for laboratory parameters of the elderly are needed. Reference intervals are obtained from healthy individuals. A major obstacle when obtaining reference intervals in the elderly is the definition of health in seniors because individuals without any medical condition and any medication are rare in older adulthood. Reference intervals obtained from such individuals cannot be considered representative for seniors in a status of age-specific normal health. In addition to the established methods for determining reference intervals, this longitudinal study utilizes a unique approach, in that survival and long-term well-being are taken as indicators of health in seniors. This approach is expected to provide robust and representative reference intervals that are obtained from an adequate reference population and not a collective of highly selected individuals.

AB  - Managing oxidative stress is an important physiological function for all aerobic organisms, particularly during periods of prolonged high metabolic activity, such as long-distance migration across ecological barriers. However, no previous study has investigated the oxidative status of birds at different stages of migration and whether that oxidative status depends on the condition of the birds. In this study, we compared (1) energy stores and circulating oxidative status measures in (a) two species of Neotropical migrants with differing migration strategies that were sampled at an autumn stopover site before an ecological barrier; and (b) a species of trans-Saharan migrant sampled at a spring stopover site after crossing an ecological barrier; and (2) circulating oxidative measures and indicators of fat metabolism in a trans-Saharan migrant after stopovers of varying duration (0-8 nights), based on recapture records. We found fat stores to be positively correlated with circulating antioxidant capacity in Blackpoll Warblers and Red-eyed Vireos preparing for fall migration on Block Island, USA, but uncorrelated in Garden Warblers on the island of Ponza, Italy, after a spring crossing of the Sahara Desert and Mediterranean Sea. In all circumstances, fat stores were positively correlated with circulating lipid oxidation levels. Among Garden Warblers on the island of Ponza, fat anabolism increased with stopover duration while oxidative damage levels decreased. Our study provides evidence that birds build antioxidant capacity as they build fat stores at stopover sites before long flights, but does not support the idea that antioxidant stores remain elevated in birds with high fuel levels after an ecological barrier. Our results further suggest that lipid oxidation may be an inescapable hazard of using fats as the primary fuel for flight. Yet, we also show that birds on stopover are capable of recovering from the oxidative damage they have accrued during migration, as lipid oxidation levels decrease with time on stopover. Thus, the physiological strategy of migrating songbirds may be to build prophylactic antioxidant capacity in concert with fuel stores at stopover sites before a long-distance flight, and then repair oxidative damage while refueling at stopover sites after long-distance flight.

AB  - Within the last 30 years the role of nitrogen in Central European forests has changed fundamentally from limiting resource to environmental problem. As the retrospective tracking of nutrient availability by soil chemical and biogeochemical measurements faces serious problems, bioindication based on understorey species composition is indispensable for monitoring broad-scale eutrophication.
   Based on a broad survey of more than 100,000 forest vegetation plots accessible in electronic databases from Germany and adjacent countries, we calculated unweighted average Ellenberg nutrient values (mN) as a proxy of plant-available macronutrients. Based on the quantiles of the frequency distribution of mN in a regionally stratified sample, we define five trophic classes, which can be used to compare dimensionless mN values.
   We studied spatial patterns of average nutrient values within 17 regions and compared the periods from 189910 1975 and 1976 to 2006. After 1975 eutrophic (mN > 5.67) and hypertrophic (mN > 6.28) conditions were common everywhere except in the Alps and Saxony-Anhalt, but very oligotrophic conditions (mN < 3.44) were still widespread in regions with nutrient-poor bedrock. Before 1975 mN of plots had been lower than after 1975 in all but the southeastern regions. Between the pre- and post-1975 data the proportion of hypertrophic plots increased from 5.7 to 11.8%, and that of very oligotrophic plots decreased from 14.6 to 8.3%.
   To remove bias resulting from uneven distribution, the dataset was stratified by five tree layer dominance types, period and region and resampled. In pre-1975 plots medians of mN increased in the order Pinus sylvestris, Quercus spp., Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica and Alnus spp, whereas the increase of mN was highest in forest types with historically low nutrient values. Therefore, the widespread change in mN must be attributed to the pronounced vegetation changes in Quercus and Pinus stands, indicating the importance of land-use change, i.e. recovery of nutrient cycles after hundreds of years of exploitation through coppicing, grazing and litter use.
   The analysis confirms eutrophication as a megatrend of modem vegetation change and demonstrates the high research potential of linking vegetation plot databases across large regions.

AB  - When managing heather (Calluna vulgaris) moorland by burning, the interval between burning must be long enough for successful bryophyte development, but not so long that excessive dry plant matter accumulates, as this can result in hot burns that damage the peat surface and cause peat erosion. Age and stage of heather development may not be the most informative and consistent indicators of recovery, as they vary considerably with different environmental conditions. A simple and reliable indicator as to when burning should occur was sought by measuring the abundance of bryophyte species on moorland plots with different phases of heather redevelopment after burning. Four dry heath (NVC community H12a) and three wet heath (NVC community M16d) sites with varying ages of heather between 1 and > 25 years were selected on Spaunton Moor, North Yorkshire, UK. Overall vegetation height and the number of bryophyte growing tips were recorded. Thirty-nine bryophyte species were recorded; 23 in dry heath and 30 in wet heath. Vascular plant canopy height was negatively correlated with the number of stems of Campylopus introflexus and Sphagnum species, and positively correlated with Hypnum jutlandicum. On dry heath, the abundance of Campylopus introflexus was greatest at a canopy height under 30 cm; Hypnum jutlandicum increased in abundance at this canopy height, and declined when the canopy reached approximately 55 cm. On wet heath, the abundance of Sphagnum species and Campylopus introflexus was greatest at a canopy height under 30 cm; Hypnum jutlandicum increased in abundance at a canopy height of 20 cm, with maximum abundance at a canopy height of 50 cm. Based on the recovery of the bryophyte species, burning is indicated when the canopy height reaches approximately 41 to 54 cm on dry heath, and 25 to 30 cm on wet heath. These canopy heights span a range of ages and stages of heather development making it difficult to translate these into a burning rotation based on these variables. As a result, canopy height was a more reliable indicator of bryophyte recovery than the age or stage of development of heather on Spaunton Moor. Further research is required to investigate the consistency of height as an indicator for burning on moorlands with different environmental conditions.

AB  - A recessive gene (tin) that inhibits tillering in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and that may be important in the redirection of assimilate from unproductive to productive tillers, has been reported. However, this gene has also been associated with a fatal condition known as 'stunting'. The severity of this phenomenon has been shown to increase when plants are grown under long photoperiods and at low temperatures. The objectives of this study were to observe how the expression of the tin gene varied in different genetic backgrounds, in addition to obtaining a better understanding of environmental factors that may affect both tillering and stunting in lines with the tin gene. Plants were grown outdoors in Canberra, Australia, at various times throughout the year, as well as under controlled conditions where photoperiod, temperature and light intensity were varied. The inhibition of tillers resulting from the presence of the tin gene was most extreme in summer, autumn and spring (up to 90% reduction in tillering). However, when sown in late autumn and winter, tillering was reduced by between 30-50% for the tin lines compared with their near-isogenic parents. Reduced tillering in the tin lines was due to an earlier cessation of tillering rather than a reduced rate. Stunting was frequently observed in some lines more than others when plants were grown under long days and when temperatures were low. The daily minimum temperature, rather than the average daily temperature, was associated with stunting. The duration of the dark period also influenced stunting, with a longer dark period reducing the incidence of stunting from almost 100% to 0%. In all experiments where irradiance was increased, stunting also increased. In addition, elevated CO2 also increased growth characteristics associated with stunting. It is concluded that stunting is associated with a high assimilate supply to the main stem shoot apex before the time of floral initiation. This is caused by an inhibition of tillering and a high photothermal quotient. Leaf length was found to be a good indicator of stunting severity, with stunted plants producing shorter leaves than those plants which failed to stunt. Measurements of leaf length indicated that stunting is induced when the second leaf is expanding.

AB  - The rapid growth of third and development of future generation mobile systems has led to an increase in the demand for image and video services. However, the hostile nature of the wireless channel makes the deployment of such services much more challenging, as in the case of a wireline system. In this context, the importance of taking care of user satisfaction with service provisioning as a whole has been recognized. The related user-oriented quality concepts cover end-to-end quality of service and subjective factors such as experiences with the service. To monitor quality and adapt system resources, performance indicators that represent service integrity have to be selected and related to objective measures that correlate well with the quality as perceived by humans. Such objective perceptual quality metrics can then be utilized to optimize quality perception associated with applications in technical systems.
   In this paper, we focus on the design of reduced-reference objective perceptual image quality metrics for use in wireless imaging. Specifically, the normalized hybrid image quality metric (NHIQM) and a perceptual relevance weighted L-p-norm are designed. The main idea behind both feature-based metrics relates to the fact that the human visual system (HVS) is trained to extract structural information from the viewing area. Accordingly, NHIQM and L-p-norm are designed to account for different structural artifacts that have been observed in our distortion model of a wireless link. The extent by which individual artifacts are present in a given image is obtained by measuring related image features. The overall quality measure is then computed as a weighting sum of the features with the respective perceptual relevance weight obtained from subjective experiments. The proposed metrics differ mainly in the pooling of the features and amount of reduced-reference produced. While NHIQM performs the pooling at the transmitter of the system to produce a single value as reduced-reference, the L-p-norm requires all involved feature values from the transmitted and received image to perform the pooling on the feature differences at the receiver. In addition, non-linear mapping functions are developed that relate the metric values to predicted mean opinion scores (MOS) and account for saturations in the HVS. The evaluation of prediction performance of NHIQM and the L-p-norm reveals their excellent correlation with human perception in terms of accuracy, monotonicity, and consistency. This holds not only for the prediction performance on images taken for the training of the metrics but also for the generalization to unknown images. In addition, it is shown that the NHIQM approach and the perceptual relevance weighted L-p-norm outperform other prominent objective quality metrics in prediction performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent years more and more environmental pollutants have been proved neurotoxic, especially at the early development stages of organisms. Zebrafish larvae are a preeminent model for the neurobehavioral study of environmental pollutants. Here, a detailed experimental protocol is provided for the evaluation of the neurotoxicity of environmental pollutants using zebrafish larvae, including the collection of the embryos, the exposure process, neurobehavioral indicators, the test process, and data analysis. Also, the culture environment, exposure process, and experimental conditions are discussed to ensure the success of the assay. The protocol has been used in the development of psychopathic drugs, research on environmental neurotoxic pollutants, and can be optimized to make corresponding studies or be helpful for mechanistic studies. The protocol demonstrates a clear operation process for studying neurobehavioral effects on zebrafish larvae and can reveal the effects of various neurotoxic substances or pollutants.

AB  - Entomology has had many applications in many biological domains (i.e insect counting as a biodiversity index). To meet a growing biological demand and to compensate a decreasing workforce amount, automated entomology has been around for decades. This challenge has been tackled by computer scientists as well as by biologists themselves. This survey investigates fourty-four studies on this topic and tries to give a global picture on what are the scientific locks and how the problem was addressed. Views are adopted on image capture, feature extraction, classification methods and the tested datasets. A general discussion is finally given on the questions that might still remain unsolved such as: the image capture conditions mandatory to good recognition performance, the definition of the problem and whether computer scientist should consider it as a problem in its own or just as an instance of a wider image recognition problem.

AB  - Spatial patterns of planktonic ciliate communities were studied to monitor marine water quality during winter, spring, summer, and autumn of 2014 in Daya Bay, South China Sea. A total of 41 species, with eight dominant species, were identified. Multivariate and univariate analyses demonstrated that spatial taxonomic pattern of planktonic ciliate communities was significantly correlated with environmental condition; ciliate abundance, species diversity, and species richness were significantly correlated with NO3- and salinity or temperature. Additionally, two dominant species (Tintinnopsis minuta Wailes, 1925 and Tintinnopsis beroidea Stein, 1867) were significantly positively correlated with nutrients, particularly with nitrogen nutrients. Three dominant species (Strombidium conicum (Lohmann, 1908) Wulff, 1919; Spirotontonia turbinata (Song & Bradbury, 1998) Agatha, 2004; Laboea strobila Lohmann, 1908) showed more sensitivity to salinity, whereas Mesodinium rubrum (Lohmann, 1908) was significantly correlated with temperature. Our findings suggest that planktonic ciliate communities can be considered a favorable bioindicator of marine water quality.

AB  - This study presents a one-dimensional, fully coupled numerical model for non-equilibrium suspended sediment transport that can be applied to channels and alluvial rivers. The accuracy of calculations was enhanced using a nonuniform size distribution, and evaluating probability of hiding and exposure effect of particles. This model is also capable of calculating the flocculation and temperature effect on sediment transport. In addition, the BOD and its influence on suspended sediment transport have been discussed. The study was conducted on the Aras River, Iran's third major river with a relatively high sediment concentration. To verify the model, water depth and sediment concentration of measured field data are compared with simulated data. Comparisons show a regression coefficient of more than 95% and mean computational error is less than 5%. The agreement of the data shows that the model is capable of predicting flow and suspended sediment transport with a correlation coefficient higher than 98%.

AB  - This study reports the occurrence of shell deformities in the Baltic clam Macoma balthica from the Northern Baltic Sea (Trosa Archipelago, Sweden). The functional significance and the bioindicative potential of observed exoskeleton' anomalies was assessed using a suite of physiological and morphological biomarkers.
   Analyzed shell deformations (SD) included damages of the dorsal margin visible as shell excavations, destruction of the beak, umbo and hinge ligament and decreased shell' transparency. Deformed clams exhibited worse physiological conditions and increased frequency of micronuclei. Skewed sex ratio towards male domination was observed in all studied populations. Spatial differences in the occurrence of deformed clams are reported, with more than 50% of deformed clams inhabiting polluted locations and 8% the reference station. These results are encouraging for the use of described SDs as initial and cost effective indicators of environmental health. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Wild coliforms and Salmonella sp. were monitored for 6 h of sunlight irradiation and 72 h of dark post-treatment period. In our conditions, SODIS treatment Could not avoid Salmonella sp. re-growth during dark storage, meanwhile the addition of 10 mg L-1 of H2O2 showed a strong enhancement of the inactivation rate without any re-growth of both bacteria.

AB  - The Kyoto Protocol, adopted on 11 December 1997, was elaborated as a means to control the risk of global warming from greenhouse gases, while improving the human condition. This paper is an attempt to answer the following main questions: Does the Protocol signature have any immediate impact on countries behaviour? Is the speed of changes similar to all European countries? Are there any allometric scaling relations between the measure of country's dynamic (CO(2) emission or other environmental parameter) and the country's size (population or Gross Domestic Product)? In case of differences among European countries, are these scaling relations relevant to explain the differences? This paper examines the differences between 2 time intervals (i.e., 1990-1997 and 1998-2005), regarding CO(2) and other environmental indicators in 15 European countries.

AB  - 1. Most attempts to describe the distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates in large rivers have used local (grab-scale) assessments of environmental conditions, and have had limited ability to account for spatial variation in macroinvertebrate populations.
   2. We tested the ability of a habitat classification system based on multibeam bathymetry, side-scan sonar, and chirp sub-bottom seismics to identify large-scale habitat units ('facies') and account for macroinvertebrate distribution in the Hudson River, a large tidal river in eastern New York.
   3. Partial linear regression analysis showed that sediment facies were generally more effective than local or positional variables in explaining various aspects of the macroinvertebrate community (community structure, density of all invertebrates, density of fish forage, density of a pest species - Dreissena polymorpha).
   4. Large-scale habitats may be effective at explaining macroinvertebrate distributions in large rivers because they are integrative and describe habitat at the spatial scales of dominant controlling processes.

AB  - Since large areas have been contaminated by mining activities, knowledge about the evolution of polluted sites and pollutant speciation are required for environmental risk assessment. A mineralogical and chemical investigation was performed on the site of the Cheni's mine (France), where sulphide-rich tailings, containing large amounts of arsenic (As), were abandoned in 1944. It revealed that most of S, Fe and As are no longer in sulphide forms in the surface layer (0-2 m). Oxidation products are gypsum, epsomite and As-rich Fe hydroxides. Arsenic fixation was found to be reversible when leaching conditions increase. We also attempted to provide an approach of the As-bearing phases using a normative calculation: average composition is [Fe2O3](5)[As2O5](4). 30 H2O nearby the reduced original material, and [Fe2O3](3)[As2O5](2). 18 H2O in more leached material.

AB  - The particle growth term renders hyperbolic the dynamic population balance equation. Problems associated with the numerical solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations with stationary grid methods are well known. Moreover in the common case of combined molecular particle growth and coagulation, the convolution integral of the coagulation terms makes the moving grid methods computationally intractable. To cope with practical problems, this work is focused on numerical solution methods, of the population balance equation, characterized by relatively small computational cost and fair accuracy - comparable to that of relevant experimental data. For this purpose, previous work on appropriate discretization of the coagulation terms is extended for the growth terms. Several numerical methods are systematically evaluated and further extended. Recommendations are made concerning the best method, by taking into account the nature of the problem, the prevailing physical conditions, and the main quantity of interest; i.e. certain specific moments, or the entire size distribution.

AB  - Indicators of past sea level play a key role in tracking the history of global climate. Variations in global sea level are controlled mainly by growth and decay of continental glaciers and temperatures that are closely correlated with the mean global climate state (glacial and interglacial cycles). Our understanding of global climate and sea level has benefited significantly from improvements in ocean floor sampling achieved by the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) and the Integrated Ocean Drilling and International Ocean Discovery Programs (IODP), as well as from the application of new analytical techniques and isotope mass spectrometry. This paper presents an overview of recent advances in paleo-sea level studies based on analysis of samples and data from deep-sea sediment cores and drowned coral reefs obtained through ODP and IODP. Future scientific ocean drilling will contribute further to studies of ice sheet dynamics under different climatic boundary conditions.

AB  - A methodology of textural analyses based on image analysis is proposed and tested based on study of fault rock samples from the Tatra Mts., Poland. The procedure encompasses: (1) SEM-BSE imagery of thin sections; (2) image classification using the maximum likelihood method, performed with GIS software; (3) statistical analysis and fractal dimension (self-similarity) analysis. The results of this method are comparable to those obtained with methods involving specialized software. The proposed analytical procedure particularly improves qualitative observations with quantitative data on grain shape and size distribution. The potential of the method is shown, as an auxiliary tool in determining the nature of deformation processes: the role of high-temperature dynamic recrystallization processes is recorded using grain shape indicators, whilst the switch from ductile to brittle conditions is reflected by the grain size distribution pattern.

AB  - Addressing sustainability incorporates multidisciplinary and heterogeneous knowledge that has extended spatial and temporal horizons. Within such context, in contrast to a procedural (prescriptive) approach, a functional or performance-based approach to setting and designing knowledge management process is more suitable. To help set up the functions of knowledge management processes, we examined 30 cases of environmental impact assessment in Ontario, Canada and engaged experts who were involved in these cases. Four main functions are proposed as essential: support the acquisition and use of sustainable knowledge; communicate sustainable practices and harness community input; facilitate coordinated analysis and integrated assessment; and reengineer regulation enforcement to simplify the process. The functions proposed are not intended to be universal, as conditions (legal and technical) will vary from one jurisdiction to another. However, it is hoped that they can be benchmarked by other jurisdictions.

AB  - This study aims at characterizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of spatio-temporal data sets, characterized by high resolution in the temporal dimension which are becoming the norm rather than the exception in many application areas, namely environmental modelling. In particular, air pollution data, such as NO2 concentration levels, often incorporate also multiple recurring patterns in time imposed by social habits, anthropogenic activities and meteorological conditions. A two-stage modelling approach is proposed which combined with a block bootstrap procedure correctly assesses uncertainty in parameters estimates and produces reliable confidence regions for the space-time phenomenon under study. The methodology provides a model that is satisfactory in terms of goodness of fit, interpretability, parsimony, prediction and forecasting capability and computational costs. The proposed framework is potentially useful for scenario drawing in many areas, including assessment of environmental impact and environmental policies, and in a myriad applications to other research fields.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to describe an ergonomics contribution in maintainability. The economical designs, inputs and training helps to increase the maintainability indicators for industrial devices. This analysis can be helpful, among other cases, to compare systems, to achieve a better design regarding maintainability requirements, to improve this maintainability under specific industrial environment and to foresee maintainability problems due to eventual changes in a device operation conditions. With this purpose, this work first introduces the notion of ergonomics and human factors, maintainability and the implementation of assessment of human postures, including some important postures to perform maintenance activities. A simulation approach is used to identify the critical posture of the maintenance personnel and implements the defined postures with minimal loads on the personnel who use the equipment in a practical scenario. The simulation inputs are given to the designers to improve the workplace/equipment in order to high level of maintainability. Finally, the work concludes summarizing the more significant aspects and suggesting future research.

AB  - Trade openness experienced by Brazil in recent decades incorporated into an environment of intense participation of agribusiness in the internal economic transactions as the transactions related to the international market, made necessary the insertion of agents linked to this sector, especially small producers. This paper aims to examine the competitiveness of milk supply chain in Alagoas, characterized by being household production and observing some ways determinants of competitiveness in the sector, looking through a indicator of competitiveness and theoretical foundations, trying thus to illustrate some economic data to understand the dynamics of the sector. However, it is observed that the sector, given the competitiveness indicator analysis (Almost Income), presents a behavior inefficient, indicating that the members of the system firms are not getting any return for the use of its fixed capital production in year t. So that the activity is not appear sustainable in the long run if this condition is perpetuated.

AB  - Knowing the maturation of the Acrocomia aculeata (macaw palm) fruit is decisive for harvest to be performed when the fruit has a higher content and quality of oil. There are different approaches to monitor maturation and they can be classified as destructive and non-destructive. Variables obtained by optical instruments have been used to determine maturation stage. The present study evaluated the relationship between the biological activity measured by the optical technique of biospeckle laser and firmness, measured in the Acrocomia aculeata fruit pulp between the 41st and 61st week after flowering. The biological activity was quantified by biospeckle images, while the fruit pulp firmness was determined by digital penetrometer. Correlations between variables were evaluated during maturation and in the senescence of fruits. According to the results, significant correlation between biological activity and firmness was found for both evaluated conditions, demonstrating that biospeckle laser can be an effective non-invasive indicator of Acrocomia aculeate fruit maturation assisting in the determination of the moment of harvest.

AB  - Studies of spawning water bodies in the city of Moscow have shown that the urban populations of common (Rana temporaria) and moor (R. arvalis) frogs are small compared with suburban populations, and their individuals lead a hidden mode of life. The recorded increase in the fecundity of females from several populations of the city of Moscow may be accompanied by an increase or the preservation of the diameter of eggs as compared with the same indicator for suburban populations. The populations in which the females produced many small eggs died out during the study period. The most prosperous populations are urban populations of brown frogs whose females spawned eggs of various sizes. We consider the formation of these clutches as a manifestation of the bet-hedging strategy compensating for mortality in adverse and unstable environmental conditions.

AB  - The concept of community disaster resilience (CDR) has become one of the most popular terms in disaster literature. This concept is recognized as a culture-bound phenomenon that is influenced by diverse domains and indicators in any specific culture. This qualitative study uses content analysis to explore conceptual and working definitions, as well as domains and indicators of CDR in Iranian context. CDR is defined as "The ability of a community to coexist, cope with, and manage disasters through an integrated, comprehensive, participatory and positive approach." Seeking a working definition, CDR explores as "The level of hazards that a community absorbs with no damage, the level of main functions that remains active, and the period a community needs to return to normal conditions." CDR in Iran is formed by social, managerial, economic, cultural, physical, and environmental domains and as a holistic approach that makes disaster management effective and efficient.

AB  - Baseline reference ranges of serum chemistry and hematology data can be important indicators for the status of both individuals or populations of wild animals that are affected by emerging pathogens, toxicants, or other causes of disease. Frequently, reference ranges for these values are not available for wildlife species or subspecies. We present hematologic and serum chemistry reference ranges for moose (Alces alces) adults, yearlings, and calves in Norway sampled from 1992-2000. Additionally, we demonstrated that both induction time and chase time were correlated with initial rectal temperature, although they were not significantly correlated with cortisol, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose, or creatine kinase. Overall, the reference ranges given here are similar to those given for American moose, with a few differences that can be attributed to environment, testing methodology, or subspecies or species status. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of reference ranges for moose in Norway.

AB  - Total coliforms, as a microbiological indicator of water quality, have been tested on the basis of condition, dynamics, as well as on the dependence on other physicochemical and biological parameters, by methods and models of data mining. Using a combination of intelligent approaches, cluster analysis and classification, total coliforms have been analyzed and modeled on the examples of the Gruza and the Grosnica reservoirs. These reservoirs have different morphometric characteristics, different trophic status as well as dominant bacterial communities. The study is based on the existing information system and automated data analyses for the period of 10 years. The system determines the accuracy of analyses by validity percentage. The analyses show that the number of total coliforms is connected to anthropogenic activity, the amount of organic mater, as well as to the presence of bacterial community which is not dominant or characteristic for the specific reservoir.

AB  - This paper examines the factors affecting the implementation of green buildings for the local construction industry. Questionnaire surveys and structural interviews were conducted to investigate the economical and social factors in the implementation of green buildings. From the survey results, the industry strongly believes that green building implementation is environment-friendly and can improve social values to the consumers. However, material costs, construction and transportation for green materials and green building features are more expensive than those for the conventional buildings. Four major factors affecting the existing limited implementation of green buildings were also discussed. Recommendations to improve the implementation of green buildings were also explored. This study can bring insights locally and around the world on how green buildings can be implemented to achieve environment-friendly, long-term cost saving and being recognized by the society and the consumers to reduce difficulties and burden encountered in the implementation.

AB  - Sagistalsee is a small lake located at the modern tree-line in the Swiss Alps. A 13.5 m long core taken in the central part of the 9.5 m deep basin consists of clayey silts and sands and dates back to about 9000 cal. BP. These sediments have a low organic content that steadily increases from 4 - 8% loss-on-ignition at 550 degreesC towards the top of the core, whereas the carbonate content decreases from 20 to about 10% loss-on-ignition at 950 degreesC. We outline the aims of an interdisciplinary research project centred on the Holocene sediments of Sagistalsee. We also present information about the lake, its sediments, and its catchment that forms the basis for different biotic and abiotic multiproxy studies carried out on the sediments of Sagistalsee.

AB  - The present study aimed at investigating whether a nonlinear and scaling approach is suitable for statistically characterizing the spatial variability of soil geochemical element contents at field conditions. Spatial distributions of 20 soil geochemical elements' contents in an agricultural field soil were investigated. Two indicators of nonlinear scaling were employed, empirical probability distribution functions (pdfs) and structure functions. For the pdfs, a trend was discovered with major elements naturally occurring in the soil being hyperbolic and minor trace elements being close to Gaussian, Further, fertilizer management was found to modify the behavior of related elements. The structure functions were generally nonscaling for major elements and scaling for minor elements, however, without any noticeable effect of fertilizer application. The scaling was of both monoaffine and multiaffine type. This suggests that the random cascade models recently used within geophysics may be useful also for geochemical element variability in soil.

AB  - The success of hybrid poplar planting programs depends on the selection of clones with desirable growth properties, matched to specific environmental conditions. Traditionally, tree geneticists have employed early height growth as an indicator of rotation age volume production. This approach was evaluated against selection functions based upon easily measured mensurational and morphological traits. A mixed planting of 12 clones of three Populus species was analyzed during three years of growth. Clonal and moisture regime variation and co-variation were examined for numerous measured and derived traits. A procedure was developed employing canonical correlation analysis to construct selection functions based on multiple mensurational and morphological traits. Results suggest that simple selection functions based upon easily measured traits are superior to early height growth for ranking hybrid poplar clones for total tree volume production.

AB  - Welfare and management of calves is of increasing interest and also influences performance of these animals in later life. The aim of this study was to assess management and environmental conditions under which pre-weaned dairy calves are reared on commercial Irish dairy farms. We included 47 spring-calving, pasture-based herds in this study. Herd and animal-specific data, such as mortality rate, age and breed, were gathered from all participants via the HerdPlus(R) database. Information pertaining to management practices was collected by conducting an interview with the principal calf rearer, while an assessment of calf housing facilities was conducted to identify conditions calves were reared in. The environmental assessment included measurements of space allowance per calf, as well as feeding equipment hygiene. To assess calf behaviour video observations were used, while accounting for the number of calves present in a group and the space available per calf. Faecal samples were also collected to determine the presence of enteric pathogens among calves. To compare calf space allowance, group size and presence of enteric pathogens early and late in the calving season each farm was visited twice. Calf mortality was not associated with either herd size, space allowance per calf or post-colostrum feeding practices. Higher calf mortality was identified among herds which reported experiencing an on-set of calf pneumonia during weeks 8 to 10 of the calving season. This study demonstrates that factors associated with calf welfare on commercial Irish dairy farms (e.g. space allowance, mortality rate) are independent of herd size. Some management practices however, such as methods used for treating health issues can affect rates of calf mortality experienced. Calf mortality, for example, was lower in herds which treated diarrhoea cases by administering electrolytes, while continuing to offer milk. Behavioural observations indicate that smaller group sizes could promote expression of positive behaviours, potentially resulting from an overall improvement in welfare. Space allowance per calf was not associated with observed behaviour frequencies. We also identified that similar rates of calf mortality are experienced across herds of different sizes.

AB  - Assessing modern radiolarian distribution in the marginal seas is essential for understanding its relationship to hydrographic and environmental variables, upon which subsequent interpretation of past radiolarian records can be made reliably. Here, we combine published radiolarian assemblages in 69 surface sediments from the Japan Sea with those obtained from 15 new surface sediments in this study to determine the modern distribution of radiolarians. The Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) taxa are only found in the south of the Subpolar Front. The results of redundancy analysis confirm that the temperature at 10 m depth (temperature(10m)) is the main factor controlling the spatial variability of TWC taxa. The water depth plays a key role in affecting the abundances of Japan Sea Proper Water (JSPW) Assemblage including Larcopyle buetschlii Dreyer (adult), Cycladophora davisiana Ehrenberg, and Actinomma group. The JSPW Assemblage can be used as a reliable indicator of ventilation changes in the Japan Sea. Based on the newly developed TWC taxa and JSPW Assemblage, we further reconstructed the water column structure in the central Japan Sea over the past 25 ka. There was weak ventilation in the central Japan Sea even during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), although a distinct decrease in the TWC inflow resulted in surface-water freshening and water column stratification. After the LGM, the TWC taxa together with JSPW Assemblage resumed in the central Japan Sea at the 19 ka meltwater pulse (MWP). The MWP-1A was clearly marked by an enhanced intrusion of the TWC. Synchronously, JSPW was ventilated deeply down after similar to 14.6 ka attaining to the similar level of the Holocene as a result of changing sea surface conditions. Along with the continuing sea-level rise, the matured TWC entered the Japan Sea at 7 ka and since then the modern hydrographic condition has been established. We suggest that the changes in the sea level and TWC strength predominantly determined the surface hydrography and deep ventilation in the central Japan Sea since 25 ka, and the TWC might have notably affected the Japan Sea since the Bolling-Allerod.

AB  - The article brings to the fore the issues related to identifying and assessing the relationship between the development of the research sector and the innovative growth of regions. It is shown that the key feature of the knowledge generation sector is research potential, the essence of which is directly related to the level of development of fundamental and applied research, the degree of their implementation in the material sector of the economy. We reveal that at present the research is carried out, which affects various aspects of the assessment of research potential, identifying the trends in its development and mechanisms of its implementation at different levels. The comparative analysis carried out in the article shows that all methodological approaches include a fairly identical set of indicators characterizing quantitative characteristics and their dynamics; many of them use aggregated indices that make it possible to compare countries and regions. In addition to the existing methods, our own approach proposes to analyze not only quantitative, but also qualitative characteristics in order to create conditions for the formation of the environment for innovative development of the region. Thus, on the example of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences we show that the priority directions of research development should not only correspond to the global and national scientific agenda, but also address the issues of innovative development of the regions in which research centers are located. The article presents the analysis of the regions in which scientific institutes and centers of the Ural Branch of RAS are located; we make a classification of these regions, highlighting the regions-innovators, regions-followers and catching up regions; priorities of innovation and technological development are identified for each region and then they are compared with the priorities of the Ural Branch of RAS. We put forward the thesis that in addition to the concentration of researchers the most important condition for the generation of knowledge and for the creation of breakthrough technologies is a high concentration of investment resources in the field of science. On the example of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences we present the data on the need for investment in the development of scientific organizations and scenarios for their development.

AB  - The vacant house is an essential phenomenon of urban decay and population loss. Exploration of the correlations between housing vacancy and some socio-environmental factors is conducive to understanding the mechanism of urban shrinking and revitalization. In recent years, rapidly developing night-time remote sensing, which has the ability to detect artificial lights, has been widely applied in applications associated with human activities. Current night-time remote sensing studies on housing vacancy rates are limited by the coarse spatial resolution of data. The launch of the Jilin1-03 satellite, which carried a high spatial resolution (HSR) night-time imaging camera, provides a new supportive data source. In this paper, we examined this new high spatial resolution night-time light dataset in housing vacancy rate estimation. Specifically, a stepwise multivariable linear regression model was engaged to estimate the housing vacancy rate at a very fine scale, the census tract level. Three types of variables derived from geospatial data and night-time image represent the physical environment, landuse (LU) structure, and human activities, respectively. The linear regression models were constructed and analyzed. The analysis results show that (1) the HVRs estimating model using the Jilin1-03 satellite and other ancillary geospatial data fits well with the Census statistical data (adjusted R-2 = 0.656, predicted R-2 = 0.603, RMSE = 0.046) and thus is a valid estimation model; (2) the Jilin1-03 satellite night-time data contributed a 28% (from 0.510 to 0.656) fitting accuracy increase and a 68% (from 0.359 to 0.603) predicting accuracy increase in the estimate model of the housing vacancy rate. Reflecting socio-economic conditions, the luminous intensity of commercial areas derived from the Jilin1-03 satellite is the most influential variable to housing vacancy. Land use structure indirectly and partially demonstrated that the social environment factors in the community have strong correlations with residential vacancy. Moreover, the physical environment factor, which depicts vegetation conditions in the residential areas, is also a significant indicator of housing vacancy. In conclusion, the emergence of HSR night light data opens a new door to future microscopic scale study within cities.

AB  - In ethnic areas, plant utilization is an essential component of traditional ecological knowledge and an important intersection between biodiversity and cultural diversity. Multipurpose plants play an important role in diversity of plant utilization and can be used as an indicator of regional biocultural diversity. Different uses of the same multipurpose plant correspond to different gathering methods and have different impacts on plant resources. Although important in both daily life and scientific studies, multipurpose plants are rarely specifically studied. In this study, multipurpose plant utilization by Miao and Buyi people in Guizhou, China, was investigated using semi-structured interviews. Plant uses were classified into eight categories: food, medicine, timber, fuel, technological, recreation, ornamental and symbolic. Three indices, Joint Plant and Use (JPU), Joint Uses (JU), and Joint Index (JI), were proposed to analyze overall utilization for multipurpose plants and the relationships among their different uses. A total of 58 species of non-cultivated multipurpose plants and 140 corresponding JPUs were recorded. With the decrease in use number, the corresponding species number of multipurpose plants increased. Two-use plants were most common among multipurpose plants, and food-medicinal plants were most frequent among two-use plants. Moreover, medicinal use and food use have the highest JI value, representing the close relationship between these two uses. Multipurpose plants are essentially determined from the attributes of plants themselves. Trees tend to have more uses than herbaceous plants. Different uses of the same plant represent different cultural or economic values, which determine the importance of a specific use. Socio-economic conditions and policies also have impacts on multipurpose plant utilization. While socio-economic conditions, policies, and plant resources vary, people might choose among different uses; hence, some key multipurpose plants and their JPUs will reflect the variations. The JPU used in this study can be regarded as a basic biocultural diversity unit. Using JPU, JU or JI allows multipurpose plants and their uses to be analyzed quantitatively. Multipurpose plants should be valued in research and management and, for further research, it is important to establish a standard plant use categorization.

AB  - Samples from the upper part of Pecinov Member of the Penic-Korycany Formation (upper Cenomanian), lower part of the Bila Hora Formation (upper Cenomanian-lower Turonian) and lower part of the Teplice Formation (upper Turonian) were analyzed for contents of rare earth elements (REE), P2O5, Y and U. The samples include glauconitic mudstones and sandstones, phosphate nodules, phosphate coprolites, sponges and tube-fills. The results indicate that carbonate-fluorapatite is the major host of REF in the Cenomanian-Turonian sequence, with REE most probably substituting for calcium in the apatite structure. The substantial proportion of REE was supplied from terrigenous material derived from highly weathered crystalline rocks of the Bohemian Massif and transported by rivers to the basin. The shale-normalized REE distribution shows a "bell-shaped" pattern, particularly developed in the phosphate-bearing samples. Such a pattern could have been produced by local environmental redox conditions, preferential substitutions in the apatite phase, and/or later diagenetic processes, in addition to a possible signature of source rocks. The results suggest that all investigated units were deposited under various degrees of oxygen availability. Redox conditions indicators, such as Ce-anomaly and Ce/La ratio, suggest decreased oxygenation of the depositional environment from bottom to top in the upper parts of the Pecinov Member and in the phosphate nodules at the base of the Bila Hora Formation at Pecinov quarry. The phosphate nodules and coprolites were in contact with seawater for an extended period of time to accommodate higher concentrations of REE, suggesting slow deposition. Further REE enrichment could have taken place later during reworking which allowed further mixing with seawater. The phosphate sponges with less REE were deposited in shallow marine environment and had less contact time with seawater prior to burial. The large REE enrichments, detected in the tubular phosphatic deposits, may be linked to a higher terrigenous input of REE-bearing minerals associated with the proximity to the continental source area during events of extreme sea level fall.

AB  - Multiple chemical constituents (nutrients; N, O, H, C stable isotopes; 64 organic wastewater compounds, 16 pharmaceutical compounds) and microbiological indicators were used to assess the impact on groundwater quality from the land application of approximately 9.5 million liters per day of treated municipal sewage effluent to a sprayfield in the 960-km(2) Ichetucknee Springs basin, northern Florida. Enriched stable isotope signatures (delta O-18 and delta H-2) were found in water from the effluent reservoir and a sprayfield monitoring well (MW-7) due to evaporation; however, groundwater samples downgradient from the sprayfield have delta O-18 and delta H-2 concentrations that represented recharge of meteoric water. Boron and chloride concentrations also were elevated in water from the sprayfield effluent reservoir and MW-7, but concentrations in groundwater decreased substantially with distance downgradient to background levels in the springs (about 12 km) and indicated at least a tenfold dilution factor. Nitrate-nitrogen isotope (delta N-15-NO3) values above 10 parts per thousand in most water samples were indicative of organic nitrogen sources except Blue Hole Spring (delta N-15-NO3 = 4.6-4.9 parts per thousand), which indicated an inorganic source of nitrogen (fertilizers). The detection of low concentrations the insect repellent N,N-diethyl-metatoluamide (DEET), and other organic compounds associated with domestic wastewater in Devil's Eye Spring indicated that leakage from a nearby septic tank drainfield likely has occurred. Elevated levels of fecal coliforms and enterococci were found in Blue Hole Spring during higher flow conditions, which likely resulted from hydraulic connections to upgradient sinkholes and are consistent with previoius dye-trace studies. Enteroviruses were not detected in the sprayfield effluent reservoir, but were found in low concentrations in water samples from a downgradient well and Blue Hole Spring during high-flow conditions indicating a human wastewater source. The Upper Floridan aquifer in the Ichetucknee Springs basin is highly vulnerable to contamination from multiple anthropogenic sources throughout the springs basin.

AB  - 1. Wetlands are threatened by desiccation, eutrophication and changing water quality, generally leading to greatly altered biogeochemical processes. Sulphate pollution can lead to severe eutrophication and sulphide toxicity, but may also interact with the availability of iron and other metals.
   2. In the present study, we examined the biogeochemical interactions between sulphate and iron availability, and their effects on aquatic macrophytes, in a field experiment with enclosures. The natural iron supply by groundwater was mimicked by adding iron to the sediment, and the effect of increased sulphate concentrations in the surface water was also studied. The enclosure experiment was performed in a mesotrophic, anaerobic ditch in a peat meadow reserve in the Netherlands. In all enclosures, three Stratiotes aloides plants were introduced to serve as indicator species.
   3. Addition of sulphate led to the mobilisation of phosphate, whereas addition of iron or both iron and sulphate did not affect P mobilisation. Growth of S. aloides was decreased by both iron addition and sulphate addition (sulphide toxicity). Addition of iron under sulphidic conditions, however, led to mutual detoxification of both toxicants (iron and sulphide) and did not decrease S. aloides growth. The uptake of metals was highest in the treatment involving sulphate addition, probably as a result of increased mineralisation of the peat soil.
   4. Growth of Elodea nuttallii, which grew naturally in the enclosures, was stimulated by iron or iron plus sulphate addition. It did not, however, grow in the enclosures with sulphate addition, as a result of sulphide toxicity or sulphide-induced iron deficiency. Under iron-rich conditions, E. nuttallii appeared to be a better competitor than S. aloides and depressed the growth of the latter species.
   5. We propose that the growth of S. aloides is directly regulated by interactions between sulphide and iron and indirectly by the effects of both compounds on the competitive strength of E. nuttallii. In general, we conclude that biogeochemical interactions between sulphate and iron can have a strong influence on plant species composition in freshwater wetlands, because of direct effects or changes in the competitive strength of plant species related to differential sensitivity to either iron or sulphide.

AB  - In the face of unprecedented biodiversity loss, the belief that conservation goals can be met could play an important role in ensuring they are fulfilled. We asked conservationists how optimistic they felt about key biodiversity outcomes over the next 10 years; 2341 people familiar with conservation in 144 countries responded. Respondents expressed optimism that enabling conditions for conservation would improve but felt pressures would continue, and the state of biodiversity was unlikely to get better. Respondents with greater general optimism about life, at early-career stages, and working in practice and policy (compared to academia) reported higher conservation optimism. But most of our biodiversity and conservation status indicators were not associated with conservation optimism. Unbounded optimism without appropriate action would be misguided in the face of growing threats to biodiversity. However, supporting those struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel could help sustain efforts to overcome these threats.

AB  - This paper investigates the conditions in which the development of new technologies induce structural change in the economy. A literature review reveals three factors that influence the industrial transformative capacity of a technology: context; complementarities; competition. We explore the dynamics of these factors, focusing on the extent and nature of induced activities in adjacent sectors. We apply this framework to study marine renewable energy technologies (MRET) in Portugal. Adjacent sector firms active in several MRET exhibited diversified activity, innovation and internal change. Comparing with Norway, where an offshore sector (oil & gas) supports the emergence of offshore wind, the absence of such sector in Portugal raises challenges but also creates opportunities for the transformation of several other sectors. We develop a new indicator to identify and compare the industrial transformative capacity of innovations. Finally, we discuss the extent to which context, complementarities and competition contribute to accelerate or hinder transformative change.

AB  - A first combined absolute gravity and GNSS network of 5 stations distributed between Lazio, Umbria and Abruzzo regions, was realized in 2018 in order to lay the basics for a multidisciplinary approach to natural risk assessment in the area of Central Italy, affected by the 2009 and 2016 seismic activity. Up to now, two absolute gravity campaigns were carried out using the transportable Micro-g LaCoste FG5#238 and the portable A10#39 absolute gravimeters. The locations of gravimetric sites have been chosen indoor to allow optimal condition of measure; therefore, the heights of the indoor sites have been determined by joining the outdoor GNSS with classical topographic surveys. The good results obtained after the campaigns and data processing lay the foundations for a new multidisciplinary approach to study also seismogenetic areas. In this paper, we present the gravity and GNSS station monographs, together with the absolute gravity values and the coordinates resulting from the first field surveys.

AB  - A comparison of micropaleontological data on the distribution of the Cycladophora davisiana radiolarian species in the surface sediment layer and the Late Quaternary sediments from the Subarctic Pacific and Far East marginal seas allowed conclusions concerning the possible conditions and occurrence of intermediate waters during the last glacial maximum. We used the modern data on the C. davisiana species, which is a micro-paleontological indicator of the cold oxygen-rich upper intermediate water mass, which is now forming only in the Sea of Okhotsk. The high amount of C. davisiana in sediments of the last glacial maximum may point to the possible formation and expansion of the ventilated intermediate water in the most part of the Subarctic paleo-Pacific: the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, within the NW Gyre, and in the Gulf of Alaska.

AB  - Meaningful public engagement is a challenging, but promising, feature of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) due to its potential for integrating sustainability principles into policies, plans and programs in developing countries such as Kenya. This research examined two selected SEA case studies to identify the extent of participation, learning outcomes attributable to participation, and if any learning outcomes led to social action for sustainability at the community level. Strengths across the two cases were the inclusion of marginalized populations and consideration of socio-economic concerns. Consistent weaknesses included inadequate notice, document inaccessibility, lack of feedback and communication, and late analysis of alternatives. Despite some learning conditions being unfulfilled, examples of instrumental, communicative, and transformative learning were identified through a focus group and semi-structured interviews with community participants and public officials. Some of these learning outcomes led to individual and social actions that contribute to sustainability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hydraulic instability caused by flow separation, vortex, second flow, and other unstable flow conditions leads to operational instability, consumption of additional energy, and pump damage. Evaluating the degree of hydraulic instability and addressing the problem at an early stage are highly important. This study focuses on developing a measurement and evaluation method for hydraulic instability by nonintrusive vibration techniques. At the onset of hydraulic instability, the spectral structure of the vibration signal significantly changes, especially for some broadband characteristics. Spectral entropy is regarded as an indicator of hydraulic instability and is capable of evaluating the spectral structure of the signal. The spectral entropy of vibration is efficient and reflects the development of cavitation. Moreover, the positive slope area in the head-flow characteristic indicates the emergence of hydraulic instability. The spectral entropy is highly suited for online tests because of its dimensionless nature, and as compared with the root mean square value, a common dimensionless parameter, spectral entropy can highly coincide with energy characteristic.

AB  - Corporate responsibility has many facets. A corporation should organize its operations so that its environmental impact is minimal, its economic state is viable, labor conditions are good, and compliance with laws and regulations is satisfactory, among others. Corporate responsibility is intimately connected to corporate sustainability which expresses the economic, environmental, and social standing of a company. A responsible corporation embraces the principle of transparency of data pertaining to its performance and its policies and strives for strategies that enhance its sustainability. A model is presented that uses hierarchical fuzzy reasoning to assess corporate sustainability, given a number of inputs, called basic indicators. Inputs are normalized according to their sustainability status and then combined to obtain a sustainability index on [0, 1] for each facet of the corporation. A sensitivity analysis pinpoints the most important indicators affecting sustainability. Two case studies of multinational cement companies are presented in detail.

AB  - A sophisticated downscaling procedure that was applied to reproduce high resolution historical records of the atmospheric conditions across the Mediterranean region is presented in this paper. This was accomplished by the dynamical downscaling of the European Center for Medium-Range Forecasts ERA-40 reanalyses with the aid of the atmospheric model of the POSEIDON weather forecasting system. The full three dimensional atmospheric fields with 6 hours of temporal resolution and the surface meteorological parameters at hourly intervals were produced for a 10-year period (1995-2004). The meteorological variables are readily available at 10 km resolution and may constitute the atmospheric forcing to drive wave, ocean hydrodynamic and hydrological models, as well as the baseline data for environmental impact assessment studies. A brief overview of the procedure and a quantitative estimation of the benefit of the new dynamical downscaling dataset is presented.

AB  - Efficient wastewater treatment requires monitoring of the biological activity of activated sludge. Its metabolic heat can be a critical indicator. Thus, a new method, measuring the temperature gradient between sludge sediment and the supernatant, is proposed for analyzing sludge. A prototype of the device was developed using an insulated cylinder with a series of thermistor sensors attached in parallel. Sedimentation of sludge in the lower part of the cylinder concentrated microorganisms, which produced more metabolic heat than the supernatant. The heat produced correlated well with the sludge concentration. The temperature profiles of each probe also enable real-time monitoring of sludge settling. Extended operation of the sensor evaluates the sludge quality, such as metabolic sustainability and the time required for the sludge to float under anaerobic conditions. A temperature-gradient sensor was implemented and its utility was confirmed by measuring the heat produced in sludge from a local wastewater plant. (C) 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Thousands of Late Carnian ( Late Triassic) charophyte gyrogonites belonging to four species [Stellatochara germanica KOZUR & REINHARDT, Stomochara starozhilovae (KISIELEVSKY), Stenochara kisielevskyi BILAN and Porochara triassica (SAIDAKOVSKY)] occur in the beds around the vertebrate-bearing level at Krasiejow, SW Poland. The abundant and well-preserved gyrogonites generally attest to fossilization in situ. Information about the habitat of recent charophytes is useful for reconstruction of their past environments. The factors limiting the habitat of modern charophytes suggests that these algae, and other micro- and macrofauna sedimented within the bone-bearing bed, lived in a shallow, freshwater environment ( probably lacustrine). Above the bone bed, there is a rapid drop in gyrogonite abundance. This could have been caused by changes in environmental conditions: increase in salinity, or increase in water energy. The preliminary mineralogical data suggest arid to semi-arid climate.

AB  - A sensitive ex vivo bioassay for detecting environmental estrogens and estrogen mimics was developed using Xenopus liver slice culture. Vitellogenin synthesis by these cultures was used as biomarker for estrogenic activity of environmental water samples. Sensitization of the assay for estrogens and mimics was accomplished by employing tissue from animals after in vivo preexposure to estrogen. Effects of various tissue culture factors were investigated in order to obtain optimum conditions for the bioassay. It was found that endogenous vitellogenin and/or estrogen could be "washed out" of cultures and that not only uncontaminated males but also estrogen-pretreated males and females can successfully be used as bioindicators. Estrogenicity was detected, using the ex vivo Xenopus liver slice culture assay, in sewage effluent, lake water, and dam water. This article presents an optimized protocol for effective estrogen detection in environmental water samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - Superficial or buried soils are important palaeostratigraphic indicators that have been poorly studied in the Basin of Mexico. This paper summarizes soil genesis and evolution based on the study of 15 soil profiles with palaeosol layers. An environmental morphogenetic and pedological sequence was established, based on granulometric, micromorphological, geochemical and field soil studies to identify the properties and characteristics of the pedogenetic environments in which they were formed. Results indicate two continuous and recurrent phenomena which altered the genesis of the soils, they are: (a) Torrential erosive processes under tectonic influences and arid conditions, and (b) Volcanic deposits that buried and fossilized soils. Both processes interrupt the evolution and sequence of soil profiles.
   Consequently, from the upper talus slopes to the lower portions stretching the length of the central lowest plains there are many palaeosoil discontinuities, that have not been considered into stratigraphic studies of the lacustrine plains. (C) 1997 INQUA/Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In bivalve hatcheries, microalgae production accounts for a large proportion of hatchery operation costs. A reliable supply of good quality algae is essential for optimal output. Two commercially important algal species, Tisochrysis lutea (T-Iso) and Chaetoceros calcitrans were grown in batch culture under optimal and high-pH conditions for 7 and 5 days respectively. A suite of parameters were compared to identify those that could be considered as early markers of algal stress. One day after inoculation of both algal species, carbon dioxide (CO2) addition was removed to cause the high pH treatment condition and cultures were monitored to determine any changes in algal health. A variety of indicators of algal function including photosynthetic parameters by Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) fluorometry and morphological and functional changes by flow cytometry were determined in parallel during the pH stress to correlate them and identify parameters that could be used as an early indicator of decreasing algal health. The pH in the sub-optimal treatments was significantly higher compared with controls from 1 day after the removal of CO2 addition. At the same sampling time (Day 2), in the high-pH treatment, the PRI photosynthetic efficiency in the light measured by PAM fluorometry and, chlorophyll fluorescence and reactive oxygen species production measured by flow cytometry were significantly lower for T-Iso, compared with controls. In sub-optimal cultures of C. calcitrans, relative algal size, complexity, chlorophyll and neutral lipid content (as measured by flow cytometry) were higher as early as Day 2, compared with controls. Additionally, the bacterial abundance associated with T-Iso and C. calcitrans cells was increased in the high pH treatment compared with controls, from Day 6 and Day 5 respectively. These responses to a subtle negative change in the culture environment were detected 24 h prior to a change in cell density and indicate the promise of PAM fluorometry and flow cytometry as tools to provide a rapid, sensitive and reliable assessment of microalgal health in a hatchery setting. Such advances in algal health monitoring will improve bivalve production systems.

AB  - The worst forest fire in South Korea occurred in April 2000 on the eastern coast. Forest recovery works were conducted until 2005, and the forest has been monitored since the fire. Remote sensing techniques have been used to detect the burned areas and to evaluate the recovery-time point of the post-fire processes during the past 18 years. We used three indices, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Gross Primary Production (GPP), to temporally monitor a burned area in terms of its moisture condition, vegetation biomass, and photosynthetic activity, respectively. The change of those three indices by forest recovery processes was relatively analyzed using an unburned reference area. The selected unburned area had similar characteristics to the burned area prior to the forest fire. The temporal patterns of NBR and NDVI, not only showed the forest recovery process as a result of forest management, but also statistically distinguished the recovery periods at the regions of low, moderate, and high fire severity. The NBR2.1 for all areas, calculated using 2.1 m wavelengths, reached the unburned state in 2008. The NDVI for areas with low and moderate fire severity levels became significantly equal to the unburned state in 2009 (p > 0.05), but areas with high severity levels did not reach the unburned state until 2017. This indicated that the surface and vegetation moisture conditions recovered to the unburned state about 8 years after the fire event, while vegetation biomass and health required a longer time to recover, particularly for high severity regions. In the case of GPP, it rapidly recovered after about 3 years. Then, the steady increase in GPP surpassed the GPP of the reference area in 2015 because of the rapid growth and high photosynthetic activity of young forests. Therefore, the concluding scientific message is that, because the recovery-time point for each component of the forest ecosystem is different, using only one satellite-based indicator will not be suitable to understand the post-fire recovery process. NBR, NDVI, and GPP can be combined. Further studies will require more approaches using various terms of indices.

AB  - Chickpea is the most important pulse crop globally after dry beans. Climate change and increased cropping intensity are forcing chickpea cultivation to relatively higher temperature environments. To assess the genetic variability and identify heat responsive traits, a set of 296 F8-9 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of the cross ICC 4567 (heat sensitive) x ICC 15614 (heat tolerant) was evaluated under field conditions at ICRISAT, Patancheru, India. The experiment was conducted in an alpha lattice design with three replications during the summer seasons of 2013 and 2014 (heat stress environments, average temperature 35 degrees C and above), and post-rainy season of 2013 (non-stress environment, max. temperature below 30 degrees C). A two-fold variation for number of filled pods (FPod), total number of seeds (TS), harvest index (HI), percent pod setting (%PodSet) and grain yield (GY) was observed in the RILs under stress environments compared to non-stress environment. A yield penalty ranging from 22.26% (summer 2013) to 33.30% (summer 2014) was recorded in stress environments. Seed mass measured as 100-seed weight (HSW) was the least affected (6 and 7% reduction) trait, while %PodSet was the most affected (45.86 and 44.31% reduction) trait by high temperatures. Mixed model analysis of variance revealed a high genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) (23.29-30.22%), phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) (25.69-32.44%) along with high heritability (80.89-86.89%) for FPod, TS, %PodSet and GY across the heat stress environments. Correlation studies (r = 0.61-0.97) and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a strong positive association among the traits GY, FPod, VS and %PodSet under stress environments. Path analysis results showed that TS was the major direct and FPod was the major indirect contributors to GY under heat stress environments. Therefore, the traits that are good indicators of high grain yield under heat stress can be used in indirect selection for developing heat tolerant chickpea cultivars. Moreover, the presence of large genetic variation for heat tolerance in the population may provide an opportunity to use the RILs in future-heat tolerance breeding programme in chickpea.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been advocated as the preferred measure of developmental instability and a reliable indicator of the quality of an animal (performance/fitness) and of its environment during its growing life. Empirical studies, however, are too scant or equivocal to consider this assumption adequately validated, which is partly due to the lack of a robust methodological framework for collecting and analyzing FA data. Therefore, we conducted an experiment in which 306 weaned rabbits were housed either in welfare-friendly pens (n = 6) or barren pens (n = 6). The size of both types of pen was similar (1.91 m(2)), but the welfare-friendly pens were equipped with suitable enrichment material (gnawing stick, elevated platform, and hiding box) and were stocked with one-half of the number of rabbits compared with the barren pens (17 vs. 34 rabbits per pen). Performance data (BW gain, ADFI, and G:F) were collected every 14 d. After slaughter (d 63 to 72), we measured twice the left- and right-hand side of 11 presumed bilateral traits on intact carcasses and 50 traits on fleshed bones. Using a stringent decision process, an optimal combination of morphological traits for estimating FA in fattening rabbits was determined. This combination consisted of five traits (fleshed bones) that showed no directional asymmetry or antisymmetry and showed a high level of FA relative to the measurement error; also, these traits were not correlated in their signed FA values. Measurements on intact carcasses seemed inappropriate for estimating FA. Using this robust FA measuring protocol, rabbits housed in the welfare-friendly pens were less asymmetric than were rabbits from the barren pens. Except for a greater daily BW gain in the welfare-friendly pens during the first 14 d after weaning, there were no effects of housing conditions on performance traits. The FA was negatively correlated with BW gain in rabbits from the barren pens, whereas in the welfare-friendly pens, there was no correlation. These results support the application of FA as an indicator of animal welfare and performance; however, FA seems to be a more reliable estimator of the underlying developmental instability when living conditions are suboptimal.

AB  - The extractable organic matter of organic-rich black shales and associated organic-poor bioturbated green/gray shales of the Illinois and Michigan Basins of North America is analyzed to constrain the water column structure during their deposition. All black shale samples contain derivatives of the biomarker isorenieratene, a diaromatic carotenoid pigment produced exclusively by the brown strain of the green sulfur bacteria Chlorobiaceae. Chlorobiaceae are phototrophic organisms requiring euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) conditions to survive, and the presence of isorenieratene derivatives indicates that the Middle Devonian-Early Mississippian epeiric seas of North America experienced bottom water euxinic conditions during black shale deposition.
   Analysis of green/gray shales also reveals the presence of isorenieratene derivatives, and in some cases isorenieratane. The highly bioturbated fabric of these sediments indicates the presence of oxygen in bottom waters during their deposition. Thus, we suggest that short-term shoaling of the oxycline across the basin slope may have occurred during their deposition, though they were deposited predominantly under an oxygenated water column (i.e. above the chemocline). Most green/gray shales contain three pseudohomologous series of branched alkanes with quaternary substituted carbon atoms (BAQCs), which are absent in black shale samples. Recent studies suggest that BAQCs are produced by benthic chemoautotrophs dwelling at the redox boundary separating anoxic sediments from moderately oxygenated waters.
   Comparison of the biomarker content (i.e. regular isoprenoid, BAQCs) between black and green/gray shales indicates different sources of organic matter, and suggests that phytoplanktonic productivity in the upper water column was enhanced during black shale deposition.
   The results of this study indicate that the alternation of green/gray and black shales in these basins results from the vertical fluctuations of the chemocline. These fluctuations seem to be driven by changes in phytoplanktonic productivity. Our data, when associated to previous studies of other black shales from Canada and Europe confirm that photic zone euxinia was a widespread feature of low-latitude epeiric seas during the Middle Devonian-Lower Mississippian.

AB  - The experience of using a telemedicine feasibility study to integrate respiratory health response and environmental stimuli information is presented. The effects of ambient air quality, pollen and local environment conditions on asthmatic patients' lung function were investigated through the use of a novel European health telematic system. The Medical Diagnosis, Communication and Analysis Throughout Europe (MEDICATE) project developed and tested the feasibility of using a telemedicine system for chronic asthmatics in London, UK, and Barcelona, Spain. The key to this was the determination of the real time health (lung function) response to the ambient environment and allergens. Air quality, pollen and environmental lifestyle information were related to respiratory measurements for recruited asthmatic patients in the study through the design of a dedicated environmental management system (EMS) database. In total, 28 patients completed the study trial, subject to ambulatory monitoring of spirometric lung function (PEF, FEV1 and FVC) up to four times a day over a 2-week period recorded during the year 2000. Alongside this, ambient air quality and pollen counts were used to represent local exposure to potential environmental stimuli. Personal questionnaire interviewing collected additional data about patient lifestyles, social-economic conditions and quality of life perceptions.
   The methods and indicative results of integrating environmental and health data in this respect are examined. Assessment tools such as GIS and object-orientated databases were designed to locate and compile environmental information about the patients' locations and lifestyles in the study areas (London and Barcelona). Socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, such as exposure to smoking, pets, personal journey lengths and modes, income, household occupancy and domestic fuel use, were found to have limited detectable effects on the patients' basic lung function levels. Patients' gender, age and predicted PEFR were significantly associated with the 2-week mean and minimum respiratory measurements. Lung function data were compared with air quality and pollen indicators to examine relationships on a daily or tagged-day basis controlling for confounding factors. The paper discusses the new methodology and the practicalities of using the telemedical system as a tool for assessing the impacts of environmental stimuli on respiratory health.

AB  - Bi-directional differences in social communication and behavior can contribute to poor interactions between autistic and non-autistic (NA) people, which in turn may reduce social opportunities for autistic adults and contribute to poor outcomes. Historically, interventions to improve social interaction in autism have focused on altering the behaviors of autistic people and have ignored the role of NA people. Recent efforts to improve autism understanding among NA adults via training have resulted in more favorable views toward autistic people, yet it remains unknown whether these benefits extend to real-world interactions between autistic and NA people. The current study explores whether a brief autism acceptance training (AAT) program can improve social interactions between autistic and NA adults. Thirty-nine NA males were randomly assigned to complete AAT or a no-training control condition, then participated in a 5-min unstructured conversation with an unfamiliar autistic male (n = 39). Following the conversation, participants rated their perceptions of interaction quality, first impressions of their partner, and their interest in future interactions with their partner. In dyads where the NA individual completed AAT, both the autistic and NA person endorsed greater future interest in hanging out with their partner relative to dyads in which the NA adult did not complete AAT. However, other social interaction outcomes, including ratings of interaction quality and first impressions of autistic partners, largely did not differ between training and no-training conditions, and assessments of the interaction were largely unrelated for autistic and NA partners within dyads. Results also indicated that NA participants, but not autistic participants, demonstrated substantial correspondence between evaluations of their partner and the interaction, suggesting that autistic adults may place less weight on trait judgments when assessing the quality of an interaction. These findings suggest that the brief AAT for NA adults used in this study may increase mutual social interest in real-world interactions between NA and autistic adults, but more systematic changes are likely needed to bridge divides between these individuals. Future work with larger, more diverse samples is recommended to further explore whether interventions targeting NA adults are beneficial for improving autistic experiences within NA social environments.</p>

AB  - Understanding the air temperature distribution, ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in poultry housing systems are crucial to poultry health, welfare, and productivity. In this study, 4 Intelligent Portable Monitoring Units and 7 temperature sensors were installed inside and between the cages and above 2 minimum ventilation fans of a commercial stacked-deck cage laying hen house in the Midwest United States (425,000 laying hens) to continuously monitor the interior environment over a 6-month period. During cold conditions (March 12th-May 22nd), there was a variation noted, with barn center temperatures consistently being highest in the longitudinal and lateral direction (P < 0.001) and the top floor deck warmer than the bottom floor (P < 0.05). During hotter conditions (May 23rd-July 26th), the interior thermal environment was more uniform than during the winter, resulting in a difference only in the longitudinal direction. The daily CO2 and NH3 concentrations were 400 to 4,981 ppm and 0 to 42.3 ppm among the 4 sampling locations, respectively. Both CO2 and NH3 decreased linearly with increasing outside temperatures. The mean NH3 and CO2 concentrations varied with sampling locations and with the outside temperatures (P < 0.001). For CO2, the minimum ventilation sidewall had lower values than those measured in the barn's center (P < 0.05) during cold weather, while the barn center and the manure room sidewall consistently measured the highest concentrations during warmer weather (P < 0.05). For NH3, the tunnel ventilation inlet end consistently had the lowest daily concentrations, whereas the in-cage and manure drying tunnel sidewall locations measured the highest concentrations (P < 0.001). Higher NH3 and CO2 concentrations were recorded within the cage than in the cage aisle (P < 0.05). The highest NH3 concentration of 42 ppm was recorded above the minimum exhaust fan adjacent to the manure drying tunnel, which indicated that higher pressure (back pressure) in the manure drying tunnel allowed air leakage back into the production area through nonoperating sidewall fan shutters.

AB  - Soil moisture is considered to be a key variable to assess crop and drought conditions. However, readily available soil moisture datasets developed for monitoring agricultural drought conditions are uncommon. The aim of this work is to examine two global soil moisture datasets and a set of soil moisture web-based processing tools developed to demonstrate the value of the soil moisture data for drought monitoring and crop forecasting using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The two global soil moisture datasets discussed in the paper are generated by integrating the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions' satellite-derived observations into a modified two-layer Palmer model using a one-dimensional (1D) ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation approach. The web-based tools are designed to explore soil moisture variability as a function of land cover change and to easily estimate drought characteristics such as drought duration and intensity using soil moisture anomalies and to intercompare them against alternative drought indicators. To demonstrate the utility of these tools for agricultural drought monitoring, the soil moisture products and vegetation- and precipitation-based products were assessed over drought-prone regions in South Africa and Ethiopia. Overall, the 3-month scale Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed higher agreement with the root zone soil moisture anomalies. Soil moisture anomalies exhibited lower drought duration, but higher intensity compared with SPIs. Inclusion of the global soil moisture data into the GEE data catalog and the development of the web-based tools described in the paper enable a vast diversity of users to quickly and easily assess the impact of drought and improve planning related to drought risk assessment and early warning. The GEE also improves the accessibility and usability of the earth observation data and related tools by making them available to a wide range of researchers and the public. In particular, the cloud-based nature of the GEE is useful for providing access to the soil moisture data and scripts to users in developing countries that lack adequate observational soil moisture data or the necessary computational resources required to develop them.

AB  - The phenomena of a balanced development of innovation and investment spheres are not immanent for it, as well as the factors of imbalance are the consequence of subjective reasons, the result of specific objective circumstances of the situation, including those on the global economic scale. It is well-known that the main reasons causing imbalances are subjective factors, including the violation of the principles of scientifically based planning, the implementation of the concepts of economic development with unjustified priorities toward individual industries, regions, and complexes, as well as deviations from the planned targets during their implementation and inadequate efficiency in eliminating emerging disproportions.
   Integrated innovation and investment policies and planning of their implementation are at the center of ensuring balanced innovation and investment activities, which contributes to improving changes through the development of integrated actions in order to achieve certain goals. It is advisable to recognize the process of planning a balanced development of integrated innovation and investment activities in the current environment as an extremely necessary measure, primarily aimed at selecting innovative projects for financing purposes and creating innovative products through providing investments in obtaining the expected results. Applying effective methods (program-target, adaptive) in practice, one can determine in advance the development of problem situations, shorten the period of implementing an investment project, and monitor its status and stages.
   To ensure the balance of innovation and investment processes, it is important to follow the principles of planning a balanced development of economic systems: scientific validity, harmonization and coordination, continuity and effective priority. Planning for a balanced development of innovative and investment spheres of economic systems presupposes the establishment of appropriate conditions, including the following: (a) agreed goals on the development of innovative and investment activities of economic systems at macro-, meso-, and micro levels; (b) balanced dynamics of their development indicators for all components; (c) the presence of a mechanism for a balanced development of innovation and investment activities, when both planned and factual information are integrated and pass through a certain algorithm of actions to ensure a balanced innovation and investment development of economic systems.

AB  - The notion that oxidative stress plays a role in virtually every human disease and environmental exposure has become ingrained in everyday knowledge. However, mounting evidence regarding the lack of specificity of biomarkers traditionally used as indicators of oxidative stress in human disease and exposures now necessitates re-evaluation. To prioritize these re-evaluations, published literature was comprehensively analyzed in a meta-analysis to quantitatively classify the levels of systemic oxidative damage across human disease and in response to environmental exposures.
   In this meta-analysis, the F-2-isoprostane, 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha), was specifically chosen as the representative marker of oxidative damage. To combine published values across measurement methods and specimens, the standardized mean differences (Hedges' g) in 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) levels between affected and control populations were calculated.
   The meta-analysis resulted in a classification of oxidative damage levels as measured by 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) across 50 human health outcomes and exposures from 242 distinct publications. Relatively small increases in 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) levels (g < 0.8) were found in the following conditions: hypertension (g = 0.4), metabolic syndrome (g = 0.5), asthma (g = 0.4), and tobacco smoking (g = 0.7). In contrast, large increases in 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) levels were observed in pathologies of the kidney, e.g., chronic renal insufficiency (g = 1.9), obstructive sleep apnoea (g = 1.1), and pre-eclampsia (g = 1.1), as well as respiratory tract disorders, e. g., cystic fibrosis (g = 2.3).
   In conclusion, we have established a quantitative classification for the level of 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) generation in different human pathologies and exposures based on a comprehensive meta-analysis of published data. This analysis provides knowledge on the true involvement of oxidative damage across human health outcomes as well as utilizes past research to prioritize those conditions requiring further scrutiny on the mechanisms of biomarker generation.

AB  - Benthic marine dioflagellate microalgae belonging to the genus Prorocentrum are a major source of okadaic acid (OA), OA analogues and polyketides. However, dinoflagellates produce these valuable toxins and bioactives in tiny quantities, and they grow slowly compared to other commercially used microalgae. This hinders evaluation in possible large-scale applications. The careful selection of producer species is therefore crucial for success in a hypothetical scale-up of culture, as are appropriate environmental conditions for optimal growth. A clone of the marine toxic dinoflagellate P. belizeanum was studied in vitro to evaluate its capacities to grow and produce OA as an indicator of general polyketide toxin production under the simultaneous influence of temperature (T) and irradiance (I-0). Three temperatures and four irradiance levels were tested (18, 25 and 28 degrees C; 20, 40, 80 and 120 mu E.m(-2).s(-1)), and the response variables measured were concentration of cells, maximum photochemical yield of photosystem II (PSII), pigments and OA. Experiments were conducted in T-flasks, since their parallelepipedal geometry proved ideal to ensure optically thin cultures, which are essential for reliable modeling of growth-irradiance curves. The net maximum specific growth rate (mu(m)) was 0.204 day(-1) at 25 degrees C and 40 mu E.m(-2).s(-1). Photo-inhibition was observed at I-0 > 40 mu Em(-2)s(-1), leading to culture death at 120 mu E.m(-2).s(-1) and 28 degrees C. Cells at I-0 >= 80 mu E.m(-2).s(-1) were photoinhibited irrespective of the temperature assayed. A mechanistic model for mu(m)-I-0 curves and another empirical model for relating mu(m)-T satisfactorily interpreted the growth kinetics obtained. ANOVA for responses of PSII maximum photochemical yield and pigment profile has demonstrated that P. belizeanum is extremely light sensitive. The pool of photoprotective pigments (diadinoxanthin and dinoxanthin) and peridinin was not able to regulate the excessive light-absorption at high I-0-T. OA synthesis in cells was decoupled from optimal growth conditions, as OA overproduction was observed at high temperatures and when both temperature and irradiance were low. T-flask culture observations were consistent with preliminary assays outdoors.

AB  - This paper addresses the application and potential of LCSA in the built environment with a focus on refurbishments of residential buildings. It specifically addresses the phenomenon of interchange of building technologies efficiencies under different life time assessments from economy, ecology and social fields. An approach of optimization rather than hard target numbers is proposed as win-win-win situations are unlikely.
   A multidimensional Pareto optimization methodology, using LCC, LCA combined with first stages of a social assessment in a feasibility study but potentially later full SLCA, is proposed, which site-specifically visualizes the interchange between different options in building design or modification, and evaluates optimal overall concepts. LCA and LCC are used to analyze a case study from an EU project named BEEM-UP in which solutions for large-scale uptake of refurbishment strategies are developed. Social frame conditions are taken into account by identifying the driving technologies and feeding the consequences of their implementation for the residents into the tenant involvement part of the project.
   The calculations prove that the general assumptions leading to the methodology hold true at least for this case study. A clear Pareto-optimal curve is visible when assessing LCC and LCA. The example buildings results show certain systems to be dominating clusters on the figures while others clearly can be identified as not relevant. Several of the driving technologies however fail to be applicable because of social frame conditions, e.g., clear requests by the tenants. Based on the conclusions, the potential for including SLCA as a third dimension in the methodology and possible visualization options are discussed.
   The development in the field of social indicators in the building sector has to be strengthened in order to come up with a holistic picture and respectively with appropriate responses to current challenges. While some solutions identified in the LCC/LCA assessment also have good social characteristics, several others have not and solutions identified as lacking might have social advantages that are currently left out of consideration The upcoming Standards EN 15643-5 and ISO 15686-x are a promising step in this direction as is the work to create a conceptual framework for impact assessment within SLCA by the scientific community.

AB  - The potential of herbal extracts containing bioactive compounds to strengthen immunity could contribute to reducing antimicrobial use in poultry. This study aimed at developing a reliable and robust methodological pipeline to assess the ability of herbal extracts to strengthen chicken innate defenses, especially concerning inflammation and oxidative stress. This methodology was applied to Melissa officinalis L. (MEL) extract, recognized for its biological activities including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Different methods were used to (1). guarantee the quality of MEL extract and its capacity to stimulate the innate immune system; (2). evaluate the relevance of an ex vivo model to mimic inflammatory and oxidative stress challenges to replace LPS injection in chickens; (3). analyse the effects of feed supplemented with MEL extract on inflammation and oxidative stress induced ex vivo; (4). assess the effects of MEL extract on the redox balance, health, welfare and performance in broilers exposed to suboptimal starting conditions through a large-scale approach. The quality of MEL extract preparations, through phytochemical quantification of rosmarinic acid (RA), revealed varying concentrations of RA in the different MEL extracts. RA concentrations remained stable for at least 9 months and in feed three months after incorporating MEL extract. When incubated with chicken cell lines MEL extract showed potential metabolic activation and ability to stimulate immune functions but induced cytotoxicity at high concentrations. The original ex vivo model of inflammation developed on chicken blood cells enabled inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers to be expressed and revealed antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of blood cells from chickens fed MEL extract. The experimental model of chicken suboptimal starting conditions validated beneficial effects of MEL extract on the redox balance and also evidenced improved performance during the growth phase, a tendency for fewer muscle defects but a higher severity of pododermatitis lesions without affecting other welfare indicators. This study grouped methods and tools that could be combined according to the plant extract, the needs of professionals working in poultry production systems and staff responsible for animal health, welfare and feeding.

AB  - Feeding is a key factor in the growth performance of rainbow trout farming, its sustainable production and profitability. However, supplying the daily ration in trout farming in flow-through system without any control is an inconceivable practice both economically and environmentally. In this study, the effect of different feeding regimes has been evaluated to optimize growth performance minimizing the feed wastage for simulating realistic intensive culture conditions (daily ration and feeding frequency per day depending on temperature and stocking density). Growth patterns of the reared fish in terms of average daily gain (ADG) and specific growth rate (SGR%) at two feeding schedules (FS-I & FS-II) and three stocking densities (Sd1, Sd2, Sd3) showed that the best performance was at Sd2 (R2 = 0.869) at FS-I and it was highly significant (P < 0.01). Regression coefficients (R2) of length-weight relationship in different seasons and stocking densities explained proper fit of the growth as per condition factor (K) and it was high (0.994 and 0.886) during monsoon and autumn respectively in FS-I showing more than 56% variability. Based on profitability analysis, and feed consumption efficiency (FCE) related growth performance, the size and temperature dependent feeding rate was determined to construe a new rate of feeding during different months of the year. The economic implications of the experimental feeding regimes were also assessed. Both the feeding regime FS-I & FS-II supported the extent of growth performance however, better performance in terms of ADG and SGR was observed in FS-I as compared to FS-II at the end of the trial. The results demonstrated a lower competition for feed since instant feed availability was higher at Sd2 and reared at FS-I. It is concluded that controlling the feeding process is essential to reduce wastage and increase profitability, which has been achieved by the monitoring process of environmental indicators and suitable feed management. Our findings suggest a new improved feeding schedule which has significant effects on feed intake and growth performance of rainbow trout besides containing the impacts of environmental indicators and eliciting costeffective productions.

AB  - Weber's law is among the basic psychophysical laws of human perception. It determines that human sensitivity to change along a physical dimension, the just noticeable difference (JND), is linearly related to stimulus intensity. Conversely, in direct (natural), visually guided grasping, Weber's law is violated and the JND does not depend on stimulus intensity. The current work examines adherence to Weber's law in telerobotic grasping. In direct grasping, perception and action are synchronized during task performance. Conversely, in telerobotic control, there is an inherent spatial and temporal separation between perception and action. The understanding of perception-action association in such conditions may facilitate development of objective measures for telerobotic systems and contribute to improved interface design. Moreover, telerobotic systems offer a unique platform for examining underlying causes for the violation of Weber's law during direct grasping. We examined whether, like direct grasping, telerobotic grasping with transmission delays violates Weber's law. To this end, we examined perceptual assessment, grasp control, and grasp demonstration, using a telerobotic system with time delays in two spatial orientations: alongside and facing the robot. The examination framework was adapted to telerobotics from the framework used for examining Weber's law in direct grasping. The variability of final grip apertures (FGAs) in perceptual assessment increased with object size in adherence with Weber's law. Similarly, the variability of maximal grip apertures in grasp demonstration approached significance in adherence with Weber's law. In grasp control, the variability of maximal grip apertures did not increase with object size, which seems to violate Weber's law. However, unlike in direct grasping, motion trajectories were prolonged and fragmented, and included an atypical waiting period prior to finger closure. Therefore, in this condition, maximal grip aperture was an inappropriate indicator of JND. Instead, we calculated the aperture at the end of the opening phase, the initial grip aperture (IGA), and the FGA at the beginning of the waiting period, as more appropriate indicators for the JNDs. The IGAs adhered to Weber's law. The FGAs approached significance in the same direction. This suggests that perception-action association during telerobotic grasping with transmission delays significantly diverges from direct grasping.

AB  - Microbiological composition of air is, with other microclimate factors, indicator of ambient circumstances in rearing unit and factor that influences health and welfare of animals. Because of that object of research was to determine in what amount density of population, with adequate accommodation of piglets, impacts the numbers and type of microorganisms in the air. The research was conducted in contemporary rearing units with several divided areas for three production cycles. Part of rearing unit in which experiment took place was 182 m(2) in size and furnished with total of 16 boxes dimensions of 3 x 2,75 in and 3, 3 x 3 m. In production, cycles that lasted for 45 days there was accommodated 416, 325 and 320 piglets. During each cycle in same week intervals sampling was performed 15 times with SAS 100(TM) (PBI International, Italy) machine including microclimate control of air with Testo and Drager equipment. Air was sampled on to substrate for isolation of mesofile, hemolytic and coliforme bacteria and fungi. After that with standard procedures their number and identification was determined. According to obtained results, number of mesofile bacteria was from 2, 9 x 10(4) to 3,75 x 10(4), number of hemolytic bacteria as 3, 4 x 10(3) to 4,4 x 10(3), number of coliforme bacteria was 5, 88 x 10(2) to 6,95 x 10(2) and number of fungus 4,4 x 10(3) to 5, 58 x 10(3) CFU/m(3) of air. Most common identified microorganisms were gram-positive bacteria, and then gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Except that, statistically significant decrease of all microorganisms was determined in correlation with decreasing the number of piglets per cycle, and the numbers were proportional. With that, we can conclude that with contemporary conditions of accommodation with automatic system for regulation of microclimate conditions in rearing unit we should expect favorable microbiological composition of air, which values depend on density of population with adherence to allowed number of animals per unit of space.

AB  - The Teotihuacan Valley, Mexico has been the object of considerable interest because of its importance in the context of human history in America. Although, archeological research has been extensively conducted to understand causes of the decline of Teotihuacan culture, no sufficient scientific evidence has been provided. This paper is focused on paleopedological evidence, especially properties that constitute "soil memory," in order to reconstruct the spatial distribution of environment variability during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. Three profiles that include modern soils and buried paleosols were studied in different geomorphic positions: uplands (Cerro Gordo site, CG), lower talus slope/transition to valley bottom (Maseca, MA), and the mouth of the Valley, at the ancient border of the former Texcoco lake. This last site is near Tepexpan (TE) where some of the oldest human remains in Mexico were recovered. The oldest palcosol is at CG at 3000 m a.s.l. It is dated at 22,000 yr BP and exhibits a truncated profile with a very well developed Bt horizon, dominated by kaolinite, with phytoliths of C3 plants. All of its features are related to a humid, probably warm environment. It was classified as a Luvisol. This paleosol is buried by another Luvisol, dated at 13,000 yr BP, with morphological characteristics similar to the previous soil, although clay mineralogy consists mostly of halloysite and a higher percentage of C4-plant phytoliths is apparent. In MA the oldest paleosol was not recognized. It is probable that the two paleosols found in CG merge into one at MA, which shows strong redoximorphic features, but high percentages of C4-plant phytoliths and halloysitic clays. At the TE site paleosols are less developed Fluvisols. Modern soil cover also varies in relation to its geomorphic position. In CG it is a Phaeozem, while in MA and TE present day soils have carbonate accumulation. We interpret prevailing conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum in the Teotihuacan valley to be humid, with a tendency towards drying at the end of Pleistocene. Dry conditions prevail in the valley today. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - We tested a working hypothesis that stress genes and anti-oxidant enzyme machinery are induced by the organophosphate compound dichlorvos in a non-target organism. Third instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster transgenic for hsp70 were exposed to 0. 1 to 100.0 ppb dichlorvos and 5.0 MM CUSO4 (an inducer of oxidative stress and stress genes) and hsp70, and activities of acetylcholinesterase (AchE), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) product were measured. The study was further extended to examine tissue damage, if any, under such conditions. A concentration- and time-dependent increase in hsp70 and antioxidant enzymes was observed in the exposed organism as compared to control. A comparison of stress gene expression with SOD, CAT activities and LPO product under similar experimental conditions revealed that induction of hsp70 precedes the anti-oxidant enzyme activities in the exposed organism. Further, concomitant with a significant inhibition of AChE activity, significant induction of hsp70 was observed following chemical exposure. Mild tissue damage was observed in the larvae exposed to 10.0 ppb dichlorvos for 48 It when hsp70 expression reaches plateau. Dichlorvos at 0.1 ppb dietary concentration did not evoke significant hsp70 expression, anti-oxidant enzymes and LPO and AchE inhibition in the exposed organism, and thereby, was found to be non-hazardous to D. melanogaster. Conversely, 1.0 ppb of the test chemical stimulated a significant induction of hsp70 and anti-oxidant enzymes and significant inhibition of AchE; hence this concentration of test chemical was hazardous to the organism. The present study suggests that (a) both stress genes and anti-oxidant enzymes are stimulated as indices of cellular defense against xenobiotic hazard in D. melanogaster with hsp70 being proposed as first-tier bio-indicator of cellular hazard, (b) 0.1 ppb of the test chemical may be regarded as No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL), and 1.0 ppb dichlorvos as Low Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL).

AB  - Three rearing methods were used to select the most suitable for biological studies of Heteropsylla cubana. The treatments were: crystal cylinders, test tubes and Petri dishes. Thirty experimental units per treatment with two repetitions in time were selected according to a random block design. Each rearing unit contained one plantlet of L. leucocephala and a couple of H. cubana, previously selected and sexed. The observation was daily until obtaining the last offspring in the adult stage. The efficiency of each method was evaluated by a multiple proportion comparison analysis, considering the following biological indicators of the insect: longevity. oviposition, fecundity, and viability of the eggs. The methods were compared and validated. through the demographic parameters: r(m), lambda and R-o. The rearing in Petri dishes and test tubes had the highest increases (P < 0.001) in eggs (25 and 13) and nymphs (16 and 8,. respectively), compared to that established, in crystal cylinders, which was the most unfavorable (P < 0.001) for the development and survival of the insect (3 eggs and 6 nymphs). The test tubes and the Petri dishes propitiated more longevity for both sexes, which favored oviposition. However, in the Petri dishes, the laying of eggs was increased (P < 0.001) (57 %), differing from the rest of the treatments (32 % in test tubes and 11 % in crystal cylinders). The values of the percentage of increase (2001.66) and the multiplication rate (20.01) ratified the dishes as the best method for the psyllid rearing, as well as the values of r(m), lambda and R-o (0.21, 1.54 and 46.27, respectively). It is concluded that the method of rearing H. cubana in Petri dishes was the most adequate for carrying out biological studies and establishing methodological basis to obtain the massive offspring. Besides, it is possible to define the performance of H. cubana and get closer to forecast and, manage this insect in Cuban conditions through the knowledge of the population indices. This method is recommended for the study of the biology of this insect in laboratory conditions, considering as methodological base the manipulation of H. cubana populations starting from the fourth day of copula. This favors the later arrival of adults.

AB  - Background and purpose: The problem of acute oxygen deficiency in benthic communities is well reported but the majority of studies have been focused on the effect of macrobenthic component. Scarcely examined meiofauna response mainly resulted in negative findings The present study was designed to examine suitability of using the meiobenthic component in oxygen defficiency monitoring. It provides comparative data from nine northern Adriatic stations distinguished by different level of oxygen deficiency its aim was to ascertain the presence, level, and pattern of oxygen deficiency effect on density and distribution of sediment-living meiofauna.
   Material and methods: Sediment samples were collected by SCUBA divers using plastic hand corers with an inner diameter of 3.5 cm. The material was treated according to standard laboratory procedure including fixation, elutration, sieving (100 and 50 mu m mesh size), counting, and classification of the main meiofaunal taxa under a dissecting microscope. The raw data (means of three replicate per sample) were subjected to statistical analyses.
   Results and conclusion: The effect of acute oxygen deficiency on density and distribution of meiofauna was clear and well-defined, Meiobenthic response was quantitative, taxon specific, and similar to a response typically occurring in chronically affected ecosystems (e.g. the Baltic Sea, Black Sea). It was found that the intensity of stress response depended on the level of oxygen deficiency; and the time span of stress conditions. In hypoxic area with higher O-2 saturation rate (>20%) no signs of disturbance on meiofauna community appeared. In parts of the hypoxic area with lower O-2 saturation rate (< 20%) reduced density values indica ting moderately affected meiofauna assemblages were recorded. In area under anoxic stress the meiofaunal response resulted in: significant decrease in Nematoda, Copepoda, and total meiofauna density, substantial increase in the Ne/Co ratio, and percentage participation of nematodes in the community composition. According to the results of the present study meiobenthic assemblages could be successfully used in detection and quantification of the stress induced by oxygen depletion. In distinction from the monitoring of organic pollution, the high Ne/Co ratio seems to be a useful indicator of anoxic stress conditions.

AB  - As per Census of India 2011, the Mumbai urban agglomeration forms a major urban magnet for migrant construction workers. The construction sector comprises principally informal workers whose conditions of work are mainly regulated by three laws, viz. the Interstate Migrant Workmen Act, 1979, the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996, and the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970. Analysis suggests that these laws do not take into account the nature of informality in the sector. In addition to this, the amalgamation of these labour laws, with several others, into four labour codes further adds to the vulnerabilities of interstate migrant workers by not considering how vulnerabilities of migrant workers vary according to their sector and place of work. This paper explores the status of employers with respect to growing informalisation of workforce in the construction industry by taking a case study approach of an organised construction site at Thane, Maharashtra. Ninety-three per cent of the workers at the construction site were migrants, mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Seventy-two per cent of the workers at the construction site responded that they got their wages from contractors, and in close to fifty-eight per cent of the cases, the contractor was the figure which helped them find work in the site. To understand the role of contractors better, the authors also conducted semi-structured interviews with fifteen contractors and three labour in-charges from the Thane construction site, during April and May 2020. Through these interviews, the authors found that the management sidestepped their responsibility of the workers by specifying that the contractor is the employer of the workers, while the contractors argued that they are the "recruiters" and not the employers. The paper thus tries to understand the term "employer" by comparing the definition of the employers in the three labour laws with our findings from surveys. Are there any potential areas of conflicts between the definitions? How does it get translated in the lives of workers, especially migrant workers? Do informal networks among migrant workers contribute in formulating the perception of the contractor as an employer? We do this by building up on fieldwork evidence of informality on large organised construction sites.

AB  - Insect distribution is influenced by topographic relief substrate structure and wind and is particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature, environmental chemical composition and water availability. These characteristics of insects make them bioindicators of paleoecological changes. The objective of this work is to register and describe fossils of insects collected in the laminated carbonate layers of the Crato Member of the Santana Formation, Araripe Basin, and to relate them to the paleoenvironment. This unit was formed in the post-rift basin stage that corresponds to the Aptiana / Albiana sequence (similar to 123 to 100 Ma.). This interval was influenced by the climatic conditions prevailing during the Cretaceous, of global warming, with average global temperatures higher than the current ones. The fossils were collected in limestone quarries in Nova Olinda, Ceara, authorized by DNPM through Process 001.433 / 2015. 46 individuals were identified among nymphs and imagos: Ephemeroptera (1 individual), Blattodea (8 individuals), Odonata (3 individuals), Hemiptera (2 individuals), Lepidoptera (5 individuals), Orthoptera (12 individuals), Diptera (4 individuals) , Neuroptera (1 individual), Dermaptera (1 individual), Hemiptera (3 individuals), Homoptera (1 individual), Hymenoptera (1 individual) and four individuals were classified as immature. The immature have their growth carried out by means of skin seedlings and, thus, in an external examination of description, it is not clear what their stage of growth is. The most represented insects belonged to the Orthoptera group and had morphological variability in relation to the length of the body and appendages, characteristics that may suggest preferences of these animals for specific niches. The identification of these orthopterans became clear due to the presence of dilated rear femurs containing large muscles used for jumping. Individuals of the order Blattodea also had typical characteristics, such as legs with spines and long antennae, facilitating their identification. The preservation of these insect fossils with intact microscopic structures indicates deposition in a shallow lake or lagoon environment with little sediment input and no transport. These environments would be lakes or coastal lagoons subject to constant changes in salinity due to the connection with the sea. The stress conditions favored the development of microbial mats responsible for the precipitation of the micritic carbonates that helped in the exceptional preservation of these insect fossils.

AB  - Elevation in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and temperature coupled with moisture stress is anticipated by most of the climate change prediction models (IPCC, 2014). Climate change results in atmospheric warming that trigger water stress to rice and could influence soil health, functioning and biological activities. Therefore, it is required to quantify indicative parameters like soil-exopolysaccharides which indicates greater water holding capacity of soil and imparted drought tolerance to rice. Carbon pools and related soil enzymes are also indicative of soil health status. We designed one field study in open top chambers (OTCs) to assess the impact of elevated CO2, temperature and deficit moisture stress on rice. There were two replicated CO2 enrichment treatment in OTCs, namely, ambient CO2 (394 +/- 20 ppm and ambient temperature; a-CO2) and elevated CO2 (550 +/- 20 ppm) with temperature (2 degrees C +/- 0.3 more than ambient; e-CO2T). Three aerobic rice (grown in saturated soil moisture condition) cultivars (CR-143-2-2, APO and CR Dhan 201) were grown in separate blocks in each OTCs with adequate nutrient level and water stress (-40 kPa). Total soil and colloidal exopolysaccharides (EPSs), soil labile carbon (C) pools, soil enzymes (dehydrogenase, Fluorescein diacetate and beta-glucosidase) and plant enzymes (catalase, peroxidase and super oxide dismutase) were measured as indicators of the soil health, functioning and intrinsic drought tolerance to the system. Total soil EPS (29%), colloidal EPS (37%), microbial biomass C (30%), readily mineralizable C (29%), dehydrogenase (15%), FDA (38%), and beta-glucosidase (13%) activities were significantly higher under elevated CO2 and temperature (e-CO2T) to that of ambient condition (a-CO2). The total and colloidal EPS, soil labile C pools and soil enzymatic activities were found higher at panicle initiation (PI) and grain filling (GF) stage than other physiological growth stages of rice. On the other hand, plant stress enzymes like catalase, peroxidise and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were decreased under e-CO2T by 24, 20 and 32%, respectively, as compared to a-CO2. All these indicated e-CO2T could impart additional intrinsic drought tolerance to tropical aerobic rice system (aerobic rice cultivars grown with adequate nutrient supply) in future climate change scenario.

AB  - Forty-eight surface sediment samples from the southeast (SE) Pacific (25-53 degrees S) are investigated for the determination of the spatial distribution of organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts along the western South American continental margin. Fifty-five different taxa are recorded and reflect oceanic or coastal assemblages. The oceanic assemblages are characterised by low cyst concentrations and the dominance of autotrophs, while the coastal assemblages generally contain a higher number of cysts, which are mainly produced by heterotrophic species. Highest cyst concentrations are observed in the active upwelling system offshore Concepcion (35-37 degrees S). Brigantedinium spp., Echinidinium aculeatum, Echinidinium granulatum/delicatum and cysts of Protoperidinium americanum dominate assemblages related to upwelling. Echinidinium aculeatum appears to be the best indicator for the presence of all year round active upwelling cells. Other protoperidinioid cysts may also occur in high relative abundances in coastal regions outside active upwelling systems, if the availability of nutrients, co-responsible for the presence/absence of their main food sources such as diatoms and other protists, is sufficient. The importance of nutrient availability as a determining environmental variable influencing cyst signals on a regional scale (SE Pacific) is demonstrated through statistical analyses of the data. Because of the importance of nutrients, uncertainties about the outcomes of quantitative sea-surface temperature (SST) reconstructions (Modern Analogue Technique) based on dinoflagellate cysts may arise, since no interaction between different hydrographical variables is considered in this approach. The combination of the SE Pacific surface sample dataset with other published cyst data from the Southern Hemisphere resulted in a database which includes 350 samples: the 'SH350 database'. This database is used to test the accuracy of the quantitative reconstructions by calculating and comparing the estimated versus observed values for each site. An attempt to perform quantitative SST reconstructions on the last 25 cal ka of site ODP1233 (41 degrees S; 74 degrees 27'W) is made and again stresses the importance of other environmental variables such as nutrient availability in determining the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages.

AB  - Stored lipid is the main source of metabolic fuel during winter fasts of small birds, yet relatively little is known about the environmental cues that stimulate lipid storage. The ultimate-temperature hypothesis, well supported for a number of species, suggests that birds fatten in anticipation of average or record low winter conditions on a given day. In contrast, the proximate-temperature hypothesis suggests that small birds respond directly to temporal and spatial variation in winter temperature and deposit an amount of body lipid appropriate to current metabolic demands Dark-eye juncos (Junco hyemalis oreganus) and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia morphna) in southwest British Columbia were subjected to warm (20 degrees C) and cold (20 degrees C, gradually reduced to - 12 degrees C over a period of days) temperatures for 10 d in environmental chambers allowing free flight and seminatural feeding and roosting conditions. Total lipid content was significantly greater (P < 0.025) in the cold group than in the warm group in both the junco and the sparrow. The same result was obtained for lipid index (g lipid/g lean dry mass) in an analysis of mass-specific fat reserves. In addition, junco populations wintering wt 951 m in the coastal mountains of southwest British Columbia showed significantly greater fat reserves than conspecifics wintering at and near sea level in British Columbia and northwest Washington. Finally, jun cos in both British Columbia and Washington showed significant inverse correlations between winter fat and proximate temperature. These findings support the proximate-temperature hypothesis and corroborate similar experiments in Wisconsin juncos that repeatedly showed a direct fattening response to low proximate temperatures in environmental chambers (C. M. Weise, personal communication). Although an underlying ultimate component of the winter fat reserve (e.g., an endogenous cycle) in the junco and song sparrow cannot be ruled out by the present experiments, they nonetheless provide strong suggestive evidence for the evolution of a direct fattening response to low proximate temperature in small birds. A caveat is that proximate temperature need not be of paramount importance as a cue and instead may act in parallel or in interaction with environmental indicators of resource predictability, such as snowfall.

AB  - Fecal coliform bacteria are important indicator microorganisms that are commonly monitored monthly for the quality of oyster harvest waters and the end product, making the protection of public health challenging as oyster harvest may occur daily and fecal coliform levels in oyster harvest waters may also change daily. This paper presents an artificial intelligence-based neural network modeling approach to predict fecal coliform bacteria levels in oyster harvest areas (waters) daily. The new approach was demonstrated by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model for daily prediction of fecal coliform levels in seven oyster harvest areas along the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast. The model input variables were selected by using the stepwise regression analysis method. It was found that the prevalence of fecal coliform bacteria in oyster growing waters was controlled by six independent environmental predictors, including wind, salinity, tide, water temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation, which were utilized as the model input variables. It was also found that the prevalence of fecal coliform bacteria in oyster growing waters is affected by not only current conditions of the six independent environmental variables but also antecedent conditions of the variables (particularly average solar radiation and cumulative rainfall over the past two days). Model prediction results indicated that the ANN model was capable to predict not only daily variations in fecal coliform levels but also seasonal fluctuations in observed fecal coliform levels characterized by high bacteria levels in the cold season and low bacteria levels in the warm season. The performance of the ANN model was demonstrated by the linear correlation coefficient (LCC) of 0.7421 and root mean square (RMSE) of 0.3844 for the model development phase and the LCC of 0.6312 and RMSE of 0.2835 for the independent validation phase. The ANN model makes it possible to reduce the harvest and consumption of fecally contaminated oysters and thereby greatly reduce the health risk to the general public and particularly oyster consumers. Although the predictive ANN model was specifically developed for oyster harvest areas along the Louisiana Gulf coast, the methods used in this paper are generally applicable to other oyster harvest areas and coastal waters.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilization decisively influences the yield of arable crops as well as increases N surplus, thereby leading to N losses to the environment. The study aimed to estimate the potential to reduce both N balances and N inputs without economic loss for agriculture in northern conditions. To that end, the source of variation in yield and N balance responses was studied and, taking into consideration the yield response variability, precise economically optimal N rates (N-opt) were estimated.
   In the present study, 61 Finnish N fertilizer experiments with spring cereals (barley, wheat and oats) cultivated on clay and course-textured mineral soils were gathered from the years 1940-2004 in order to integrate studies by means of research synthesis and meta-analysis. With increasing N rates, N balances increased more steeply in moderately acidic (MA) soils (pH 4.9-5.7) than in slightly acidic (SA) soils (pH 5.8-6.9). An increase of 10 kg N ha(-1) in fertilization was associated with a 7.4 and 5.0-6.6 kg ha(-1) year(-1) increase in the N balances for MA and SA, respectively. This indicates that applying increasing amounts of N to fields with low pH may pose a greater risk to the environment, Moreover, the yield without added N strongly governed both the yield response and N-opt: the higher the yield, the smaller the response and N-opt. Ignoring this fact may lead to overuse of N, as demonstrated for the present Finnish recommendations. In contrast, taking into account the difference in response would reduce N input by 20-75 kg ha(-1) and N balances by 10-40 kg ha(-1) year(-1) with no economic loss. The current Finnish fertilizer recommendations based on yield expectancy (the higher the expected yield, the higher the N fertilizer recommendation) should be reconsidered to take into account the assessment of yield without added N in farmers' fields. This would make it possible to combine both economic profitability and environmental protection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest structural diversity can serve as an important indicator of biodiversity. The relationship between spaceborne hyperspectral remotely sensed data and several measures of forest structure was explored over a 625 km(2) coastal temperate forest landscape on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Thirteen Hyperion bands were selected for analysis based on the documented and hypothesized importance of various spectral wavelengths to forest characterization. To aid in understanding spectral trends, measures of forest stand structural diversity (projected age, projected height, and stand species composition complexity) were derived from forest inventory data. The spectral distance between the stand mean and standard deviation of reflectance and related expectations from global equivalents for each of the 13 bands were used to relate measures of spectral diversity (N = 801 forest inventory stands).
   Canonical correlation analysis was then used to determine the independent and shared relationships between these selected measures of forest structural diversity (dependent variables) and spectral diversity (independent variables). The dependent variables that were most strongly correlated with the first canonical variate were projected age and projected height, with canonical loadings of 0.973 and 0.979, respectively. In contrast, stand species composition complexity had a weak, negative correlation with spectral diversity (canonical loading = -0.025). The wavelengths contributing the most to the canonical function included: 681-740 nm, 551-680 nm, and 1401-2400 nm. There have been few studies that attempt to directly link spectral and species diversity in temperate forest environments. From this initial investigation, we posit that the complex spectral response of coastal temperate forests may confound efforts to directly link spectral and species diversity across a range of site conditions. Our results, which are constrained by the spectral and spatial resolution of the data used, our target environment, and the metrics selected for measuring forest structure, suggest that attributes that characterize forest structural conditions may have a more meaningful relationship with spectral diversity than measures of species diversity alone, and that future studies in coastal temperate forests that seek to link spectral diversity with biodiversity should include measures of forest structural diversity, in addition to measures of species diversity.

AB  - Knowledge of sea-level change in the southern Baltic Sea region is important for understanding the variations in late Pleistocene and Holocene sea-level change across northern Europe. These variations are a consequence of the response of the Earth's crust to the deglaciation of Fennoscandia and of the water added to the oceans from the melting of all Pleistocene ice sheets. The sedimentological and geochemical composition of five sediment cores from the lagoonal Oder Estuary offers new observational evidence for sea-level change and coastal development in the southern Baltic Sea region. The combined use of several geochemical proxies (organic carbon, nitrogen, calcium carbonate and biogenic opal contents, C-org/S and C-org/N ratios, delta C-13 values of organic matter, and delta N-15 values) is a new approach for the study area. The chemical evidence of this multiproxy approach allows clear identification of several stages in the development of the lagoonal environment: postglacial lake stages with sandy sedimentation during the Older Dryas and the Allerod stades, lacustrine phases with high autochthonous productivity during the Atlantic stade, terrestrial stages with peat formation at the beginning of the Subboreal stade, sedimentation as a result of marine transgression, and brackish sedimentation after the formation of sand spits and barrier islands during the Subatlantic stade. The stages are the result of regional sea-level change owing to complex shoreline development. They support the tentative sea-level curve proposed nearly 20 years ago for the region. In addition, changes in Oder River input in response to climate conditions is monitored. Whereas high terrigenous input of organic matter from the Oder River occurred during periods of humid climate during the Allerod, Atlantic, and Subatlantic stades, Oder River discharge decreased with drier and cooler climate conditions during the Subboreal stade. Furthermore, the geochemical evidence points to local anomalies such as the significance of river input and additional sulfate supply into the Oder lagoon for the composition of the sediments. Overall, the results provide a framework for future studies, which would allow for a more detailed comparison with other, similar environments. (C) 2001 University of Washington.

AB  - This study presents geochemical evidence for a change in depositional energy conditions of tidal flat sediments (southern North Sea) from the Holocene, i.e. human unaffected, to present-day conditions. We investigated Holocene and present tidal flat sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM) from the NW German coastal area (Spiekeroog Island back-barrier area and Jade Bay), as well as sediments from the Helgoland Island mud hole area. Samples were analysed for bulk parameters (TC, TIC), major (Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, K, P, Si, Ti), and trace elements (Ba, Pb, Rb, Sr, V, Zn, Zr).
   Enrichment factors versus average shale reveal four groups of elements for the investigated Holocene and present sediments. Fe, Mg, K, Ba, Rb, and V show a shale-like behaviour and enrichments of Ca and Sr reflect the occurrence of carbonate, whereas higher levels of P, Pb, and Zn in the present samples are due to pollution. The fourth group consists of Si, Ti, and Zr, which may be used as indicators of depositional energy because these elements are concentrated by particle sorting effects. The most pronounced geochemical difference between the Holocene and present tidal Rat sediments is an enrichment of Zr in the present samples. As Zr is commonly associated with heavy minerals, this enrichment indicates a higher depositional energy environment in the present sediments, which can be traced to modern dike building. The same effect, i.e. increasing current velocities, is responsible for a general depletion of fine-grained, Al-rich. material in the present sediments.
   The examination of SPM shows that large amounts of this fine-grained material are present in the water column and may be transported from the intertidal system into the open North Sea. The comparison of a calculated Holocene clay accumulation rate with modern estimates of SPM deposition in the German Eight reveals about a two-fold higher deposition of fine material in the Holocene tidal flats. As the sediments from the Helgoland mud hole show a geochemical composition similar to Holocene tidal flat sediments, we assume that the Helgoland mud hole may serve as a proximal depocentre in the southern North Sea for the SPM exported from the back-barrier systems.

AB  - The controversy surrounding the question of whether iron limits phytoplankton production in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions of the world's oceans has stimulated research on numerous fronts, including the search for diagnostic indicators of phytoplankton iron nutritional status. Flavodoxin (Fly), an iron-independent protein capable of catalyzing many of the same reactions as the non-heme, iron-sulfur protein ferredoxin (Fd), is produced by certain prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms in response to iron stress. Few eukaryotic marine phytoplankton species have been examined for their ability to synthesize Fly, primarily due to the lack of a suitable analytical method. In response to this need, a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/photodiode array detection method was developed for the separation and identification of Fly and Fd in crude protein extracts of algal samples. The utility of this technique was then demonstrated with a study of Fly and Fd production by the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, a eukaryotic marine phytoplankton species. Fly was detected in iron-limited T. weissflogii at levels about 20-fold greater (by molecules) than in iron-replete cells. Although constitutive expression of this protein under iron-sufficient conditions was observed, actual levels were very low. By comparison, the iron-containing protein Fd was abundant in iron-replete cells but undetectable in iron-limited cells (limit of detection ca 1 pg ml(-1)). If Fly (by molecules) is expressed as a percentage of the combined pool of Fly and Fd, [Flv/(Flv + Fd)] x 100, values fall between ca 10 and 15% (n = 6) for iron-replete cells, but are consistently 100% under Fe-limiting conditions (n = 5), where Fd is below detection limits. Thus, the constitutive nature of Fly production by T. weissflogii does not preclude its possible use as a diagnostic indicator of iron stress. The HPLC method developed during this study, in conjunction with cellular level techniques (e.g. antibodies, nucleic acid probes), will permit a rapid, accurate assessment of phytoplankton iron nutritional status without the need for intrusive techniques such as bottle incubations. Additional laboratory and field studies are now needed to evaluate the applicability of Fly and Fd relative abundance as a diagnostic indicator of iron limitation in a broad range of species and natural phytoplankton communities.

AB  - Aims We aimed to elucidate the driving forces underlying the geographical distribution of spruce forests, as well as the morphological and phylogenetic divergence among spruce species in China.
   Methods One hundred and seventy two sites across the entire range of spruce forests in China (23 degrees-53 degrees N, 75 degrees-134 degrees F, 250-4300 m a.s.l.) were sampled for species composition, geographical coordinates, and topographic and climatic variables. Sixteen spruce taxa, which are naturally distributed in China, were respectively grouped into morphologically defined sections and phylogenetically distinct clades. Multivariate approaches, including two-way indicator species analysis, principal components analysis, detrended correspondence analysis, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), and partial CCA, were used for data analysis.
   Important findings The 172 samples grouped into 13 spruce forests, the geographical distributions of which were closely related to climate and geographical location. The variation in species composition explained by the geographical coordinates (32.01%) was significantly higher than that explained by the climatic (27.76%) and topographic variables (23.32%). Of the three morphologically defined sections, sect. Omorica occurred mainly in wetter habitats with a mean annual precipitation of ca. 229 mm and 426 mm higher than the habitats of sect. Casicta and sect. Picea (P< 0.01), respectively. Of the two phylogenetically distinct clades, Clade-II (an older Glade) occurred in habitats with warm winters and cool summers whose mean temperature in the coldest month was ca. 8-10 degrees C higher, yet accumulated temperature during the growing season (>= 5 degrees C) was ca. 297-438 degrees C lower, than the habitats of Clade-III (a younger Glade) (P < 0.01). Our data support the hypothesis that geographical location may be a greater determinant of variation in species composition. In addition, moisture conditions tend to be the key determinants that account for the divergence among the morphologically defined sections, while the phylogenetic divergence among spruce species is mainly affected by temperature conditions. While the clades or sections of the spruce species in question carry strong climatic signals, their divergences are subject to different selective pressures.

AB  - This study evaluated a comprehensive plant water stress indicator that integrates the leaf temperature and the environmental conditions that can provide feedback on the plant response to irrigation scheduling. This quantity Comprehensive Stress Indicator (CSI)-is based on the reformulation of the leaf energy balance equation. Specifically, CSI is the ratio of the temperature difference between a dry leaf (i.e., a leaf with a broken stem) and a live leaf (on the same tree) [i.e., T-dry-T-leaf and the difference between the vapor pressure inside the stomatal cavity at saturation and the vapor pressure of the air at ambient temperature [i.e., e(s)(T-L)-e(T-A)]. The required measurements to compute CSI include dry leaf temperature, live leaf temperature, relative humidity, and air temperature at the tree being monitored. In this study, all measurements were obtained using a sensor suite called the leaf monitor. Leaf monitors were connected to a wireless mesh network to communicate the data to a website. The leaf monitor included two thermal infrared sensors, one for the dry leaf and one for the live leaf, both of which were housed in the same unit with almost identical environmental conditions due to a diffusing hemispherical dome that enclosed these sensors. The CSI is a dynamic indicator with a value for every data sample collected. For a single indicator representing each day, the CSI was evaluated in two ways. First, the CSI was integrated with respect to time from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. to obtain the Integrated Comprehensive Stress Indicator (ICSI). Second, the CSI was averaged from 1 P.M. to 3 P.M. to obtain the Average Comprehensive Stress Indicator (ACSI). Both ICSI and ACSI were compared to other stress indicators, including the existing Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) and Integrated Degrees Above Non-Stressed (IDANS). Results show that ICSI and ACSI are satisfactorily correlated with midday stem water potential (SWP). The ICSI and ACSI indicators may be more convenient than other stress indicators because they require measurements only at the tree being monitored.

AB  - The organic geochemistry of the Paleogene-aged second and first members of the Kongdian Formation (Ek(2) and Ek(1)) and the third member of the Shahejie Formation (Es-3) in the Cangdong sag, Bohai Bay Basin, China, are characterized and the hydrocarbon generating potential is evaluated. The Ek(2) source rocks have a good to very good oil-generating potential, as indicated by the high abundance and good quality of organic matter within a mature stage. Although the Ek(1) mudstones have entered the oil window, they are organic lean and are dominantly composed of Type III kerogen. Accordingly, the Ek(1) mudstones are considered to be poor source rocks. The Es-3 member is thermally mature and contains several intervals that have high contents of good-quality organic matter (mixed Type I and II kerogens), suggesting that these intervals also have a good potential for oil-generation. Given this potential, new exploration plays sourced from the Es-3 member could be possible in the Cangdong sag. Biomarker distributions in the Ek(2) and Es-3 source rocks are both characterized by a dominance of medium- to high-molecular-weight n-alkanes (n-C-18 to n-C-29), a low sterane/hopane ratio, and a low diasterane abundance. The Ek(2) samples have low Pr/Ph ratios (< 1.0), relatively high gammacerane/C-30 hopane ratios (> 0.1) and beta-carotane, trace amounts of C-30 4 alpha-methyl-24-ethlycholestanes, and a predominance of C-29 regular steranes. Collectively, these characteristics indicate that abundant prokaryotic biomass mixed with some terrigenous organic matter was deposited under reducing conditions within a stratified water column. In contrast, the Es-3 source rocks are characterized by variable Pr/Ph ratios, low gammacerane and beta-carotane, comparable C-27 and C-29 regular steranes, and relatively high C-30 4 alpha-methyl-24-ethlycholestanes. These properties indicate that the Es-3 source rocks contain significant contributions from prokaryotic and algal sources, and were deposited under reducing to suboxic conditions within a relatively less stratified water column.

AB  - 1. Because perennial herbs of temperate climates develop their above-ground parts every year anew, their success critically depends on the timing and speed of this growth (growth phenology). These parameters can play a role in species coexistence and may differ along environmental gradients. Still, we know little about them, as most phenological data come from observations of flowering and to a lesser degree leafing onset.
   2. We collected data on growth phenology of about 400 perennial herbs in a botanical garden to make the results independent of local differences in climatic drivers as much as possible. Using these data, we determined species-specific parameters of Day of peak growth, Day of maturity and two types of growth rates associated with the change in plant size. Environmental conditions in which these species occur in the field were assessed using Ellenberg indicator values, which express species' optima along gradients of moisture, nutrients and temperature.
   3. Both timing and speed of growth estimated in the common garden were affected by light and moisture conditions of the habitats where the species typically occur. All parameters showed phylogenetic conservatism.
   4. We identified two relationships among these parameters of growth phenology: (1) species with early peak growth had high relative growth rates in contrast to late species; (2) tall species showed later peak growth than short species. The first relationship is associated with survival under forest canopy, where species are selected to grow early and fast before trees leaf out, which restricts their size. The latter is associated with (asymmetric) competition for light in open habitats, where the main selection factor is for tall stature, which cannot be attained early in the season.
   5. Synthesis. We show that large differences in size growth dynamics among herbaceous species are constrained by a few key trade-offs involving height at maturity, rate of growth and time when maximum height is attained. These trade-offs correspond to major selective forces acting on herbaceous plants in temperate climates.

AB  - A study of the stable isotope composition (delta O-18, delta C-13) of biogenic (ostracod, mollusc) and authigenic carbonates in the Ballagan Formation, Lower Carboniferous of Scotland, coupled with evidence from sedimentology and associated fossil fauna and flora, supports the argument that this formation was deposited in a coastal flood plain setting, in brackish (0.5 < 30 parts per thousand NaCl) and hypersaline (> 40 parts per thousand NaCl) waters, but in the absence of persistent normal marine conditions. The oxygen isotope data from the Ballagan Formation divide into three clusters: a diagenetic field defined by low delta O-18 (< - 11 parts per thousand VPDB); an intermediary field (delta O-18 - 11 parts per thousand to - 9 parts per thousand) composed of a mixture of known primary and secondary (diagenetic) carbonates; and samples within the range of -9 parts per thousand to -4 parts per thousand which, as far as we can ascertain, are largely unaltered. No samples give typical Early Carboniferous delta O-18 marine values. Average marine carbonates from Europe have delta O-18 between -4 parts per thousand to - 3 parts per thousand. The Ballagan Formation carbonates were probably deposited in evaporated freshwater and/or brackish water. This conclusion is supported by the presence of evaporites (gypsum, anhydrite, halite pseudomorphs) and common desiccation-cracked mudstone surfaces throughout the Ballagan Formation, suggesting conditions of fluctuating salinity in ephemeral bodies of water. The stable isotope data support the notion that the ostracod assemblages of the Ballagan Formation were colonising brackish water and hypersaline ecologies on a coastal flood plain during the Early Carboniferous, a stage of development that may have encouraged their colonisation of fully non-marine (limnetic) environments during the later Carboniferous. The ostracods include cytherellacean and kloedenellacean species known from marginal marine sites elsewhere, but probably tolerant of brackish water, podocopid species such as 'Bythocypris' aequalis that may have been adapted for brackish water settings on coastal flood plains (ephemeral lakes and lagoons), and paraparchitacean-dominated assemblages that may signal harsh (hypersaline or desiccating) environments.

AB  - Bacterial pollution of water is impacted to a great extent by the ability of bacteria to survive in manure following excretion. We investigated the effects of environmental temperature (4 degreesC, 27 degreesC, and 41 degreesC) and manure moisture content (30%, 55%, and 83%) on the survival and release of indicator bacteria in dairy cow manure. Fresh manure samples of about 60 g were packed to 12 mm depth in polystyrene dishes and held at controlled temperatures and moisture contents for up to 103 days. Supernatant from a distilled-water extraction was enumerated for fecal bacteria (fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and fecal streptococci) by the membrane filtration method. Bacterial populations increased as much as 2.5 log(10) (over 300x) in the three days following excretion. Temperature had a significant overall effect on survival of all three fecal bacteria, whereas moisture content produced a consistent effect on fecal streptococci survival only. Fecal streptococci showed no significant die-off at any temperature or moisture content studied. In contrast, no measurable E. coli or fecal coliforms were found in supernatant water samples from the 41 degreesC treatment after day 35. E. coli and fecal coliform populations for the 4 degreesC treatment at lower moisture content (30% and 55%) conditions were close to the detection limits after five weeks, but significant numbers of E. coli (2.34 x 10(4) cfu g(-1) wet manure) and fecal coliforms (3.84 x 104 cfu g(-1) wet manure) remained for the 4 degreesC treatment at 83% moisture content after 103 days. First-order die-off rate coefficients for E. coli were found to be appropriate after day 3 for about a 3-week period and averaged 0.11 d(-1) at 4 degreesC, 0.20 d(-1) at 27 degreesC, and 0.32 d-1 at 41degrees C. Results from this study suggest that barnyard, feedlot, and manure management practices that detain manure at higher temperatures (e.g., 41 degreesC) will decrease the E. coli and fecal coliform populations but not those of fecal streptococci. Coliform bacterial populations tested remained viable for long periods (>3 months) particularly at moderate temperature (27 degreesC) for any moisture level, and streptococci survived under all conditions studied.

AB  - The performance of the heart is considerably affected by the blocks formed because of the deposition of plaque inside the coronary artery. The blocks (stenosis) either in coronary artery or elsewhere force the heart to work harder for pumping the oxygenated blood to the heart muscles and blood vessels. This study analyses the flow through the stenosed coronary arteries via numerical modelling by using ANSYS FLUENT software. Three real cases with different asymmetric stenosis levels (i.e., block level 33%, 66% & 85%) are analysed by considering blood as a non-Newtonian fluid, and blood flow as pulsatile in nature. As the flow regime falls in transition to turbulent region, the transition Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-w turbulence model is used to take care of the changeover stage from laminar to turbulent flow and vice versa. The results show large variation both in Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and pressure drop near the stenosis. Pressure drop becomes more significant at severe degrees of stenosis (66% and 85%) compared to the mild case (33%). The study throws light on the critical distribution of shear stress and pressure drop along the artery wall, which are considered as indicators of the commencement of heart disease and further growth of stenosis. An indicator, viz., Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), which relates the percentage of stenosis to the pressure variations, can be used as an index to diagnose the severity of stenosis. All the three cases with different stenotic levels were analysed under hyperaemic conditions and found that even 45% stenosis case can go near to critical at hyperaemic flow conditions. The effect of severity due to vessel constriction can be estimated by comparing the simulated pressure drop and WSS before and after the stenosis, with the ones for a healthy artery. The present study developed a methodology to calculate FFR value for unknown percentage of stenosis based on the simulated results obtained from 33%, 66% and 85% stenosis. Thus, criticality of a patient with certain percentage stenosis can also be evaluated. This simulation technique can be recommended as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Producer-recorded health data for metabolic disease traits and fertility disorders on 35,575 Canadian Holstein cows were jointly analyzed with selected indicator traits. Metabolic diseases included clinical ketosis (KET) and displaced abomasum (DA); fertility disorders were metritis (MET) and retained placenta (RP); and disease indicators were fat-to-protein ratio, milk 3-hydroxybutyrate, and body condition score (B CS) in the first lactation. Traits in first and later (up to fifth) lactations were treated as correlated in the multiple trait (13 traits in total) animal linear model. Bayesian methods with Gibbs sampling were implemented for the analysis. Estimates of heritability for disease incidence were low, up to 0.06 for DA in first lactation. Among disease traits, the environmental herd-year variance constituted 4% of the total variance for KET and less for other traits. First- and later-lactation disease traits were genetically correlated (from 0.66 to 0.72) across all traits, indicating different genetic backgrounds for first and later lactations. Genetic correlations between KET and DA were relatively strong and positive (up to 0.79) in both first- and later-lactation cows. Genetic correlations between fertility disorders were slightly lower. Metritis was strongly genetically correlated with both metabolic disease traits in the first lactation only. All other genetic correlations between metabolic and fertility diseases were statistically nonsignificant. First-lactation KET and MET were strongly positively correlated with later-lactation performance for these traits due to the environmental herd-year effect. Indicator traits were moderately genetically correlated (from 0.30 to 0.63 in absolute values) with both metabolic disease traits in the first lactation. Smaller and mostly nonsignificant genetic correlations were among indicators and metabolic diseases in later lactations. The only significant genetic correlations between indicators and fertility disorders were those between BCS and MET in both first and later lactations. Results indicated a limited value of a joint genetic evaluation model for metabolic disease traits and fertility disorders in Canadian Holsteins.

AB  - Currently, cloud chemistry models are including more detailed and explicit multiphase mechanisms based on laboratory experiments that determine such values as kinetic constants, stability constants of complexes and hydration constants. However, these models are still subject to many uncertainties related to the aqueous chemical mechanism they used. Particularly, the role of oxidants such as iron and hydrogen peroxide in the oxidative capacity of the cloud aqueous phase has typically never been validated against laboratory experimental data. To fill this gap, we adapted the M2C2 model (Model of Multiphase Cloud Chemistry) to simulate irradiation experiments on synthetic aqueous solutions under controlled conditions (e.g., pH, temperature, light intensity) and for actual cloud water samples. Various chemical compounds that purportedly contribute to the oxidative budget in cloud water (i.e., iron, oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide: H2O2) were considered. Organic compounds (oxalic, formic and acetic acids) were taken into account as target species because they have the potential to form iron complexes and are good indicators of the oxidative capacity of the cloud aqueous phase via their oxidation in this medium. The range of concentrations for all of the chemical compounds evaluated was representative of in situ measurements. Numerical outputs were compared with experimental data that consisted of a time evolution of the concentrations of the target species.
   The chemical mechanism in the model describing the "oxidative engine" of the HxOy/iron (HxOy = H2O2, HO2 center dot/O-2(center dot-) and HO center dot) chemical system was consistent with laboratory measurements. Thus, the degradation of the carboxylic acids evaluated was closely reproduced by the model. However, photolysis of the Fe(C2O4)(+) complex needs to be considered in cloud chemistry models for polluted conditions (i.e., acidic pH) to correctly reproduce oxalic acid degradation. We also show that iron and formic acid lead to a stable complex whose photoreactivity has currently not been investigated. The updated aqueous chemical mechanism was compared with data from irradiation experiments using natural cloud water. The new reactions considered in the model (i.e., iron complex formation with oxalic and formic acids) correctly reproduced the experimental observations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Xiaotan section, situated on the southwestern Yangtze Platform, South China, contains an unusually expanded sedimentary record, spanning the upper Neoproterozoic to the Cambrian and representing more than 40 My of marine sedimentation. Three distinct black shale units of the Shiyantou and Yuanshan formations were analysed for redox-sensitive trace elements and iron speciation, in order to constrain the evolution of the marine environment during the Early Cambrian metazoan biodiversification on the southwestern Yangtze Platform. For comparison we also include black shale samples of the Shiyantou Fm. from the Meishucun section, samples from a previous study covering the Shiyantou and Yuanshan Fm. at Dapotuo near Chengjiang, and samples from the strongly condensed Early Cambrian Niutitang Fm. from the Zhongnan section situated on the platform margin. Th/U and Fe-HR/Fe-T ratios reveal that bottom waters on the southwestern Yangtze Platform were commonly anoxic and ferruginous into the Cambrian, but became oxic after deposition of the black shales of the lower Yuanshan Formation, which elsewhere contains the Chengjiang Biota. Average Mo/TOC ratios, used as an indicator of the size of the Mo reservoir, increase up-section, and together with generally increasing S/C ratios suggest a trend towards normal (Phanerozoic) marine conditions. A distinctive Ni peak within the upper Shiyantou Fm. at Xiaotan and maximum Mo concentrations at the base of the Yuanshan Fm. can be correlated to the Ni Mo sulphide layer within the lower Niutitang Fm. and thus indicate two separate pulses of sedimentary-exhalative nickel enrichment and subsequent, redox controlled molybdenum accumulation. A strong decoupling of organic carbon and pyrite sulphur within both sections further suggests upwelling of H2S-rich waters onto the platform. We argue here for an opening of the depositional environment on the northwestern Yangtze Platform which led to the upwelling of sulphidic waters, ventilation of the seafloor and ultimately its colonisation by newly emergent animal groups during the 'Cambrian Explosion'.

AB  - The semi-arid temperate steppe in northern central China is one of the main areas influenced by frequent dust and sand storms, and is at the same time a primary source of dust from deteriorated grasslands; thus, the sediment grain size distribution of inland lakes in this region can be a particularly useful indicator of palaeoenvrionmental change. The local pattern of grain size suggests that aeolian activity is the most important agent for sedimentation in the lake center in this region, as strong northwesterly winds prevail for most of the year and the surface runoff is very weak. Meanwhile, the regional pattern of topsoil grain size and its close association with mean annual precipitation (MAP) allows the establishment of a statistical model for palaeo-moisture reconstruction from sediment grain size. In this study, we reconstructed a humidity time series based on the sediment grain size sequence from Anguli Nuur Lake on the southern Inner Mongolian Plateau in China and found that it coincides very closely with the C/N ratio (carbon to nitrogen ratio) and other humidity indices revealed in previous studies of this temperate steppe region and from the delta O-18 values of stalagmite calcite in southern, monsoon-dominated China. This close relationship suggests that climate change in the semi-arid areas of Asia is strongly influenced by the Pacific summer monsoon and that it is reasonable to use sediment grain size as an indicator of humidity variability in the semi-arid steppe region. The reconstructed humidity increased during the early Holocene, and generally humid conditions lasted from about 10,400 until 7000 yr BP. The period from around 7000 to 5200 yr BP was a transition phase from humid to semi-arid conditions, and the monsoon intensity of that time may have been at the threshold for a semi-arid vegetation ecosystem. Finally, since approximately 5200 yr BP to present, the climate has become more arid, with corresponding vegetation deterioration and strong aeolian activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Exploration appears to be carried out for its own purpose due to being self-rewarding. Furthermore, it increases environmental certainty with the effect of increased predictability and control of the environment. We, therefore, supposed that exploratory behaviour is associated with positive emotions and could be a valuable tool in the assessment of animal welfare from the positive side. Since assessing the level of exploration in daily life is time consuming, the goal of our study was to develop a feasible on-farm test to estimate the daily exploratory level of beef bulls. This was based on the hypothesis that bulls in barren environments (here: pens with fully slatted floors) will explore an unknown object more than those housed under more enriched conditions (here: littered pens). A novel object test at the feed rack over a 1-h period was carried out in 64 groups of fattening bulls on farms in Germany and Austria. In order to evaluate sensitivity of the test half of the barren pens in Germany were slightly enriched after these tests and bulls tested again after 1 week. During the first three quarters of the test hour, significantly more barren-housed bulls were occupied with the objects than animals in littered pens. This was predominantly due to more licking/chewing of the novel object. However, the differences in exploration levels were only slight. Moreover, the test was not sensitive to the slight short-term change in stimulation of the bulls following the simple enrichment. The motivational basis for increased exploration of the novel object by licking or chewing in bulls kept in barren conditions is not clear-cut. While it might reflect that these bulls gain less positive emotions from intrinsic exploration in their daily life, nutritional aspects may also play a role. While further investigations should aim to identify the motivational basis of occupation with the novel object and relate true daily exploration levels to test results, for the on-farm assessment of good animal welfare the test appears not to be promising in its current form.

AB  - The carbon isotope composition of C-4 grasses has the potential to be used as an indicator of changes in the isotopic composition and concentration of atmospheric CO2, especially for climate reconstruction. The usefulness of C-4 grasses far this purpose hinges on the assumption that their photosynthetic discrimination against C-13 remains constant in a wide range of environmental conditions. We tested this assumption by examining the effects of light and water stress on the carbon isotope composition of C-4 grasses using different biochemical subtypes (NADP-ME, NAD-ME, PCK) in glasshouse experiments. We grew 14 different C-4 grass species in four treatments: sun-watered, sun-drought, shade-watered and shade-drought. Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) rarely remained constant. In general, Delta values were lowest in sun-watered grasses, greater for sun-drought plants and even higher for plants of the shade-watered treatment. The highest Delta values were generally found in the most stressed grasses, the shade-drought plants. Grasses of the NADP-ME subtype were the least influenced by a change in environmental variables, followed by PCK and NAD-ME subtypes. Water availability affected the carbon isotope discrimination less than light limitation in PCK and NAB-ME subtypes, but similarly in NADP-ME subtypes.
   In another experiment, we studied the effect of increasing light levels (150 to 1500 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) on the Delta values of 18 well-watered C-4 grass species. Carbon isotope discrimination remained constant until photon flux density (PFD) was less than 700 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Below this light level, Delta values increased with decreasing irradiance for all biochemical subtypes. The change in Delta was less pronounced in NADP-ME and PCK than in NAD-ME grasses. Grasses grown in the field and in the glasshouse showed a similar pattern. Thus, caution should be exercised when using C-4 plants under varying environmental conditions to monitor the concentration or carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 in field/glasshouse studies or climate reconstruction.

AB  - Rangia cuneata is a brackish water clam with a broad distribution along western Atlantic coasts and is an important component of estuarine communities. Adult R. cuneata are tolerant of salinities ranging from 0 to 32 but limited experimental studies have indicated that spawning and larval development are constrained to salinities between 2 and 10. In 2003, a permanent saltwater barrier was built in the lower Neches River, Texas, that partitioned a population of R. cuneata that had been surveyed since the 1950s. The barrier prevented salt water intrusions upstream and provided a natural experiment to determine how the regulation of salinity intrusion can influence R. cuneata spawning, recruitment, and establishment. We surveyed a total of 12 historical sites (eight above and four below the barrier) plus one site outside the previous surveys. Above the barrier, five sites had no living R. cuneata and the remaining three sites had very low densities (0.2 per m(-2)). The large sizes of the few R. cuneata above the barrier (mean = 65.8 mm) suggested no spawning, with energy instead being invested into somatic growth. It also demonstrated the effectiveness of the barrier in preventing the continued recruitment of R. cuneata upstream and supports the hypothesis that non-zero salinity levels are needed for successful reproduction of the species. Populations downstream from the barrier experienced a resurgence in population size since the last survey in 1992, with one site having 86 individuals m(-2). The presence of distinct size cohorts indicated that spawning and recruitment occurs sporadically. Using the results of previous research, we defined the conditions apparently needed for successful reproductive events as warm weather periods with a salinity change (>= 4 over a week) to induce spawning and elevated salinity levels (2-10 for 15+ days) for larval development. Using these criteria, we identified three salinity influx events on the lower Neches River in the last eight years that correlate with the presence of the size cohorts observed below the barrier, which support the hypothesis that salinity fluxes and durations are needed to induce spawning and facilitate larval recruitment.

AB  - Taking into account the European integration course of Ukraine, it is necessary to evaluate the socioeconomic conditions of cultural sphere development in the countries of the European Union, because it is an integral part of creative industries and improvement of social capital. The purpose of this research is to identify the factors of cultural sphere development in the EU countries due to its importance for the system of creative industries and the process of social capital accumulation, outlining the possibilities of European experience adaptation in this sphere for Ukraine.
   The scientific and methodology approaches were developed to the definition of cultural sphere development factors in the EU countries from the point of view of its influence on the formation of social capital and creative industries. A comparative analysis of socio-economic development of cultural sphere in 2011-2019 was realized, including evaluation of spatial differences in its functioning on the base of variation indicators calculating and tracking their dynamics. The specification of multiple regression models was done, in which the explained variables became employment in cultural sphere (Y-1) and the value of its gross value added (Y-2).
   It is found out that the place and significance of the cultural sphere for the national economy of each EU country differ, whereas the environment of its functioning is relatively stable, which contributes to the formation of proper conditions for the accumulation of social capital and the development of creative industries. It is substantiated that spatial differences in cultural sphere development have been intensified in the EU countries due to the different intensity of social capital and creative industries network formation. The multiple regression analysis revealed that a number of explanatory variables (demographic situation, tourism activity, unemployment rate, and education index) influence employment and gross value added of the cultural sphere.
   It is determined that for the cultural sphere of Ukraine, taking into account the European integration and experience of the EU countries, it is important to ensure the stability of cultural sphere, minimize the effects of the demographic crisis, promote tourism development, and regulate the employment policy, which, due to synergy, will influence the social capital and the positions of creative industries in the national economy.

AB  - Purpose. The aim of the work is to identify the patterns of the dissolved oil (DO) field structure in the Sevastopol Bay waters and the factors conditioning its state, to compare the obtained result with the available ideas on large-scale distribution of the water quality indicators on the area under study, to evaluate the current trend of the dissolved oil field state, to consider the relationship between the fields of the dissolved oil concentration, the total suspended matter (TSM) and the dissolved organicmatter (DOM).
   Methods and Results. Based on the data of a series of the oceanological expeditions carried out by Marine Hydrophysical Institute and Institute of Natural and Technical Systems in 1999-2018, the structure of the dissolved oil content field in the Sevastopol Bay (the Black Sea) and the forming it factors are considered. The obtained result is compared with the known structural regularities of the hydrochemical elements' fields. A tendency of the state of the dissolved oil concentration field is assessed. The relationship between the fields of the dissolved oil concentration, total suspended matter and the dissolved organic matter is considered.
   Conclusions. It is shown that the structure of the dissolved oil content field is conditioned by interaction of the polluted waters in the Sevastopol Bay apex (spacious maximum of the substance concentration was revealed in the region of the Neftyanaya Harbor) with the pure Black Sea waters in its western region. The characteristic structural element of the field under investigation is a well-pronounced meridian frontal section observed on the Southern Bay traverse. Significant local maximum values in the dissolved oil field were observed also in the bays Kilen, Korabel'naya, Artilleriyskaya and Severnaya. The frontal section in the dissolved oil concentration field coincided with the boundary section in the hydrochemical elements' fields, which was earlier revealed in course of studying water pollution in the Sevastopol Bay. Noted are the tendency to decrease of the dissolved oil products' concentration in the Southern Bay waters and the qualitative difference of this substance structure being compared to the fields of the total suspended matter and the dissolved organic matter concentrations.

AB  - Proper utilization of water resources is very important in agro-based and drought-prone Bangladesh. Sustainable use of water resources in agriculture requires irrigation schedules based on local environmental conditions, soil type and water availability. In this study, the water productivity model AquaCrop was used to simulate different water and fertilizer management strategies in a drought prone area of Bangladesh to obtain management recommendations. First, the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) and Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) were determined to quantify the aggregated deficit between precipitation and the evaporative demand of the atmosphere, which confirm that meteorological drought is occurring frequently in the study area. Also, the AquaCrop model was successfully calibrated and validated for wheat in the area, which was confirmed by the several statistical indicators, and could be used to design water and fertilizer management strategies. Simulations identified stem elongation (jointing) to booting and flowering stage as the most water sensitive stages for wheat. Deficit irrigation during the most water sensitive stages could increase the interannual yield stability and the grain yield compared to rainfed conditions for different soil fertility levels on loamy and sandy soils by 21-136% and 11-71%, respectively, while it could increase water productivity compared to full irrigation strategies. Deficit irrigation resulted in grain yields almost equal to yields under full irrigation and could at the same time save 121-197 mm of water per growing season. Specifically, we suggest two irrigation applications: one at the stem elongation (jointing) to booting stage and another at the flowering stage for loamy soils; and one at the end of seedling development to the beginning of crown root initiation stage and another at the flowering stage for sandy soils. Given the water scarcity in the region, instead of optimal fertility levels, moderate fertility levels are recommended that result in 60% of the potential biomass production for loamy soils and in 50% for sandy soils in combination with the suggested deficit irrigation strategies.

AB  - In organic agriculture, weeds and nitrogen deficiency are the main factors that limit crop production. The use of relay-intercropped forage legumes may be a way of providing ecological services such as weed control, increasing N availability in the cropping system thanks to N fixation, reducing N leaching and supplying nitrogen to the following crop. However, these ecological services vary considerably depending on the forage legume biomass. The aim of this study was to identify factors that affect forage legume establishment and growth to help farmers adjust the management of the cover crop.
   Sixteen field experiments were conducted over a period of five years. In each experiment, winter wheat was grown as sole crop or intercropped with one of two species of forage legumes; Trifolium repens L. or Trifolium pratense L After the intercropping stage, the cover crop was maintained until the end of winter and then destroyed by plowing before maize was sown. Climatic conditions, and the accumulation of legume and weed biomass were monitored from when the legume was sown to destruction of the cover crop.
   Our results showed that a minimum threshold of about 500 kg ha(-1) biomass in the aboveground parts of the cover crop was needed at the end of intercropping to obtain the minimum biomass of 2000 kg ha-1 in September necessary to guarantee ecological services. To obtain sufficient legume biomass at the end of intercropping period, a thermal time greater than 1900 degrees Cd and more rainfall than 300 mm are required for legume growth. Moreover, a legume density of at least of 300 plants per square meter at the wheat flowering stage was a good indicator of legume biomass at the end of the intercropping period. Rainfall was a limiting factor of legume growth between the end of the intercropping period and September.
   Legume density at wheat flowering and climatic conditions during the intercropping period thus appear to be good indicators to predict to capacity of cover crop to produce sufficient biomass in September. These indicators can be used by farmers as a management tool for the cover crop. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extended areas of the Mediterranean and semi-arid ecosystems are predicted to face decreased water availability, alongside increased human disturbances owing to an increase in population during this century. The use of geosimulations is instrumental for studying the expected ecosystem's response to predicted changes in habitat conditions due to the lack of field data at appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions over wide regional extents throughout sufficient time spans. Computational simulations, based on reaction-diffusion equations (RDE), were performed in order to quantitatively assess the form of shrubland pattern changes in response to decreasing and increasing rainfall regimes and during recovery following catastrophic removal of plants, which would result from fires or droughts. Patch pattern properties were analyzed using the Shannon Wiener fragmentation (SW) metric (= Sigma Si Ln Si, where Si is the area fraction of patch i of n patches) and the edge ratio (ER) metric (= sum of edge area/sum of patches' area). The SW fragmentation change during pattern formation is characterized by 3 phases, where in the first phase there is decreased fragmentation, and the third phase represents the evolution of equilibrium. The second phase is the most interesting one, where we have observed pattern regularization obtained by rearranging the shrubs' patches while increasing the fragmentation of the shrub patches. Such regularization phases seem to be a primary characteristic of self-organized behavior in these ecosystems. The general form of pattern properties change with decreasing or increasing rainfall according to SW fragmentation levels reached at equilibrium, which revealed a non-linear configuration with three divergence points. At these divergence points, the pattern evolution trajectories diverge according to the rainfall change rates. The most important divergence point occurs when rainfall drops below the critical desertification level. Whereas a slow reduction in rainfall would allow the shrub patches to be maintained below this critical rainfall level, rapid changes would cause immediate desertification. Edge ratios are closely linked to rainfall levels, and thus, they may provide early warnings and allow changes in the habitat conditions to be monitored due to climate changes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Canopy gaps modify the environmental conditions available for plant growth in forests. Small canopy gaps are frequent in Nothofagus betuloides forests of Tierra del Fuego. Our objective was to study whether the forest floor vascular and non-vascular plant species composition and diversity are influenced by the occurrence of small-scale disturbances due to changes in the below-canopy solar radiation transmittances and forest floor heterogeneity (cover of litter, bare soil and fallen woody debris classed in three decay stages) in a N. betuloides forest located in south western Tierra del Fuego (53 degrees 59'S, 69 degrees 58'W). The vegetation was sampled in and around 13 canopy gaps (47 m(2) on average). Following a light gradient, 65 plots (2 x 2 m) were established. The cover of all plant species was recorded using Londo's scale. Species richness and total cover were calculated for each of the following taxonomical groups: spermatophyta (monocotyledons, dicotyledons), pteridophyta, bryophyta, marchantiophyta, anthocerotophyta and lichens. There were 63 species found on the forest floor. Marchantiophyta was the most diverse group with the highest species richness (6.6 species per plot). The vegetation on the forest floor was very homogeneous in species composition, richness and species diversity. The ordination analysis (NMS) showed that the community composition was weakly influenced by the patterns of below-canopy solar radiation transmittances and substrate heterogeneity. MRPP analysis of the community composition did not reveal differences in plant species assemblages between positions along transects running from areas beneath closed canopy to the open centres of canopy gaps. The marchantiophyte Chiloscyphus magellanicus was the only species which can be considered to be an indicator species; it was more likely to occur in gap centres (more open conditions). We conclude that these small canopy gaps do not very much modify the forest floor communities and the communities can be considered relatively stable.

AB  - In fresh meat there exists not only a very close correlation (in direct proportion) between water and protein, even closer are associated (in inverse proportion) water and fat (r = -0,998). This relation is defined by the regression equation water (%) = 77 - fat (%) x 0.77. Therefore, based on the fat content of a meat/fat-mixture one can calculate the corresponding natural water amount very accurate. In a meat product the value exceeding this figure should be equivalent to added water. This consideration reflects the basis of the described method. If water is added to a meat/fat homogenate the composition will change. In this case the equation is not longer valid because it only can be used in fresh meat. Calculating step by step increasing amounts of added water out of the analytical values of the sample the fat content is raising continuously, whereas the water amount is falling. So these values are getting more and more equivalent to the natural conditions in meat. In this calculation there is one given point at which the fat/water-ratio of the equation is met (again). At this place the water amount calculated out reflects the added water content of the sample. Hence the regression equation is used as an indicator for having reached the natural conditions in meat before water addition. Besides added water, salt and spices meat products can also contain carbohydrates etc. In the same way as added water these additives will change the chemical composition of the sample. Therefore, the equation for calculating the amount of added water can only be used if the influence of these compounds is corrected as well. Theoretically this is valid for every additive. However, in practice only water and salt (sometimes carbohydrates) influence the composition of the sample considerably. The mathematical correction can be done easily. Practical experiments with products made out of pork and beef show that the amount of added water calculated on basis of the fat content corresponds throughout (clearly) better to the real content than the data received by the conventional method. The described procedure shows a more accurate and easily practicable alternative to the common added water calculation on basis of the water/protein-ratio.

AB  - We studied the floristic composition of lignicolous cryptogams (i.e. bryophytes and lichens inhabiting decaying wood) in the old-growth coniferous forests of southern coastal British Columbia. The composition of the cryptogams was related to forest communities (described by vegetation units using forest floor cryptogams and vascular plants) and regional climates (described by biogeoclimatic zones). The study is based on a total of 247 sample plots, each of 0.04 ha in size. The plots were located in three different biogeoclimatic zones and were classified into 12 alliances and four orders in a previous study. We used indicator species analysis to determine cryptogam indicator species for each vegetation unit and biogeoclimatic zone, and used similarity analysis and multivariate analyses (discriminant analysis and detrended correspondence analysis) to detect differences in the floristic composition of the cryptogams among sample plots, vegetation units, and biogeoclimatic zones. Most of the cryptogams in this study had a narrow distribution, and only < 5 % of the species were present across all the vegetation units and biogeoclimatic zones. The overall means of Jaccard coefficients between two sample plots from the same vegetation unit (alliance or order) or biogeoclimatic zone were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those from different vegetation units or biogeoclimatic zones. The difference in the mean Jaccard coefficients within- and between-units was highest for zones. The results of detrended correspondence analysis and discriminant analysis suggest that the composition of lignicolous cryptogams changes with the change in the floristic composition of forest floor vegetation. When the first axes of detrended correspondence analysis were compared, the Pearson's correlation coefficients between the first axes of lignicolous cryptogams and forest floor vascular plants and between the first axes of lignicolous cryptogams and forest floor cryptogams were 0.78 and 0.87, respectively. The degree of correspondence in the composition of lignicolous cryptogams and forest floor vegetation increased from alliance to order to biogeoclimatic zone. This trend suggests that the floristic composition of lignicolous cryptogams is influenced at the community level mainly by edaphic conditions and at the regional level by climatic conditions.

AB  - Detection of on farm and transport animal welfare problems at slaughterhouse level is a key issue for the meat industry; however, usually, the assessments do not include basic aspects of animal health. For that reason, it is necessary to develop an assessment method that has an integrative scope and identifies the risk profiles in an-imals. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to detect cattle welfare indicators that can be implemented at the slaughterhouse level and to develop integrated risk profiles based on the animal's origin, pre-slaughter lo-gistics, and animal-based indicators. We recorded the origin, commercial category, transportation details, and horn size of 1040 cattle upon arrival at the slaughterhouse. Cattle welfare was measured based on individual scores for vocalizations, stunning shots, carcass bruises, meat pH, severe hoof injuries, and organ condemnations. To characterize operational and logistic practices from the farm to the slaughterhouse, a two-step cluster analysis was applied to the aforementioned variables (production system, cattle type, horn size, journey distance, vehicle type), which identified four clusters: small feedlot and free-range profile (C1, n = 216, 20.8 %), feedlot profile (C2, n = 193, 18.6 %), culled dairy cows profile (C3, n = 262, 25.2 %), and free-range profile (C4, n = 369, 35.5 %). The animal's diet and environmental conditions might have influenced the development of hoof disorders in C1 animals (P = 0.023), the proportion of animals that were re-shot was highest in C2 animals (P = 0.033), and C3 and C4 animals were most likely to suffer injuries such as severe bruising (P = 0.001). In addition, the number of stunning shots, meat pH, carcass bruises, severe hoof injuries, and liver condemnations, explained a significant variation in the incidence of various health and welfare consequences based on an animal's origin, which confirmed their importance as 'welfare iceberg' indicators. The study provided detailed data that can be included into assessment methods for the welfare of slaughter cattle, which can be tailored to specific production systems.

AB  - A comprehensive in situ dataset of chlorophyll a (Chl a; N = 18,001), net primary production (NPP; N = 165) and net community production (NCP; N = 95), were used to evaluate the performance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on Aqua (MODIS-A) algorithms for these parameters, in the South Atlantic Ocean, to facilitate the accurate generation of satellite NCP time series. For Chl a, five algorithms were tested using MODISA data, and OC3-CI performed best, which was subsequently used to compute NPP. Of three NPP algorithms tested, a Wavelength Resolved Model (WRM) was the most accurate, and was therefore used to estimate NCP with an empirical relationship between NCP with NPP and sea surface temperature (SST). A perturbation analysis was deployed to quantify the range of uncertainties introduced in satellite NCP from input parameters. The largest reductions in the uncertainty of satellite NCP came from MODIS-A derived NPP using the WRM (40%) and MODIS-A Chl a using OC3-CI (22%).
   The most accurate NCP algorithm, was used to generate a 16 year time series (2002 to 2018) from MODIS-A to assess climate and environmental drivers of NCP across the South Atlantic basin. Positive correlations between wind speed anomalies and NCP anomalies were observed in the central South Atlantic Gyre (SATL), and the Benguela Upwelling (BENG), indicating that autotrophic conditions may be fuelled by local wind-induced nutrient inputs to the mixed layer. Sea Level Height Anomalies (SLHA), used as an indicator of mesoscale eddies, were negatively correlated with NCP anomalies offshore of the BENG upwelling fronts into the SATL, suggesting autotrophic conditions are driven by mesoscale features. The Agulhas bank and Brazil-Malvinas confluence regions also had a strong negative correlation between SLHA and NCP anomalies, similarly indicating that NCP is forced by mesoscale eddy generation in this region. Positive correlations between SST anomalies and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) in the SATL, indicated the influence of El Nino events on the South Atlantic Ocean, however the plankton community response was less clear.

AB  - Strong tornadoes are common for the European part of Russia but happen rather rare east of the Urals. June 2017 became an exceptional month when two tornado outbreaks occurred in the Ural region of Russia, yielded $3 million damage, and resulted in 1 fatality and 14 injuries. In this study, we performed detailed analysis of these outbreaks with different data. Tornadoes and tornado-related environments were diagnosed with news and eyewitness reports, ground-based meteorological observations, sounding data, global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models data, synoptic charts, satellite images, and data of specially conducted aerial imaging. We also estimated the accuracy of short-term forecasting of outbreaks with the WRF-ARW mesoscale atmospheric model, which was run in convection-permitting mode. We determined the formation of 28 tornadoes during the first outbreak (3 June 2017) and 9 tornadoes during the second outbreak (18 June 2017). We estimated their intensity using three different approaches and confirmed that, based on the International Fujita scale (IF), one of the tornadoes had the IF4 intensity, being the first IF4 tornado in Russia in the 21st century and the first-ever IF4 tornado reported beyond the Ural Mountains. The synoptic-scale analysis revealed the similarity of two outbreaks, which both formed near the polar front in the warm part of deepening southern cyclones. Such synoptic conditions yield mostly weak tornadoes in European Russia; however, our analysis indicates that these conditions are likely favorable for strong tornadoes over the Ural region. Meso-scale analysis indicates that the environments were favorable for tornado formation in both cases, and most severe-weather indicators exceeded their critical values. Our analysis demonstrates that for the Ural region, like for other regions of the world, combined use of the global NWP model outputs indicating high values of severe-weather indices and the WRF model forecast outputs explicitly simulating tornadic storm formation could be used to predict the high probability of strong tornado formation. For both analyzed events, the availability of such tornado warning forecast could help local authorities to take early actions on population protection.

AB  - The concern of cumulative demand of parboiled paddy dryings signposts the requirement of more optimized and mechanized processing. The study was conducted to fulfill the requirements of an efficient heat pump (HP) dryer unit for paddy drying in subtropical monsoon climate region of China, by utilizing the different hot air circulation methods and environmental conditions in the winter season. Therefore, a newly designed HP drying test bench enhanced with a series of heat pumps was employed for parboiled paddy drying of different varieties and sample loads. The drying efficiency and performance of HP was assessed in terms of specific moisture evaporation rate (SMER), moisture evaporation rate (MER), and coefficient of performance (COP) in closed and open-loop cycles. The closed and open-loop cycles hot air dryings were employed with the temperature and velocity ranges of 50-60C and 2-3 m/s, respectively. Furthermore, SMER and MER for both varieties and COP in closed and open loops were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The findings of the study revealed the dependency of SMER and MER on the temperature and velocity, as minimum SMER and MER were witnessed at 47.93C and 2.5 m/s, while COP in closed loop (2.211) was higher than that of the open cycle (1.409) due to the entrance of a significant amount of ambient air into the designed system during each cycle. Moreover, the intended parameters were optimized by exploiting RSM and were as follows: 60C (drying temperature), 2.76 m/s (air velocity), 0.321 (SMER1), 1.318 (SMER2), 0.208 (OSMER1), 0.865 kg/kWh (OSMER2), 0.202 (MER1), 0.796 (MER2), 0.180 (OMER1), 0.689 kg/h (OMER2), 2.211 (COP-closed), and 1.409 (COP-open). We further perceived that the temperature has more effect on the drying efficiency compared to air velocity as performance indicators were found to be increased by lofting the temperature profiles. The confidence of interval was observed significant (5%) as we equated the optimized values with experimental values, that particularly offerings our study a valuable to achieve a high quality of parboiled paddy.

AB  - Integrated conservation and management of agricultural areas affected by the current global warming represents a priority at international level following the implementation of the principles of sustainable agriculture and adaptation measures. Transylvanian Plain (TP), with an area of 395,616 ha is of great agricultural importance for Romania, but with an afforestation degree of only 6.8% and numerous degradation phenomena of farmland, it has the lowest degree of sustainability to climate change. Monitoring of agro-climatic indicators and their evolution in between 2008-2014 and the analysis of the obtained data underlie the technological development of recommendations tailored to current favorable conditions for the main crops. Results obtained show that: the thermal regime of the soils in TP is of mesic type and the hydric regime is ustic; multiannual average of temperature in soil at 10 cm depth is 11.40 degrees C, respectively at 50 cm depth is 10.24 degrees C; the average yearly air temperature is 11.17 degrees C; multiannual average of soil moisture is 0.227 m(3)/m(3); Multiannual average value of precipitation is 466.52 mm. During the studied period, compared with data series available (1961-1990; 1901-2000), clear decrease of the average quantities of rainfall especially during critical periods for crops, and increases in average temperatures for the entire year can be noticed. Between June and August the highest temperature difference were recorded, differences of +3.09 degrees C to +3.65 degrees C. There is an increase phenomenon of drought and heat; determined indicators show that most values, 61.11%, are commensurate with a semiarid climate. Aggression peaks are in February-April, July, and October-November, and for the whole period, in 19.43% of the cases are favorable and very favorable conditions for triggering erosion. Recommended ago-technical measures to limit and counteract the effects of drought, as a climatic phenomenon with major risk to agriculture in TP, refer to: i) use of a biological material resistant to water stress and heat; use of management practices favorable for accumulation of, conservation and the efficient use of water from rainfall; iii) operating a system of conservation agriculture based on soil protection and desertification avoidance.

AB  - Questions: Can we improve understanding of vegetation response to water availability on monthly time scales in semi-arid environments using remote sensing methods? What climatic or water balance variables and antecedent windows of time associated with these variables best relate to the condition of vegetation? Can we develop credible near-term forecasts from climate data that can be used to prepare for future climate change effects on vegetation?
   Location: Semi-arid grasslands in Capitol Reef National Park, Utah, USA.
   Methods: We built vegetation response models by relating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from MODIS imagery in Mar-Nov 2000-2013 to antecedent climate and water balance variables preceding the monthly NDVI observations. We compared how climate and water balance variables explained vegetation greenness and then used a multi-model ensemble of climate and water balance models to forecast monthly NDVI for three holdout years.
   Results: Water balance variables explained vegetation greenness to a greater degree than climate variables for most growing season months. Seasonally important variables included measures of antecedent water input and storage in spring, switching to indicators of drought, input or use in summer, followed by antecedent moisture availability in autumn. In spite of similar climates, there was evidence the grazed grassland showed a response to drying conditions 1 mo sooner than the ungrazed grassland. Lead times were generally short early in the growing season and antecedent window durations increased from 3 mo early in the growing season to 1 yr or more as the growing season progressed. Forecast accuracy for three holdout years using a multi-model ensemble of climate and water balance variables outperformed forecasts made with a naive NDVI climatology.
   Conclusions: We determined the influence of climate and water balance on vegetation at a fine temporal scale, which presents an opportunity to forecast vegetation response with short lead times. This understanding was obtained through high-frequency vegetation monitoring using remote sensing, which reduces the costs and time necessary for field measurements and can lead to more rapid detection of vegetation changes that could help managers take appropriate actions.

AB  - This paper explores the vegetation signals contained in the non-arboreal pollen and spore (NAPS) components of pollen assemblages from Tauber traps placed in woodlands subject to rotational cutting (coppicing) in lowland England. Sets of three Tauber traps were placed in compartments of different ages at multiple locations within each woodland for 1 year, and pollen assemblages recorded along with a vegetation survey using a modified pin-frame method in an area of 10 m radius around each trap array. Cluster analysis suggests that, as expected, the ground layer vegetation broadly reflects the different environmental conditions in the three woods, with the main subdivisions within woods apparently driven by changes in ground cover between the early and late stages of the coppice cycle. Non-arboreal pollen and spores (NAPS) assemblages group according to woodland of origin, with subdivisions which relate to pollen abundance but lack a simple relationship with years since cutting. Indices of Association between NAPS records and plant presence in the area around each array were calculated using presence-absence data for multiple distances of vegetation survey. All values tend towards an asymptote, which is interpreted as implying an effective source area for the single taxon presence-absence indicator values of ground flora taxa in coppiced woodlands on the order of a 10 m radius. Only four taxa, Poaceae, Ranunculus acris-type, Cyperaceae, and Scilla-type, have an Index of Association (A) greater than 0.5, implying that the presence of pollen can be interpreted in terms of the local presence of the relevant plant taxon with some confidence. Estimates of Pollen Productivity relative to Poaceae are presented for five taxa: Apiaceae, Asteraceae (Cardueae), Cyperaceae, Mercurialis perennis, and Scilla-type.
   Years since cutting does affect the ground vegetation and NAPS assemblage trapped in these woods, but that the effect is more clearly seen at an assemblage level in the vegetation than in the pollen assemblages. The interpretative significance of NAPS taxa does not seem to be in providing information about the local conditions around the sampling point, but in reflecting the ground flora of the wider woodland.

AB  - To quantify the relative proportions of Ce3+ and Ce4+ in natural magmas, we have synthesized a series of Ce doped glasses ranging in composition from basalt to rhyolite (+/- H2O) at 0.001 and 1 GPa, under fO(2) conditions varying from FMQ -4.0 to FMQ +8.4, and temperatures from 1200 to 1500 degrees C. The Ce4+/Ce3+ ratio in the experimental run products was determined both potentiometrically and in situ, using Ce M-4,M-5-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. For a given melt composition, the change in Ce4+/Ce3+ ratio with fO(2) follows the trend predicted from the reaction stoichiometry assuming simple oxides as melt species. In addition to fO(2), melt composition and water content have been found to be secondary controls on Ce4+/Ce3+, with more depolymerized melts and hydrous compositions favoring the stabilization of Ce3+. The Ce4+/Ce3+ ratio can be expressed through the equation,
   log CeO2/CeO3/2 = 1/4 log fO(2) + 5705(+/- 257)/T - 0.8990(+/- 0.0805)NBO/T
   -3.856(+/- 0.083) center dot xH(2)O - 3: 889(+/- 0.037)
   where T is in Kelvin, NBO/T is the proportion of non-bridging oxygen to tetrahedrally coordinated cations, and xH(2)O is the mole fraction (calculated using molecular oxides, e.g. Al2O3, Na2O) of water dissolved in the melt. A recent study conducted by Burnham and Berry (2014, Chemical Geology) investigating Ce oxidation state in silicate melts using Ce L-3-edge XANES, equilibrated under a subset of the conditions investigated here, showed a similar dependence of Ce4+/Ce3+ on T and fO(2), however, melt composition was found to have the opposite effect, with decreasing melt polymerization resulting in an increased abundance of Ce4+. This apparent discrepancy likely arises from the presence of alkalies and H2O in the compositions presented in this study, which were absent in the study of Burnham and Berry (2014). Our results indicate that even at relatively low oxygen fugacity, trace amounts of Ce4+ will be present in most terrestrial igneous systems, suggesting that Ce partitioning could be a sensitive indicator of fO(2).

AB  - The simulation of unstable invasion patterns in porous media flow is very challenging because small perturbations are amplified, so that slight differences in geometry or initial conditions result in significantly different invasion structures at later times. We present a detailed comparison of pore-scale simulations and experiments for unstable primary drainage in porous micromodels. The porous media consist of Hele-Shaw cells containing cylindrical obstacles. By means of soft lithography, we have constructed two experimental flow cells, with different degrees of heterogeneity in the grain size distribution. As the defending (wetting) fluid is the most viscous, the interface is destabilized by viscous forces, which promote the formation of preferential flow paths in the form of a branched finger structure. We model the experiments by solving the Navier-Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation in the discretized pore space and employ the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method to track the evolution of the interface. We test different numerical models (a 2-D vertical integrated model and a full-3-D model) and different initial conditions, studying their impact on the simulated spatial distributions of the fluid phases. To assess the ability of the numerical model to reproduce unstable displacement, we compare several statistical and deterministic indicators. We demonstrate the impact of three main sources of error: (i) the uncertainty on the pore space geometry, (ii) the fact that the initial phase configuration cannot be known with an arbitrarily small accuracy, and (iii) three-dimensional effects. Although the unstable nature of the flow regime leads to different invasion structures due to small discrepancies between the experimental setup and the numerical model, a pore-by-pore comparison shows an overall satisfactory match between simulations and experiments. Moreover, all statistical indicators used to characterize the invasion structures are in excellent agreement. This validates the modeling approach, which can be used to complement experimental observations with information about quantities that are difficult or impossible to measure, such as the pressure and velocity fields in the two fluid phases.

AB  - Biochar is charcoal made from waste biomass and intended to be added to soil to improve soil function and reduce emissions from the biomass caused by natural degradation to CO2. Nitrogen (N) forms in biochar can be complex and their lability likely to be influenced by pyrolysis temperature which, together with the nature of carbon (C), will influence N mineralisation or immobilisation. These complex relationships are poorly understood, yet impact strongly on the potential agronomic value of biochar. In this study, N in different biochar samples produced from human and animal waste streams (biosolids and cow manure; each mixed with eucalyptus wood chips in a 1:1 dry wt. ratio) at different pyrolysis conditions (highest heating temperature 250, 350, 450 and 550 degrees C) was extracted with 6 M HCl. The acid hydrolysable, extractable N (THN) was fractionated into ammonia N (AN), amino acid N (AAN), amino sugar N (ASN) and uncharacterisable hydrolysable N (UHN). Biochar samples were also treated with 0.167 M K2Cr2O7 acid to determine N potentially available in the long term. An incubation study of the different biochar samples mixed with acid washed sand was conducted at 32 degrees C for 81 days to study both C and N turnover. During incubation, the CO2 released was trapped in NaOH and quantified. Hydrolysable N decreased as pyrolysis temperature increased from 250 to 550 degrees C. Fractionation into AN, AAN, ASN and UHN revealed progressive structural rearrangement of N with pyrolysis temperature. Based on HCl hydrolysis and dichromate oxidation results, C and N in biochar became more stable as pyrolysis temperature increased. The ratio of volatile C to THN was a useful indicator of whether net N mineralisation or immobilisation of N in biochar occurred. THN thus seems a sound estimate of the labile N fraction in biochar in the short term; however, dichromate-oxidisable N is probably more meaningful in the long run. Further studies using different types of biochar need to be conducted under more realistic conditions to obtain more information on N availability in biochar once in soil. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pebble-sized sandstone concretions, cemented by iron and manganese oxides, are found in several semi-arid regions in the world. Although recognized for a long time, their formation mechanisms have not yet been constrained from scientific studies. We have made extensive studies of the chemical composition, cosmogenic (10)Be and radiogenic U/Th concentrations, and biological fossils in ironstones from six sites in southern California. The ironstones exhibit appreciable enrichments of Mn, Zn, Mg, Ti, Fe, U, Th, and fossil bacteria. In addition to elemental data, we report here first observations of radionuclides, U, Th, K, and concentrations of cosmogenic (10)Be which we show are an excellent indicator of precipitation amounts. Our data favor the model that the ironstones formed within sandy beach ridges during wetter climates following dry climates during which aeolian sediment was added to the beach ridges. Iron, Mn, Zn and other trace element-rich leachates from the dust layers nurtured and accelerated bacterial activity in the beach ridges down to depths of a few meters, as first suggested by Abbott (1981). Our observations of trace-element enrichments and bacterial fossils support the model proposed by Abbott and underscore the fact that the ironstones are principally a product of bacterial activity, which concentrates the leachates in a narrow layer within the beach ridges. The extreme alternating dry/wet climatic conditions which existed in the past in southern California led to the formation of ironstone concretions within the ancient beach ridges, which provided suitable host mineralogy for their formation. The time periods represented by the ironstones from the six sites presumably cover the past similar to 1 my. The recent surface explorations on the surface of Mars by the rovers SPIRIT and OPPORTUNITY (Squyres et al., 2006), showed that similar to southern California, extreme climatic conditions existed on Mars in its early history. It therefore seems that studies of ironstones may provide useful clues to the evolution of soils on Mars in such extreme climates, and possibly even provide criteria to evaluate whether any bacterial activity was present at that time.

AB  - Providing continuously-housed dairy cows with a loafing area may allow them space to express behaviours that are affected by the housing environment. The aim of this study was to investigate whether dairy cows had a preference for loafing area type and if loafing area type affected behaviour performed within it. Three groups of 12 and one group of 11 lactating cows (n = 47) were housed in a cubicle shed with two nearby loafing areas 1) a concrete-floored roofed area and 2) a grassed paddock fenced to the same size as the concrete area. After 3d baseline period without access, cows were trained to access the loafing areas over 2 days. A 5d preference test followed, where cows had free access to the cubicle shed and both loafing areas from 08:45 until 12:45 and 15:30-18:30. Behaviour was observed via live observations (scan sampling) in the mornings and afternoons and activity sensors (IceTags) continuously recorded lying bouts 24 h/d until the end of the experiment. Results of the live observations showed that the cows were in the paddock area for more of the scans than the concrete area (P < 0.01). Descriptive statistics showed cows behaving differently in the two areas, lying down more when in the paddock area and standing more when in the concrete area (lying behaviour: paddock area = 69%; concrete area = 0%). Active behaviours (loafing behaviours) such as social interactions were recorded in both loafing areas (active standing behaviour: paddock area = 8%; concrete area = 23%). The weather and ground conditions affected behaviour. In dry conditions, cows lay down in the paddock area. When the ground was saturated, the cows lay down in the cubicle shed. There was no statistical evidence of overall differences in behaviours (P = 0.35) recorded during the baseline and preference testing periods. However, based on sensor data, cows had longer lying bouts over 24 h on the days when they had access to the loafing areas compared to the days when they did not (P = 0.028). This suggests that cows prefer paddock loafing areas to concrete areas when lying opportunities are presented, but proportionately, more active standing or 'loafing' behaviours are performed in the concrete area.

AB  - First results of strontium, calcium, carbon and oxygen isotope analyses of bulk carbonates from a 106 m long sediment record of Laguna Potrok Aike, located in southern Patagonia are presented. Morphological and isotopic investigations of mu m-sized carbonate crystals in the sediment reveal an endogenic origin for the entire Holocene. During this time period the calcium carbonate record of Laguna Potrok Aike turned out to be most likely ikaite-derived. As ikaite precipitation in nature has only been observed in a narrow temperature window between 0 and 7 degrees C, the respective carbonate oxygen isotope ratios serve as a proxy of hydrological variations rather than of palaeotemperatures. We suggest that oxygen isotope ratios are sensitive to changes of the lake water balance induced by intensity variations of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies and discuss the role of this wind belt as a driver for climate change in southern South America. In combination with other proxy records the evolution of westerly wind intensities is reconstructed. Our data suggest that weak SHW prevailed during the Lateglacial and the early Holocene, interrupted by an interval with strengthened Westerlies between 13.4 and 11.3 ka cal BP. Wind strength increased at 9.2 ka cal BP and significantly intensified until 7.0 ka cal BP. Subsequently, the wind intensity diminished and stabilised to conditions similar to present day after a period of reduced evaporation during the "Little Ice Age". Strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio) were identified as a potential lake-level indicator and point to a lowering from overflow conditions during the Glacial (similar to 17 ka cal BP) to lowest lake levels around 8 ka cal BP. Thereafter the strontium isotope curve resembles the lake-level curve which is stepwise rising until the "Little Ice Age". The variability of the Ca isotope composition of the sediment reflects changes in the Ca budget of the lake, indicating higher degrees of Ca utilisation during the period with lowest lake level.

AB  - Pneumatic actuators and electric actuators have almost been applied to all manufacturing industries. The two kinds of actuators can replace each other in most fields, such as the point to point transmission occasion and some rotating occasions. However, there are very few research results about the advantages and disadvantages of two kinds of actuators under the same working conditions so far. In this paper, a novel comprehensive assessment method, named as overall life cycle comprehensive assessment (OLCCA), is proposed for comparison and assessment of pneumatic and electric actuators. OLCCA contains mechanical properties evaluation (MPE), life cycle cost analysis based on users (LCCABOU) and life cycle environmental impact analysis (LCEIA) algorithm in order to solve three difficult problems: mechanical properties assessment, cost analysis and environmental impact assessment about actuators. The mechanical properties evaluation of actuators is a multi-objective optimization problem. The fuzzy data quantification and information entropy methods are combined to establish MPE algorithm of actuators. Two kinds of pneumatic actuators and electric actuators with similar bearing capacity and similar work stroke were taken for example to verify the correctness of MPE algorithm. The case study of MPE algorithm for actuators verified its correctness. LCCABOU for actuators is also set up. Considering cost complex structure of pneumatic actuators, public device cost even method (PDCEM) is firstly presented to solve cost division of public devices such as compressors, aftercooler, receivers, etc. LCCABOU method is also effective and verified by the three groups of pneumatic actuators and electric actuators. Finally, LCEIA model of actuators is established for the environmental impact assessment of actuators. LCEIA data collection method and model establishment procedure for actuators are also put forward. With Simapro 7, LCEIA comparison results of six actuators can be obtained: Fossil fuels are the major environmental factor of pneumatic and electric actuators; Environmental impact of electric actuator is large than one of pneumatic actuator under the similar mechanical properties and working conditions of pneumatic and electric actuators. The results are correct and correspond with the actual mechanical properties of actuators. This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation method of the actuators, which can solve the critical problem that similar electromechanical products are very difficult to be compared with each other from the angle of performance, cost and environment impact.

AB  - One of the main factors in increasing the efficiency of milk production is the breed. No breed in the world would be ideal for a variety of conditions and technological processes. Besides, like any biological system, the breed is in continuous change. The breed of cattle largely determines both the level of milk production and the quality of milk. Therefore, to improve the quality of milk, it is necessary to establish the degree of influence of zootechnical and technological factors on the condition of milk components. Among genetic factors, the breed of animals and the breed combination have a significant influence. During the research, a one-way analysis of variance of the breed's influence and breed combinations on productive indicators has been analyzed. The factor "breed" and "breed combination" were used as the analyzed factor, and the protein content in milk and the yield of milk protein was used as the dependent factor. Based on one-way and multi-way ANOVA, the degree of influence of the factors under study was assessed. It has been established that the breed has a significant, both direct and combined with other factors, influence on the protein content in milk and the yield of milk protein. The level of the breed's direct influence on the protein content is 1.0%, on the milk protein yield - 1.7%. The factors "father" and "calving number" have the most substantial combined effect. Their influence levels are 1.8%, 1.4%, respectively, with a high level of reliability (P>0.999). The same factors most influence the milk protein yield as the protein content (the levels of influence are 1.9%, 1.3%, respectively) with a high level of reliability (P>0.999). As a result of analyzing the data on changes in protein content and milk protein yield in cows of different breed combinations, it can be concluded that this factor can describe 4.5% of the variability in protein content and 11.4% of milk protein yield (P>0.999). The degree of joint influence of breed combinations with other studied factors was up to 6.6%.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important indicator of resource and environment changes in coastal wetlands and exhibits considerable spatiotemporal variations under multiple influences of intensive landesea interaction and various human activities. Revealing the multi-temporal characteristics of LST and its relationships with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture content (MC) in coastal wetlands is important for identifying the LST variations under complex factors, the heat effects of different human exploitations, and the corresponding changes in vegetation and soil water conditions. The Yellow River Delta, a typical and important coastal wetland in China, was selected to demonstrate the study. Remote sensing and field investigation served as the data source, and the LST spatiotemporal patterns and their intrinsic correlations with NDVI and MC in the last 30 years and across different seasons were analyzed. Results indicated that LST spatial distributions varied in different years and seasons. In 1987, LST was low along the Yellow River and high in alongshore areas; in 2016, LST was distinctly low in most of the alongshore areas and high in urban and industrial areas. Across seasons, LST differences between alongshore and inner areas were more distinct in spring that in the other seasons, and LST in urban and industrial areas was especially higher than that in other areas in summer. Among different land covers, salt pond generated cool island effect, whereas urban and industrial areas generated heat island effect. Significant correlations were observed between LST and NDVI at regional scale and among LST, NDVI, and MC at site scale, and their relationships varied in different land cover types across different times. The changes in shorelines, land covers, and vegetation and soil conditions jointly determined the LST spatiotemporal patterns, and human activity has been the main driving factor.

AB  - The hot summer of 2018 posed many challenges with regard to water shortages and yield losses, especially for agricultural production. These agricultural impacts might further pose consequent threats for the environment. In this paper, we deduce the impact of droughts on agricultural land management and on water quality owing to nitrate pollution. Using national statistics, we calculate a Germany-wide soil surface nitrogen budget for 2018 and deduce the additional N surplus owing to the dry weather conditions. Using a model farm approach, we compare fertilization practices and legal restrictions for arable and pig breeding farms. The results show that, nationwide, at least 464 kt of nitrogen were not transferred to plant biomass in 2018, which equals an additional average nitrogen surplus of 30 kg/ha. The surplus would even have amounted to 43 kg/ha, if farmers had continued their fertilization practice from preceding years, but German farmers applied 161 kt less nitrogen in 2018 than in the year before, presumably as a result of the new implications of the Nitrates Directive, and, especially on grassland, owing to the drought. As nitrogen surplus is regarded as an "agri-drinking water indicator" (ADWI), an increase of the surplus entails water pollution with nitrates. The examples of the model farms show that fertilization regimes with high shares of organic fertilizers produce higher nitrogen surpluses. Owing to the elevated concentrations on residual nitrogen in soils, the fertilization needs of crops in spring 2019 were less pronounced than in preceding years. Thus, the quantity of the continuously produced manure in livestock farms puts additional pressure on existing storage capacities. This may particularly be the case in the hot-spot regions of animal breeding in the north-west of Germany, where manure production, biogas plants, and manure imports are accumulating. The paper concludes that water shortages under climate change not only impact agricultural production and yields, but also place further challenges and threats to nutrient management and the environment. The paper discusses preventive and emergency management options for agriculture to support farmers in extremely dry and hot conditions.

AB  - The goal of the paper is to assess changes in the regional differentiation of life expectancy in Russia for 2003-2017, to consider the features of the level and growth rate of life expectancy, gender differences in the indicator, the difference between urban and rural areas, the structure of mortality due to death, the level of infant mortality in the regions of Russia; the paper also defines regional reserves for further increase in life expectancy. The relevance of the topic is due to significant regional differentiation, Russia's significant lagging behind developed countries, and the goals associated with this field. We arrange Russian regions into nine groups with annual intervals of the indicator and evaluate the changes in the groups in 2003-2017. We find out that in the conditions of growing life expectancy there has been a marked convergence of regions; they approached the Russian average level according to this indicator. Regional convergence has occurred at the expense of the extreme groups in terms of the indicator, and primarily due to the lagging regions getting closer to the leaders; i.e. we observe the catch-up nature of convergence. This suggests that over the period of 2004-2017, the relatively easy-to-implement life expectancy growth reserves, which are typical for low-indicator regions, have been used quite well, while further growth in high-indicator regions is not an easy task, since the possibilities of first-order factors, such as gender differentiation, the difference between urban and rural indicators, the share of mortality from external causes, and infant mortality rate, have been largely implemented. Nevertheless, all nine groups of regions still have reserves to increase life expectancy, due to certain growth factors of the first order. The groups with the most unfavorable level of the indicator have the greatest reserves. However, factors such as the lag in the rural indicator and the value of infant mortality in the group with very high life expectancy provide opportunities for further increase due to growth factors of the first order.

AB  - 1. Many animals and plant species have advanced spring phenology in response to climate warming. The majority of avian phenological studies are based on arrival dates. Consequently, knowledge on bird phenology is mainly based on migratory species. In addition, arrival dates of migratory birds may be substantially affected by en route climate conditions, thus failing to provide good indicators for spring phenology on the breeding grounds. Correlating arrival dates with other phenological data or with environmental covariates may be meaningless in these cases.
   2. We propose the date of highest singing activity, quantified by detection probability, as a powerful proxy for breeding phenology that is applicable to migratory and sedentary bird species alike. In contrast to arrival dates, breeding phenology is mainly (non-migrants) or at least partially (migrants) influenced by conditions experienced within the breeding area.
   3. We developed a new method for flexible estimation of peak detectability date in spring by combining multiseason site occupancy with semi-parametric regression modelling (thin-plate splines). We applied our approach to opportunistic observations of 27 bird species (mostly passerines) in Switzerland.
   4. We found substantial differences among species in the date of spring peak detectability: late February to mid-April in sedentary and short-distance migratory species and mid-April to late May in long-distance migrants. Among 10 species with data for > 9 years, five showed a trend in detectability peaks towards an earlier spring phenology by nine to 17 days within 10 years. The mean shift over all species was c. 3.5 days per 10 years.
   5. Our approach is widely applicable, especially for temporally and spatially large-scale data from monitoring or citizen-science programmes. Besides using the detectability peak as measure of phenology, the estimated seasonal pattern in detectability can help designing monitoring programmes for improved efficiency. Our approach may be applied to any species with pronounced acoustic displays or other behavioural traits strongly influencing detectability during the breeding period. We believe that it can contribute substantially to unravelling how species and communities respond to environmental change.

AB  - The objective of this reseach is to investigate the growth and reproduction of Eisenia fetida during vermicomposting of organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Furthermore the research was intended to assess the applicability of vermicomposting as an alternative recycling process for conversion of OFMSW to a useful stabilized nutrient rich end product. This research was performed in 24 L containes (as experimental units) and in a complete randomized design with five level of substrate mixture consisting of pretreated OFMSW and cow manure (CM) in per cent ratios of: 20:80,40:60,60:40,80:20 and 100:0, respectively, on the basis of total dry matter. The units with 100 % OFMSW were considered as control ones. The experimental period lasted 80 days. The change in number and biomass of adult earthworms, measured at the beginning and at the end of the experimental work was used to evaluate the difference in growth and reproduction of Eisenia fetida under various experimental conditions. Other parameters such as temperature, pH, moisture content and C/N ratio were measured regularly to observe the change in environmental and operational conditions. Statistical assessment of the results was done using SPSS software. The results of the research indicated that a pretreatment step (e.g., undergoing conventional composting for a period of 21 days) was required for OFMSW prior to its use as a substrate in vermicomposting process. The results also showed a considerable increase in the number and biomass of E. fetida in all the experimental units. However, the rate of increase varied significantly (p < 0.05) between different units. The growth and reproduction of E. fetida was found to be significantly affected by the proportion of OFMSW in the substrate mixture; increasing as the amount of OFMSW was increased. The best result (211 % increase in number and 468 % increase in weight of the earthworms) occured in the units with only pretreated OFMSW as substrate indicating that, without the need for any additives, the process of vermicomposting can be used as an alternative method in management and recycling of organic fraction of municipal solid waste.

AB  - Sustainable land use under climate change requires detailed knowledge of the system dynamics. This applies particularly for the management of domestic livestock in semi-arid and arid grazing systems, where the risk of degradation is high and likely climate change may have a strong impact. A suitable way to assess potential future trends of these complex systems is through the application of simulation models.
   We reviewed 41 models published between 1995 and 2005 simulating semi-arid and arid livestock grazing systems. The models were categorized according to the model aim and type, their temporal and spatial scale, and several indicators of model complexity. Additionally, we developed a list of model requirements for adequately simulating the effects of climate change. Based on these requirements, we evaluated the potential of current models to simulate impacts of climate change and determine important shortcomings.
   Three general model types could be distinguished, namely state and transition, difference and differential equation, and rule-based models. Over time, we found that the number of models aiming to improve management strategies increased, while there were fewer models that aimed to understand system dynamics. This was accompanied by a trend to simplify model descriptions of hydrological relationships.
   Important shortcomings of current models included the impact of increased CO2 levels on plant productivity and the ability to resolve changes in intra-annual precipitation patterns. The consideration of both external drivers is crucial under climate change, hence sustainable long-term decision making is currently lacking important information.
   Synthesis and applications. Sustainable livestock management in semi-arid and arid systems requires knowledge about effects of future climate change to adjust livestock density adequately. Producers' experiences from current weather conditions are not necessarily transferable to future conditions, thus models could help to support management. However, an analysis of current models has shown that few existing models are able to assess the impacts of the predicted climate change. Therefore, we call for the development of new dynamic grazing models that provide land managers with the necessary tools to face the threat of future climate changes.

In order to characterize the depositional environment of this level, a sedimentological, organic and inorganic geochemical study was performed on 30 samples. Three units are distinguished. Unit 1 consists of black marlstones, very rich in organic carbon (22-30%) with HI (hydrogen index) values around 600. The organic matter is an amorphous homogeneous material even at nanoscopic scale. This unit is also characterized by a very high concentration of V ( >1000 p.p.m.) and a delta(13)C(org) value around -26.5 parts per thousand. Unit 2 shows thin-bedded black limestones with chert layers. Its organic content varies from 2% to 6%. As in unit 1, the HI values are uniformly high (600), and gas chromatography shows a high quantity of hopanes. The V concentration is also high (approximate to 400 p.p.m.). The unit has a high Sr/Ca ratio, an organic carbon isotopic ratio close to -28.7 parts per thousand, and diffuse, nanoscopically amorphous organic material that is closely associated with pyrite. Unit 3 corresponds to the white limestones overlying the 'black band'. This calcitic facies is almost devoid of organic carbon (<0.1%). The delta(13)C(org) values are similar to those of unit 1 (-25.5 parts per thousand to -26 parts per thousand). Deposition occurred in a basinal environment surrounded by a carbonate platform. Primary productivity was high but not exceptional; terrestrial organic inputs were scarce. Bottom waters were probably euxinic during the deposition of unit 1. The presence of bath hopane-rich and sulphur-rich nanoscopically amorphous organic matter may be the result of strong sulphate-reducing bacterial activity. Coupled with low amounts of iron, this led to intense vulcanization of the organic matter and thus good preservation. With the onset of unit 2 deposition, environmental conditions became less extreme, perhaps because of cooler water temperatures. Finally, the depositional conditions became oxic, leading to the accumulation of pale-coloured organic-poor limestones of unit 3.

AB  - Spatial distributions of vegetation cover are closely related to topographical characters like slope, steepness, soil types, elevations, etc. In seismo-tectonic regions fault lines or tectonic lineaments are the most prominent surface signatures that can be reflected by vegetation distribution as tectonic displacement causes the change of topographical parameters. In the present study a part of northern Baromura hill (between 23A(0) 42'A N to 23A(0)49 N latitudes and 91A(0)30 E to 91A(0)36 E longitudes), which is considered as an active seismo-tectonic region of Tripura as well as northeast India, was selected for assessing the relationship between spatial variation of plant cover and topography. Geologically, Baromura hill is a north-south extended fold belt and formed by late Tertiary to Quaternary depositions. Evidences show that tectonic events played very important role in landform evolution of this area during the geological past. In this research an extensive fieldwork was conducted in the study area to understand the geomorphic and vegetation signatures and their environmental relationships. Various spectral resolutions of Landsat ETM+ were used for digital analysis. To analyse the vegetation character of this area digital operation was done within the spectral range 0.63-1.75 mu m. Band 4 and band 3 were used for NDVI operation. Band 5 or mid-wave infrared band was classified in unsupervised mode to understand the range of plant water in the study area. Overlay operation with those operated images shows the spatial distribution pattern of vegetation cover indicates the landform condition. Three clear tectonic lineaments (faults) were detected from the digital study in on the northern part Baromura hill. Structural conditions of those fault lines were verified by geo-electrical survey during fieldwork. GPS tool was used for fixing the ground control points. Resistivity characters of the study area assessed from VES profile strongly supports that vegetation cover analysis from remotely sensed data within 0.63-1.75 mu m spectral ranges can be a very useful tool for detecting surface tectonic signatures of the landform.

AB  - The ongoing changes to climate challenge the conservation of forest biodiversity. Yet, in thermally limited systems, such as temperate forests, not all species groups might be affected negatively. Furthermore, simultaneous changes in the disturbance regime have the potential to mitigate climate-related impacts on forest species. Here, we (i) investigated the potential long-term effect of climate change on biodiversity in a mountain forest landscape, (ii) assessed the effects of different disturbance frequencies, severities and sizes and (iii) identified biodiversity hotspots at the landscape scale to facilitate conservation management. We employed the model iLand to dynamically simulate the tree vegetation on 13865ha of the Kalkalpen National Park in Austria over 1000years, and investigated 36 unique combinations of different disturbance and climate scenarios. We used simulated changes in tree cover and composition as well as projected temperature and precipitation to predict changes in the diversity of Araneae, Carabidae, ground vegetation, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Mollusca, saproxylic beetles, Symphyta and Syrphidae, using empirical response functions. Our findings revealed widely varying responses of biodiversity indicators to climate change. Five indicators showed overall negative effects, with Carabidae, saproxylic beetles and tree species diversity projected to decrease by more than 33%. Six indicators responded positively to climate change, with Hymenoptera, Mollusca and Syrphidae diversity projected to increase more than twofold. Disturbances were generally beneficial for the studied indicators of biodiversity. Our results indicated that increasing disturbance frequency and severity have a positive effect on biodiversity, while increasing disturbance size has a moderately negative effect. Spatial hotspots of biodiversity were currently found in low- to mid-elevation areas of the mountainous study landscape, but shifted to higher-elevation zones under changing climate conditions.Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight that intensifying disturbance regimes may alleviate some of the impacts of climate change on forest biodiversity. However, the projected shift in biodiversity hotspots is a challenge for static conservation areas. In this regard, overlapping hotspots under current and expected future conditions highlight priority areas for robust conservation management.

AB  - The effect of filter media on groundwater quality changes was studied for 6 months. The test system was continuously supplied with groundwater from well, at a constant speed from top to bottom and filter deposits were open to provide contact with air. Filter beds during the study period were not washed. The subject of the study were three beds (Z1, Z2 and Z3) with different filter materials: Z1, Z3 were filled only with an alkaline material, which provided to reduction the corrosivity of water, Z2 - outside alkalising materials also included sand, thus increasing removal efficiency of iron and phosphate ions
   Analysis of water physico-chemical parameters include pH, temperature, total alkalinity, intensity of colour, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and the content of: iron, iron (II) and (III), aggressive carbon dioxide, inorganic nitrogen forms (Ninorg), ie NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, phosphate and total organic carbon. Bacteriological analysis of water samples was based on the total number of psychrophilic bacteria, having an optimum temperature for growth about 22 degrees C, and mesophilic (37 degrees C). All analyses were made in accordance with current standards. Groundwater was characterized by high volatility of most of the analyzed indicators of water quality.
   Due to the low flow velocity of water through the filtration beds and presence of dissolved oxygen in water, there was conditions for microbial growth in the deposits. There were a growth conditions for biofilm development on the surface of filter media. Excess filter media was periodically flushed out by flowing water regardless of the type of material which is contacted with water. Confirmation of the biofilm development on the surface of mineral grains was also indirectly by the increase in the number of bacteria in the filtrate, compared to the number of bacteria in the groundwater. Biological activity of the bacteria on the deposits surface was confirmed by changes in concentration of inorganic forms of nitrogen.
   All three beds have provided a reduction in inorganic nitrogen, which was assimilated by the microorganisms. Microorganisms on the surface of deposits reduced ammonia nitrogen in the filtrates by nitrification process. In addition, NH4+ particles may be adsorbed on the surface of particulate matter present in the water and retained in the bed. During this research there were no significant differences depending on the type of deposit, in efficiency of removal of inorganic nitrogen.

AB  - The Tertiary Nima Basin in central Tibet covers an area of some 3000 km(2) and is closely similar to the nearby Lunpola Basin from which commercial volumes of oil have been produced. In this paper, we report on the source rock potential of the Oligocene Dingqinghu Formation from measured outcrop sections on the southern and northern margins of the Nima Basin.
   In the south of the Nima Basin, potential source rocks in the Dingqinghu Formation comprise dark-coloured marls with total organic carbon (TOC) contents of up to 4.3 wt % and Hydrogen Index values (HI) up to 849 mg HC/g TOC. The organic matter is mainly composed of amorphous sapropelinite corresponding to Type I kerogen. Rock-Eval T-max (430-451 degrees C) and vitrinite reflectance (R-r) (average R-r = 0.50%) show that the organic matter is marginally mature. The potential yield (up to 36.95 mg HC/g rock) and a plot of S2 versus TOC suggest that the marls have moderate to good source rock potential. They are interpreted to have been deposited in a stratified palaeolake with occasionally anoxic and hypersaline conditions, and the source of the organic matter was dominated by algae as indicated by biomarker analyses.
   Potential source rocks from the north of the basin comprise dark shales and marls with a TOC content averaging 9.7 wt % and HI values up to 389 mg HC/g TOC. Organic matter consists mainly of amorphous sapropelinite and vitrinite with minor sporinite, corresponding to Type II-III kerogen. This is consistent with the kerogen type suggested by cross-plots of HI versus T-max and H/C versus O/C. The T-max and R-r results indicate that the samples are immature to marginally mature. These source rocks, interpreted to have been deposited under oxic conditions with a dominant input of terrigenous organic matter, have moderate petroleum potential. The Dingqinghu Formation in the Nima Basin therefore has some promise in terms of future exploration potential.

AB  - The goal of this two-year study was to explore the role of nutrients and climatic conditions in promoting reoccurring Alexandrium fundyense blooms in the Northport-Huntington Bay complex, NY, USA. A bloom in 2007 was short and small (3 weeks, 10(3) cells L-1 maximal density) compared to 2008 when the A. fundyense bloom, which persisted for 6 weeks, achieved cell densities >10(6) cells L-1 and water column saxitoxin concentrations >2.4 x 10(4) pmol STX eq. L-1. During the 2008 bloom, both deployed mussels (used as indicator species) and wild soft shell clams became highly toxic (1400 and 600 mu g STX eq./100 g shellfish tissue, respectively) resulting in the closure of shellfish beds. The densities of benthic A. fundyense cysts at the onset of this bloom were four orders of magnitude lower than levels needed to account for observed cell densities, indicating in situ growth of vegetative cells was responsible for elevated bloom densities. Experimental enrichment of bloom water with nitrogenous compounds, particularly ammonium, significantly increased A. fundyense densities and particulate saxitoxin concentrations relative to unamended control treatments. The delta N-15 signatures (12-23 parts per thousand) of particulate organic matter (POM) during blooms were similar to those of sewage (10-30 parts per thousand) and both toxin and A. fundyense densities were significantly correlated with POM delta N-15 (p < 0.001). These findings suggest A. fundyense growth was supported by a source of wastewater such as the sewage treatment plant which discharges into Northport Harbor. Warmer than average atmospheric temperatures in the late winter and spring of 2008 and a cooler May contributed to an extended period of water column temperatures optimal for A. fundyense growth (12-20 degrees C), and thus may have also contributed toward the larger and longer bloom in 2008. Together this evidence suggests sewage-derived N loading and above average spring temperatures can promote intense and toxic A. fundyense blooms in estuaries. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Interpretation of photosynthetic pigment data using iterative programs such as CHEMTAX are widely used to examine algal community structure in the surface ocean. The accuracy of such programs relies on understanding the effects of environmental parameters on the pigment composition of taxonomically diverse algal groups. Phaeocystis antarctica is an important contributor to total autotrophic production and the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and sulfur in the Southern Ocean. Here we report the results of a laboratory culture experiment in which we examined the effects of ambient dissolved iron concentration on the pigment composition of colonial P. antarctica, using a new P. antarctica strain isolated from the southern Ross Sea in December 2003. Low-iron (< 0.2 nM dissolved Fe) filtered Ross Sea seawater was used to prepare the growth media, thus allowing sub-nanomolar iron additions without the use of EDTA to control dissolved iron concentrations. The experiment was conducted at relatively low irradiance (similar to 20 mu E m(-2) s(-1)), with P. antarctica primarily present in the colonial form-conditions that are typical of the southern Ross Sea during austral spring. Relative to the iron-limited control treatments (0.22 nM dissolved Fe), iron addition mediated a decrease in the ratio of 19 '-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin to chlorophyll a, and an increase in the ratio of fucoxanthin to chlorophyll a. Our results also suggest that the ratio of 19 '-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin to chlorophyll c(3) (Hex:Chl c(3) ratio) may be a characteristic physiological indicator for the iron-nutritional status of colonial P. antarctica, with higher Hex:Chl c(3) ratios (> 3) indicative of Fe stress. We also observed that the ratio of fucoxanthin to 19 '-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (Fuco:Hex ratio) was highly correlated (r(2) = 0.82) with initial dissolved Fe concentration, with Fuco:Hex ratios < 0.05 measured under iron-limited conditions (dissolved Fe < 0.45 nM). Our results corroborate and extend the results of previous experimental studies, and, combined with pigment measurements from the southern Ross Sea, are consistent with the hypothesis that the interconversion of fucoxanthin and 19 '-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin by colonial P. antarctica is used as a photo-protective or light-harvesting mechanism, according to the availability of dissolved iron.

AB  - This study links offspring size and energetic content to offspring performance (measured as growth and survivorship) in the intertidal gastropod Nucella ostrina and examines the effect of hatching size on performance at different times of year and in contrasting environments. The relationships between individual hatchling size and organic content were compared both within and among clutches of N. ostrina. Hatchling size was positively, significantly, and predictively correlated with hatchling organic content both within and among clutches, demonstrating that hatching size could be reliably used as an indicator of maternal investment. The slope of the relationship between hatchling size and organic content varied between clutches, suggesting intrapopulation variation in embryonic growth geometry. In field outplants, hatching size always had a positive and significant effect on growth, and small hatchlings took approximately one month to reach the initial size of their larger siblings. More large hatchlings than small hatchlings were recovered in every experimental outplant. The: effect of hatching size on recovery was not significant in short (9 d) outplants, but recovery of large hatchlings was significantly greater than recovery of small hatchlings in two out of three long-term (36 or 54 d) outplants. Overall recovery was lower in the summer, the long-term outplant in which size did not significantly affect recovery. In experiments testing the relationship between hatching size and survivorship in two environments that differed in degree of sun exposure, size significantly and positively affected recovery in the more shaded habitat (with higher overall recovery) but not in the sun-exposed environment. Thus, larger hatching size in N. ostrina results in (1) increased hatchling growth, (2) considerably shortened time to maturity, and (3) higher survivorship. However, the advantage of large hatching size was decreased under more severe environmental conditions, those which resulted in higher overall hatchling mortality. Contrary to predictions, poor environmental conditions may not be more likely to select for large off spring size in intertidal habitats: during periods of high heat stress, mortality may be largely random with respect to size.

AB  - Clear-cutting means forest removal (stems only) and is the most common type of forest harvesting but undoubtedly has a negative impact on the C budget in soils. This work aimed to describe responses of soil organic matter (SOM) in the mixed coniferous forest following the removal of trees under temperate climate conditions in lowland and mountain regions in southwestern Poland. Investigated soils are described as Brunic Arenosols derived from sand with an average content of total organic carbon (TOC) in the Oa-horizons of 244 g center dot kg(-1) in the lowland and Dystric Cambisols derived from gneiss; the average content of TOC in the Oa-horizons in the mountain regions was 309 g.kg(-1). Analyzed soils were very acidic in the both regions (pH 2.7-3.5 in the topsoil). In the experiment, two replicated soil profiles were located on each site, both taken after clear-cutting and without any harvesting. Humic fraction was isolated from Oa- and A-horizons; differences between investigated objects were checked with a significance p < 0.05, (n = 16). Using the instrumental analysis, like electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR), and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy applied to isolated humic fractions, it has been found that clear-cutting alters C cycling and accelerates decomposition in the forest floor, leading to loss of humic fractions in the investigated soils. In the mountain forests, the more labile, low-molecular-weight fulvic fraction decreased as the effect of harvesting practice by 30% in Oa-horizon and by 54% in A-horizon. The analysis of stable radicals by EPR showed a decrease in radical concentration observed for humic acids (HA) from mountain clear-cut areas compared to the undisturbed forest. Results presented in this article have proved there is less aliphatic character of HA molecules from the lowlands, compared to the mountain forest as the effect of clear-cutting. Changes in plant cover observed as a consequence of deforestation lead to the decrease in concentration of humic fractions with different solubility properties.

AB  - Semi-arid riparian woodlands face threats from increasing extractive water demand and climate change in dryland landscapes worldwide. Improved landscape-scale understanding of riparian woodland water use (evapotranspiration, ET) and its sensitivity to climate variables is needed to strategically manage water resources, as well as to create successful ecosystem conservation and restoration plans for potential climate futures. In this work, we assess the spatial and temporal variability of Cottonwood (Populus fremontii)-Willow (Salix gooddingii) riparian gallery woodland ET and its relationships to vegetation structure and climate variables for 80 km of the San Pedro River corridor in southeastern Arizona, USA, between 2014 and 2019. We use a novel combination of publicly available remote sensing, climate and hydrological datasets: cloud-based Landsat thermal remote sensing data products for ET (Google Earth Engine EEFlux), Landsat multispectral imagery and field data-based calibrations to vegetation structure (leaf-area index, LAI), and open-source climate and hydrological data. We show that at landscape scales, daily ET rates (6-10 mm day(-1)) and growing season ET totals (400-1,400 mm) matched rates of published field data, and modelled reach-scale average LAI (0.80-1.70) matched lower ranges of published field data. Over 6 years, the spatial variability of total growing season ET (CV = 0.18) exceeded that of temporal variability (CV = 0.10), indicating the importance of reach-scale vegetation and hydrological conditions for controlling ET dynamics. Responses of ET to climate differed between perennial and intermittent-flow stream reaches. At perennial-flow reaches, ET correlated significantly with temperature, whilst at intermittent-flow sites ET correlated significantly with rainfall and stream discharge. Amongst reaches studied in detail, we found positive but differing logarithmic relationships between LAI and ET. By documenting patterns of high spatial variability of ET at basin scales, these results underscore the importance of accurately accounting for differences in woodland vegetation structure and hydrological conditions for assessing water-use requirements. Results also suggest that the climate sensitivity of ET may be used as a remote indicator of subsurface water resources relative to vegetation demand, and an indicator for informing conservation management priorities.

AB  - There is considerable interest in improving feed utilization of dairy cattle while limiting losses to the environment (i.e., greenhouse gases, GHG). To breed for feed-efficient or climate-friendly cattle, it is first necessary to obtain accurate estimates of genetic parameters and correlations of feed intake, greenhouse gases, and production traits. Reducing dry matter take (DMI) requirements while maintaining production has high economic value to farmers, but DMI is costly to record and thus limited to small research or nucleus herds. Conversely, enteric methane (CH4) currently has no economic value, is also costly to record, and is limited to small experimental trials. However, breath gas concentrations of methane (CH(4)c) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)c) are relatively cheap to measure at high throughput under commercial conditions by installing sniffers in automated milking stations. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic correlations between DMI, body weight (BW), fat- and protein-corrected milk yield (FPCM), and GHG-related traits: CH(4)c and CO(2)c from Denmark (DNK) and the Netherlands (NLD). A second objective was to assess the genetic potential for improving feed efficiency and the added benefits of using CH(4)c and CO(2)c as indicators. Feed intake data were available on 703 primiparous cows in DNK and 524 in NLD; CH(4)c and CO(2)c records were available on 434 primiparous cows in DNK and 656 in NLD. The GHG-related traits were heritable (e.g., CH(4)c h(2): DNK = 0.26, NLD = 0.15) but were differentially genetically correlated with DMI and feed efficiency in both magnitude and sign, depending on the population and the definition of feed efficiency. Across feed efficiency traits and DMI, having bulls with 100 daughters with FPCM, BW, and GHG traits resulted in sufficiently high accuracy to almost negate the need for DMI records. Despite differences in genetic correlation structure, the relatively cheap GHG-related traits showed considerable potential for improving the accuracy of breeding values of highly valuable feed intake and feed efficiency traits.

AB  - In forest research and nursery practice there is often a need to monitor the condition and responses of trees to different stressors. Chlorophyll content in leaf is a good indicator of plant health and can be measured rapidly in many repetitions using the chlorophyll meter SPAD-502Plus. This practical tool provides the values of chlorophyll content in relative units (SPAD values), therefore it should be calibrated for each species to determine chlorophyll content in physiological units. In this study, the chlorophyll meter SPAD-502Plus was calibrated to be used for total chlorophyll (Chl), chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b) and carotenoids (Car) contents determination in leaves of Quercus petraea and Prunus serotina seedlings growing in different light environments. In the same leaf, SPAD values were measured with the Chl meter, and then photosynthetic pigments content (PP; chlorophyll and carotenoids) was consistently assessed using a conventional extraction method. The measurements were conducted once a month from May to November in three light treatments to obtain the widest possible range of the PP content values. To estimate total Chl content in leaves using the chlorophyll meter the quadratic polynomial functions: y = 0.0374x(2) + 0.5345x + 0.5137 and y = 0.024x(2) + 2.1998x - 32.7866 were obtained from the relationship between the Chl meter SPAD readings and total Chl determined spectrophotometrically for P. serotina and Q. petraea, respectively. Chl was higher under shade compared with full light regime and Car were linearly correlated with Chl. PP content was positively correlated with air temperature except for Car in P. serotina leaves. It was concluded that at the same soil conditions chlorophyll content in leaves of Q. petraea and P. serotina depended on species, light regimes and temperature of growth. The chlorophyll meter can be used as a practical tool to monitor and compare photosynthetic pigments content in leaves between tree species or populations acclimated to different environments together with a control of abiotic and biotic factors affecting pigments content and leaf optical properties.

AB  - We analysed a 25-year time series of fishery catch and effort data, and age/size information for four large-bodied, native fish species to investigate the hypotheses that under conditions of reduced freshwater inflows and high fishing pressure: (1) the structure of fish assemblages in the lower Murray River system have changed, (2) species diversity of fishes has declined and (3) population age structures of large-bodied, late-maturing, native fish (Macquaria ambigua, Argyrosomus japonicus, Rhombosolea tapirina and Acanthopagrus butcheri) have been reduced. Annual catches and effort in the lower Murray River system were stable for 25 years, but proportional contribution to the total catch from each of freshwater, estuarine and adjacent marine habitats, and the species within them varied. Fish assemblages generally differed between subsequent 5-year periods, with the exception of 1989-1993 when floods occurred in 4 out of 5 years, and the following 5-year period (1994-1998). Species richness declined steeply over 25 years in freshwater and estuarine habitat and species diversity (Hill's H (2)) also declined after 2001 in estuarine habitat. Species with rapid growth and early maturation (opportunistic strategists), increasingly dominated catches, whilst species with slow growth and late maturation (periodic strategists) declined. Truncated population age structures suggested longevity overfishing of three periodic strategist species: golden perch (M. ambigua), black bream (A. butcheri), mulloway (A. japonicus) and a fourth species with an intermediate strategy, greenback flounder (R. tapirina). This has implications for management because loss of older/larger individuals suggests reduced capacity to withstand or recover from deteriorated environmental conditions associated with a historically extreme drought in the lower Murray River system. Management of these species should seek to preserve the remnant population age structures and then to rebuild age structures by allowing recruits to become established in the adult population. We recommend that assessment of multi-species fisheries in changeable environments, such as occur in estuaries and other end-river environments, requires a suite of indicators that address changes in fish assemblages and populations.

AB  - Samples from two coal seams of the Markushegy underground mine (Hungary) were investigated for variations in maceral composition, petrography-based facies indicators and various geochemical parameters, using three seam profiles. Both seams originate from a topogenous mire and evolved within a peneplaned coastal area covered with eutrophic swamps. The presence of foraminifera and marine algae in the marly layers is indicative of marine ingressions.
   Coal facies characterisation from these parameters is combined with the results from biomarker analyses of soluble organic matter in order to reconstruct the depositional environment and to relate petrography-based indicators to the molecular composition. The contents of macerals of the liptinite group are positively correlated with soluble organic matter (SOM) yields and Hydrogen Index (HI). Consistent with maceral composition and high HI values, enhanced proportions of n-alkanes of intermediate molecular weight (n-C21-25), which are predominantly found in macrophytes, are obtained from samples of the marly shales. The final drowning of the mire is reflected by decreasing pristane/phytane ratios, due to the rise of the (ground) water table and the establishment of anaerobic conditions. The observed positive correlation between pristane/phytane ratios and inertinite percentages suggests that, at least in the Markushegy deposit, both parameters reflect variations in redox conditions of the mire.
   The predominance of angiosperms in the peat-forming vegetation of the Markushegy coal is evidenced by the high relative proportions of angiosperm-derived triterpenoids. The influence of the relative proportion of fossil wood on tissue preservation (TPI) is indicated by the positive relationship of the concentration of land plant-derived terpenoid hydrocarbons and TPI. The degree of gelification of plant tissue (GI) is governed by the microbial activity in the mire, as indicated by a negative relationship between GI and the steroids/hopanoids concentration ratios. The variation of the delta C-13 values of coal is obviously governed by the relative contribution of plant lipids to the biomass. The obtained negative relationship between delta C-13 of the coal and GI is explained by the effect of cellulose decomposition and microbial activity on the isotopic composition of the organic matter.

AB  - Because of the ageing population, the demand for assisted living solutions that can help prolonging independent living of elderly at their homes with reduced interaction with caregivers is rapidly increasing. One of the most important indicators of the users' well-being is their motion and mobility inside their homes, used either on its own or as contextual information for other more complex activities such as cooking, housekeeping or maintaining personal hygiene. In monitoring users' mobility, radio frequency (RF) communication technologies have an advantage over optical motion detectors because of their penetrability through the obstacles, thus covering greater areas with fewer devices. However, as we show in this paper, RF links exhibit large variations depending on channel conditions in operating environment as well as the level and intensity of motion, limiting the performance of the fixed motion detection threshold determined on offline or batch measurement data. Thus, we propose a new algorithm with an online adaptive motion detection threshold that makes use of channel impulse response (CIR) information of the IEEE 802.15.4 ultra-wideband (UWB) radio, which comprises an easy-to-install robust motion detection system. The online adaptive motion detection (OAMD) algorithm uses a sliding window on the last 100 derivatives of power delay profile (PDP) differences and their statistics to set the threshold for motion detection. It takes into account the empirically confirmed observation that motion manifests itself in long-tail samples or outliers of PDP differences' probability density function. The algorithm determines the online threshold by calculating the statistics on the derivatives of the 100 most recent PDP differences in a sliding window and scales them up in the suitable range for PDP differences with multiplication factors defined by a data-driven process using measurements from representative operating environments. The OAMD algorithm demonstrates great adaptability to various environmental conditions and exceptional performance compared to the offline batch algorithm. A motion detection solution incorporating the proposed highly reliable algorithm can complement and enhance various assisted living technologies to assess user's well-being over long periods of time, detect critical events and issue warnings or alarms to caregivers.

AB  - Four massive brecciated, chimney-like, and slender pipe network carbonate samples (JA-4, JA-5, JX-8 and BG-12) were collected from southwestern Taiwan, which were suggested to have formed as a result of anaerobic oxidization of methane (AOM). Considering that the environmental conditions of the carbonates precipitation and the sources of carbon and organic matter need to be further declared, molecular fossils and compound-specific carbon isotopic investigations of the carbonates were conducted in this study. According to lipid biomarkers of 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethyleicosane (PMI) and squalane diagnostic to methanotrophic archaea, as well as the extremely low C-13 values (as low as -113.4 parts per thousand) detected in samples JA-4, JA-5 and JX-8, these carbonates were revealed to be a result of AOM. Based on the varied C-13 values of characteristic archaea biomarkers in specific samples, biogenic methane was proposed to be responsible for the formation of samples JA-4 and JA-5, whereas a mixed carbon source of C-13-depleted methane and C-13-enriched residual CO2 from methanogenesis was suggested for the carbonate of JX-8 due to the co-occurrence of a highly positive C-13(carb) value (+8 parts per thousand) and a moderate C-13 depletion of PMI. The low content of AOM-related biomarkers and the absence of indicators for ANME-2 suggested that these carbonates were formed in weak seep settings. By comparison, no typical lipid biomarkers for methanotrophic archaea was detected in carbonate BG-12. The short-chain and long-chain n-alkanes accounted for 30% and 45% of all hydrocarbons, respectively, with a CPI value of 1.2, suggesting that the n-alkanes were derived from both marine organisms and terrestrial inputs. A low thermal maturity could be revealed by the incomplete equilibrium value of the C-31 22S/(22S+22R) ratio (0.5), and the carbonate BG-12 was probably deposited in a suboxic condition indicated by a value of Pr/Ph ratio (2.5).

AB  - Facies models try to explain facies architectures which have a primary control on the subsurface heterogeneities and the fluid flow characteristics of a given reservoir. In the process of facies modeling, geostatistical methods are implemented to integrate different sources of data into a consistent model. The facies models should describe facies interactions; the shape and geometry of the geobodies as they occur in reality. Two distinct categories of geostatistical techniques are two-point and multiple-point (geo) statistics (MPS). In this study, both of the aforementioned categories were applied to generate facies models. A sequential indicator simulation (SIS) and a truncated Gaussian simulation (TGS) represented two-point geostatistical methods, and a single normal equation simulation (SNESIM) selected as an MPS simulation representative. The dataset from an extremely channelized carbonate reservoir located in southwest Iran was applied to these algorithms to analyze their performance in reproducing complex curvilinear geobodies. The SNESIM algorithm needs consistent training images (TI) in which all possible facies architectures that are present in the area are included. The TI model was founded on the data acquired from modern occurrences. These analogies delivered vital information about the possible channel geometries and facies classes that are typically present in those similar environments. The MPS results were conditioned to both soft and hard data. Soft facies probabilities were acquired from a neural network workflow. In this workflow, seismic-derived attributes were implemented as the input data. Furthermore, MPS realizations were conditioned to hard data to guarantee the exact positioning and continuity of the channel bodies. A geobody extraction workflow was implemented to extract the most certain parts of the channel bodies from the seismic data. These extracted parts of the channel bodies were applied to the simulation workflow as hard data. This study showed how different sources of data can be employed in a multiple-point simulation algorithm to get reliable facies models. In addition, concerning the reproduction of curvilinear channel bodies, the modeling results revealed the strength of MPS algorithms (SNESIM in this study) in comparison with two-point geostatistical methods (including the SIS and TGS).

   Cryolithological, ground ice and fossil bioindicator (pollen, diatoms, plant macrofossils, rhizopods, insects, mammal bones) records from Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island permafrost sequences (73 degrees 20'N, 141 degrees 30'E) document the environmental history in the region for the past c. 115 kyr. Vegetation similar to modern subarctic tundra communities prevailed during the Eemian/Early Weichselian transition with a climate warmer than the present. Sparse tundra-like vegetation and harsher climate conditions were predominant during the Early Weichselian. The Middle Weichselian deposits contain peat and peaty soil horizons with bioindicators documenting climate amelioration. Although dwarf willows grew in more protected places, tundra and steppe vegetation prevailed. Climate conditions became colder and drier c. 30 kyr BP. No sediments dated between c. 28.5 and 12.05 C-14 kyr BP were found, which may reflect active erosion during that time. Herb and shrubby vegetation were predominant 11.6-11.3 C-14 kyr BP. Summer temperatures were c. 4 degrees C higher than today. Typical arctic environments prevailed around 10.5 C-14 kyr BP. Shrub alder and dwarf birch tundra were predominant between c. 9 and 7.6 kyr BP. Reconstructed summer temperatures were at least 4 degrees C higher than present. However, insect remains reflect that steppe-like habitats existed until c. 8 kyr BP. After 7.6 kyr BP, shrubs gradually disappeared and the vegetation cover became similar to that of modern tundra. Pollen and beetles indicate a severe arctic environment c. 3.7 kyr BP. However, Betula nana, absent on the island today, was still present. Together with our previous study on Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island covering the period between about 200 and 115 kyr, a comprehensive terrestrial palaeoenvironmental data set from this area in western Beringia is now available for the past two glacial-interglacial cycles.

AB  - Sex-specific interactions involving competition for space between the dioecious alcyonacean soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum and the scleractinian coral Acropora robusta were assessed experimentally on Bald Rock, central region of the Great Barrier Reef. To examine this, plus inter-clonal responses, one male colony of S. glaucum, known to produce sarcophytoxide as its predominant complementary (secondary) metabolite, was sectioned, producing 10 clones. The same was done for a female colony. These two sets of clones were then relocated to grids and placed in contact with Acropora clones. Relocated and non-relocated controls were also monitored. High levels of tissue necrosis were observed in the hard coral under contact conditions with both the male and female clones after 20 days. The development of a protective polysaccharide layer in the alcyonacean was also observed. Differences observed in the concentrations of complementary metabolites within the two different S. glaucum colonies were related to sex. Both under competition and non-competition conditions, females exhibited significantly higher concentrations of sarcophytoxide than males, and this increased with time. Fatty ester concentration was also higher in females than males, varying significantly through time, and falling dramatically just after spawning. Fatty ester concentrations decreased linearly through time in the male clones. When involved in competition for space, females possessed higher concentrations of fatty esters than males, both at the site of contact and in non-contact sites, again, decreasing after spawning. No significant changes in sarcophytoxide levels were noted in the parental colonies, but such changes were observed in fatty esters, with the female producing higher concentrations until after spawning. The use of these two variates in the form of a ratio (sarcophytoxide concentration:fatty ester concentration) yielded a variable Rho (rho) which was a more sensitive indicator of biochemical change than either of its components alone. These two sets of compounds appeared to have a negative association through time and varied highly significantly between sexes. The diterpene sarcophytoxide may be considered an allelopathic or stress metabolite, while the lipids act as energy storage metabolites.

AB  - Bulk organic matter (OM) in sediments that accumulated in Lakes Victoria, Albert and Tanganyika during the major transgression that transformed these basins from a desiccated or lowstand condition at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum to highstand with overflow in the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene, show some striking compositional trends. Sediment OM content (TOC) and Rock-Eval Hydrogen Index (HI) both rise markedly, reflecting increasing primary productivity during the transgression and enhanced conditions for the preservation of labile OM, In Lake Victoria rising sedimentary sulphur content tracks the change in HI. Over the same time interval in all three lakes, delta C-13(OM) shows a falling trend of 5-8 degrees. Nitrogen isotopic and C/N trends are, in contrast, more variable. Relatively high delta N-15 values at an early stage in the transgression may reflect isotopic effects associated with ammonia loss from an alkaline waterbody, while high delta N-15 later in the transgression was probably due to periods when stratification-related denitrification had a particularly strong impact upon the lakes' N cycle. The observed changes are attributed to the influence of the landscape drowned during the transgression upon the nutrient budget of the lake, a rise in river-supplied nutrients as the climate became wetter, and an increasing tendency to stable chemical stratification as the water column deepened. In the case of delta C-13, additional contributory factors were changes in the amount and isotopic composition of river-supplied dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) as runoff and soil-moisture turnover rates increased, and the replacement of a C4-grassland dominated flora by mixed woodland-grassland and forest with a significant presence of C3 plants. Distinct geochemical changes are also apparent in Lakes Victoria and Albert sediments at the end of the transgression which are consistent with a reduction in nutrient loading. In the case of N this resulted in biological N fixation becoming a major part of the lakes' N cycle, Some of the observed geochemical variations may be generally applicable as proxy indicators of major transgressions in large lakes.

AB  - Glacier forelands provide valuable sites for the study of patterns and processes of primary succession. The Storbreen glacier foreland, south-central Norway, has previously been the subject of a suite of community-level approaches. Here, the focus is population-level studies of six key pioneer plants: Arabis alpina, Deschampsia alpina, Oxyria digyna, Poa alpina, Saxifraga cespitosa and Trisetum spicatum and four heath shrubs: Betula nana, Empetrum hermaphroditum, Phyllodoce caerulea and Salix complex (Salix glauca and S. lanata). Size-frequency distributions are used as indicators of population phenomena.
   The optimal conditions for growth and fecundity of Arabis alpina and Saxifraga cespitosa appear to be almost immediately upon deglaciation (<7 yr), although both achieve their maximum cover on slightly older terrain. A similar pattern was noted for the grasses, although their optima come at slightly later times. Population phenomena in Oxyria digyna could not be related to terrain age, indicating a differing role of this species within the succession.
   Among the shrubs a number of demographic and behavioural patterns are identifiable as successional features, and other patterns are explicable in relation to changing histories of disturbance and site moisture relationships. Establishment and build-up in Empetrum hermaphroditum and Salix complex do not appear to be environmentally constrained, in contrast to Betula nana and Phyllodoce caerulea. Betula nana is the slowest species to colonize, but occasional early colonists appear healthy and fecund, pointing to a strong environmental sieve at the point of establishment. The population patterns varied considerably among the shrub species, the most striking common feature being in mode of establishment. Establishment of ramets by vegetative means occurs increasingly on older ground within the foreland (maximum terrain age 230 yr) but only in sites of the mature heath outside the foreland is it the characteristic mode of establishment. In exception to this pattern, vegetative establishment of Phyllodoce caerulea is very rare in all conditions studied.
   Discussion focuses upon the importance of population phenomena, seed dispersal and life-history characteristics in successional change. It is concluded that processes involved in species turnover include both allogenic and autogenic elements and that although the two classes are difficult to separate in practice, autogenic factors become more significant whilst species-environment relations become tighter in later phases of vegetation development.

AB  - Background: Growing evidence indicates that air pollution is capable of disrupting the immune system and therefore, might be associated with an onset of Type 1 diabetes (T1D).
   Objectives: We explored possible links of T1D with ambient exposures in the population of southern Israel, characterized by hot and dry climate and frequent dust storms.
   Methods: We conducted a matched nested case-control study where exposure to environmental pollutants during gestation in T1D cases was compared to that of healthy children. Up to 10 controls were matched to every case by age, gender and ethnicity, in all 362 cases and 3512 controls. Measurements of pollutants' concentrations, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O-3) and particulate matter of size less than 10 and 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM10 and PM2.5), as well as the mean daily measurements of meteorological conditions were obtained from the local monitoring stations. The association between T1D and pollution, solar radiation (SR), temperature and relative humidity was adjusted for socioeconomic status, temperature, maternal age and pre-gestational maternal DM, using conditional logistic regression. The environmental exposures were presented as indicators of quartiles averaged over whole pregnancy and by trimesters.
   Results: Exposure to ozone and solar radiation during gestation were both associated with the T1D in offspring, although at borderline significance. Compared to the lowest quartile, the odds ratio (OR) for exposure to 3rd and 4th quartile of O-3 was equal 1.61 (95%CI: 0.95; 2.73) and 1.45 (95%CI: 0.83; 2.53), respectively. Likewise, the ORs for exposure to SR were equal 1.83 (95%CI: 0.92; 3.64), 2.54 (95%CI: 1.21; 5.29) and 2.06 (95%CI: 0.95; 4.45) for to 2nd, 3rd and 4th quartiles, respectively. Exposure to SO2 followed a dose- response pattern, but was not statistically significant. Other environmental factors were not independently related to T1D. Analysis of exposures one year prior to the disease onset indicated a positive association between T1D and SR.
   Conclusions: We showed that exposure to high ozone levels and solar radiation during gestation might be related to the T1D. More scientific evidence needs to accumulate to support the study findings.

AB  - The article evaluates the dynamics of the main indicators of economic activity of the rural population of Volyn region, formed and highlighted trends in their development in the region and compared with neighboring regions within the Polissya economic zone of Ukraine. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the intensive reduction of employment of the rural population in traditional sectors of economic activity, which leads to an increase, on the one hand, rural unemployment, and on the other to an increase in employment in personal peasant farms. The study substantiated that employment in the personal economy turned out to be more profitable for the rural population the income per unit of labour there is now about twice as high with twice as low labour productivity. The explanation for this is the shadow nature of production in peasant farms and the imbalance of the economic mechanism in enterprises. It is substantiated that, taking into account the number of employed persons who produced products for personal consumption in private farms, programs inefficient use not only of their labour resources, but also reduces the average industry efficiency of labour resources of the agricultural sector as a whole. Among other features of the rural labour market of Volyn region, which limits its development, we can point to the non-compact distribution of the rural population in the territory. Peculiarities of the settlement network in Volyn region are that the dominant segment of rural employment is agricultural enterprises. It was found that in the current conditions it is advisable to develop and implement a set of measures to improve demographic processes, optimize employment and improve the living standards of the rural population, which requires effective cooperation between government and research institutions, relevant authorities and interested private entities. It is proved that in the rapidly changing conditions of modern times the optimization of territorial mobility of the working population between types of employment, areas of employment, insufficient and surplus areas, adaptation of statistical information base to the specifics of rural employment to rationalize economic activity and prevent negative phenomena continue to be extremely important and acute issues in Ukraine.

AB  - High-resolution, long-term and accurate daily-precipitation is always difficult and rarely measured in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) because of the high altitude and complex terrain. The accuracy of satellite-based gridded precipitation products have been continuously improved recently which is crucial to the study of cryosphere ecology and environment. The goal of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of CHIRPS v2 (Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations data, version 2) and MSWEP v2 (Multi-source weighted-Ensemble Precipitation, version 2) daily-precipitation products over the QTP during the period 1981-2015. Validation was done using a time series of daily-precipitation data obtained from 104 hydrometeorological stations distributed over the QTP. Error metrics (The correlation coefficient CC, the relative bias BIAS, and root mean square error RMSE) were used for accuracy evaluation and detectability indicators (probability of detection POD, false alarm ratio RFA, and critical success index CSI) were used for the analysis of detection capabilities of rainfall occurrence events. The results indicate that when compared to rain gauge observations, CHIRPS and MSWEP daily-precipitation products represent well the spatial and temporal distribution of the mean daily precipitation over the QTP, while both of them overestimate the daily-precipitation (0.18 mm/d for CHIRPS, 0.56 mm/d for MSWEP). MSWEP performed better than CHIRPS according to CC (MSWEP is 0.44, CHIRPS is 0.23) and RMSE (MSWEP is 4.21 mm, CHIRPS is 5.03 mm) and MSWEP showed better detection capabilities with higher POD (0.65), lower RFA (0.50) and higher CSI (0.39) in the QTP. Both products are less accurate in dry conditions (the north QTP, winter) than in moist conditions (the south QTP, summer). Light precipitation events (0-2 mm/d) are underestimated but heavy precipitation events (2-25 mm/d) are overestimated. CHIRPS and MSWEP have shown great potential to be able to be applied to the precipitation-related study of the QTP. Although the accuracy of MSWEP is higher than that of CHIRPS, the latter has higher spatial resolution (o.o5 degrees) and is more suitable for small-scale studies.

AB  - Denitrification of high-nitrate high-salinity wastewater is difficult due to plasmolysis and inactivation of denitrifiers at high salinity conditions. In this study, the effects of salinity and empty bed contact time (EBCT) on simultaneous heterotrophic and sulfur based autotrophic denitrification of synthetic wastewater were evaluated in an up flow packed bed reactor. The reactor was filled with granular elemental sulfur particles with diameters of 2.8-5.6 mm and porosity of 40%. The initial culture was prepared from sludge of Shahrak-e-ghods domestic wastewater treatment plant. The influent nitrate concentration and EBCT were 600 mg NO3-N/lit and 16 h respectively. First, the stoichiometric fraction of nitrate removed by heterotrophic denitrification (with methanol as organic carbon source) supplied enough alkalinity to compensate the autotrophic alkalinity consumption, was determined 60%. Then, salt concentration was gradually increased with NaCl from 0% in the feed. The Process kept high nitrate removal efficiency (>99%) even at 3.5% NaCl. During these changes the alkalinity variations were insignificant which showed the microbial population ratio of acclimated autotrophic to heterotrophic denitrifiers had no any significant changes with NaCl concentrations up to 3.5% in the feed. At 4 and 5% NaCl, the efficiency drastically decreased to 78% and 48%, respectively. Similar behavior was also observed for methanol removal efficiency, effluent turbidity as an indirect determinant of biological mass and sulfate production. The effects of flow rates on denitrification of synthetic high nitrate high salinity wastewater with 3.5%NaCl under mixotrophic condition were also investigated by increasing the flow rate from 7.06 lit/day to 70.6 lit/day with corresponding EBCT 20 to 2 h. Denitrification efficiency was close to 100% at EBCT of 20 to 8 hr, but decreased to 79% and 39% when the EBCT was 4 and 2 h, respectively. The decrease in effluent sulfate concentration (as an indicator for autotrophic denitrification) and the increase in effluent alkalinity (as an indicator for heterotrophic denitrification) and pH at EBCT of 4 and 2 h were considerable correspondingly. These results imply that the population ratio of autotrophic to heterotrophic denitrifiers depends on EBCT.

AB  - A multidisciplinary team, composed of stratigraphers, petrophysicists, reservoir engineers, and geophysicists, studied a portion of Boonsville gas field in the Fort Worth Basin of North-Central Texas to determine how modern geophysical, geological, and engineering techniques could be combined to understand the mechanisms by which fluvio-deltaic depositional processes create reservoir compartmentalization in a low- to moderate-accommodation basin. An extensive database involving well logs; cores, production, and pressure data from 200-plus wells, 26-mi(2) (67 km(2)) of 3-D seismic data, vertical seismic profiles (VSPs), and checkshots was assembled to support this investigation.
   The reservoir system we studied was the Bend Conglomerate, a productive series of gas reservoirs composed of Middle Pennsylvanian fluvio-deltaic clastics 900 to 1300 ft (275 to 400 m) thick in our project area. We were particularly interested in this reservoir system because evidence suggested that many of the sequences in this stratigraphic interval were deposited in low-accommodation conditions (that is, in an environment where there was limited vertical space available for sediment accumulation), and our objective was to investigate how fluvio-deltaic reservoirs were compartmentalized by low-accommodation depositional processes.
   Using an extensive well log database (200 plus wells) and a core-calibrated calculation of rock facies derived from these logs, we divided the Bend Conglomerate interval into ten genetic sequences, with each sequence being approximately 100 ft (30 m) thick. We then used local VSP and checkshot control to transform log-measured depths of each sequence boundary to seismic two-way time coordinates and identified narrow seismic data windows encompassing each sequence across the 26-mi(2) (67 km(2)) 3-D seismic grid. A series of seismic attributes was calculated in these carefully defined data windows to determine which attributes were reliable indicators of the presence of productive reservoir facies and which attributes could, therefore, reveal distinct reservoir compartments and potentially show where in-field wells should be drilled to reach previously uncontacted gas reservoirs.
   Our best success was the seismic attribute correlations we found in the Upper and Lower Caddo sequences, at the top of the Bend Conglomerate. These sequences were deposited in a low-accommodation setting, relative to other Boonsville sequences, and we found that reflection amplitude and instantaneous frequency, respectively, were reliable indicators of the areal distribution of reservoir facies in these low-accommodation sequences.

AB  - The contrast in rheological properties between layers of different composition or texture, and between stiff inclusions and their matrix, gives rise to perturbations in dow that result in structures. Theory and modeling allow us to understand the conditions necessary for such structures to form and, conversely, we can use the form of the structures to infer possible rheological conditions for the rocks during natural deformation. We review here several structures and their use as indicators of rheological behavior, based on theory, numerical and experimental models. and observations on natural structures.
   Theory predicts that a dominant wavelength/thickness (L(d)/h) exists for both folding and boudinage that depends on the ratio of viscosities of layer to matrix, the homogeneous shortening undergone by the layer, and the exponent, n, in a flow law of power-law type. The measurement of average L/h, and of the shortening within the layers allows an estimate of the power-law exponent of the stiff layer to be made. Also, numerical modeling shows that fold hinges become sharper as n increases and the limbs become relatively longer and straighter. The dynamic growth of pinch and swell instabilities only overcomes the kinematic decay in nonlinear flow, thus the existence of pinch and swell is by itself evidence of nonlinear behavior.
   Strain rate and strain increase more rapidly away from the neutral surface for a layer of power-law rheology (with n > 1) than for a layer of Newtonian theology. Thus, strain gradient across a fold hinge, at fixed amplitude or limb dip, increases with increasing n.
   Porphyroclasts in mylonites develop characteristic rims of recrystallized grains that are drawn out into trails of sigma or delta shape by the perturbed flow of the material around the clast. Experimental evidence suggests that sigma shapes occur if flow is linear, whereas nonlinear flow may give rise to the delta shape.
   The inference of rheological behavior from structures is complementary to the determination of rheological properties of rocks in the laboratory. What data there is suggest that constitutive relations for rocks undergoing ductile deformation in which many structures develop are highly nonlinear. There is general qualitative agreement between flow laws inferred on the basis of experimental results and those inferred from observation of structural characteristics.

AB  - Clonal trials with the West African hardwood Triplochiton scleroxylon, K. SCHUM. have indicated a positive relationship between stem size (height and diameter) and branching frequency (mean no. of branches per m of mainstem). As part of a programme of vegetative propagation and clonal selection, the present study with young plants examined clonal variation in apical dominance, the process which determines branching frequency. Young potted plants of five clones were decapitated by removing the apex and uppermost node. The plants were partially defoliated, leaving 4 to 6 leaves at the apical nodes. These plants were grown in a glasshouse at 25-degrees-C to 30-degrees-C under experimental conditions testing: (i) two rates of fertilizer application (4.0% and 0.04% liquid feed, NPK = 23:19.5:16); (ii) three rates of water application, ranging from field capacity to severe water stress (watering with 250 ml either every day, every three days or every 12 days); and (iii) two daylengths (10 h and 19.5 h). The length and number of lateral shoots formed on these decapitated plants were measured weekly to determine the percentage bud activity. In the first four weeks after decapitation, percentage bud activity increased (Sprouting Phase) and, thereafter, it declined as dominance was re-imposed (Dominance Phase). Peak bud activity at week 4 was greatest with the higher rate of nutrient application under the daily and 3-day watering regimes, but was unaffected by daylength. During the Dominance Phase, bud activity remained high at the higher rate of nutrient application, under the 3 and 12-day watering regimes and under long days. The relative performance of different clones was consistent in all treatments. Of the three clones used in all experiments, clones 8038 and 8049 had similarly high activity (rank one or two) and clone 8053 displayed less activity. However, inconsistencies in clonal ranking occurred under the lowest rate of watering. Responses to decapitation can thus be used as a robust indicator of genetic variation in apical dominance, provided care is taken: (i) to avoid extreme environmental conditions; and (ii) to maintain uniformity in the morphological (height, no. of leaves etc.) and physiological state (eg water and nutrient status) of the plants and their growing environment (especially light).

AB  - Rare earth elements (REEs) record a large amount of geological information, and serve as a good geological indicator that can effectively predict the palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironment, and palaeotectonic evolution of the sedimentary rocks. The REEs and major elements of 94 marine shale samples obtained from the Late Ordovician to the Early Silurian at Shuanghe (SH) and Qiliao (QL) sections in Sichuan Basin were analysed in this study. Results showed that the major elements of Al2O3, K2O, and TiO2 were mainly controlled by clay minerals associated with terrigenous detrital, but the SiO2 and Na2O were not influenced by clay minerals. In addition, sigma REE values obtained at Shuanghe and Qiliao sections during the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian were close to those of North American Shale (NASC) composites (173.2 ug/g). REEs were characterized by light rare earth elements enrichment, but heavy rare earth elements depletion. Furthermore, the NASC-normalized REE patterns were similar with a little difference at Shuanghe and Qiliao sections. The following conclusions were drawn by studying REE indicators associated with source, redox condition and the mechanism of organic matter enrichment: (a) sigma REE showed strong positive correlations with TiO2, Al2O3, K2O, and Na2O, but exhibited relatively poor correlations with Fe2O3 and P2O5. These results suggested that REEs in the marine shale mainly occurred in clay minerals, but also were influenced by pyrite, phosphates, and other minerals. (b) Ce/Ce* showed that marine shale during the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian was mainly deposited under anoxic condition in Sichuan Basin and the reduction intensity at Qiliao section was stronger than Shuanghe section. (c) The diagram between La/Yb and sigma REE and the Ce/Ce* values indicated that the detrital minerals in the marine shale were mainly derived from the sedimentary rocks and deposited in the same continental margin environment with a complex composition. (d) The controlling factors of organic matter enrichment were different at Shuanghe and Qiliao sections and the depositional environment controlled the organic matter accumulation and preservation of the organic-rich marine shale.

AB  - Rockfalls are one of the most common instability processes in high mountains. They represent a relevant issue, both for the risks they represent for (infra) structures and frequentation, and for their potential role as terrestrial indicators of climate change. This study aims to contribute to the growing topic of the relationship between climate change and slope instability at the basin scale. The selected study area is the Bessanese glacial basin (Western Italian Alps) which, since 2016, has been specifically equipped, monitored and investigated for this purpose. In order to provide a broader context for the interpretation of the recent rockfall events and associated climate conditions, a cross-temporal and integrated approach has been adopted. For this purpose, geomorphological investigations (last 100 years), local climate (last 30 years) and near-surface rock/air temperatures analyses, have been carried out. First research outcomes show that rockfalls occurred in two different geomorphological positions: on rock slopes in permafrost condition, facing from NW to NE and/or along the glacier margins, on rock slopes uncovered by the ice in the last decades. Seasonal thaw of the active layer and/or glacier debutressing can be deemed responsible for slope failure preparation. With regard to timing, almost all dated rock falls occurred in summer. For the July events, initiation may have been caused by a combination of rapid snow melt and enhanced seasonal thaw of the active layer due to anomalous high temperatures, and rainfall. August events are, instead, associated with a significant positive temperature anomaly on the quarterly scale, and they can be ascribed to the rapid and/or in depth thaw of the permafrost active layer. According to our findings, we can expect that in the Bessanese glacierized basin, as in similar high mountain areas, climate change will cause an increase of slope instability in the future. To fasten knowledge deepening, we highlight the need for a growth of a network of high elevation experimental sites at the basin scale, and the definition of shared methodological and measurement standards, that would allow a more rapid and effective comparison of data.

AB  - The persistence of replication-competent HIV reservoirs in people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a barrier to cure. Therefore, their accurate quantification is essential for evaluating the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions and orienting the decision to interrupt ART. Quantitative viral outgrowth assays (QVOAs) represent the "gold standard" for measuring the size of replication-competent HIV reservoirs. However, they require large numbers of cells and are technically challenging. This justifies the need for the development of novel simplified methods adapted for small biological samples. Herein, we sought to simplify the viral outgrowth procedure (VOP) by (i) using memory CD4(+)T-cells, documented to be enriched in HIV reservoirs (ii) optimizing cell-culture conditions, and (iii) supplementing with all-transretinoic acid (ATRA), a positive regulator of HIV replication. Memory CD4(+)T-cells were sorted from the peripheral blood of ART-treated (HIV+ART;n= 14) and untreated (HIV+;n= 5) PLWH. The VOP was first performed with one original replicate of 1 x 10(6)cells/well in 48-well plates. Cells were stimulatedviaCD3/CD28 for 3 days, washed to remove residual CD3/CD28 Abs, split every 3 days for optimal cell density, and cultured in the presence or the absence of ATRA for 12 days. Soluble and intracellular HIV-p24 levels were quantified by ELISA and flow cytometry, respectively. Optimal cell-culture density achieved by splitting improved HIV outgrowth detection. ATRA promoted superior/accelerated detection of replication-competent HIV in all HIV+ART individuals tested, including those with low/undetectable viral outgrowth in the absence of ATRA. Finally, this VOP was used to design a simplified ATRA-based QVOA by including 4 and 6 original replicates of 1 x 10(6)cells/well in 48-well plates and 2 x 10(5)cells/well in 96-well plates, respectively. Consistently, the number of infectious units per million cells (IUPM) was significantly increased in the presence of ATRA. In conclusion, we demonstrate that memory CD4(+)T-cell splitting for optimal density in culture and ATRA supplementation significantly improved the efficacy of HIV outgrowth in a simplified ATRA-based QVOA performed in the absence of feeder/target cells or indicator cell lines.

AB  - To understand to what extent depositional dynamics and riverine input contribute to shape the microbial benthic community structure in coastal systems, surface sediments were collected along one nearshore and two land-sea transects in the Po River prodelta, and analyzed for lithology, sediment structures, grain-size, short-lived radioisotopes (Be-7 and Cs-137) and organic matter (OM) quantity and origin (C, N, stable isotopes). The most recent surface supply (i.e. 5-6 mo = SUP layer) and the underneath, older sub-surface deposits (i.e. > 6 mo = SUB layer) were analyzed at six selected sampling sites and checked for possible differences in the microbial community abundance and structure. According to different depositional dynamics, three distinct groups of sites were detected: nearshore muddy and sandy sites, and offshore sites. Sedimentary records reflected the interplay of different elements and/or processes acting in this complex and highly dynamic system. Riverderived sediments, as depicted by high contribution of silty particles and recent riverine OM inputs, were confined to nearshore locations in front of the main river mouth. They resulted highly correlated to bacterial distribution and prokaryotic abundances in SUP layer. Nevertheless, in subsurface sediments affected by the delivery of high amount of mud, potential burial phenomena and/or the development of anoxic conditions occurred, leading to a change in the bacterial community structure. We speculated that the decrease of Gammaand increase of Delta-Proteobacteria in the SUB layer could be related to their sulfur-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing activities, respectively. On the other hand, at offshore sites, the presence of a low, and regular sedimentary input and less intense hydrodynamic conditions favored a more stable microbial structure across surface and subsurface sediments. Four discriminating proxies, such as grain-size representing the system energy, Total N as an indicator of land-derived nutrient inputs,Be-7 as a tracer of the freshness of riverine discharge, and stable C isotope as an indicator of the type and age of OM, mainly summarize the complex relationships between sedimentary dynamics and bacterial community structure in the Po River prodelta area.

AB  - Background and Aims Seedling vigour is one of the major determinants for stable stand establishment in rice (Oryza sativa), especially in a direct seeding cropping system. The objectives of this study were to identify superior alleles with consistent effects on seedling vigour across different temperature conditions and to investigate genotype x environmental temperature interactions for seedling vigour QTL.
   Methods A set of 282 F-13 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a rice cross were assessed for four seedling vigour traits at three temperatures (25 degreesC, 20 degreesC and 15 degreesC). Using a linkage map with 198 marker loci, the main-effect QTL for the traits were mapped by composite interval mapping.
   Key Results A total of 34 QTL for the four seedling vigour traits were identified. Of these QTL, the majority (82%) were clustered within five genomic regions, designated as QTL qSV-3-1, qSV-3-2, qSV-5, qSV-8-1 and qSV-8-2. All of these five QTL had small individual effects on the traits, explaining 3.1-15.8% of the phenotypic variation with a mean of 7.3%. QTL qSV-3-1, qSV-3-2 and qSV-8-1 showed almost consistent effects on the traits across all three temperatures while qSV-5 and qSV-8-2 had effects mainly at the 'normal' temperatures of 20 degreesC and 25 degreesC. Among the five QTL identified, all and four showed additive effects on shoot length and germination rate, respectively. The contributions of these five QTL to shoot length and germination rate were also much larger than those to the other two traits.
   Conclusions A few of genomic regions (or QTL) were identified as showing effects on seedling vigour. For these QTL, significant genotype x environmental temperature interactions were found and these interactions appeared to be QTL-specific. Among the four seedling vigour traits measured, shoot length and germination rate could be used as relatively good indicators to evaluate the level of seedling vigour in rice.

AB  - Three sequential hurricanes in the fall of 1999 provided the impetus for assessing multi-annual effects on water quality and phytoplankton dynamics in southwestern Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. Two and a half years of post-hurricane data were examined for short- and long-term impacts from the storms and > 100 year flooding. Salinity decreased dramatically and did not recover until. May 2000. Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were briefly elevated during the flooding, but later returned to background levels. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations declined through the whole study period, but did not appear to peak as was observed in the Neuse River estuary, a key tributary of the Sound. Light attenuation was highest in the fall to spring following the storms and was best correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations. Phytoplankton biomass (chl a) increased and remained elevated until late spring 2000 when concentrations returned to pre-storm levels and then cycled seasonally. Phytoplankton community composition varied throughout the study, reflecting the complex interaction between physiological optima and combinations of salinity, residence time, nutrient availability, and possibly grazing activity. Floodwater advection or dilution from upstream maxima may have controlled the spatial heterogeneity in total and group-specific biomass. The storms produced areas of short-term hypoxia, but hypoxic events continued during the following two summers, correlating strongly with water column stratification. Nitrogen loading to the southwestern sound was inferred from network analysis of previous nitrogen cycling studies in the Neuse River estuary. Based on these analyses, nutrient cycling and removal in the sub-estuaries would be decreased under high flow conditions, confirming observations from other estuaries. The inferred nitrogen load from the flood was 2-3 times the normal loading to the Sound; this estimate was supported by the substantial algal bloom. After 8-mos, the salinity and chl a data indicated the Sound had returned to pre-hurricane conditions, yet phytoplankton community compositional changes continued through the multi-year study period. This is an example of long-term aspects of estuarine recovery that should be considered in the context of a predicted 10-40 yr period of elevated tropical storm activity in the western Atlantic Basin.

AB  - Brazil has one of the largest protected areas (PA) systems in the world but just a small fraction is devoted to the protection of marine habitats. The effectiveness and integrity of PA are being challenged and questioned worldwide and this situation is not different in Brazil. Poorly managed PA are more vulnerable to habitat loss, poaching and other threats. Alarmingly, studies have shown that just a fraction of the current PA can be considered effectively managed. Facing such scenario, studies on the effectiveness of the management of PA and especially marine PA (MPA)- become essential to enhance the role these areas play in biodiversity conservation, as well as provide useful tools for managers and decision-makers. Using the Rapid Assessment and Priorization of Protected Area Management (RAPPAM) methodology, we evaluated the management effectiveness of the largest MPA in Brazil, the Environmental Protected Area Costa dos Corals (APACC, IUCN category V). In a rare opportunity in the context of Brazil's PA system, we were able to access the management effectiveness of APACC over a 15-year period, tracking progresses, identifying strengthens and weaknesses experienced. The overall management effectiveness of APACC has improved over the last 15 years. Although there were variations, five out of 14 indicators analyzed presented improvements while nine remained stable over the years. Finance was the module that contributed the most for the general improvement of APACC. Contrary to many other PA worldwide, which face budget restrictions, APACC's financial situation is currently stable and such stability may have had a positive effect on other management modules, like Infrastructure and Outputs. Research, Monitoring and Evaluation was among modules with slower progress, which is a contradiction considering APACC is amongst the Brazilian MPA with more research. The feedback from researchers is considered poor and most of the research conducted considered not useful for management purposes. Tourism has the highest increase in criticality, being not only the biggest pressure, but also the main threat. Considering that there were improvements in other areas, increasing APACC's limited staff should be a priority for the coming years. RAPPAM proved to be a quick and easy-to-apply methodology, making it effective for temporal analysis on the management of MPA. However, caution is necessary when analyzing some of RAPPAM results. Frequent changes in the management staff, poor records of the management process and the activities adopted, and incomplete transference of information between staff members inevitably compromises the answers and the overall accuracy. RAPPAM needs in loco validation of the answers and this could be a time consuming process for large PA. For better results, RAPPAM could and should be applied together with other evaluation methods.

AB  - Urbanization and population growth have created considerable sanitation challenges in cities and communities in many parts of Europe and the world. As such, it is imperative to identify the most environmentally-harmful microbiological and chemical sources of pollution, these being wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) which release wastewater of low quality. In the present manuscript, an extensive study was performed of the sanitary conditions of river water and treated wastewater from seventeen WWTPs of various sizes along the Pilica River catchment in central Poland, with the aim of identifying "hot spots" in terms of most serious sources of sanitary hazards. The bacteriological risk for the river, including fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) such as coliforms, E.coli, enterococci, C. perfringens, and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. (CRA) were assessed using classical microbiological methods, and the physicochemical parameters were also tested. The WWTPs, particularly the small ones (<2000 people equivalent, PE) demonstrated significant variation regarding the physicochemical parameters. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. bacteria growing at 42 degrees C were found in the effluent wastewaters of all tested municipal WWTPs, and in most of the Pilica River water samples, presenting a potential hazard to public health. A positive correlation was identified between E. coli and CRA abundance in treated wastewater; however, no such relationship was found in river water. It was found that seven small treatment plants discharged wastewater with very different microbiological parameters. Moreover, three small treatment plants serving only 0.56% of the population in the studied area continuously released extremely high microbiological contamination, constituting as much as 54-82% of fecal indicator bacteria loads in the area studied. Our findings show that this type of comprehensive analysis may enable assessment of the use of the entire catchment area, thus identifying the most serious threats to surface water quality and guiding the actions needed to improve the worst operating WWTPs.

AB  - Agonistic behaviour is an important component of intraspecific competition because outcomes of agonistic contests can serve as indicators of fitness, helping the victors secure critical resources. Although several factors affecting aggression, including age and body size, have been well documented, few studies have examined the effects of abiotic factors on aggression and outcomes of agonistic contests. Abiotic factors affect a broad range of behaviours and can naturally covary, but some factors are becoming increasingly uncoupled. For example, ongoing climate change continues to shift temperature, but not light:dark, cycles. Thus, we employed a 2 x 2 factorial design in sand field crickets, Gryllus firmus, to disentangle the naturally covarying effects of temperature and circadian rhythms. During early adulthood, virgin males were maintained in either a typical or inverted diel temperature cycle (i.e. cool in the morning and warm in the afternoon, or warm in the morning and cool in the afternoon, respectively) reflecting field conditions (20.5-32 degrees C). Agonistic contests occurred at either cool (22 degrees C) or warm (31 degrees C) periods in the temperature cycle. Morphological traits, such as head width, femur length and testes mass, positively covaried and influenced the outcome of contests where relatively large crickets won most contests. However, temperature and time of day had additive, interactive effects on the level of aggression and the duration of contests. Contests occurring in cool, morning conditions were relatively long and aggressive. Although crickets appeared to use a mutual assessment strategy (contests between males of mismatched body size took longer to initiate), there may have been a context-dependent shift to a self-assessment strategy during warm evenings. Thus, plasticity in agonistic behaviour occurred due to the interactive, additive effects of temperature and circadian dynamics. We encourage continued investigation into studies that disentangle the effects of temperature and circadian effects on other fitness-related behaviours, such as mate choice or foraging.

AB  - Increasing external pressures from human activities and climate change can lead to desertification, affecting the livelihood of more than 25% of the world's population. Thus, determining proximity to transition to desertification is particularly central for arid regions before they may convert into deserts, and recent research has focused on devising early warning signals for anticipating such regime shifts. We here draw the attention to some emerging land-cover cross-scale patterns with a historical characteristic sequence of different regimes in arid or semi-arid Mediterranean regions that could indicate an impending transition to the tightening and extension of desertification processes. Inflexibility of land administration may, in turn, reinforce desertification processes, erode the resilience and promote regime shifts and collapse instead of the adaptability required to counter surprises due to climate change. Various theoretical studies have designated the increase in spatial connectivity as the leading indicator of early warning for an impending critical transition of regime shifts. We show that a potential way to address early warning signals of regime shifts to monitor and predict changes is to look at current land-cover regime within a simple framework for interpreting cross-scale spatial patterns. We provide examples of this approach for the Apulia region in southern Italy with desertification processes in place, and discuss what a cross-scale land-cover pattern could mean, what it says about the condition of socio-ecological landscapes, and what could be the effects of changing observed conditions ought to, for instance, climate change. We took advantage of the rich information provided by cross-scale pattern analysis in the pattern transition space provided by classic neutral landscape models. We show potentially dramatic shifts of connectivity at low land-cover composition below certain thresholds, and suggest that the degree to which the observed pattern departs from a particular neutral model can indicate early warning signals of regime shifts, and how those landscapes might evolve/react to additional land-cover variation. Moreover, as the land-cover pattern mostly depends on social-economic factors, we argue that we have to change societal values at the root of inflexibility. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Valanginian time interval (Early Cretaceous) is characterized by a positive carbon isotope excursion (CIE) which represents the first of several prominent Cretaceous delta C-13 anomalies. A combined chemostratigraphic and organic-geochemical approach has been chosen to investigate the composition and distribution of sedimentary organic matter (OM) deposited before the Valanginian CIE, during its onset and plateau-phase. This was done to test whether this CIE is accompanied by changes in marine primary production and/or OM preservation. Biostratigraphically well-calibrated deposits from two hemipelagic sections located in the Vocontian Basin of SE France are used as sedimentary archives. A newly established high-resolution delta C-13 record covering the composite succession shows a characteristic Valanginian pattern and enables a detailed correlation with existing carbon isotope curves from the northern Tethyan margin, The analyzed solvent extractable fraction of the sedimentary OM is mainly composed of a marine origin with an admixture of land plant material. Variations in specific biomarkers for cyanobacteria (2 alpha-methyl-hopanes), dinoflagellates (dinosterane or 4-desmethyl-23,24-dimethyl steranes) and terrigenous plant-derived OM (odd-numbered long-chain n-alkanes) as well as the sterane/hopane ratio, the C-35 hopane index and the isoprenoids pristane and phytane were investigated. In contrast to the well-studied mid-Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs), neither significant OM enrichment nor prominent fluctuations in the selected biomarker abundances can be observed during the build-up phase of the Valanginian CIE. This points to relatively stable marine paleoenvironmental conditions with well-oxygenated bottom waters. Prior to the CIE, four cm-thick, finely laminated, dark layers (known as Barrande layers) with total organic carbon content reaching up to 4% show an exception from the generally stable biomarker pattern. Sedimentological and biomarker evidence support deposition under less oxygenated conditions for the Barrande layers. However, their occurrence clearly predates the onset of the positive delta C-13(carb) shift (by about 180 kyrs). Contrary to the subsequent mid-Cretaceous CIEs, the occurrence of widespread anoxia associated with the Valanginian CIE cannot be confirmed for the Vocontian Basin. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) is the parameter of daily cycle of trunk diameter most widely suggested in irrigation scheduling for several fruit trees. However, as in other plant-measured approaches, the irrigation decision may be difficult due to the influence of the environment on the values obtained. Reference equations of MDS have been established in order to avoid the effects of environmental conditions. Such equations are usually related to simple meteorological data, in order to easily estimate MDS values in full-irrigated conditions. This paper studies the influence of fruit load and the inter-annual variations on the reference equation of MDS in olive trees. These reference equations were calculated during 4 seasons in a full-irrigated orchard and the equations were validated with the data from a different season. The MDS values were related to vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature taken near the experimental orchard. In addition, meteorological data were considered as mean daily or as midday values: only for temperature was the maximum daily value also used. The validation of the equations was made using the fits with all the meteorological data considered (midday and mean daily of VPD and temperature). In addition, two different fits were used in each meteorological data one according to fruit load and other with the complete pool of data. The equations fit were significantly different each season in all the meteorological data considered. However, seasons with similar fruit load were more similar to each other. In both meteorological data considered (VPD and temperature) the midday values improved the fit in respect to mean daily values. The equations obtained with maximum daily temperature were similar in accuracy to the one of midday. The reference equations in which temperature was used obtained a better fit that the ones calculated with VPD. No significant differences were found in the validation when equations according to fruit load or the complete pool data were compared. The limitations and usefulness of these reference equations are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study we examine the relationships between the vegetation of beech and beech-oak forest communities (Hordelymo-Fagetum, Galio-Fagetum, Deschampsio-Fagetum, Betulo-Quercetum) and their soil conditions in the lowlands of northern Germany, based on 84 sample plots. In all plots the vegetation was recorded and soil parameters were analysed (thickness of the O- and the A-horizons, pH, S-value, base saturation, C/N, mean Ellenberg moisture indicator value). The vegetation classification according to the traditional Braun-Blanquet approach was compared with the result of a multivariate cluster analysis. Vegetation-site relationships were analysed by means of an indirect gradient analysis (DCA).
   Both traditional classification methods and the cluster analysis have produced comparable classification results. So far as the species composition is concerned, a similar grouping of sample plots was found in both approaches. Multivariate cluster analysis thus supports the classification found by the Braun-Blanquet method. The result of the DCA shows that the four forest communities mentioned above represent clearly definable ecological units. The main site factor influencing changes in the species composition is a base gradient, which is best expressed by the S-value. In addition, within the series Hordelymo-Fagetum - Galio-Fagetum - Deschampsio-Fagetum the C/N-ratios and the thickness of the organic layers (O-horizon) increase continuously. By contrast, the floristic differences between oligotrophic forest communities (i.e., Deschampsio-Fagetum and Betulo-Quercetum) cannot be explained by a base gradient and increasing C/N-ratios. It is suggested that a different forest management history in some cases (e.g., promotion of Quercus robur by silvicultural treatments) is responsible for differences in the species composition, but on the other hand the result of the DCA indicates that Fagus sylvatica is replaced by Quercus robur with increasing soil moisture (i.e., with the increasing influence of a high groundwater table). Summarizing these results, it can be concluded that the ecological importance of single site factors affecting the species composition changes within the entire site spectrum covered by the beech and beech-oak forests of northern Germany.

AB  - This research is aimed at studying the different effects and mechanisms of CO2 and N-2 on inhibiting coal spontaneous combustion (CSC) and providing theoretical guidance for the prevention and control of CSC in the goaf. The variations of free radicals and functional groups and the generation of indicator gas CO during lowtemperature oxidation of coal under the conditions of dry air (DA), dry air-nitrogen mixture (DA + N-2) and dry air-carbon dioxide mixture (DA + CO2) were investigated based on electron spin resonance spectrometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatograph. The experimental results reveal that the reaction of free radicals and the transformation of functional groups occur in the low-temperature oxidation process. In the whole oxidation heating process (30-230 degrees C), the concentrations of free radicals (Ng) increase by 4.04 x 10(17) spin/g, 2.24 x 10(17) spin/g and 1.90 x 10(17) spin/g under the conditions of DA, DA + N-2 and DA + CO2, respectively. The variation ranges of peak areas of active functional groups (-C-O-, -C=O, -CH2-, -CH3 and -OH) under the action of inert gases (CO2 and N-2) are notably smaller than those in the DA environment. The time and amount of CO generation both exhibit an obvious "hysteresis effect", indicating that the presence of N-2 and CO2 inhibits coal oxidation and conduces to CSC prevention. A comparison between the values of inhibition effect parameters R (R-CO, R-Ng, R-C-O- and R-C=O) and P (P-CH2-, (-CH3), P-OH) discloses that CO2 boasts a superior ability to inhibit CSC than N-2. This study presents a comparison between N-2 and CO2 in CSC prevention and control based on the variation characteristics of indicator gas and active groups. It provides an experimental and theoretical basis for developing and improving the technology of fire prevention and extinguishing by inert gases.

AB  - It was determined that the existing scientific and methodological approaches to the assessment of the state of financial security of defence industry enterprises due to the specific peculiarities of this industry and the rapid changes in their external environment, currently taking place, need both the advancement in the direction of improving the level of timeliness of such assessment and expansion of the indicators list for its implementation. In the light of modern conditions, characterized by globalization and increased competition in the domestic and foreign arms markets, the defence enterprises can be competitive if they can adapt their activity effectively to the changes in the external environment, take timely preventive measures against the impact of negative environmental factors and make timely use of the opportunities, provided by the environment for strengthening of their financial security. In the research, the authors have improved scientific and methodological approaches to the complex assessment of financial security of defence enterprises - conduction of the analysis upon 3 blocks: definition of the indicators system (including the one upon the criterion of the enterprise's relations state with the subjects of the external environment; express diagnostics of the enterprise's financial security; a full-blown assessment of the financial security of the enterprise, which makes it possible to provide operational efficiency during substantiation of the administrative decisions, concerning the provision of financial security of the enterprises and consider the change of conditions of their interaction with subjects of the external environment. The development of the integration processes in the global economy, in particular defence industries, and the steady increase in competition on the global arms market, provides importers of arms and military equipment (AME) with a diverse choice of means of pressure on the exporters, directly encourage the application of the offset practices in this area. The research determines the ways and priorities of application of the offset activity by defence enterprises of Ukraine in the context of consideration of this phenomenon as a tool for strengthening their financial security thanks to the optimization of expenditures for implementation of the export-import operations and research, development, and engineering activity (RD&T).

AB  - This work is devoted to the study of the use of the subcritical water as an extractant for the extraction of biologically active substances from the yellow onion peel (Allium cepa). The aim of the study is to determine the optimal conditions for the extraction of biologically active substances from the yellow onion peel with the subcritical water in static mode. Optimal conditions were determined by changing the parameters of the factors: temperature 145-185 degrees C, extraction time 10-20 minutes, the ratio of the raw materials mass to the extraction (hydromodule) mass) 1 : 30 - 1 : 60. Other parameters of the factors remained unchanged for each experiment, namely the given pressure of 8 MPa and the degree of raw materials grinding.0.5 mm. To obtain the samples of onion peel extracts, an experimental setup based on a high-pressure reactor "PBA-2-500" was used., The content of dry substances, the total content of polyphenols, the total content of flavonoids, and antioxidant activity were determined in the obtained samples of extracts. As a result, the highest average value of these indicators was found in the extracts obtained at a temperature of 164 degrees C, the extraction duration of 20 minutes, and the hydromodule 1 : 32. The static processing of experimental data was performed using the software package STATISTICA 10. In order to optimize the response function, regression equations were obtained. According to the obtained equation, it was concluded that the interaction between the factors was absent. The values of the determination and correlation coefficients were close to unity, which led to the conclusion that the equations were adequate. Subcritical water extraction was compared in efficiency with two other methods. It was found out that the indicators of the extracts obtained by subcritical water extraction were 1.36 and 1.96 times higher than the dry matter content of extracts, 1.66 and 1.28 times higher than the total content of polyphenols, 1.72 and 1.31 times higher than the total content of flavonoids obtained by 70 % ethanol and hot water extraction methods, respectively. Therefore, the extraction of biologically active substances from the yellow onion peel with the subcritical water in a static mode is a good alternative to other extraction methods.

AB  - Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are ubiquitous aquatic microorganisms that form intracellular nanoparticles of magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4) in a genetically controlled manner. Magnetite and greigite synthesis requires MTB to transport a large amount of iron from the environment. Most intracellular iron was proposed to be contained within the crystals. However, recent mass spectrometry studies suggest that MTB may contain a large amount of iron that is not precipitated in crystals. Here, we attempted to resolve these discrepancies by performing chemical and magnetic assays to quantify the different iron pools in the magnetiteforming strain Magnetospirillurn magneticurn AMB-1, as well as in mutant strains showing defects in crystal precipitation, cultivated at various iron concentrations. All results show that magnetite represents at most 30% of the total intracellular iron under our experimental conditions and even less in the mutant strains. We further examined the iron speciation and subcellular localization in AMB-1 using the fluorescent indicator FIP-1, which was designed for the detection of labile Fe(II). Staining with this probe suggests that unmineralized reduced iron is found in the cytoplasm and associated with magnetosomes. Our results demonstrate that, under our experimental conditions, AMB-1 is able to accumulate a large pool of iron distinct from magnetite. Finally, we discuss the biochemical and geochemical implications of these results.
   IMPORTANCE Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) produce iron-based intracellular magnetic crystals. They represent a model system for studying iron homeostasis and biomineralization in microorganisms. MTB sequester a large amount of iron in their crystals and have thus been proposed to significantly impact the iron biogeochemical cycle. Several studies proposed that MTB could also accumulate iron in a reservoir distinct from their crystals. Here, we present a chemical and magnetic methodology for quantifying the iron pools in the magnetotactic strain AMB-1. Results showed that most iron is not contained in crystals. We then adapted protocols for the fluorescent Fe(II) detection in bacteria and showed that iron could be detected outside crystals using fluorescence assays. This work suggests a more complex picture for iron homeostasis in MTB than previously thought. Because iron speciation controls its fate in the environment, our results also provide important insights into the geochemical impact of MTB.

AB  - Strontium titanate was synthesized by polymer precursor method and its catalytic activity as heterogeneous basic catalyst was tested in transesterification reaction for high-quality biodiesel production form Madhuca indica oil. The synthesized strontium titanate was characterized by powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) attached with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Surface area and basicity were also determined using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analyzer and Hammett indicator method. The structural characterizations of catalyst enunciated the single perovskite phase formation of well-assorted strontium titanate nanospheres. The transesterification reaction was optimized using one variable at a time (OVAT) and Response Surface Methodology (RSM) using Box Behnkehn Design (BBD) to comprehend the linear effect and interactive effect of process variables on biodiesel production. The optimized reaction condition through OVAT was obtained as: catalyst dose (1.3 wt%), methanol to oil molar ratio (18:1), reaction temperature (65 degrees C), reaction time (120 min), and agitation speed (600 rpm) while RSM predicted the highest methyl ester conversion at optimum catalyst dose (1.19 wt%), methanol to oil molar ratio (21.5:1), reaction temperature (71 degrees C), and reaction time (97.7 min). The confirmatory experiment noticed the highest 98% FAME conversion at following reaction conditions catalyst dose (1.2 wt%), methanol to oil molar ratio (22:1), reaction temperature (65 degrees C), and reaction time (100 min). Confirmatory experiment showed its close agreement with the predicted values from RSM instead OVAT. According to RSM, catalyst dose, reaction temperature, reaction time, and methanol to oil molar ratio were influencing process parameters for transesterification in descending order of their strength. Furthermore, a pseudo-first-order kinetic model was established with the activation energy (E-a) of 65.95 kJ mol(-1). The Environmental Factor (E-factor) and Turn Over Frequency (TOF) were also determined and demonstrated the prepared catalyst as a sustainable and potential heterogeneous base catalyst. The physicochemical properties of produced biodiesel were evaluated to check its compatibility with conventional diesel fuel.

AB  - Background Sperm motility parameters, which can be measured objectively and repeatedly by a computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system, are important indicators of sperm quality. However, the sperm motility parameters assessed by a CASA system can be affected by various factors, including instrument components and settings, sperm preparation or analysis procedures. To date, no standardized protocol is available that would permit to assess sperm kinetic characteristics in passerine birds and this lack precludes any comparison of sperm swimming ability and sperm quality across species. Methods In this study, we chose the Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) as the object to evaluate sperm motility parameters, including sperm motility, sperm velocity and sperm movement trajectory, at different analysis time, temperatures and pH using the WLJY-9000 CASA system. Results Sperm motility parameters remained statistically unchanged at 1-9 min. Progressive motility was similar at 38 degrees C and 40 degrees C, but a greater percentage of slow progressive sperm was detected at 38 degrees C compared to 40 degrees C and 42 degrees C. Additionally, progressive motility was lower and immotility was higher at 42 degrees C than 38 degrees C and/or 40 degrees C (close to the body temperature of the Tree Sparrow). The percentages of rapid progressive sperm, progressive sperm and immotile sperm were statistically similar at pH 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0 with the exception of lower percentage of progressive sperm at pH 7.0 compared to pH 7.5. In addition, slower sperm velocity and worse sperm movement trajectory were found at pH 6.0 and 9.0 than those at pH 8.0, 7.5 or 7.0. Conclusions Our study indicates that the ideal conditions for sperm motility parameters assessment in Tree Sparrow are obtained between 1 and 9 min after dilution, an environment at body temperature (40 degrees C) and a pH around 7.5-8.0. The results of this study provide a reference for the evaluation of sperm characteristics and sperm quality using a CASA system in passerine birds.

AB  - Purpose
   The West Sweden Asthma Study (WSAS) is a population-representative longitudinal study established to: (1) generate data on prevalence trends, incidence and remission of asthma, allergy and respiratory conditions, (2) elucidate on the risk and prognostic factors associated with these diseases, (3) characterise clinically relevant phenotypes of these diseases and (4) catalyse relevant mechanistic, genomic, genetic and translational investigations.
   Participants
   WSAS comprised of randomly selected individuals aged 16 to 75 years who are followed up longitudinally. The first stage involved a questionnaire survey (>42 000 participants) and was undertaken in 2008 and 2016. A random sample (about 8000) of participants in the initial survey undergoes extensive clinical investigations every 8 to 10 years (first investigations in 2009 to 2012, second wave currently ongoing). Measurements undertaken at the clinical investigations involve structured interviews, self-completed questionnaire on personality traits, physical measurements and extensive biological samples.
   Findings to date
   Some of our key findings have shown a 54% increase in the use of asthma medications between the 1990s and 2000s, primarily driven by a five-fold increase in the use of inhaled corticosteroids. About 36% of asthmatics expressed at least one sign of severe asthma indicator, with differential lung performance, inflammation and allergic sensitisation among asthmatics with different signs of severe asthma. Multi-symptom asthmatics were at greater risk of having indicators of severe asthma. In all adults, being raised on a farm was associated with a decreased risk of allergic sensitisation, rhinitis and eczema, but not asthma. However, among adolescents (ie, those 16 to 20 years of age), being raised on a farm decreased the risk of asthma. Personality traits were associated with both beliefs of asthma medication and adherence to treatment.
   Future plans
   Follow-up of the cohort is being undertaken every 8 to 10 years. The repeated clinical examinations will take place in 2019 to 2022. The cohort data are currently being linked to routine Swedish healthcare registers for a continuous follow-up. Mechanistic, genomic, genetic and translational investigations are ongoing.

AB  - Fossiliferous beds in a complex sequence of late Middle to Late Pleistocene deposits at Whittlesey, eastern England, provided a rare opportunity for a multidisciplinary study of the palaeoecology of cool/cold stage deposits from different glacial stages. The fossiliferous sediments investigated form part of the River Nene 1st Terrace. Three of the four fossil assemblages investigated pre-date the last interglacial stage (Ipswichian/Eemian/marine oxygen isotope stage (MIS) 5e), whereas the other dates to part of the MIS 3 interstadial complex (Middle Devensian/Weichselian). Pollen, plant macrofossil, molluscan, coleopteran, ostracod, foraminifera and vertebrate data are available to a greater or lesser extent for each cool/cold stage assemblage, and they broadly present the same ecological picture for each one: a continuum from low-energy permanent to non-permanent aquatic habitats through marshland with associated waterside taxa, together with flood influxes of fluvial, riparian and ruderal taxa. Although each fossil assemblage records cool/cold climatic conditions, to a greater or lesser extent, these conditions are more apparent in the insect and ostracod faunas. In comparison with results published for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) stadial in The Netherlands, palaeotemperature estimates based on ranges of mutual agreement between independent coleopteran and ostracod methods for the three pre-Ipswichian/Eemian assemblages indicate minimum mean July air temperatures that are from +1 degrees to +3 degrees C warmer, but January values that embrace the -8 degrees C estimate for the LGM. There is, however, a disparity between the coleopteran and ostracod palaeotemperature estimates for the Middle Devensian/Weichselian fossil assemblage, which are based on two different sample stratigraphic levels; the lower, coleopteran assemblage is indicative of very cool, continental climates, whereas the stratigraphically slightly higher ostracod assemblage suggests a climatic amelioration. Lack of numerical age-estimates prevents a robust stratigraphical interpretation, but the youngest pre-Ipswichian/Eemian fossil assemblage could date to the MIS 7-6 transition, at a time when cooling possibly preceded glacially driven sea-level fall. It is apparent from the rich coleopteran data that some continental cold-indicator taxa also appeared in pre-Ipswichian/Eemian cold stages and therefore assignment of continental cold-indicator taxa to particular Devensian/Weichselian intervals should be undertaken with care.

AB  - Biofuels are expected to be a major contributor to renewable energy in the coming decades under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). These fuels have many attractive properties including the promotion of energy independence, rural development, and the reduction of national carbon emissions. However, several unresolved environmental and economic concerns remain. Environmentally, much of the biomass is expected to come from agricultural expansion and/or intensification, which may greatly affect the net environmental impact, and economically, the lack of a developed infrastructure and bottlenecks along the supply chain may affect the industry's economic vitality. The approximately 30 million acres (12 million hectares) under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) represent one land base for possible expansion. Here, we examine the potential role of the CRP in biofuels industry development, by (1) assessing the range of environmental effects on six end points of concern, and (2) simulating differences in potential industry growth nationally using a systems dynamics model. The model examines seven land-use scenarios (various percentages of CRP cultivation for biofuel) and five economic scenarios (subsidy schemes) to explore the benefits of using the CRP. The environmental assessment revealed wide variation in potential impacts. Lignocellulosic feedstocks had the greatest potential to improve the environmental condition relative to row crops, but the most plausible impacts were considered to be neutral or slightly negative. Model simulations revealed that industry growth was much more sensitive to economic scenarios than land-use scenarios-similar volumes of biofuels could be produced with no CRP as with 100% utilization. The range of responses to economic policy was substantial, including long-term market stagnation at current levels of first-generation biofuels under minimal policy intervention, or RFS-scale quantities of biofuels if policy or market conditions were more favorable. In total, the combination of the environmental assessment and the supply chain model suggests that large-scale conversion of the CRP to row crops would likely incur a significant environmental cost, without a concomitant benefit in terms of biofuel production.

AB  - Question: The eu-atlantic forest herb Ceratocapnos claviculata showed a recent increase in frequency within its native range and an eastward and northward range expansion in Central Europe. To gain deeper understanding of factors affecting the range expansion of the species, we analyzed vegetation releves at three different scales and asked the following questions: As the species occurs in a wide range of vegetation types, is variation in community composition across the entire range related to climatic environmental zones and tree cover? Are there differences in species composition and habitat characteristics between the native range and the two invaded regions (S Sweden and NE Germany)? Did community composition and habitat characteristics within the native range (The Netherlands) change between 'before 1970' and '1990 to 2006'?
   Location: W, C and N Europe.
   Methods: We analysed vegetation-plot data with C. claviculata from various databases and own surveys using partial CCA, partial DCA, Indicator Species Analysis, MANCOVA and multiple regression.
   Results: Using vegetation plots from the entire distribution range, climatic environmental zones explained 68.9% of the total canonical Eigenvalue. Differences in floristic composition and habitat characteristics between the two invaded regions were as large as between native and invaded range sites. However, releves from the invaded range were generally characterized by anthropogenic disturbance. Accordingly, abundance of C. claviculata was positively linked to silvicultural intensity. New releves from 1990 to 2006 were characterized by higher Ellenberg nutrient indicator values, lower species diversity, higher proportions of neophytic and hemerobic species and showed a lower cover of the study species than old releves from before 1970.
   Conclusions: Across the range of C. claviculata, climatic environmental zones determine vegetation composition. Accordingly, the species is characterized by a broad macroclimatic amplitude. Vegetation composition and structure differ significantly between the two regions of the new range. Thus, the species has successfully established under various biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. Beyond potential positive effects of soil eutrophication and mild winters, anthropogenic impact may directly facilitate seed dispersal and provide sites and resource conditions suitable for germination and establishment of C. claviculata, whereas a decrease of forest management may constrain the species.

AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a non-flammable, non-explosive, colorless gas. It is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and an important chemical intermediate in several industrial processes. The toxicological properties of SO2, including its genotoxic potential, have been studied extensively. The majority of the available in vitro data indicate a lack of genotoxicity of SO2, while for sulfite salts some positive results have been reported. However, recent in vivo studies, using Kunming albino mice, have pointed to in vivo clastogenicity of SO2. To re-evaluate these positive findings, a bone-marrow micronucleus test according to OECD Guideline No. 474 was performed. NMRI mice (m/f) were exposed by inhalation via whole-body exposure to 0 (clean air), 2.7, 8, 27, or 80 mg/m(3) (0, 1, 3, 10, or 30 ppm) SO2 for 4 h/day on 7 consecutive days. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after start of the last exposure, and blood samples (for complementing hematology) and bone marrow smears (for analysis of micronuclei) were prepared. Under the conditions used, exposure to SO2 caused no acute toxicity, mortality, or reduction in body weight. Compared with the clean-air controls, hematological parameters such as hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocyte/platelet/total leukocyte counts, differential white blood cell counts, and indicators of blood formation (reticulocyte counts, ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow) remained unchanged by SO2 treatment. Unlike the previously reported studies on micronucleus formation, SO2 did not induce micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes of the bone marrow, whereas the positive control cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg body weight) was quite effective in this respect. Interestingly, SO2 treatment significantly enhanced malondialdehyde levels in erythrocyte lysates (TBARS method), indicating SO2-mediated oxidative stress, but also demonstrating systemic availability of the inhaled SO2. In conclusion, the present study could not reproduce the genotoxicity findings of the previously reported studies. SO2 is thus considered non-genotoxic in polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of NMRI mice under the conditions and in the concentrations used. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parental care requires a complex integration of physiology and behaviour, yet little is known about the physiological and energetic consequences or correlates of these behaviours. Using two species of male black bass (smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu; largemouth bass, M. salmoides) as a model, the focus of this study was to determine the biochemical and hematological indicators of change in nutritional status and potential for chronic stress. This was accomplished by randomly sampling individuals at four stages across parental care. Additionally, a subset of individuals was repeatedly sampled at three brood development stages to track changes in biochemical factors within the individual. Though there were changes in physiological factors across parental care in randomly sampled fish of both species (declines in plasma glucose in largemouth bass; decreases in hematocrit and plasma chloride in smallmouth bass), repeated sampling of individuals was determined to be a more appropriate sampling technique due to natural variability in biochemical factors among individual fish. Repeated sampling of smallmouth bass did not adversely influence physiological metrics or brood abandonment. However, there were higher incidences of nest abandonment in repeatedly sampled largemouth bass. Amongst the repeatedly sampled smallmouth bass, nutritional indicators such as plasma triglyceride levels decreased indicating individual fasting across the majority of parental care. Increases in plasma calcium and magnesium towards the end of care indicated that feeding most likely resumed when the brood was close to independence after similar to 3 weeks of care. Lastly, several indicators of chronic stress, such as plasma glucose and chloride levels, increased throughout the parental care period. These sublethal stressors are indicative of decreasing body condition associated with prolonged activity and fasting which may have marked impacts on the ability of an individual to continue parental care for the current brood and impact subsequent individual fitness. Further research into the mechanistic relationships between behaviour, physiology, and energetics during the parental care period will provide a better understanding of the decisions by individuals facing multiple trade-offs that ultimately lead to differences in individual fitness.

AB  - The Silurian is characterised by strong environmental changes, as indicated by several pronounced positive delta C-13 and delta O-18 excursions. The mechanisms responsible for these isotopic shifts are a matter of much debate. The purpose of the present study is a quantitative high-resolution evaluation of the palynomorph distribution across the Late Ludlow (Ludfordian) isotope excursion on Gotland. Marine and terrestrial palynomorphs have been chosen as palaeoenvironmental indicators because they are widely distributed and exceptionally well preserved. Moreover, the combined analysis of marine and terrestrial palynomorphs allows the reconstruction of contemporaneous palaeoenvironmental change in the marine and terrestrial realms. To correlate our results with the carbon isotope stratigraphy, we have sampled only localities with published isotope data from diagenetically unaltered brachiopod shells. Our results show that fluctuations in the composition of the acritarch assemblages are closely correlated with the stable isotope development. Low abundances of acritarchs occur in times of high stable isotope values and vice versa, indicating that an increase in marine productivity cannot have been the reason for the positive delta C-13 excursion. The results are in good agreement with climatic models for the Silurian assuming alternating humid and arid climatic conditions in low latitudes. Times of high stable isotope values correspond to arid climatic conditions in low latitudes, with low input of terrestrial nutrients resulting in impoverished acritarch and conodont communities, whereas times of low stable isotope values correlate with humid climate, high nutrient input, and abundant and diverse acritarch communities. The major change in acritarch communities took place during the increase of the stable isotope values after hemipelagic planktonic or nektonic organisms (graptolites, conodonts) have been affected. This indicates that environmental changes connected with the stable isotope excursion first affected deeper-water settings and later the photic zone. The absolute abundance of terrestrial spores closely mirrors the marine delta C-13 and delta O-18 development, showing that both the marine and the terrestrial realm were synchronously affected by the climatic changes. The high abundance of spores during the isotope excursion might be explained by increased aeolian input. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Shchuch'ya inlier, geomorphologically highlighted against the plain topography of the southwestern Yamal Peninsula near the northern subduction of the Polar Urals, is a link between the buried structures of the basement of the West Siberian geosyneclise (WSG) and geodynamically well-explored Paleozoic structures of the eastern slope of the Urals. Within the entire Uralo-Mongolian Fold Belt, this block displays unique denudation. In addition, there are numerous quarries along the railway and automobile road which are constructed from the town of Labytnangi to northern Yamal. Such a profitable situation, supplemented with data of prospecting and core drilling, makes this area a key object for studying a complete set of facies settings, stages of development, and conditions of the formation of island-arc complexes in the geochronological range from Ordovician to Carboniferous.
   Results of the complex study of the Shchuch'ya inlier by detailed biostratigraphy, structure-tectonic mapping, lithogeodynamic and facies analysis, petrology, petrogeochemistry, and organic geochemistry permitted us to reconstruct the settings and evolution stages of sedimentogenesis and petrogenesis, to corroborate the island-arc nature of structure-formational complexes of this territory, and to reveal their most important morphological, structural, facies, and petrochemical indicator characteristics, which can be efficiently used for the diagnostics of geodynamic settings and interpretation of drilling and geophysical data in other areas of the WSG. The specific features of the explored complexes are regular lateral and vertical combinations of thick carbonate massifs with volcanic, terrigenous, and siliceous rocks, the presence of slope facies (thick elastic mixtites and fine-terrigenous gradational gravitites) around the organogenic reefs, and spatial closeness of deep- and shallow-water facies due to contrasting bathymetric differentiation of the paleobasin. We have established microfacies types of organogenic reefs, conditions of formation of zones of gravitational, hypergenic, and tectonic desintegration of rocks as potential reservoirs, molecular composition, distribution, and catagenesis of organic matter in reefs and near-reef facies as factors contributing to their oil-producing potential. Comparative analysis of geological and geophysical data on other regions of the WSG shows that the island-arc complexes with thick organogenic bodies are rather widespread in the Paleozoic stage of the WSG.

AB  - Symmeria paniculata is a common, evergreen tree species from the lowest part of the flooding gradient in blackwater inundation forests in Central Amazonia (Brazil) which does not shed submerged leaves. Chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured regularly in non-submerged and submerged leaves of different age classes in 1999-2000. Measurements at up to 8 m under the water were performed in both years. Chlorophyll concentration was determined in the leaves of different age classes; the older leaves having experienced submergence of several months. The F-v/F-m values ('current photochemical capacity' of photosystem II (PSII)) in non-submerged leaves and in those submerged at 0-1 m depth were not correlated with the changing water levels and remained above the lower limit of natural variation of healthy leaves (>0.66), indicating an undamaged photochemical apparatus. Younger leaves showed higher F-v/F-m values than older leaves which in turn showed higher values than in currently submerged leaves. Leaves submerged in darkness (1-7 m depth, up to 163 days of submergence at the time of measuring) showed F-v/F-m values between 0.7 and 0.4, showing a negative correlation with the duration of submergence. The recovery of these F-v/F-m values to mostly greater than or equal to0.7 during falling water levels apparently took place when still underwater. 'Rapid light curves' of leaves submerged at >1 m depth revealed that the PSII started with electron transport when illuminated. However, the electron transport was apparently inhibited shortly after the start. A negative correlation was found between the inhibition of electron transport and the depth/duration of submergence. Chlorophyll concentration was significantly correlated with leaf age, i.e. long-term submergence did not affect this pattern. Comparison of anatomical and morphological leaf structures with other Polygonaceae revealed that S. paniculata follows the general pattern of the family, i.e. they did not appear to be related to particular floodplain conditions. However, several features such as thick epidermis cells and cuticula, cuticular wrinkles, epicuticular waxes, raised stomatal rims, and sunken stomata should facilitate the survival under floodplain conditions.

AB  - Bacterial colonization and growth responses of hybrid spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii) seedlings after inoculation with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were evaluated in controlled environment and field assays. Six antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains belonging to the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas were used as inocula. For controlled environment assays, surface sterilized seeds were inoculated with log 6 Bacillus or log 8 Pseudomonas colony-forming units (cfu) under gnotobiotic conditions for assessment of rhizosphere and internal root and stem tissue colonization. In the field trial, one-year-old, container-grown hybrid spruce seedlings were inoculated with each of the Bacillus or Pseudomonas strains 1-2 days before planting at nine field sites in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. All six strains colonized the rhizosphere with log 5.6-7.6 cfu g(-1) root tissue under controlled environmental conditions. Two strains, Bacillus Pw-2R and Pseudomonas Sm3-RN, were also recovered from internal root and stem tissues with population sizes ranging from log 3.9 to log 5.0 cfu g(-1) plant tissue. In the field trial, PGPR survived the winter in the rhizosphere with populations of log 2 to log 5 cfu g(-1) root tissue 17 months after inoculation. In addition, spruce growth was significantly enhanced by bacterial inoculation at certain sites. The most effective growth-promoting strains were the endophytes, Sm3-RN and Pw2-R, and the external root colonizing strain, Ss2-RN. These three strains increased seedling dry weight up to 57% above noninoculated controls at five of the nine outplanting sites. Pseudomonas strain Sw1 and the other two Bacillus strains produced mean spruce dry weight increases at four of the sites. Seedling growth inhibition due to bacterial inoculation was detected at some sites. Our results confirm the short-term, sire specific effectiveness of PGPR for reforestation of conifer seedlings, and indicate that benefits of a single inoculation at planting can extend through the second year in the field. In addition, bacteria capable of colonizing the seedling interior may be more effective PGPR for spruce than those restricted to the rhizosphere and the root surface. However, site specific seedling growth promotion may necessitate matching PGPR strains to outplanting sites for effective growth promotion. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Volcanoes represent one of the most critical geological settings for hazard modelling due to their propensity to both unpredictably erupt and collapse, even in times of quiescence. Volcanoes are heterogeneous at multiple scales, from porosity, which is variably distributed and frequently anisotropic, to strata, which are laterally discontinuous and commonly pierced by fractures and faults. Due to variable and, at times, intense stress and strain conditions during and following emplacement, volcanic rocks span an exceptionally wide range of physical and mechanical properties. Understanding the constituent materials' attributes is key to improving the interpretation of the hazards posed by the diverse array of volcanic complexes. Here, we examine the spectrum of physical and mechanical properties presented by a single dome-forming eruption at a dacitic volcano, Mount Unzen (Japan), by testing a number of isotropic and anisotropic lavas in tension and compression with acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. The lava dome erupted as a series of 13 lobes between 1991 and 1995, and its ongoing instability means that much of the volcano and its surroundings remain within an exclusion zone today. During a field campaign in 2015, we selected four representative blocks as the focus of this study. The core samples from each block span a range in total porosity from 9.14% to 42.81% and a range in permeability from 1.65 x 10(-15) to 1.88 x 10(-9) m(2) (from 1065 measurements). For a given porosity, sample permeability varies by > 2 orders of magnitude and is typically lower for macroscopically anisotropic samples than for isotropic samples of similar porosity. An additional 379 permeability measurements on planar surfaces of both an isotropic and anisotropic sample block showed consistent minimum, maximum, and average permeabilities, and comparable standard deviations to measurements on core and disc samples; this indicated a negligible impact of sample size on recorded permeability across the range of sample sizes and absolute permeabilities tested. Permeability measured under confined conditions showed that the lowest permeability samples, whose porosity largely comprises microfractures, are most sensitive to effective pressure and that anisotropy of permeability is enhanced by confinement. The permeability measurements highlight the importance of the measurement approach, scale, and confinement conditions in the description of permeability. The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) ranges from 13.48 to 47.80MPa, and tensile strength (UTS) using the Brazilian disc method ranges from 1.30 to 3.70MPa, with crack-dominated lavas being weaker than vesicle-dominated materials of equivalent porosity. UCS is lower in saturated conditions, whereas the impact of saturation on UTS is variable. UCS is between 6.8 and 17.3 times higher than UTS, with anisotropic samples forming each endmember. The Young's modulus of dry samples ranges from 4.49 to 21.59 GPa and is systematically reduced in water-saturated tests. The interrelation of porosity, UCS, UTS, and Young's modulus was modelled with good replication of the data, and empirical relationships are provided. Acceleration of monitored acoustic emission (AE) rates during deformation was assessed by fitting Poisson point process models in a Bayesian framework.
   An exponential acceleration model closely replicated the tensile strength tests, whilst compressive tests tended to have relatively high early rates of AEs, suggesting failure forecast may be more accurate in tensile regimes, though with shorter warning times. The Gutenberg-Richter b value has a negative correlation with connected porosity for both UCS and UTS tests which we attribute to different stress intensities caused by differing pore networks. The b value is higher for UTS than UCS, and it typically decreases (positive Delta b) during tests, with the exception of cataclastic samples in compression. Delta b correlates positively with connected porosity in compression and correlates negatively in tension. Delta b using a fixed sampling length may be a more useful metric for monitoring changes in activity at volcanoes than the b value with an arbitrary starting point. Using coda wave interferometry (CWI), we identify velocity reductions during mechanical testing in compression and tension, the magnitude of which is greater in more porous samples in UTS but independent of porosity in UCS and which scales to both b value and Delta b. Yet, saturation obscures velocity changes caused by evolving material properties, which could mask damage accrual or source migration in water-rich seismogenic environments such as volcanoes. The results of this study highlight that heterogeneity and anisotropy within a single system not only add variability but also have a defining role in the channelling of fluid flow and localisation of strain that dictate a volcano's hazards and the geophysical indicators we use to interpret them.

AB  - Simple Summary: Welfare assessments for animals require the use of specific indicators. These indicators should be practical and easy to use in an on-farm environment while correctly reflecting on the animals' welfare. Our aim was to review literature on such indicators for goats, as small ruminants have not received as much attention as other farm animals in the field of welfare assessment. Some indicators such as lameness are already well investigated and suitable for use in goat welfare assessments. Others, for example, lying behaviour, need more research, as the limited amount of knowledge restrains the information on validity or usefulness. As in other animals, the welfare of goats has become an increasingly important issue in public discourse. Our overview on indicators aids in developing tools to measure and improve the welfare of goats.<br>This review describes the current state of knowledge relating to scientific literature on welfare indicators for goats. Our aim was to provide an overview of animal-based indicators for on-farm welfare assessments. We performed a literature search and extracted 96 relevant articles by title, abstract, and full-text screening. Out of these articles, similar indicators were aggregated to result in a total of 32 welfare indicators, some of which were covered in multiple articles, others in only a single one. We discuss a set of three established assessment protocols containing these indicators, as well as all individual indicators which were covered in more than one article. As single indicators, we identified lameness, body condition score (BCS), qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA), and human-animal relationship (HAR) tests with substantial evidence for sufficient validity to assess welfare in goats. A multitude of indicators (e.g., hair coat condition) was studied less intensively but was successfully used for welfare assessments. For some indicators (e.g., oblivion, lying behaviour), we highlight the need for future research to further validate them or to optimise their use in on-farm welfare assessments. Moreover, further investigations need to include kids, bucks, and meat and fibre goats, as well as extensively kept goats as the literature predominantly focuses on dairy goats in intensive production systems.

AB  - Purpose Winter road maintenance in the Nordic climate is demanding due to challenging weather conditions, high precipitation, and icy conditions. As a leading country in the transition to low-emission transport, Norway must work to reduce their emissions while providing a safe level of service through winter maintenance operations. This article investigates the environmental impacts of winter road maintenance (WRM) in Norway both today and under a climate change scenario predicted for 2050. Methods Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental impact of the functional unit "average winter road maintenance in Norway on national and county roads per km.lane." The ReCiPe (hierarchy) method was used to identify and categorize emissions related to WRM to show how different factors affect the system and to reveal hidden emissions hotspots. Real-time data from WRM vehicles were used to determine how fuel consumption is affected by gradient and weather. Producers and operators provided other relevant information on WRM vehicles. Official reports supplied information on deicer quantities used and the total distance driven by WRM vehicles in Norway. Results and discussion The quantity of deicer used is the main source of emissions contributing toward all impact categories. The effect of deicer is likely to be even higher in certain impact categories. The environmental impact of the deicer after application is not included. The representation of WRM in existing emissions data is limited despite the considerable amount of deicer applied and the long distances that WRM vehicles travel. The results document how energy use throughout the system is another important source of emissions. Various parameters, such as road gradient, vehicle properties, driver behavior, and weather, affect the fuel consumption of WRM vehicles, with weather being the most important of these. Conclusions Significant potential for emissions reductions from WRM was found, and WRM operations should be included in cold-climate road LCA studies. The environmental impacts of deicer application are especially high compared to the mechanical clearing of roads and contribute strongly to impact categories such as terrestrial, freshwater, and human toxicity and to the formation of particulate matter.

AB  - Simple Summary Goats play a key multifunctional role in food security and poverty alleviation for small farmers in many less developed countries. Unfortunately, the productivity level of these goats is low. Among the alternatives proposed to overcome this situation, one is to establish a phenotypic breeding program with the support of community breeding organizations. In this study, genetic parameters were estimated for the growth, conformation, and survival of 1538 young goats raised by small farmers in Burundi organized in farmer field schools. Overall, the results suggest that phenotypic selection of growth and conformation traits would be possible if data recording and animal management were improved. On the other hand, efforts to improve survival should focus on improving the environmental conditions in which kids are raised. The role of community breeding organizations and animal health workers is therefore essential to disseminate breeding techniques and methods that optimize animal production and health.
   Abstract The goal of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for the growth, conformation, and survival of goat kids raised in smallholder farming systems in Burundi. To do this, measurements were taken on live weight, thoracic perimeter, length, and height at birth (n = 1538 animals), at 3 months (n = 1270 animals), at 6 months (n = 992 animals), at 9 months (n = 787 animals), and at 12 months (n = 705 animals). Kids were born between 2016 and 2019, from 645 dams and 106 bucks. Three bivariate animal models were used to estimate genetic parameters of body weight and conformation measurements as potential indicators of this weight. According to the measure, heritability was estimated between 15 and 17% and genetic correlations between 65 and 79%. An accelerated failure time animal model was used to estimate the heritability of survival for kids under one year, adjusted for birth weight. Goat survival was significantly prolonged by 0.64 days per kilogram of birth weight. The estimated heritability for this trait was 2%. Overall, these results suggest that a selection program could be implemented to improve animal growth, either directly on weight or indirectly on conformational traits. At the same time, efforts need to be made to improve rearing conditions to increase the survival of kids.

AB  - Hypothesis: Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) - random deviations from perfect symmetry that are used as a measure of developmental stability - is an effective indicator of stress and fitness in threespine stickleback.
   Organisms: The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and two other species, the brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) and ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), were the focus of a review of the literature. In addition, four populations of G. aculeatus - one anadromous population from the Kamchatka River, two marine populations from the White Sea, and one freshwater population from the White Sea basin - were studied in the field.
   Methods: A review of the literature relating fluctuating asymmetry to different variables, and a comparison of fluctuating asymmetry in four populations of stickleback, which differed in geographical distribution and life history, using lateral plates and four cranial bones (operculum, lachrymal, third suborbital, quadrate).
   Results: An appraisal of the literature on fluctuating asymmetry suggests that decreasing interest in FA studies has likely resulted from conflicting research results. To some extent, this problem is likely caused by the morphological structures used in FA analysis, which are generally limited to the lateral plates and pelvic fins. These structures can evolve quickly in response to various environmental changes, thus their fluctuating asymmetry reflects not only individual fitness and stress, but also multiple uncontrolled factors that may directly affect those same structures. Using four cranial bones in our analysis showed lower fluctuating asymmetry in anadromous stickleback from the Kamchatka Peninsula compared with marine and freshwater stickleback from the White Sea and its basin. This may be caused by more favourable feeding conditions in the North Pacific than in the White Sea. The different environmental conditions at these locations did not appear to have a significant effect on fluctuating asymmetry, although the comparison of freshwater, anadromous, and marine populations showed that the fluctuating asymmetry of the structures we used is responsive to these differences. Our FA analysis of the selected bone structures reveals clear heterogeneity in stickleback with different life histories. We suggest that these structures can be considered reliable for studies of fluctuating asymmetry in stickleback fishes.

AB  - Succession theory argues that the taxonomic and functional structure of assembling communities is regulated by the interplay of local environmental conditions and regional factors such as available species pools or landscape configurations that moderate dispersal. Yet, the relative importance of these factors and whether they control different aspects of community structure, for example species diversity or the composition of plant traits, is not well understood. This limits predictions of spatial variation in successional outcomes. We explored patterns of species diversity and traits in recovering calcareous grasslands that varied in environmental conditions, age, past and present spatial landscape configuration, as well as in the propagule pressure they receive from historical grasslands that have large and functionally distinct species pools. Mixed-effects modelling and multimodel inference were used to dissect the leading drivers of species diversity and functional composition. Propagule pressure from the regional species pools of old grasslands during early stages of grassland re-assembly was an important determinant of community structure, with significant effects not only on species diversity but also on the composition of traits related to resource economics. Such species pool effects exceeded positive influences of environmental heterogeneity on species richness and confounded well-known diversity-environment and trait-environment relationships. As an orthogonal axis of community assembly, environmental sorting occurred along a gradient of soil texture that discriminated species according to their canopy height and - to a smaller extent - phenology. Additionally, high grassland perimeter-area ratios favoured specialist species richness and increased the proportion of species with predicted poor epizoochorous and wind dispersal.Synthesis. We provide empirical evidence that both species pool effects and local environmental sorting operate during community assembly of recovering calcareous grasslands, but that they influence different aspects of plant community structure. Further, we show that geographic variation in propagule pressure from large and functionally distinct source species pools can confound diversity-environment and trait-environment relationships. Therefore, besides accounting for environmental factors, considering the location of source species pools, as well as their compositional and functional characteristics, is a prerequisite for robust predictions of contingencies in taxonomic and functional community structure of successional habitats.

AB  - The advantage of the clonal plants over the nonclonal species in colonization of all biomes and biogeographical regions primarily is due to occurrence of two modes of reproduction. The creating of vegetative propagules with high vitality and survivability, enables the spread in the newly colonized site, while seed production increases the chances for successful recruitment of seedlings, ensuring the genetic diversity of the population. The differences in allocation into vegetative reproduction and generative propagation in relation to rising height of adjacent plants was investigated in populations of Serratula tinctoria L., occurring in Molinietum caeruleae meadows localized in Southern Poland. Each locality was represented by randomly established three permanent study plots: dominated by small meadow species (LOW), prevailed by large-tussock grasses (INTER) and overgrown by shrubs and trees (HIGH). In the years 2009-2011 the number of leaf rosettes and length of the longest leaf in rosette (as a measure of allocation in vegetative propagation), as well as height of generative stems, number of capitula per stem and number of seeds per capitulum (as indicators of investment in generative reproduction) were observed.
   The allocation in vegetative reproduction decreased along the gradient of vegetation height. The gradually decline of number of rosettes might be caused by lack of free space suitable for establishment of new ramets, whereas the small leaf size could be due to drastically augmentation of shading. The allocation in generative reproduction increased along the gradient of vegetation height. The placement of structures necessary for generative propagation in higher layers of herbaceous canopy, as well as considerable number of capitula and seed production might increase the chances for successful recruitment of seedlings.
   On the basis of obtained results combining with published data it should be assumed, that the substantial allocation in vegetative reproduction and the slight investment in generative propagation seems to be sufficient for persistence of Serratula tinctoria populations in patches dominated by small meadow species, while the considerable allocation in generative reproduction could be crucial for maintenance of population viability under competitive conditions.

AB  - Archaeological research in central-northern Patagonia (Atlantic coast and lower the valley of Chubut river) showed that this area was used since at least the Middle Holocene. Stable isotope analyses (13C and 15N) of human bone samples indicate that hunter-gatherers living in that area had a terrestrial-marine diet including guanaco meat, land plants, mollusks and pinnipeds. Despite this general trend, intersite variability and changes through time were noted, especially after the late Holocene. These results have been reinforced by archaeofaunal, technological and bioarchaeological records. In this paper, three hypotheses are examined: (a) the diet of these populations was complete and rich enough to ensure good health status and avoid nutritional deficiencies; (b) carbohydrate consumption increased progressively after 1000 BP, when pottery technology was adopted and (c) this kind of mixed diet would have been qualitatively more nutritious than that of other populations of the region, which would have resulted in better nutritional and healthy conditions. These three hypotheses are compared with dental results obtained from 563 permanent teeth from 45 individuals (34 adults and 11 juveniles from both sexes), rescued from burial sites. Indicators of oral health were assessed through the observation of caries, abscesses, wear, pulpar cavity exposure and ante mortem loss. Features of nutritional status such as enamel hypoplasia, porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia were also examined. Given the availability of direct radiocarbon dating for most of the sample, three temporal series were determined: Before 1000 BP, 10005000 BP and Post-contact. No evidence of alimentary stress or iron deficiency was found in individuals from the three series, which accounts for healthy and good nutritional life conditions. After 1000 BP, the results show a progressive increase in the caries percentage and a decrease in abscesses, dental wear and ante mortem losses frequency. This is possibly related to more consumption of processed foods in the last 1000 years. These results were compared with similar studies based on samples from different environments and latitudes of Patagonia. Evidence suggests that mixed diets (marine-terrestrial) would have been more appropriate and nutritionally complete than exclusively marine or terrestrial diets.

AB  - White-tailed deer were introduced into the Czech Republic about one hundred years ago. Population numbers have remained stable at low density despite almost no harvesting. This differs from other introductions of this species in Europe. We presumed that one of the possible factors preventing expansion of the white-tailed deer Population is lack of high-quality food components in in area overpopulated by sympatric roe, fallow and red deer. We analyzed the WTD winter diet and diets of the other deer species to get information on their feeding strategy (hiring a critical period of a year. We focused primarily on conifer needle consumption, a generally accepted indicator of starvation and on bramble leaves as an indicator of high-quality items. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) If the environment has a limited food supply, the poorest competitors of the four deer species will have the highest proportion of conifer needles in the diet : (2) the deer will overlap in trophic niches and will share limited nutritious resource (bramble). White-tailed, roe. fallow. and red deer diets were investigated by microscopic analysis of plant remain,,,, in their faeces. The volume of bramble decreased in the diet of all four deer species from November to March. The content of conifer needles in the diet of white-tailed and roe deer was negatively correlated with bramble and in spring made up 90 % of their diet volume. On the other hand conifer needles in the diet of red and fallow deer occurred only in January with snow cover. Fallow and red deer started the compensation of winter starvation at least one month earlier than both roe and white-tailed deer. A high content of conifers in white-tailed deer diet in the second half of the winter fully support the presumption about low nutritional food supply and its diet. It can lead to a markedly impaired condition for white-tailed and roe deer and negatively affect their condition. The dietary overlap of four sympatric deer species was extensive in winter. All species share a limited good quality food supply (bramble) when food is scarce, suggesting that interspecific competition may occur.

AB  - 1. To assess whether the reported slow breakdown of litter in tropical Cerrado streams is due to local environmental conditions or to the intrinsic leaf characteristics of local plant species, we compared the breakdown of leaves from Protium brasiliense, a riparian species of Cerrado (Brazilian savannah), in a local and a temperate stream. The experiment was carried out at the time of the highest litter fall in the two locations. An additional summer experiment was conducted in the temperate stream to provide for similar temperature conditions.
   2. The breakdown rates (k) of P. brasiliense leaves in the tropical Cerrado stream ranged from 0.0001 to 0.0008 day(-1) and are among the slowest reported. They were significantly (F = 20.12, P < 0.05) lower than in the temperate stream (0.0046 - 0.0055). The maximum ergosterol content in decomposing leaves in the tropical Cerrado stream was 106 mu g g(-1), (1.9% of leaf mass) measured by day 75, which was lower than in the temperate stream where maximum ergosterol content of 522 mu g g(-1) (9.5% of leaf mass) was achieved by day 30. The ATP content, as an indicator of total microbial biomass, was up to four times higher in the tropical Cerrado than in the temperate stream (194.0 versus 49.4 nmoles g(-1)).
   3. Unlike in the temperate stream, leaves in the tropical Cerrado were not colonised by shredder invertebrates. However, in none of the experiments did leaves exposed (coarse mesh bags) and unexposed (fine mesh bags) to invertebrates differ in breakdown rates (F = 1.15, P > 0.05), indicating that invertebrates were unable to feed on decomposing P. brasiliense leaves.
   4. We conclude that the slow breakdown of P. brasiliense leaves in the tropical Cerrado stream was because of the low nutrient content in the water, particularly nitrate (0.05 mgN L-1), which slows down fungal activity and to the low density of invertebrates capable of using these hard leaves as an energy source.

AB  - Simple Summary Soil quality and fertility rely on soil microorganisms which contribute to nutrient cycling and plant nutrition. Accidental or intentional fires can almost completely kill soil microbiota and cause soil sterilization. Fires can also destroy soil organic matter (OM), thus causing the release of potentially toxic elements such as Cr that can further disturb soil recolonization by surviving bacteria. The identification of species able to cope with such altered environments is highly relevant to restore soil life in degraded soils and to remediate polluted sites. In this study, we identified soil microorganisms potentially suitable to colonize fire-affected areas and tolerate high concentrations of bioavailable and toxic Cr, and which therefore could be useful for the above-mentioned purposes. Fire events in agricultural soils can modify not only soil properties but also the structure of soil microbial communities, especially in soils containing high concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). The recolonization of burned soils can in fact favor the proliferation of certain microorganisms, more adaptable to post-fire soil conditions and higher PTE availability, over others. In this study, we simulated with laboratory experiments the microbial recolonization of an agricultural soil containing high Cr concentrations after heating at 500 degrees C for 30 min, to mimic the burning of crop residues. Changes in soil properties and Cr speciation were assessed, as well as soil microbial structure by means of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Both altered soil conditions and increased Cr availability, especially Cr(VI), appeared to be responsible for the reduction in species diversity in heated soils and the proliferation of Firmicutes. Indeed, already after 3 days from the heat treatment, Firmicutes increased from 14% to 60% relative abundance. In particular, Paenibacillus was the most abundant genus identified after the simulation, with an average relative abundance of 40%. These bacteria are known to be good fire-responders and Cr-tolerant. These results could be useful to identify bacterial strains to be used as bioindicators of altered environments and for the recovery of fire-impacted polluted sites.

AB  - Soil moisture plays a vital role in terrestrial water cycles, which requires the understanding of the spatial characteristics of soil moisture patterns and their influencing factors across different scales; however, inconsistent findings have been reported in the past with regards to the relative importance of meteorological (e.g., precipitation and evapotranspiration) and local (e.g., soil texture) factors in controlling soil moisture spatial variability at mesoscales. To further elucidate this issue, long-term soil moisture data from East and Northwest China were examined in this study, using two statistical methods of temporal stability analysis (TSA) and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The TSA results showed that the spatial distributions of mean relative difference (MRD; an indicator of the relative wetness condition at a location as compared to the areal average wetness condition) of soil moisture had statistically significant correlations with mean annual precipitation ((P) over bar) and soil texture in both study regions; however, the spatial correlation between MRD and (P) over bar was much stronger in the Northwest region, suggesting that precipitation played a more important role in determining the spatial distribution of soil moisture in Northwest China. Moreover, the EOF analysis revealed that the primary soil moisture spatial structure was mostly related with soil texture in the East region while with (P) over bar in the Northwest region, which was also consistent with the TSA results. The stronger impact of precipitation on the soil moisture spatial distribution in the Northwest region could be largely attributed to the greater spatial variability in (P) over bar that varied by similar to 4.6 times from 171.2 to 791.0 mm/year across the region. By comparison, in the East region characterized by lower spatial variability in (P) over bar that varied by similar to 2.6 times from 484.2 to 1236.0 mm/year, soil texture exerted a stronger impact on the primary soil moisture spatial structure. Therefore, the observational evidence from this study demonstrated that the relative importance of meteorological and local factors in controlling mesoscale soil moisture spatial variability might vary considerably across regions, primarily depending on the spatial variability in those influencing factors across the region under consideration.

AB  - Ibuprofen (IB) is a high environmental risk drug and one of the most frequently prescribed in human medicine. Recently, IB has been detected in Gran Canaria in reclaimed water for irrigation and in groundwater. Adsorption was studied in four volcanic soils from three islands of the Canarian Archipelago. Once the biodegradation process has been excluded from the experimental conditions, a batch method was applied using initial concentrations of 1-5-10-20-50-100-200 mgL(-1) and two soil/water ratios (w/V): 1:5 (OECD, 2000) and 1:1. Non-linear and linearized Langmuir and Freundlich equations were well fitted. The wide IB range tested in our batch studies allowed us to measure experimental adsorption values close to the maximum adsorption capacity (S-max) as estimated by Langmuir, making it possible thereby to validate the use of the Langmuir equation when there is a burst of contamination at high concentration. The distribution coefficient (K-d), S-max and Retardation Factor (R-F) varied from 0.04 to 0.5 kgL(-1), 4-200 mgkg(-1) and 1.2-1.9, respectively. The lowest S-max and K-d values were found for the 1:1 S/W ratio whereas most batch studies employ 1:5 S/W ratios, thus obtaining higher adsorption parameters than when considering field conditions (1:1). Despite the high anion retention of andic soils, similar K-d and R-F to those reported for other soils were obtained in 1:5, while high S-max was found. Our results demonstrate that IB adsorption in volcanic areas responds not only to the soil properties commonly cited in adsorption studies, but also depends on andic properties, sorbent concentration and Dissolved Organic Carbon, the higher values of which are related to the lower K-d and S-max. The low R-F and low detection frequency of the IB in groundwater suggests that a) reclaimed water irrigation is not the main source of IB, and b) the existence of some uncontrolled water disposal points in the zone.

AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated the relationship between magnetic mineralogy in soil and paleosol sequences and climatic and environmental variations as well as pollution effects affecting them. In order to analyze this relationship, we carried out a study of magnetic properties in five soils and a paleosol, all developed on volcaniclastic deposits and located throughout an altitudinal range of 2250 to 3040 m above sea level and within a toposequence from Teotihuacan valley. These soil profiles consist of two Cambisols, a Calcisol, two Fluvisols, as well as a Vertisol. The magnetic mineralogy was characterized by rock magnetism techniques in order to determine the composition, concentration and domain size distribution of magnetic minerals, and was compared and validated with other non-magnetic parameters. Results reflect a clear difference in magnetic properties which are influenced by environmental conditions for each soil and their degree of pedogenesis. These magnetic properties vary between two extremes: 1) Cambisols, with higher concentrations of magnetic minerals of larger particle size; and 2) Fluvisols with low concentrations of magnetic minerals dominated by fine particle size. The analyzed Calcisol presents variations between these two extremes, for both aspects (concentration and grain sizes), while the Vertisol shows low concentration and coarse sizes. Unlike magnetic susceptibility enhancement reported in loess-paleosol sequences, which is caused by a rise of SD and SP ferri- and antiferrimagnetic minerals, the increase reflected in a Cambisol and Fluvisol from Teotihuacan is caused by the incorporation of new volcanic and fluvial material to the upper part of the soils. By contrast, the higher SP and SD concentrations are located in the lower horizons. These present a rather weak formation of pedogenic magnetic minerals, both ferrimagnetic and antiferrimagnetic. The low intrinsic magnetization of the latter and the relatively low proportion in which they occur make identification difficult because they are masked by ferrimagnetic phases. Our analysis highlights the features of soils developed on volcanic material as well as the potential that the analysis of magnetic properties holds in combination with other pedogenetic indicators for the reconstruction of past environmental conditions.

AB  - Clonal plants of three genotypes of Lotus corniculatus (cv Lee) were grown in eight controlled environments under combinations of two temperature regimes, two CO2 concentrations and two watering regimes. Condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins), in-vitro digestibility, initial rates of gas evolution las an indicator of the initial rates of fermentation of the substrate), volatile fatty acid evolution, and non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) levels were determined in leaves, stems and roots at full flowering. Under control conditions (average midsummer conditions in the United Kingdom) the total condensed tannin content of leaves varied six-fold between genotypes but condensed tannin contents in stems and roots were similar. Condensed tannin levels were significantly increased in leaves and stems of all three genotypes by doubling the CO2 concentration while raising the temperature towards the optimum for growth significantly reduced condensed tannin levels. Drought stress significantly reduced condensed tannin levels in leaves and, particularly, in roots. Nutritive value was inversely related to condensed tannin levels in leaves and a negative relationship was observed between condensed tannin concentrations of more than 25-30 g kg(-1) dry matter and the initial rates of gas evolution when subjected to in-vitro fermentation with rumen micro-organisms. In leaves, digestibility was significantly increased by drought and by increasing temperature but reduced by high CO2. In stems, digestibility was significantly increased by drought, but not significantly affected by increasing temperature, or by high CO2 alone. In roots, digestibility was significantly increased by drought, and decreased by increasing temperature or CO2. Increasing the growth temperature towards optimum growth reduced the content of NSC in all tissues with the greatest changes occurring in root tissue. Doubling the CO2 concentration increased NSC levels in leaves and stems with starch content more than doubled under high CO2 while, in roots, increased levels were only observed in combination with drought stress. There was a linear correlation between condensed tannin concentration and total NSC that was positive for leaves, neutral for stems and negative for roots. The relationship between carbohydrate levels and rates of gas production was negative for leaves and positive for stem and roots. (C) 1999 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Indicators of vegetation composition, vegetation structure, bare ground cover, and gap size in drylands potentially gives information about the condition of ecosystems, in part because they are strongly related to factors such as erosion, wildlife habitat characteristics, and the suitability for some land uses. Field data collection based on points does not produce spatially continuous information about surface indicators and cannot cover vast geographic areas. Remote sensing is possibly a labor- and time-saving method to estimate important biophysical indicators of vegetation and surface condition at both temporal and spatial scales impossible with field methods. Regression models based on machine learning algorithms, such as random forest (RF), can build relationships between field and remotely sensed data, while also providing error estimates. In this study, field data including over 15,000 points from the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) programs on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands throughout the Western U.S., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters, MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) surface reflectance products with ancillary data were used as predictor variables in a k-fold cross-validation approach to RF modeling. RF regression models were built to predict fourteen indicators of vegetation cover and height, as well as bare gap parameters. The RF model estimates exhibited good correlations with independent samples, with a low bias and a low RMSE. External cross-validation showed good agreement with out-of-bag (OOB) errors produced by RF and also allowed mapping prediction uncertainty. Predicted distribution maps of the surface indicators were produced by using these relationships across the arid and semiarid Western U.S. The bias and RMSE distribution maps show that the sample insufficiency and unevenly pattern of sample strongly impact the accuracy of the RF regression and prediction. The results from this study clearly show the utility of RF as a means to estimate multiple dryland surface indicators from remotely sensed data, and the reliability of the OOB errors in assessing the accuracy of the predictions.

AB  - Coal, shale and siltstone samples from the Serra Alta, Irati, Palermo and Rio Bonito formations (Early Permian: Kungarian, Artinskian and Sakmarian) were collected from borehole CBM001-ST-RS (core ST) over a depth range from 496.40 to 637.75 m. This core was evaluated by geochemical parameters to identify organic matter type, depositional environment and hydrocarbon generation potential. The effects of igneous intrusion on the maturity parameters from the shale and carbonaceous shale from Rio Bonito Formation between 605.45 and 610.90 m were also evaluated. Regardless the geological formation, the mineralogical composition along the ST core shows few variations in quartz, Na-plagioclase, illite, kaolinite, carbonates such as calcite and ankerite and some contributions of pyrite. Samples are characterized by a predominance of terrigenous organic matter and the evaluation of the depositional environment indicates two types: fluvial-deltaic environment, where the organic matter was subjected to suboxic or periodically dysoxic conditions, and marine environment related to source rocks deposited under anoxic conditions. All samples are at present time at a maturity near the peak of the oil window (except samples in contact or near igneous intrusions), and have poor to fair hydrocarbon generative potential. In the stratigraphic interval of the Rio Bonito Formation, specifically in samples close to diabase intrusions (coal seam ST-5 and shale ST-6), TOC, bitumen, and SARA composition showed significant variations that are probably caused by the contact with igneous intrusions. In this interval, saturated biomarkers did not represent values indicating an advanced maturity degree. They seem not having reached their equilibrium or endpoint values of maturity. This behavior is attributed to the development of rapid heating rates probably caused by high temperatures associated with the diabase intrusions. However, aromatic hydrocarbon ratios such as the methylphenanthrene index (MPI-1 and MPI-1((modified))) and methyldibenzothiophene ratio (MDR) did show maturity trends that agree with reported vitrinite reflectance determinations in the contact zones with igneous rocks. As a result, these parameters may be used to identify maturity levels in areas with igneous activity.

AB  - Agriculture under changing climate scenario is facing major challenges of water scarcity and resource imbalances. Crop water productivity (WP) may act as an indicator of crop responses to water limitation. Organic amendments such as biochar and manure application to soil are suggested for improving soil quality and reducing water requirements from agricultural sector. However, studies exploring the impact of biochar as sole or in combination with organic and/or chemical fertilizers on WP in dry tropical agro-ecosystems are limited. In this study, we observed the effect of rice-husk ash (RHA, biochar) along with farm-yard manure (FYM) and chemical fertilizers (CF) under varying water conditions on soil hydro-physical properties, yield and WP of wheat crop. Water-filled pore space (WFPS), grain and straw yield, irrigation and total water productivity varied significantly (at P < 0.001) at treatment level. Grain and straw yield were found higher under sole and combined CF applied treatments. Sole and combined RHA and FYM amendment improved water holding capacity (WHC) and WFPS, whereas a decrease in crop yield was observed as compared to the control. Irrigation and total water productivity were found higher under combined RHA + FYM and sole CF treatments with reduced water supply (except sole CF) as compared to control and sole RHA treatments with full water irrigation. Crop water productivity was found positively correlated with grain and straw yields, however, significant correlations were not observed with WHC and WFPS. Results indicate that increasing soil hydro-physical properties in silty-loam soil may hinder crop yield and WP under sole biochar applied soils. Overall, the implications of the study would help in devising agro-management practices based on combined application of RHA and FYM with reduced chemical fertilizer and water inputs to mitigate the impacts of climate change without compromising crop yield in the highly vulnerable dry tropical agro-ecosystem of India. Moreover, long-term studies are needed in these ecosystems to identify the appropriate agricultural package for mitigating the forthcoming water scarcity conditions.

AB  - Rock avalanche clusters can be relevant indicators of the evolution of specific regions. They can be used to define: the type and intensity of triggering events, their recurrence and potential probability of occurrence, the progressive damage of the rock mass, the mechanisms of transport and deposition, as well as the environmental conditions at the time of occurrence. This paper tackles these subjects by analyzing two main clusters of rock avalanches (each event between 0.6 and 30 Mm(3)), separated by few kilometers and located along the coastal scarp of Northern Chile, south of Iquique. It lies, hence, within a seismic area characterized by a long seismic gap that ended on April 1st, 2014 with a M-w 8.2 earthquake. The scar position, high along the coastal cliff, supports seismic triggering for these clusters. The deposits' relative positions are used to obtain the sequence of rock avalanching events for each cluster. The progressive decrease of volume in the sequence of rock avalanches forming each cluster fits well the theoretical models for successive slope failures. These sequences seem to agree with those derived by dating the deposits with ages spanning between 4 kyr and 60 kyr. An average uplift rate of 0.2 mm/yr in the last 40 kyr is estimated for the coastal plain giving a further constraint to the rock avalanche deposition considering the absence of reworking of the deposits. Volume estimates and datings allow the estimation of an erosion rate contribution of about 0.098-0.112 mm km(-2) yr(-1) which is well comparable to values presented in the literature for earthquake induced landslides. We have carried out numerical modeling in order to analyze the mobility of the rock avalanches and examine the environmental conditions that controlled the runout In doing so, we have considered the sequence of individual rock avalanches within the specific clusters, thus including in the models the confining effect caused by the presence of previous deposits. Bingham rheology was the most successful at explaining both the distance and the geometry of the observed events. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives It remains unclear whether depressive and anxiety disorders are associated with hyporeactivity or hyperreactivity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and whether deviant reactivity occurs in all types of stressors. This study compared ANS reactivity in people with current or remitted depression/anxiety with reactivity in healthy controls during two stress conditions.
   Methods From the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, data of 804 individuals with current depression/anxiety, 913 individuals with remitted depression/anxiety, and 466 healthy controls (mean age = 44.1 years; 66.4% female) were available. Two conditions were used to evoke stress: a) an n-back task, a cognitively challenging stressor, and 2) a psychiatric interview, evoking personal-emotional stress related to the occurrence of symptoms of depression/anxiety. Indicators of ANS activity were heart rate (HR), root mean square of differences between successive interbeat intervals (RMSSD), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and preejection period.
   Results As compared with controls, participants with psychopathology had significant hyporeactivity of HR (controls = 4.1 4.2 beats/min; remitted = 3.5 +/- 3.5 beats/min; current psychopathology = 3.1 +/- 3.4 beats/min), RMSSD (controls = -6.2 +/- 14.5 milliseconds; remitted = -5.4 +/- 17.8 milliseconds; current psychopathology = -3.5 +/- 15.4 milliseconds), and RSA (controls = -9.3 +/- 17.0 milliseconds; remitted = -7.4 +/- 16.5 milliseconds; current psychopathology = -6.9 +/- 15.0 milliseconds) during the n-back task. In contrast, during the psychiatric interview, they showed significant hyperreactivity of HR (controls = 2.7 +/- 3.4 beats/min; remitted = 3.5 +/- 3.4 beats/min; current psychopathology = 4.0 +/- 3.3 beats/min), RMSSD (controls = -3.4 +/- 12.2 milliseconds; remitted = -4.1 +/- 12.1 milliseconds; current psychopathology = -5.6 +/- 11.8 milliseconds), and RSA (controls = -3.8 +/- 8.1 milliseconds; remitted = -4.3 +/- 7.9 milliseconds; current psychopathology = -5.0 +/- 7.9 milliseconds). The lack of group differences in preejection period reactivity suggests that the found effects were driven by altered cardiac vagal reactivity in depression/anxiety.
   Conclusions The direction of altered ANS reactivity in depressed/anxious patients is dependent on the type of stressor, and only the more ecologically valid stressors may evoke hyperreactivity in these patients.

AB  - The elevational limit of trees (henceforth, the tree line') is widely considered to be a sensitive indicator of environmental change. Here, we document the 20th century tree line advance and increase in the tree population at the tree line ecotone, along a Pinus sylvestris-dominated slope in north-eastern Finland, in conditions where growth and recruitment have generally been linked to temperature variation. Using tree recruitment ages (growth to 1.3m height) along an elevational transect, we compared recruitment to variation in environmental conditions associated with tree line dynamics, seed and cone crops, and reindeer densities. We further investigated the relationships among temperature and tree-level growth variables. Results show the existence of a former tree line at approximately 400m a.s.l. and an advance of trees that began in the 1920s and reached the top of the fell (at 470m a.s.l.) in the 1980s. During this time, the population density of P.sylvestris increased from 4 to 468 trees within the 5.6ha study plot. Needle and shoot lengths were positively related to air temperature but recruitment was not. Average rate of P.sylvestris advance over the 20th century was consistent with earlier studies, but the temporal patterns of both upslope advance and population density increase were unexpected: both were characterized by a strongly stepwise pattern, culminating in a rapid advance and density increase in the 1970-1980s, and returning to low levels in the 1990s. Despite a positive relationship between growth and temperature variables at the tree level, climatic variables, or seed and cone crops were inconsistent with recruitment patterns. For most part of the 20th century, the increase corresponded to the gradual atmospheric CO2 increase, but of the variables screened only the changes in reindeer densities coincided with the stepwise pattern.Synthesis. Our results confirmed the connection between tree-level processes and temperature variability as expected from earlier studies. However, recruitment was not correlated with any of the environmental variables. Our findings point towards complex tree line dynamics, in which biotic agents may play a major role in mediating tree line response to environmental change.

AB  - Monthly sampling in northwestern Mediterranean coastal waters was undertaken to better understand the relationship between zooplankton biomass and the cycling of the natural radionuclide Po-210/Pb-210 pair during a one-year period (October 1995 November 1996). In conjunction with mesozooplankton collections and Po-210/Pb-210 measurements in seawater, zooplankton and their fecal pellets, the biochemical composition of particulate organic matter (POM) was also examined at three depths (0, 20 and 50 m) as an indicator of trophic conditions. During May 1996, a strong zooplankton "bloom" was observed which was preceded by a prolonged increase in POM (protein + carbohydrates + lipids) starting at the end of March, and further demonstrated by a concomitant increase in the concentration of smaller particles, two features that are typical of mesotrophic waters. Simultaneous measurements of Po-210 in sea water and zooplankton showed an inverse trend between these two parameters during the sampling period, with the two lowest Po-210 concentrations in the dissolved phase of seawater coincident with the highest radionuclide concentrations in the zooplankton; however, this apparent relationship was not statistically significant over the entire year. Freshly excreted mesozooplankton and salp fecal pellets, which have been strongly implicated in the removal and downward transport of these radionuclides from the upper water column, contained Po-210 and Pb-210 levels ranging from 175 to 878 and 7.5 -486 Bq kg(-1) dry weight, respectively. Salp pellets contained 5 and 10 times more Po-210 and Pb-210 than in fecal pellets produced by mixed zooplankton, a finding most likely related to their different feeding strategies. During the zooplankton biomass peak observed in May, the Po-210 concentration in zooplankton was at a minimum; however, in contrast to what has been reported to occur in some open sea oligotrophic waters, over the year no statistically significant inverse relationship was found between zooplankton biomass and Po-210 concentration in zooplankton. This observation may have resulted from the general lack of very low biomass concentrations (<1 mg m(-3)) measured in these coastal waters, biomass levels which commonly occur in open ocean oligotrophic regions.

AB  - Degradation of oxalic acid (OA) by the mycoparasitic fungus Coniothyrium minitans (Cm), and the effects of OA degradation on production and activity of beta-1,3-glucanase of Cm were investigated. Results showed that OA was degraded by 86-92% by Cm grown at 20 degrees C for 15 days in modified potato dextrose broth (mPDB) containing OA at 0.8-28 mM. Ambient pH values of these cultures were increased from 3.0-4.8 to 8.3-8.6 due to the degradation of OA and/or accumulation of ammonia by Cm. In dual cultures of Cm and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Ss) on potato dextrose agar amended with 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue (a pH indicator), spread of Cm onto colonies of Ss was correlated with the elevation of the ambient pH from 2.9 to 6.6, implying that OA degradation by Cm may occur during the interaction between the two fungi. Increase of the ambient pH was also observed on flower petals of oilseed rape inoculated with Cm (5.4 x 10(4) conidia/petal) and Ss (5.4 x 10(3) ascospores/petal) when they were incubated on water agar amended with 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue for 6 days, compared to those inoculated with Ss alone. Meanwhile, leaf blight incidence of oilseed rape caused by flower petals inoculated with Cm (1.5 x 10(3-5) conidia/petal) and Ss (4.2 x 10(3) ascospores/petal) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that caused by flower petals inoculated with Ss alone. Results also showed that OA degradation was correlated with the enhanced production of beta-1,3-glucanase by Cm and the stimulated activity of this enzyme. In cultures of Cm grown in mPDB amended with OA (16 mM) for 9, 12 and 15 days, OA was degraded by 90%, 91% and 94%, respectively, and the yield of beta-1,3-glucanase produced by Cm was increased by 61%, 23% and 52%, respectively, compared to that in Cut cultures grown in mPDB alone. Results in buffered PDB media showed that the yield of beta-1,3-glucanase produced by Cm was positively correlated (R = 0.9439, P < 0.01) with the ambient pH ranging from 3 to 8, implying that the increase in ambient pH caused by OA degradation may be responsible for the enhanced production of beta-1,3-glucanase by Cm in OA-containing media. Inhibition by OA of the activity of beta-1,3-glucanase produced by Cm was observed and the degree of inhibition was positively correlated to the concentration of OA ranging from 4 to 32 mM, which inversely conditioned the ambient pHs to a range from 1.5 to 3.5. In contrast, the activity of beta-1,3-glucanase produced by Cm was not affected by sodium oxalate ranging from 2 to 32 mM, which conditioned the ambient pH to a range from 5.9 to 6.1. The optimum ambient pH for the enzymatic reaction of beta- 1,3-glucanase of Cm ranged from 4.0 to 6.0. This study suggests that degradation of OA by Cm can nullify the pH effect conditioned by OA and may improve mycoparasitism of Cm on Ss by stimulating production of beta-1,3-glucanase by Cm and/or the activity of this enzyme. Degradation of OA by Cm might also be a mechanism by which Cm can protect plants from infection by Ss. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF SPRING BARLEY SPACING ON UNDERSEEDED CLOVER CROPS
T2  - ROSTLINNA VYROBA

AB  - The results obtained of average dry matter yields in double classification in the first cut are presented in Tab. I. The maximum yield was obtained in the control with the sowing rate of lucerne without cover crop (2.43 t per 1 ha), maximum in barley J 125 with lucerne undersown (7.36 t per 1 ha). The yield of stubble cut (Tab. II) was minimum in J 125 with lucerne undersown (1.87 t per ha), maximum was in the control with clover undersown without cover crop (4.21 t per ha).
   In the second growing year, dry matter yields (Tab. IV) on an average for variants were 10.63 to 11.4 t per 1 ha. In statistical investigation of total average yields through variance analysis (at 95 % confidence Tabs I to IV contain an interval of reliability) in the first growing season and in the first stubble cut, no statistical significant difference was found out among variants J 125, J 250 and J 375. There was statistical difference among treatments K and J 125, J 250, J 375 in both cuts. Among undersown clover crops, no significant difference has been found out, whereas a significant difference was found in the stubble cut. Clover exhibited higher yield than that in the stubble cut by 1.291 per 1 ha on an average. This is conditioned by biological character of clover under favourable moisture conditions. In the second growing year, no significant differences were found neither among variants, nor among undersown clover crops.
   There is a tendency of increasing the dry matter yield among variants J 125, J 250 and J 375 as presented in Tab. II, among variants J 125 and J 375 this is on the margin of significance. This difference maybe ascribed to ending effect of the cover crop (S t r a f e l d a, F o g l, 1989).
   To explain the effect of the first cut, the methodology was supplemented with studying thc dynamics of clover crop growing and the number of clover plants. Harvest data solely do not provide complete base of finding the difference in row spacing of the cover crop.
   Clover crop dry matter weight in the dynamic development in absolute expression is presented in Tab. V. The data in the fourth date of investigation shows that clover crop dry matter before the first cut (cover crop) amounted to 10.6 % in J 125, 17.3 % in J 250, 20.2 % in J 375 of the control and lucerne. The clover dry matter weight in the same date was 9.4 % in J 125, 16.2 % in J 25O, 23.2 % in J 375 of the control.
   The dynamics in relative expression in percentage of the control in the fourth date in lucerne is illustrated in Fig. 2. In lucerne the difference are apparent practically from the beginning of the growing season, in clover as less sensitive species, more significant differences can be seen not earlier than from the second date of studying.
   There is a certain trend also in the number of plants (Tab. VI). In the relation to the conditioned means, the variant with extended row spacing of the cover crop increases the numbers of plants in lucerne even by 4.7 %, in clover even by 23 %.
   In spite of the fact that resulting harvest indicators (dry matter yields) do not manifest statistically significant differences between variants of different row spacing of the cover crop, extended row spacing is of positive effect in the meaning og higher certainly of establishment to undersown lucerne and clover, as well. In insignificant differences in the cover crop dry matter yield, the undersown plants are better rooted, more resistant to unfavourable effects, with prerequisitions of high productivity.

AB  - We report here for the first time the occurrence of Mg-Al granulites within the khondalite belt of the North China Craton and provide robust evidence for extreme crustal metamorphism at ultrahigh-ternperature (UHT) conditions in this region. The UHT indicator assemblages in these rocks include equilibrium sapphirine +quartz, high alumina orthopyroxene +sillimanite +quartz and high temperature perthites. The surrounding khondalites also carry spinel+ quartz equilibrium assemblage. The sapphirines occurring in various micro structural associations are markedly magnesian (X-Mg-0.69-0.77) with a cornposition varying from 7:9:3 to 2:2:1 end members. Spinel is a solid solution of Mg-spinel and hercynite (X-Mg-0.41-0.54) with ZnO content varying from 0.48 to 1.79 wt.%. Garnet shows a compositional range between pyrope and almandine (X-Mg-0.39-0.48) with minor grossular (2.6-3.8 mol%) and spessartine (0.5-1.8 mol%). The orthopyroxenes display marked compositional variations in terms of Al2O3 content, with the core of the medium-grained orthopyroxene adjacent to sillimanite in the matrix showing the highest Al2O3 content (8.4 wt.%). The history of prograde to peak metamorphism of these rocks is indicated by inclusions of sapphirine, spinel, quartz and sillimanite within garnet. Sapphirine formed during the peak stage through the reaction: Spl +Qtz+ Sil -> Spr. Occurrence of sapphirine and quartz inclusions trapped in sillimanite suggests the reaction: Spr+Qtz+Grt -> Opx+Sil. A series of retrograde reactions are observed in these rocks as corona and symplectite textures around early coarse-grained minerals such as: Opx + Sil + Qtz -> Crd, Grt + Sil + Qtz -> Crd, Grt + Qtz -> Crd + Opx, Grt+O-2 -> Crd+Qtz+Fe2O3 in Mag or Ilm, and finally Opx+Kfs+H2O -> Bt+Qtz. Whereas the stability of sapphirine +quartz and orthopyroxene + sillimanite+ quartz in the matrix assemblage suggests T > 1000 degrees C and P > 10 kbar peak metamorphism, conventional geothermobarometric estimates confirm the ultrahigh-temperature nature and also trace the retrograde conditions (930-970 degrees C at P > 10 kbar Al in Opx; 900-1000 degrees C - perthite; 930-990 degrees C - Grt-Opx; and 910-940 degrees C - sapphirine-spinel).
   Electron microprobe dating of monazites in textural association with the UHT assemblages yield a sharply defined isochron age of 1917 +/- 48 Ma, which correlates with the 1927 +/- 11 Ma obtained in a previous study from monazites in the surrounding khondalites carrying spinel+quartz assemblage. An evaluation of the assemblages and textures using appropriate petrogenetic grids indicate that following peak ultrahigh temperature conditions, the rocks underwent initial isobaric cooling and subsequent isothermal decompression, and we interpret these trajectories to be part of an overall anti-clockwise P-T evolution. The study area, located within the northern margin of the North China Craton, defines a collisional orogenic belt where continental collision and deep subduction was possibly followed by extensional collapse of the orogen. Evidence for the extensional phase is provided by the several mafic magmatic intrusives of Paleoproterozoic age occurring in the region which suggest a possible link between the thermal anomaly associated with extreme crustal metamorphism in this region with mantle-derived magmas. The UHT metamorphism in North China Craton coincided with the assembly of the Paleoproterozoic supercontinent Columbia. (c) 2006 International Association for Gondwana Research.

AB  - Over a period of 205 years, there have been carried out dozens of censuses of nests and nesting bird individuals, summerings and non-nesting bird individuals, winterings and wintering bird individuals, the determinations of migration routes in the Caspian region and across the Caspian Sea, in Central and Southern Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Russia. Until the early XXI century, the main flamingo nesting sites were located in the Caspian region and along the Caspian Sea within the Russian Empire / USSR / Commonwealth of Independent States. It was found that such a geographical distribution of flamingo nesting sites was established until 1930 by the relative stability of the global climate conditions in northern Eurasia that have caused the stand of water level in the Caspian Sea.
   During this period, in the northern part of the Asian population the monitoring of the flamingo had the form of collecting mainly qualitative information. Amongst these are the determination of the locations of breeding sites, summerings and winterings; the bird's abundance was characterised mainly using the epithets. The next period (from 1931 to 1977) was caused by the development of anthropogenic influences and by changes of global climatic conditions in northern Eurasia, which have caused a decrease in the water level in the Caspian Sea. Environmental effects of the hydrological regime changes were the most significant in the shallow northeastern part of the Caspian Sea. The breeding sites and the summerings (that were located there) had changed dislocation. Sometimes such a dislocation was observed over a wide area, up to the complete loss of breeding sites and summerings. During this period, the observations had the character of quantative information collecting and clarification of qualitative data: determination of new locations of breeding sites, duration of their existence, location of summerings and winterings, sizes of flocks and groupings, and disappearance reasons of the flamingo from former habitats. The persistent reduction of the Caspian Sea area, as well as the drying up of several sea gulfs, had caused the emergence of permanent breeding colonies on the lakes of Central Kazakhstan (Lake Shalkartenize, Lake Tengiz). The decrease in the level of continental waterbodies in Central Kazakhstan had caused an increase of their nesting and feeding properties: formed shoals became the sites of feeding and breeding of flamingos. Significant annual and long-term fluctuations of the water level in the lakes had become the reason of the periodic disappearance of flamingo colonies on certain lakes and their emergence of those on other lakes. During 1978-2015 the monitoring of flamingos in the northern part of the range of the Asian population were aimed at obtaining qualitative and quantitative indicators of nesting sites, summerings and winterings in conditions of increasing of the Caspian Sea level, the fluctuations of the water content in Central Kazakhstan, the refinement of migration dates, the spring and autumn migration routes.
   The placement of the major part of flamingos on the water bodies of Central Kazakhstan by the end of the XX century has contributed to the final formation of the flight route, which had connected these habitats with areas previously populated along the Caspian Sea. In the early XXI century the permanent reproductive centre in the northern part of the Asian flamingo population remained the breeding colony on Lake Tengiz. Available data have formed the necessary information base for further quantitative and qualitative assessment of the northern part of the Asian population over three time periods caused by the state of the Caspian Sea, waterbodies of the Caspian region and Central Kazakhstan, each of which had specific characteristics that determine the placement of nesting colonies, summerings, winterings, routes of seasonal and inter-seasonal migrations in the northern part of the range of flamingos and beyond.

AB  - The influence of the pH of the working medium on the processes of electrification of the wet steam flow and the indicators of the reliability and efficiency of the turbine plant are considered. The assessment of the formation of charges in the flow, depending on the water-chemical regime (WCR), was carried out on a laboratory bench created for this purpose and directly on the turbine. The laboratory bench was equipped with an air-droplet flow supply system, which, passing through a special device, electrified, and the current was recorded at the exit depending on the pH of the medium. Full-scale tests were carried out on an 800 MW turbine unit at the Navajo TPP (Arizona, United States). On the basis of these studies, it was found that the intensity of the formation of charges and their polarity depend on pH during the electrification of wet steam in a turbine. In an alkaline medium, the sign of the charges at certain boundary pH changes from negative to positive. The study of the influence of the pH of the feed water on the efficiency of the steam expansion process in the flow path of the turbine was carried out on a thermodynamic bench using a supersonic nozzle and in natural conditions on a turbine with a capacity of 800 MW. It was found that significant changes in both the thermodynamic process in the supersonic nozzle at the test bench and the turbine power do not occur at pH 7.0-9.6. A well-reasoned explanation and justification of these experimental results is presented. The influence of an aggressive charged working medium on the surface strength of rotor blades is considered, and studies in this direction were based on the fact that the degradation of the blade surfaces, especially the last stage of the turbine, largely depends on the intensity of the formation of charges and their polarity. The indicators of the working environment that most significantly (by 1.5-2.0 times) intensify electrocorrosive processes are determined. It is proposed, due to the rational choice of pH in the preparation of feed water, to control the process of formation of flow charges and control it, which will make it possible to increase the wear resistance of the surfaces of the blades and extend their service life.

AB  - Although coppice forests represent a significant part of the European forest area, especially across southern Countries, they received little attention within the Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) processes and scenarios, whose guidelines have been mainly designed to high forests and national scale. In order to obtain "tailored" information on the degree of sustainability of coppices on the scale of the stand, we evaluated (i) whether the main coppice management options result in different responses of the SFM indicators, and (ii) the degree to which the considered SFM indicators were appropriate in their application at stand level. The study considered three different management options (Traditional Coppice TC, coppice under Natural Evolution NE, and coppice under Conversion to high forest by means of periodical thinning CO). In each of the 43 plots considered in the study, which covered three different European Forest Types, we applied a set of eighteen "consolidated" SFM indicators, covering all the six SFM Criteria (FOREST EUROPE, 2020) and, additionally, tested other sixteen novel indicators shaped for agamic forests and/or applicable at stand level. Results confirmed that several consolidated indicators related to resources status (Growing stock and Carbon stock), health (Defoliation and Forest damage), and socio-economic functions (Net revenue, Energy and Accessibility) were highly appropriate for evaluating the sustainability of coppice at stand level. In addition, some novel indicators related to resources status (Total above ground tree biomass), health (Stand growth) and protective functions (Overstorey cover and Understorey cover) proved to be highly appropriate and able to support the information obtained by the consolidated ones. As a consequence, a subset of consolidated SFM indicators, complemented with the most appropriate novel ones, may represent a valid option to support the evaluation of coppice sustainability at stand level. An integrated analysis of the SFM indicators showed that NE and CO display significant higher environmental performances as compared with TC. In addition, CO has positive effects also on socio-economic issues, while TC -which is an important cultural heritage and a silvicultural option that may help to keep local communities engaged in forestry - combines high wood harvesting rates with dense understory cover. Overall, each of the three management options showed specific sustainability values; as a consequence, their coexistence at a local scale and in accordance with the specific environmental conditions and the social-economic context, is greatly recommended since it may fulfill a wider array of sustainability issues.

AB  - Under the hypothesis that organically managed cacao agroforestry systems report a lower global warming potential (GWP) and reduce other environmental pressure indicators compared with conventionally managed systems and monocultures, this work discusses how global transportation can cut back the ecological advantage of the production phase. For this purpose, the life cycle assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of dark chocolate manufactured with Ecuadorian cacao has been performed (cradle-to-retailer approach), including the indirect impacts of transportation and estimating the equilibrium distances beyond which organic chocolate would have a higher impact than chocolate manufactured from cacao grown in monocultures and/or conventionally managed systems. To articulate the discussion, the carbon footprint (CF) of cacao/chocolate was analyzed together with 10 additional LCA-related impact categories. Three management systems-conventional monoculture (CM) and agroforestry (CA), and organic agroforestry (OA)-and three different supply chain scenarios with different weights in the transportation phase were studied. Expanding on the concept of "food miles", the equivalent kilometers of the impact of emissions (km-eq) (or cumulated energy demand, eutrophication, etc.) were defined as the variable distance that a certain means of transportation can travel in relation to a fixed level of GHG emissions (or MJ, kg PO4-eq, etc.). The CF of the life cycle of cacao/chocolate was estimated at between 2.04 and 4.66 kg CO2-eq kg(-1). The relative weight of transportation in relation to the total GHG emissions ranged between 8.9% and 51.1%, with cacao/chocolate traveling between 1380 and 9155 km-eq. The CF of chocolate made from cacao grown in OA systems was 22.7%-34.2% and 6.3%-10.7% lower than the CF of chocolate produced from cacao grown in CM and CA and manufactured and transported under the same conditions. The equilibrium distances between managements were estimated at 1213 and 5275 km-eq. Beyond those equivalent kilometers, organic chocolate would have a larger CF than chocolate manufactured from cacao grown, respectively, in CA and CM systems. Our results indicate that transportation would cancel out this and most other comparative ecological advantages of producing organic cacao analyzed in this work. Directly exporting chocolate from cacao-producing countries and relocating chocolate manufacture would help reduce GHG emissions and other environmental impacts of the supply chain.

AB  - The interest in tree phenology monitoring is increasing because this trait is a robust indicator of the impacts of climate change on natural and managed ecosystems. Different approaches to monitor phenology at different spatial scales, from in situ monitoring to remote sensing, are used to investigate spring and/or autumn phenological changes. In Mediterranean area, most of phenological changes occur during cloudy periods (spring and autumn), leading to a loss of information also for very high temporal resolution satellites. Instead, cloud-uninfluenced sensors, such as radar sensors, can allow to bypass this problem and produce a temporally continuous coverage.
   In this paper, we analyzed the spring phenology of two European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) populations, located at different latitudes in Mediterranean area. Weekly in situ monitoring of leaf-out has been correlated with data collected by Synthetic Aperture Radar. Spring phenological phases were monitored in situ following a modified BBCH-code with a 5-scores scale (from 1 buds closed and covered by scales, to 5 leaf completely unfolded). The score 3 (young leaves starting to emerge from the bud) was considered the bud break. Different site conditions based on aspect (northern and southern) and altitudinal gradient (high and low altitude) have been considered. The aim was to test and implement a new methodology able to decrease the frequency of the field sampling, using remote data, to extend more detailed information on geographical scale, and to reconstruct past phenology.
   Results showed a statistically significant different length of the vegetative spring period, spanning from dormant buds, up to leaves completely unfolded, between sites. Through Synthetic Aperture Radar estimation, this study demonstrates that leaf-out can be monitored with an extreme accuracy. The phenophase score 4 and 5 estimation showed the best performance (RMSE < of 4 days), phenophases score 2 and 3 showed promising performances (4 days < RMSE < 5 days), while phenophases score 1 seems to be not easily detectable, although it can be extrapolated with an RMSE < 6 days.
   This radar approach fixes the cloud problem typical of multispectral approach and very frequent in phenophase change periods in Mediterranean climate. This study promotes the proposed remote sensing approach as a very useful tool to monitor growing season starting in remote areas, helping to reduce in situ observations and allowing past phenology reconstruction.

AB  - Effective management of a dairy farm has to focus on individual animal apart from group or herd management since 'smallest production unit in the dairy is the individual animal'. In this context, precision dairy farming (PDF) aims to manage the basic production unit in order to exploit its maximal production capacity. PDF is the use of information and technology based farm management system to measure physiological, behavioural and production indicators of individual animals to improve management strategies, profitability and farm performance. PDF applications are finding their way on dairy farms, although there seem to be differences in the uptake of PDF applications between dairy systems. The authors have attempted to identify different PDF tools utilized across the globe and have highlighted the status of adoption in Indian scenario by highlighting about few farms/organizations involved in its utilization and uptake over the years. In this direction, the authors have also focused on several benefits and challenges faced by developing countries including India since the benefits are often not immediately apparent and they require more management expertise along with an investment of time and money to realize. In addition, the adoption rate depends on various factors like farmer education, farm size, perceptions of risk, ownership of a non-farm business etc. Addressing these issues is very essential for the uptake of technologies and hence, an effort has been made to propose strategies for adoption and operationalization of PDF in India and other developing countries where the similar scenario exists. The study also highlights that PDF in many developing countries including India is in its infancy, but there are tremendous opportunities for improvements in individual animal and herd management in dairy farms. The progressive farmers or the farmers' groups. with guidance from the public and private sectors, and professional associations, can adopt it on a limited scale as the technology shows potential for raising yields and economic returns on fields with significant variability, and for minimizing environmental degradation. Additional research needs to be undertaken to examine the adoption process for not only successful adoption of technology, but also to solve the issues associated with the technology adoption. Further, right extension approaches and advisory services for the farmers interested in PDF needs to be undertaken for its effective application under different socio-economic and ecological conditions.

AB  - The European Union Habitats Directive (HD) obliges member states to assess the conservation status of marine habitat types but no explicit methodologies for assessing the quality of habitats have been stated in the directive or accompanying documents. In this study, a system was developed to assess the structure and functioning of three important marine habitat types in the Estonian sea area: sandbanks (HD code 1110), mudflats (1140), and reefs (1170). The assessment system includes a list of ecological criteria and favourable reference values together with procedural rules and field sampling locations. The habitat types listed in the HD are broadly defined and may encompass different communities depending upon distinct environmental gradients. By considering these environmental gradients the habitat types reefs and sandbanks were zoned and the assessment criteria and corresponding favourable reference values were defined separately for each zone. A set of several metrics like benthos indices, community variables, presence of sensitive or typical species, proportions of functional or taxonomic groups were tested as potential criteria for determining habitat quality. The most appropriate criteria were selected for incorporation into the assessment system based on ecological eligibility, suitability to local conditions, occurrence rates of benthic species, responses to disturbances, statistical properties of distribution of measured values, and practical considerations. Extensive benthos database (records from the whole Estonian sea area, 1995-2014) was used to calculate values of criteria to support the selection of criteria and to derive reference values. In order to fully take into account their crucial role in maintaining the structure and functioning of habitats, the criteria on habitat-forming species were assigned higher hierarchical order in the assessment scheme compared to other criteria. Special field works were carried out to assess the status of the three habitat types in 2015. The quality of all three monitored habitats was assessed to be in a favourable status. Additionally, the distributions of the three habitat types were mapped. To date, this is the first study in the Baltic Sea region that formulates HD compliant explicit criteria, reference values, and assessment procedures for several marine habitat types. The main challenges of the study were to derive assessment criteria and favourable reference values that are ecologically relevant and practically feasible. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial oxidation of methane (CH4) plays a central role in carbon cycling in Arctic lakes, reducing potential CH4 emissions associated with warming. Isotopic signatures of CH4 (delta C-13 and delta H-2) are indicators of microbial oxidation, wherein the process strongly enriches C-13 and H-2 in residual CH4. We present delta C-13 and delta H-2 measurements obtained from sampling the water column and sediment for dissolved CH4 from three, small Arctic lakes in western Greenland under both open-water and ice-covered conditions from 2013 to 2014. Despite substantial variations in aquatic chemistry among the lakes, delta C-13 and delta H-2 of CH4 suggested that CH4 was produced predominantly by acetoclastic methanogenesis in the littoral sediments and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the profundal sediments in all of the lakes. Surprisingly large variations for both delta C-13 and delta H-2 of CH4 were observed, with delta C-13 extending from -72 parts per thousand to + 7.4 parts per thousand and delta H-2 from -390 parts per thousand to +250 parts per thousand. The CH4 isotopic values reported here were significantly more enriched (p < 0.0001) in both C-13 and H-2 than values reported from other Arctic freshwater environments. As is characteristic of methanotrophy, the enrichment in C-13 and H-2 was associated with low CH4 concentrations. We suggest that the CH4 most enriched in C-13 and H-2 may reflect unusually efficient methanotrophic communities in Arctic ice-margin lakes. This study provides the first measurement of delta H-2 for CH4 in an Arctic freshwater environment at concentrations <10 mu M. The extreme enrichment of C-13 and H-2 of CH4 from Arctic methanotrophy has significant implications for interpreting sources and sinks of CH4. Without knowledge of local geology, stable isotope values of CH4 higher than -30 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and -150 parts per thousand for delta H-2 could be misinterpreted as thermogenic, geothermal, or abiogenic origins. Given crystalline bedrock and the strong positive correlation between delta C-13 and delta H-2 throughout the water columns in three Arctic lakes confirms that CH4 heavily enriched in C-13 and H-2 is the result of methanotrophy.

AB  - Deer have been overabundant throughout much of Pennsylvania since at least the 1940's. We compared plant communities in the Allegheny National Forest (ANF) on boulder tops and the forest floor to test the hypothesis that large boulders serve as refugia for plants threatened by deer herbivory. Five of the ten most common woody species (hemlock, Tsuga canadensis L., mountain maple, Acer spicatum Lam., red maple, A. rubrum L., striped maple, A. pensylvanicum L., and yellow birch, Betula alleghaniensis Britton) occurred at much higher densities on boulders than in randomly selected areas of the same size adjacent to these boulders on the soil surface. We never encountered any individuals of hemlock, mountain maple, or red maple on the forest floor. Total woody species density (excluding root suckers of beech, Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) was nearly three times higher on the boulders. Woody species richness and evenness, as well as forb and shrub cover and richness, were also much greater on boulders. Our results strongly suggest that overbrowsing by deer can dramatically reduce tree regeneration and diversity as well as reduce forb and shrub abundance in the ANF. Furthermore, understory plant communities are now dominated by species that are known to be unpalatable or tolerant of deer browse, particularly beech, grasses, and ferns (Dryopteris carthusiana Vill. and Thelypteris noveboracensis L.). The primary alternative explanation is that conditions on the surface of boulders are superior for numerous woody and herbaceous species. Although we cannot rule this out, we consider this alternative improbable because of the poor nature of these habitats.
   Because deer are reducing the diversity and abundance of both woody and herbaceous species, we conclude that deer are damaging the very nature of these hardwood forests. Furthermore, our findings suggest that boulders could serve as an inexpensive bioassay of deer impact on vegetation whenever they are common and large enough. Boulders may also overcome the problem associated with the ghost of herbivory past, whereby plant species that would respond to the reduction of herbivores are absent because they have been driven to very low abundance or local extirpation. Our findings suggest that sampling the surface of boulders circumvents this problem because the vulnerable species were never subjected to sustained browsing on these refugia; consequently, these areas may represent typical levels of abundance of these vulnerable plant species.

AB  - Groundwater quality study was conducted in the Drini basin situated in the northern part of the Albanian territory. The objective of this study was to identify the quality of groundwater in four different well-defined monitoring sites. Groundwater is vital for the population and is considered to be subject to continuous exploitation with high growth intensity, and permanent risk of pollution from natural and human activities. Contamination of groundwater occurs when synthetic products such as gasoline, oil, road salts and chemicals get into the groundwater and return it unsafe and unfit for human use. Groundwater monitoring was carried out according to a network, which aimed to include mainly the most intensive areas of exploitation and distribution in the aquifer. Samples were collected in two different months of June and October in four monitoring drilling sites and were analysed for those key indicators defined by the rules and procedures for the drafting and implementation of the national programme of environmental monitoring in Albania. The study results reveal that geological formation, human activities as well as environmental conditions affect groundwater quality. Complete chemical analysis revealed that the groundwater in this area results in medium hardness, has good physico-chemical properties, local pollution is encountered, and there is no massive pollution of the basin. They are waters with low mineralisation. Further, they are neutral waters, which meet the allowed norm for drinking water. The pollution displayed is occasional, as the presence of NH4+ and NO2- are isolated cases, manifested mainly by the non-application of areas of strictness and sanitary protection around the drill and the small cover of the subaxillary layer. The analysis performed for microelements shows that the content of some heavy metals is below the maximum allowed amount; this demands serious future attention to the density of the network and the monitoring frequency in this basin. The risk of pollution in the Drini basin is high due to the small protective cover, especially in the source of Dobrac. Intensive exploitation can lead to the mixing of fresh water with water with high mineralisation. The concentration of Cu, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cd, Na+, K+ and Cl- in the water samples known as the major pollutants from the urban transport sector, has shown that the values are within the water quality standard. The low concentration of these pollutants was due to the distance of the drilling sites from the roads in these areas.

AB  - Background: Manganese (Mn) is an element found in the environment and certain geographic areas have elevated concentrations in soil and water du to natural conditions or anthropic activities. A growing body of data suggests that exposure to manganese in drinking water could be neurotoxic.
   Objective: Firstly, we aimed to examine the association between exposure to manganese from drinking water and cognition in children consuming well water. Secondly, we also aimed to examine the relation between cognition and manganese concentrations in children's hair, nail, and saliva.
   Methods: A total 259 children from 189 households consuming well water were included in the present study (ages 5.9 to 13.7 years). We assessed children's cognition with the WISC-IV, and we used five indicators of manganese exposure: concentration in tap water, intake from the consumption of water divided by child's weight, manganese concentration in children's hair, toe nail, and saliva. We used General Estimating Equation analysis to assess the relation between manganese exposure indicators and IQ scores, adjusting for potential confounders, and taking into account family clusters.
   Results: Drinking water manganese concentrations were generally low, with 48% of children consuming water <51.1 mu g/L, 25% >50 mu g/L, and 4% >400 mu g/L. Results differed by sex. In girls, higher manganese concentration in water, hair, and toe nail were associated with poorer Performance IQ scores but this was significant only for toe nail (for a 10-fold increase in manganese, beta: -5.65, 95% CIs: -10.97, -0.32). Opposite associations were observed in boys, i.e., better Performance IQ scores with higher manganese concentration hair, toe nail, and water, the latter being significant beta: 2.66, 95% CIs: 0.44, 4.89). Verbal IQ scores did not seem to be associated with manganese exposure indicators.
   Conclusions: Drinking water manganese levels were considerably lower than in previous studies reporting neurotoxic effects. There was no clear indication of an association between exposure to manganese and cognitive development in this sample of school-age children although the data suggest there might be sex-specific associations. Given the low levels of exposure and sex-specific associations, a larger sample size would have been required to increase the statistical power and better characterize the relations.

AB  - The North Brazil Shelf is a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that extends from the Caribbean Sea, in Central America, to the Parnaiba River in Brazil, and includes six countries. The area is dominated by the runoff of large rivers, including the Amazon and Orinoco, and by the intense disturbance of sediment transport, tides and currents. The sea bed is formed mainly by mud in shallow water, and by sand, mud, and gravel in deeper water. In terms of its biological productivity, this LME can be considered oligotrophic, with stratified habitats. The main source of nutrients of the euphotic layer is the local rivers and mangroves. Primary production has been limited by light and rising temperatures in recent years, factors associated with a decrease in marine primary productivity. However, the benthic fauna is very rich and unique, but poorly known. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in this LME. Demersal fish and shrimp are the main fishery resources in coastal and continental shelf waters. Fisheries account for more than 600 million USD a year with a considerable diversity of methods and scales ranging from very small to industrial. Seafood consumption is moderate to high in the local countries. Climate changes, dam building, deforestation, pollution, overfishing, tourism and aquaculture are the main threats to ecosystem productivity and habitat quality. Socioeconomic data are scant for this LME. Development is concentrated near the cities and mouths of rivers. Traditional communities in the coastal areas are culturally diverse, but invariably characterized by very low socioeconomic conditions. The Gross Domestic Product of the local countries ranges from 7,500 USD per capita in Guyana to 32,600 USD per capita in Trinidad and Tobago. Profound problems of governability are common to all six countries, and mean governance indicators reflect poor performances in all cases. The main issues are an absence of effective rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption. Fisheries are characterized by increasing effort and an absence of sustainability. Most of the fishery stocks are either fully or over exploited. This scenario can only be rectified by investments in marine protected areas and scientific research, as well as the increased participation of fishers in the development and implementation of management strategies and regulations.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) or carbon (SOC) is the most important component of the soil and it is composed of fractions with different lability. Particulate organic carbon (POC) and carbohydrates (CH), among others, are the most sensitive to changes in crops and soil management practices. The purpose of this study was to analyze different soil parameters aimed for the evaluation of management practices effects under widely different soil and climatic conditions. Soils were located along a West-East transect in the most productive region of the Argentinean pampas: [West] Bengolea and Monte Buey (Cordoba), Pergamino (Buenos Aires) and Viale (Entre Rios) [East]. Three treatments were defined according to land use: "Good agricultural practices" (GAP): sustainable agricultural management under no-till; "Poor agricultural practices" (PAP): non-sustainable agricultural management under no-till; "Natural environment" (NE): rangelands long as reference situation. Samples were taken at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths. SOC was determined in different particle size fractions: 105-2000 mu m (coarse particulate organic carbon, POCc), 53-105 mu m (fine particulate organic carbon, POCf), and 53 mu m (mineral-associated organic carbon, MOC). Total (CHt) and soluble (CHs) carbohydrate contents were also determined. The SOC level in NE was decreasing from the East (27.3 g kg(-1) in Viale) to the West (13.3 g kg(-1) in Bengolea), following the rainfall and texture gradient among sites. The POCc/SOC and POCc + POCf/SOC ratios in the NE showed differences among sites, suggesting different dynamic depending on the environmental characteristics at the different locations. The SOC levels in the upper layer of agricultural soils were 16-44% lower than natural ones. Carbon stocks were estimated for an equivalent mass of soil (950 and 2350 Mg ha(-1)) in order to consider differences in bulk densities among different treatments. Mean values were significantly different (p < 0.001) for the different management practices: NE (26.6 Mg ha(-1)) > GAP (20.1 Mg ha(-1)) > PAP (16.3 Mg ha(-1)). In general, labile organic fractions showed differential sensitivity. Fractions with an intermediate dynamic, as POCf (53-100 mu m) and CHt, seem to be better indicators to detect the short- and medium-term management effects than more dynamic fractions.

AB  - As closed-basin systems, saline lakes are prone to fluctuate in level and salinity with climate change and hydrologic alterations. Loss of many Great Basin Cakes has resulted from the diversion of tributary streams for agricultural or municipal uses. At Mono Lake, an alkaline salt lake in eastern California, salinities have risen from 50 to 100 g.L-1 in just 50 years. Experimental mesocosms were established to simulate some of the potential ecological effects that could have accompanied this change. The influence of salinity on diatom diversity,taxonomic structure, and primary Production was tested using mesocosms deployed at Mono Lake. Mesocosm tanks were 500 L in volume, 1 m square, and 0.5 m deep, with open tops covered by I mm mesh net. I;ive treatments (50, 75, 100, 125, and 190 p.L-1) with four replicates per treatment were used over a 2-month period. The diatom-dominated benthic algae were reduced both in standing crop (from 6 to <0.1 g.m(-2)) and diversity (from 30 to 12 taxa) with increased salinity, with most loss occurring in salinities greater than or equal to 75 g.L-1. Photosynthetic oxygen production also was significantly lower at salinities greater than or equal to 75 g.L-1. Diatom indicator taxa for these shifts included Denticula sp., Nitzschia frustulum, N. monoensis, N. communis, and Stephanodiscus oregonicus increasing in relative abundance in higher salinity treatments, accompanied by decreases in Achnanthes minutissima, Cymbella minuta, N. dissipata, and Rhoicosphenia abbreviata. Exhibiting dominance at moderate salinity levels (75 to 125 g.L-1) were Nitzschia frustulum, N. communis, N. palea, and Navicula crucialis. These latter species may be limited by both physiological stress at high salinity and grazing and competition at low salinity. The filamentous chlorophyte, Ctenocladus circinnatus, and cyanobacteria (Oscillatoria spp.) occurred only in salinity treatments from 50 to 100 g.L-1. Diversion of tributary stream flow and resulting salinity increases in this lake threaten sustained benthic primary production and algal species diversity relative to conditions prior to stream diversion. The 1994 decision of the California State Water Resources Control Board to return stream flows to Mono Lake will raise the lake level and reduce salinity to around 75 g.L-1 and is expected to increase the diversity and productivity of the benthic algae of this ecosystem.

AB  - The perspective on water transparency changed since the early days of limnology from being a physical parameter of optical water property to an ecological indicator tracking algal turbidity due to eutrophication or an overall success of sustained lake restoration in the late 60ies to 80ies. In modern cities, where ecosystems are commonly deteriorated by man-made modifications, water transparency offers a great opportunity to the public to raise socio-ecological consciousness concerning urban green-blue spaces. We thus re-emphasize water transparency as a key indicator of multi-functional value when assessing an oxbow lake of the riverine floodplain in Vienna, the Alte Donau. Our study covers the eutrophication from 1987 to 1994 due to the inclusion of the riverine landscape in the urban area, the following lake restoration with an ecosystem shift from a nutrient-rich, algal-turbid water body to a nutrient-poor, clear-water macrophyte controlled system and the impact of global warming in recent decades. We used light attenuation profiles to identify depth layers of specific ambient light requirements for photosynthetic domains (phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes), and to interpret Secchi measurements. Here, we calculated the depth at 1% (minimum light requirements for phytoplankton growth as euphotic depth), 3% (minimum light requirements for macrophytes as maximum macrophyte colonization depth), and 12% (preferred light requirements for phytoplankton development) of surface ambient light. A Secchi disk water transparency of 1.5 m ("lake bottom view"), judged as good water quality by human perception, refers to mesotrophic conditions with a maximum colonization depth for macrophytes exceeding the mean lake depth in Alte Donau. Water clarity required for sustained macrophyte growth, in particular for favoring bottom-dwellingCharameadows instead of tall-growingMyriophyllum spicatum, is 3.5 m Secchi depth and thus exceeds by far water clarity requested due to bathing aesthetics. Global warming, mirrored by an advanced warming in spring seems to favor significantly a higher yield of macrophytes mainly built up byMyriophyllumat the expense of the yield of algae. The prolongation of the summer period above 21 degrees C, however, coincides with lowered Secchi transparency. Water visibility during the hot season thus seems to be slightly hampered against lake restoration efforts by global warming.

AB  - Indicators of large-scale ecological change are typically derived from long-term monitoring networks. As such, it is important to assess how well monitoring networks provide evidence for ecological trends in the regions they are monitoring. In part, this depends on the network's representativeness of the full range of environmental conditions occurring in the monitored region. In addition, the statistical power to detect trends and ecological changes using the network depends on its structure, size and the intensity and accuracy of monitoring. This paper addresses the optimisation of representativeness and statistical power when re-designing existing large-scale ecological monitoring networks, for example due to financial constraints on monitoring programmes. It uses a real world example of a well-established river monitoring network of 254 sites distributed across Scotland. We first present a novel approach for assessing a monitoring network's representativeness of national habitat and pressure gradients using the multivariate two-sample Cramer's T statistic. This compares multivariate gradient distributions among sites inside and outside of the network. Using this test, the existing network was found to over-represent larger and more heavily polluted sites, reflecting earlier research priorities when it was originally designed. Network re-design was addressed through stepwise selection of individual sites to remove from or add to the network to maximise multivariate representativeness. This showed that combinations of selective site retention and addition can be used to modify existing monitoring networks, changing the number of sites and improving representativeness. We then investigated the effect of network re-design on the statistical power to detect long-term trends across the whole network. The power analysis was based on linear mixed effects models for long-term trends in three ecological indicators (ecological quality ratios for diatoms, invertebrates and macrophytes) over a ten-year period. This revealed a clear loss of power in smaller networks with less accurate sampling, but sampling schedule had a smaller effect on power. Interestingly, more representative networks had slightly lower trend detection power than the current unrepresentative network, though they should give a less biased estimate of national trends. Our analyses of representativeness and statistical power provide a general framework for designing and adapting large-scale ecological monitoring networks. Wider use of such methods would improve the quality of indicators derived from them and improve the evidence base for detecting and managing ecological change.

AB  - Background and questions How forest vegetation responds to disturbance continues to be a focal point, especially in the context of biodiversity conservation. To investigate the short-term effects of forest management on understory vegetation, we asked: (a) Are there any plant indicator species associated with different felling intensities? (b) What are the differences in abundance of plant functional types along the disturbance gradient? (c) How do typical forest species respond to silvicultural treatments? Location Dinaric Mountains, Slovenia. Methods At each of three study sites in Illyrian beech forests, nine plots (4,000 m(2)) were established, comprising a total of 27 plots. Three different felling intensities were implemented at each site, with one third of the plots assigned to each treatment: control, 50% of the growing stock removed and 100% of the growing stock removed. In the centre of each plot, a vegetation survey of vascular plants was done before (in 2012) and two years after (in 2014) felling in a circular sampling area of 400 m(2). We employed indicator species analysis, and species were grouped into functional types with respect to their traits. Results Understory species composition differed significantly between treatments. Forty-seven species (out of 251) were significantly associated with the 100% felling intensity. This relatively high number of indicators was due to the post-disturbance colonization of early-successional, non-forest species, coupled with the expansion of pre-treatment resident species. Only one species was a strong indicator for the 50% felled plots, while three species showed a preference for the unfelled plots. Graminoids, tall perennial forbs, annual/biennial forbs and legumes exhibited the most prominent increase in cover at the 50% and 100% felling intensity. Ferns showed non-significant changes, whereas woody plants exhibited a decrease in the most intensive treatment. In general, most of the typical forest species responded with increased frequency and/or abundance after felling. Conclusions The post-treatment taxonomic and functional composition of plant communities exhibited the largest changes in the most intensively felled stands. Overall, in the short term, ecological conditions in canopy gaps were not modified to an extent that would be detrimental to the persistence of typical forest species.

AB  - Low faecal worm-egg count (FEC) has been used as a phenotypic trait for breeding sheep for resistance to nematode infection. Application of this trait has resulted in a major reduction in worm-egg output in faeces, but in certain environments some of the resistant sheep develop what is believed to be a hypersensitivity-associated diarrhoea, resulting in soiling of the breech area (dags). To avoid breeding sheep with a propensity to scour, it, therefore, seems logical to combine selection for low FEC with selection for a trait based on the immune response to worm infection. We, therefore, investigated the relationships between immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) activities against L-3 larval antigens of Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostrongylus colubriformis and measured their inheritance and their genetic relationships with FEC, dag traits and measures of production. Total plasma IgE concentrations were also determined and included in the study. We used 762 progeny from 23 Merino sires selected for resistance to helminths (the Rylington Flock') and to breech flystrike. Total plasma IgE and IgE activities against T. circumcincta were negatively correlated with liveweight, longissimus dorsi muscle depth, and fleece weight, but positively correlated with severity of dags, softer faeces and back-fat depth. The IgA activity against T. circumcincta was negatively correlated with liveweight and clean fleece weight, but positively correlated with back-fat depth and faecal consistency score. The IgA activity against T. colubriformis was not correlated with any measure, except the breeding value for dags around yearling age. The heritability for the IgA activity against T. circumcincta and T. colubriformis was 0.13 and 0.08 respectively. The heritability for both IgE activity against T. circumcincta and total plasma IgE concentration was 0.39. We conclude that it is feasible to combine FEC and dag traits with an immune trait (in this case, helminth-specific IgE activity and total plasma IgE concentration) and, thus, genetically select sheep for resistance to both helminths and diarrhoea. However, under natural worm-challenge conditions, blood sampling protocols need to developed, on the basis of animal age, season and environment, for optimum estimation of the immune trait and its relationships with other traits.

AB  - Urban landscape is one of the most important issues and issues of interest to architects, planners and urban planners. Hence, the urban landscape is a concept beyond an urban planning and design problem, and primarily includes human goals and social interactions between people and people with the city. Therefore, at the outset, is an objective that is due to quality the emergence of physical factors of the environment is present, but gradually, due to the historical conditions and the repetition of it against the group of perceptive humans. It becomes a kind of mental aspect and becomes a common element of the linking of the people of the community. On the other hand, art is closely linked to human life, and its wisdom is woven from human experience and always seeks to establish a relationship between men and his transcendental needs. In this context, one of the main attractions of Iranian art during various periods of history is Iranian architecture and gardening. However, today, the advancement of technology, modernization and the growing trend of Western culture in our society have greatly affected the art and architecture of this land. As it is no longer a trace of the color of Iranian art in the city, especially in its architecture and urbanization. Particularly the design of urban green spaces and parks, generally based on the European park design and decorative design and design, and has no link with the rich archetypes of Iranian art and architecture. On the other hand, urban parks and green spaces are one of the most important elements and elements of the city and dynamic institutions and play a major role in the urban structure and urban structure, and their absence can seriously undermine sustainable development. In addition, the future life of each city, therefore, green spaces as the focal points and concentration of activity are one of the important indicators of urban development, which is very high in metropolises with numerous environmental and social problems. Thus, the purpose of this paper is, to explain the process of achieving and creating a sustainable urban landscape with dynamic and community based applications by restoring the spirit of Persian historical gardens. Introducing people to the latest news and developments of art, and eliminating the minimum need for educational space, recreation and culture, which is a new and unique approach in its kind.

AB  - Stress accompanying animal production is both an indicator of welfare and a factor that affects economic parameters. Dynamic development of alternative poultry production systems such as outdoor, free range or ecological, strives to achieve best-quality products and to improve the living conditions of birds. Apart from the type and intensity of the external stimuli, the response to stress is determined genetically. Poultry rearing in the aforementioned systems requires selecting the appropriate genotype of birds, often including crosses of fast-growing and slow-growing lines. The objective of this study was to demonstrate differences in the physiological response to stress of fast-growing (FG) and slow-growing (SG) turkeys and their crosses: SF (SG x FG) and FS (FG x SG), based on hematological and biochemical blood analyses. Blood was sampled from 30 turkey hens from each of four genotypes, aged 14 weeks, subjected to standard pre-slaughter handling procedures. Compared to FG and FS turkeys, the SG and SF birds had a high total protein concentration, a higher heterophil (H) / lymphocyte (L) ratio and a higher concentration of cortisol. In turn, the FG turkeys had the highest activity of enzymes: alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase. Conversely, the FS turkeys had the highest concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDLC) and the lowest concentration of cortisol. Significant positive effects of crossing were reported for total protein, cholinesterase and cortisol. Effects of crossbreeding on the percentage of H, concentrations of total cholesterol, and LDLC and activity of aspartate transaminase in blood of the crosses were significant but negative and more dependent on the sire line. Except for albumins, whose concentration in blood of crosses was higher compared to birds of pure lines, there were no advantages of heterosis. Negative heterosis was estimated for creatinine, the enzymes alanine transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase, and for cortisol. The most similar regarding creatinine, bilirubin, albumins, total protein, H, L and H / L were the FS and SF groups. The greatest differences were in the following parameters: triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDLC), LDLC, glucose and lactate, which occurred between the pure lines of turkeys. Study results demonstrate various responses to stress in the analyzed groups of turkeys, with the level of stress measured with hematological and biological blood markers being mostly determined by additive genetic variation, and to a lesser extent by the maternal and sire effects.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is considered a toxic element and its concentrations are relevant to human health and the environment. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which the bottom sediments of water bodies (artificial lakes and ponds) in the Silesian Upland in southern Poland are contaminated with Cd; an attempt was also made to determine the factors that condition spatial differences in the concentration of this element between individual water bodies in the region.
   Measurements of the Cd content in bottom sediments were carried out in 35 water bodies in southern Poland in 2011 and 2012. Depending on the surface area and morphometric characteristics, from two to nine samples representative in terms of sediment thickness were collected in each water body. Cadmium concentrations were determined for 92 0.25 g aliquots using the TD-ICP method.
   Cadmium content in all samples (0.7-580.0 mg kg(-1)) was higher than the natural range of concentrations for this element in the Earth's crust (0.1-0.3 mg kg(-1)) and the geochemical background for Poland (0.5 mg kg(-1)) and, with a few exceptions, was also higher than the preindustrial concentration (1.0 mg kg(-1)) and the regional geochemical background (2.5 mg kg(-1)). Adopting natural Cd concentrations in the Earth's crust (0.1-0.3 mg kg(-1)) as the baseline for the geoaccumulation index (I-geo), the sediments examined can be classified as extremely and heavily contaminated (and moderately contaminated in a small number of cases). The assessment of sediment quality based on I-geo,I- with the regional geochemical background (2.5 mg kg(-1)) adopted as the baseline, results in non-contaminated and moderately contaminated sediments being dominant with a far smaller number of heavily and extremely contaminated ones.
   In the case of several water bodies, Cd concentrations were at record levels that have not been found anywhere else in the world. On the basis of the I-geo, sediments of varying quality were found-from virtually uncontaminated to extremely contaminated. The I-geo index as an indicator of the quality of bottom sediments is a measure that requires careful interpretation, especially when different concentration levels regarded as natural are used for determining its value.

AB  - Soil microbes contribute to native plant species successful resistance against invasive plant. Three native tree species, Heteropanax fragrans (HF), Cinnamomum burmanii (CB), and Macaranga tanarius (MT) were effective in controlling the notorious invasive vine Mikania micrantha (MM). Biomass production and allocation patterns (shoot/root biomass ratio (shoot/root)) are important indicators of MM climbing coverage and competitive light-capturing capacity. An investigation was conducted to test the role of soil microbes associated with the three native tree species to inhibit MM biomass production and shift MM shoot/root. Rhizosphere soils originating from preculture HF, CB, MT, and MM plots were collected separately for use as inocula. The inocula were mixed with sterilized river sand at a 1:9 (w/w) ratio to grow MM. The fungicide carbendazim (methyl benzimidazol-2-ylcarbamate) was applied to half the treatments to kill pathogenic soil fungi. Two nutrient levels were established based on the natural soil nutrient concentration from a field stand invaded by MM. MM were grown from seeds in a glasshouse, harvested 15 weeks after sowing, and separated into shoot and root portions. Results showed that under interaction of soil origin and nutrient levels, MM biomass production was unchanged, but biomass allocation patterns were significantly different. MM biomass production grown in the three native tree soils under two nutrient levels was similar or higher than MM biomass production in MM conspecific soil, indicating the absence of species-specific pathogens that inhibited MM biomass production in native tree soils. However, in both conspecific and tree soils, MM biomass production was significantly reduced in the presence of pathogenic soil fungi, i.e. MM experienced significant fungal inhibition, demonstrating the pathogenic soil fungi promoted native tree resistence to MM. MM exhibited decreased shoot biomass allocation when cultivated in native tree soil relative to MM conspecific soil under field stand nutrient level conditions. Reduced resource allocation to shoot biomass could result in diminished capacity to climb, cover, and subsequent smother to native trees, and reduced surface area exposed to available light. Following fungicide application, significant biomass allocation differences disappeared, suggesting the native tree soil fungi were responsible for decreasing MM shoot biomass. The overall results indicated tree soil fungi serve an integral role in controlling invasive MM through fungal inhibition on MM biomass production, and shifts in MM biomass allocation patterns.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) is an abundant element in terrestrial and coastal ecosystems and an essential micronutrient in the metabolic processes of plants and animals. Mn is generally not considered a potentially toxic element due to its low content in both soil and water. However, in coastal ecosystems, the Mn dynamic (commonly associated with the Fe cycle) is mostly controlled by redox processes. Here, we assessed the potential contamination of the Rio Doce estuary (SE Brazil) by Mn after the world's largest mine tailings dam collapse, potentially resulting in chronic exposure to local wildlife and humans. Estuarine soils, water, and fish were collected and analyzed seven days after the arrival of the tailings in 2015 and again two years after the dam collapse in 2017. Using a suite of solid-phase analyses including X-ray absorption spectroscopy and sequential extractions, our results indicated that a large quantity of Mn-II arrived in the estuary in 2015 bound to Fe oxyhydroxides. Over time, dissolved Mn and Fe were released from soils when Fe-III oxyhydroxides underwent reductive dissolution. Due to seasonal redox oscillations, both Fe and Mn were then re-oxidized to Fe-III, Mn-III, and Mn-IV and re-precipitated as poorly crystalline Fe oxyhydroxides and poorly crystalline Mn oxides. In 2017, redox conditions (Eh: -47 +/- 83 mV; pH: 6.7 +/- 0.5) favorable to both Fe and Mn reduction led to an increase (similar to 880%) of dissolved Mn (average for 2015: 66 +/- 130 mu g L-1; 2017: 582 +/- 626 mu g L-1) in water and a decrease (similar to 75%, 2015: 547 +/- 498 mg kg(-1); 2017: 135 +/- 80 mg kg(-1)) in the total Mn content in soils. The crystalline Fe oxyhydroxides content significantly decreased while the fraction of poorly ordered Fe oxides increased in the soils limiting the role of Fe in Mn retention. The high concentration of dissolved Mn found within the estuary two years after the arrival of mine tailings indicates a possible chronic contamination scenario, which is supported by the high levels of Mn in two species of fish living in the estuary. Our work suggests a high risk to estuarine biota and human health due to the rapid Fe and Mn biogeochemical dynamic within the impacted estuary.

AB  - Soil colour can indicate soil physical, chemical and biological properties and processes, and is an important indicator for soil classification, soil quality evaluation and soil management. It varies in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, and thus regional maps of soil colour can reveal spatial patterns of these properties, processes, and indicators. However, although soil regions are sometimes named for their dominant soil colour, it is directly measured only at "point" support, i.e., during soil profile description, whereas it is desirable to know soil colour over the entire soilscape. To achieve this for China we used predictive soil mapping methods to produce soil colour maps (dry and moist colours) at 1 km(2) grid cell size and over multiple depths from a consistent dataset of approximately 4 600 full profile descriptions taken as part of a national survey to define soil series in Chinese Soil Taxonomy, and a set of environmental covariates covering the national territory. The covariates characterized soil forming factors including climate, parent materials, terrain, vegetation, land surface water and thermal conditions. Soil colour descriptions in the Munsell system were extracted from the genetic horizon descriptions at the selected depths and converted to the sRGB and L*a*b* colour spaces. Dry and moist colour separates were not well-correlated in either space (r < 0.76). Random forest models were constructed in both spaces, for dry and moist colours separately. Models in sRGB space were moderately successful (R-2 approximate to 0.43, RMSE approximate to 26/255) at 5 cm, with success decreasing with depth. Models smoothed the colour space and thus did not predict the more extreme values or chromas, nor the rarer hues. Models in L*a*b* space were less successful. The fitted sRGB models were used to produce predictive maps over all of China. Regional patterns as well as local detail are clearly shown. Solar radiation, wind exposure, regolith thickness, and Landsat TM bands 7 and 5 contributed most to the predictions, followed by elevation, mean annual precipitation, terrain wetness index, air temperature seasonality, precipitation standard deviation and standard deviation of NDVI. These suggest pedological processes acting on the development of soil colours, including weathering of parent materials, oxidation-reduction chemistry and biochemistry of the decomposing of organic matter. This study shows that predictive methods from points using suitable covariates are an alternative to spatial predictions over map units from their representative profiles.

AB  - The purpose of the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) cropland national assessment is to quantify the environmental benefits of conservation programs at the regional and national levels, which include both onsite and instream water quality benefits. Modeling is an effective tool for environmental assessment at the regional and national scale due to the complexities in nature at this scale. Two simulation models, the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), were used for the CEAP cropland national assessment. A subset of National Resources Inventory (NRI) sample points was selected to serve as "representative fields" for the CEAP cropland survey to determine conservation practices currently in use. The NRI-CEAP points for cultivated cropland were simulated using APEX. The APEX results were aggregated and combined with modeling results from SWAT for uncultivated land uses. The combined modeling results at 8-digit watershed outlets were routed downstream in SWAT for estimating the offsite effects of conservation practices. The regional modeling involved three major steps: APEX setup for simulating conservation practices, calibration of water yield at the 8-digit watershed level (1961-1990), and development of sediment delivery ratios (SDR) for transporting sediment from cultivated cropland and uncultivated land to the 8-digit watershed outlet before combining model outputs for further routing downstream. The objective of this article is to address the use of APEX to model CEAP cultivated cropland, APEX simulation of conservation practices, and SDR development and to test the combined modeling of flow and sediment yield for the upper Mississippi River basin. Simulated annual and monthly flows at key gauging stations along the river basin and annual sediment yields at Valley City and Alton/Grafton, Illinois, were compared with observed values. Test results are promising for using the combined modeling systems for large-scale studies and for performing scenario analyses to evaluate conservation practices. The limitations of this national modeling include the uncertainties associated with data (channel dimensions, conditions of structural practices) and the inability to account for streambank and channel erosion at the 8-digit watershed level. Therefore, while using absolute predictions for individual scenarios, consideration should be given to various uncertainties. Both data updating and the development of an enhanced SWAT model with streambank/channel erosion components and particle size distribution are underway for reducing the level of uncertainty in future national-scale modeling efforts.

AB  - The delta(13)C value of plant tissue is increasingly used to infer environmental and ecological conditions in modern and ancient enviromnents. Isolation techniques and morphological descriptions have been established that characterize plant pollen for the greater part of the Phanerozoic eon. If the delta(13)C value of fossil pollen could be used as an indicator of the carbon isotope composition of ancient pollinating communities, it could provide insight into ancient paleoenviromnents. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the delta(13)C value of pollen and the delta(13)C value of bulk plant tissue in a few isolated species; this study sought to quantify the isotopic relationship between modern pollen and stem and leaf tissues across all the major phylogenetic clades of the tracheophytes. One-hundred and seventy-five different species of tracheophytes were collected from 11 arboreta and botanical gardens across the United States and analyzed for delta(13)C value of pollen, leaf, and stem tissue. The carbon isotope difference between pollen and leaf tissue values in the same species was = +/-3.00parts per thousand for >90% of data pairs, and the same relationship was true for comparisons between pollen and stem tissue. When the data was examined by phylogenetic clade, it was found that some groups, such as the Cornales and Ericales, exhibited a much closer and more consistent correlation between pollen and stem and leaf tissue. It was also noted that green-stemmed clades tended to show delta(13)C(stem)<delta(13)C(pollen) while woody-stemmed clades showed the opposite (delta(13)C(pollen)<delta(13)C(stem)), a difference attributable to the different chemical composition of the two types of stem tissue. The chemical preparation method involving Schulze's solution that is commonly employed to isolate pollen from pre-Quaternary sediments was shown not to affect the carbon isotope composition of pollen by more than 0.23parts per thousand. The manual isolation of sufficient pollen from the fossil record for delta(13)C analysis of a single species would be prohibitively laborious; however, these results showed that when understood in terms of paleobotanical taxonomy, delta(13)C analyses of bulk fossil pollen can be used to infer the delta(13)C value of the ancient plant community to within 1.5parts per thousand.

AB  - Simple Summary Tropical pasture-based beef production systems play a vital role in global food security. The importance of promoting sustainable intensification of such systems has been debated worldwide. Demand for beef is growing together with concerns over the impact of its production on the environment. Implementing sustainable livestock intensification programs relies on animal genetic improvement. In tropical areas, the lack of sexual precocity is a bottleneck for cattle efficiency, directly impacting the sustainability of production systems. In the present review we present and discuss the state of the art of genetic evaluation for sexual precocity in Bos indicus beef cattle, covering the definition of measurable traits, genetic parameter estimates, genomic analyses, and a case study of selection for sexual precocity in Nellore breeding programs. Increasing productivity through continued animal genetic improvement is a crucial part of implementing sustainable livestock intensification programs. In Zebu cattle, the lack of sexual precocity is one of the main obstacles to improving beef production efficiency. Puberty-related traits are complex, but large-scale data sets from different "omics" have provided information on specific genes and biological processes with major effects on the expression of such traits, which can greatly increase animal genetic evaluation. In addition, genetic parameter estimates and genomic predictions involving sexual precocity indicator traits and productive, reproductive, and feed-efficiency related traits highlighted the feasibility and importance of direct selection for anticipating heifer reproductive life. Indeed, the case study of selection for sexual precocity in Nellore breeding programs presented here show that, in 12 years of selection for female early precocity and improved management practices, the phenotypic means of age at first calving showed a strong decreasing trend, changing from nearly 34 to less than 28 months, with a genetic trend of almost -2 days/year. In this period, the percentage of early pregnancy in the herds changed from around 10% to more than 60%, showing that the genetic improvement of heifer's sexual precocity allows optimizing the productive cycle by reducing the number of unproductive animals in the herd. It has a direct impact on sustainability by better use of resources. Genomic selection breeding programs accounting for genotype by environment interaction represent promising tools for accelerating genetic progress for sexual precocity in tropical beef cattle.

AB  - A coupled ocean-wave model was used to investigate residence times of the water masses on the Gulf of Lion shelf and their export routes during autumn 2010 and winter 2010-2011. Particular attention is paid to the Cap de Creus region and submarine canyon, a key site for the export of water from the Gulf of Lion shelf. First, model results were compared to numerous observations taken during the same period. The timing of strong current pulses on the shelf and at 300 m depth within the Cap de Creus Canyon, linked to easterly winds during winter, were well reproduced by the model. Lagrangian particle trajectories were used to calculate residence times of water masses on the Gulf of Lion shelf. Those of waters located near the Rhone River ranged from 10 to 40 days for autumn 2010, a period which was dominated by frequent strong winds, to 40-60 days for winter 2010-2011, which has been linked to less frequent strong winds and a slope current flowing farther away from the shelf. In the Cap de Creus region the volumes of water exported were estimated at 747 km(3) in autumn and 1513 km(3) in winter. Results show that, in autumn, only 4% of the water was exported at depths below 200 m while, in winter, this percentage was 25% because it was related to coastal dense water cascades. Yet, this export remains low compared to other winters. It is likely that the low heat losses that characterized the second part of the winter were responsible for the shallow export depth through the Cap de Creus Canyon. These conditions favoured an export of water from the Gulf of Lion to the Spanish coastal zone that would represent 70% of the total exported volume. Interannual variability of the distribution of this export was investigated over the longer period of 2010-2017. Heat losses in February and March appear to be an indicator of dense shelf water cascading, suggesting about 3 or 4 out of 8 winters being affected by deep cascading (reaching 1000 m depth). Understanding the variability of exports of continental inputs to this region is essential to anticipate their potential impacts on ecosystems and human activities in environments as contrasting as the coastal zone and deep canyons.

AB  - Contradictory paleoaltitudinal histories of the Himalayas arrived at using isotopic paleoaltimeters and ecological evidences have constrained our further exploration of the geodynamic mechanisms driving the India-Eurasia collision and the resultant interaction between tectonic uplift and climate change. In this study, based on evidence derived from glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), the hydrogen isotopes of leaf wax n-alkanes (delta H-2(alk)), we estimated the paleoaltitude of the Gyirong Basin (GB), central Himalayas, for the 7.0 similar to 3.2 Ma period. The paleoaltitudinal reconstruction based on delta H-2(alk) values (similar to 6.3km above sea level (asl)) was consistent with that of the revised delta O-18(c) values (similar to 5.6 km asl), and higher than the present-day altitude (similar to 4 km asl). The reconstructed paleotemperatures based on brGDGTs (14.2 +/- 4.5 degrees C for the lake surface; 7.5 +/- 3.3 degrees C for terrestrial organic matter source areas) were consistent with the ecological evidences, indicating a low-altitude paleoenvironment. This proves that a systemic bias exists between the isotopic paleoaltimeters and the ecological evidence, rather than a problem with specific indicators. The reconstructed paleoaltitudinal differences between the delta H-2(alk) and delta O-18(c) values are similar to those of brGDGT reconstructions, seemingly representing the paleoaltitudinal differences between the source areas of terrestrial organic matter inputs and the lake surface, and suggesting that the isotopic palaeoaltimeters do not specifically record the higher-altitude parts of the basinal topography. Further paleoenvironmental analysis indicated that the warmer and wetter environment present during the Late Miocene to Mid-Pliocene would, on the face of it, be better suited to the application of brGDGT paleothermometers, and this in turn would potentially lead to a systemic overestimation by isotopic paleoaltimeters. We therefore adopted the paleoaltitudinal reconstructions which used brGDGTs and concluded that the lake surface of the GB during the Late Miocene to Mid-Pliocene was 2.5 +/- 0.8 km asl, and that the surrounding mountains exceeded 3.6 km asl in height, implying that the central Himalayas underwent a rapid uplift of similar to 1.5 km after the Mid-Pliocene.

AB  - To achieve appropriate yield levels, inherent nitrogen (N) supply and biological N fixation are often complemented by fertilization. To avoid economic losses and negative environmental impacts due to over-application of N fertilizer, estimation of the inherent N supply is critical. We aimed to identify the roles of soil texture and organic matter in N mineralization and yield levels attained in cereal cultivation with or without N fertilization in boreal mineral soils. First, the net N mineralization and soil respiration were measured by laboratory incubation with soil samples varying in clay and organic carbon (C) contents. Secondly, to estimate the inherent soil N supply under field conditions, both unfertilized and fertilized cereal yields were measured in fields on clay soils (clay 30-78%) and coarse-textured soils (clay 0-28%). In clay soils (C 2.5-9.0%), both the net N mineralization and the cereal yields (without and with fertilization) decreased with increasing clay/C ratio. Moreover, in soils with high clay/C ratio, the agronomic N use efficiency (additional yield per kg of fertilizer N) varied considerably, indicating the presence of growth limitations other than N. In coarse-textured soils, the yield increase attained by fertilization increased with increasing organic C. Our results indicate that for clay soils in a cool and humid climate, the higher the clay content, the more organic C is needed to produce reasonable yields and to ensure efficient use of added nutrients without high N losses to the environment. For coarse soils having a rather high mean organic C of 2.3%, the organic C appeared to improve agronomic N use efficiency. For farmers, simple indicators such as the clay/C ratio or the use of non-N-fertilized control plots may be useful for site-specific adjustment of the rates of N fertilization. Highlights
   We aimed to identify simple indicators of inherent soil N supply applicable at the farm level. In clay soils, the net N mineralization was found to correlate negatively with the clay/C ratio. In coarse-textured soils, agronomic N use efficiency improved with increasing soil organic C. Clay soils with high clay/C ratio are at risk of low yield levels.

AB  - Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are a kind of emerging contaminants, but the information about their pollution profile and ecological risk are still scarce in China. In this study, 31 surface water samples of Haihe River (China) were collected in November 2017, and 11 OPEs were measured, and the ecological risk of OPEs was assessed by means of species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method and assessment factor method. Additionally, Pearson correlation analysis and an international comparison with other rivers in the world were conducted. The results showed that total OPEs ranged from 23.98 to 824.72 ng L-1, and the mean value was 228.70 ng L-1. The concentration of OPEs decreased as follows: Tri(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP) > Tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) > Triethyl phosphate (TEP) > Tributoxyethyl phosphate (TBEP) > Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) > Tripropyl phosphate (TPrP) > Tri(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP) > 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) > Tri(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) > Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) > Tri-m-cresyl phosphate (TMPP). TCPP (19.54-160.82 ng L-1) and TCEP (N.D.-151.99 ng L-1) with the mean value of 76.67 and 53.13 ng L-1 respectively were identified as the richest OPEs in Haihe River. The concentration of OPEs slowly increased in the upper reaches of Haihe River, and it tended to be stable in the middle reaches of Haihe River and decreased rapidly from the downstream to the outer sea. Significantly positive correlations occurred among three chlorinated alkyl OPEs (TCEP, TCPP, and TDCPP), suggesting that they might come from the same source. Based on the comparison, the pollution condition of OPEs in Haihe River was low, and TCEP was found to be the most abundant OPEs in China but it was not that in Europe. The ecological risk assessment on the basis of assessment factor method suggested that the risk of OPEs in Haihe River for algae, crustacean, and fish was limited. In addition, the results of SSD method suggested that the combined ecological risk of four OPEs in Haihe River was also low. This study provides information about the pollution status of OPEs in the surface water of China to some extents and a project for the risk estimation based on SSD for prior and emerging flame retardants.

AB  - The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum is an invasive bivalve in Europe, widely distributed, with a great ability to tolerate a broad range of environmental conditions. Despite the ability to reflect contamination, its suitability as bioindicator is not consensual. This study provided clarification on this issue by evaluating the ability of R. philippinarum to signalise trace element contamination in an estuary chronically impacted by metals and metalloids (Tagus estuary, Portugal). A multidimensional approach was carried out in two differently contaminated sites (Barreiro - BAR; Alcochete - ALC) in warm and cold periods, combining sediment contamination, bioaccumulation of trace elements (As, Cd, Pb and Hg), and a battery of oxidative stress biomarkers in two R. philippinarum organs (digestive gland and gills). Sediments from BAR exhibited higher concentrations of all the elements than those from ALC, in line with the anthropogenic pressures identified for both estuarine areas. Likewise, clams from BAR showed higher concentrations of As and Pb in the digestive gland (cold period) and Pb in the gills (warm and cold periods) in comparison with ALC. These results suggest the capacity of R. philippinarum to reflect external levels of exposure to those elements into tissue loads. However, an opposite spatial variation was consistently found for Hg accumulation in the digestive gland and gills in both periods, as well as for Cd in the gills in the warm season. The results reinforce the idea that trace element accumulation patterns depend not only on the external bioavailability, but also on the toxicokinetics that is trace element-specific. Despite the two contrasting patterns found for bioaccumulation in R. philippinarum (mainly Pb vs. Hg), oxidative stress parameters were able to signalise BAR as the most impacted area. In fact, the digestive gland of BAR clams exhibited higher GST activity and GSHt levels (in both sampling periods) and SOD activity (warm season), presumably to cope with the enhanced accumulation of Pb and As. Moreover, variations of gills' CAT and SOD activities (warm period) agreed with the elevated accumulation of Pb at BAR. Overall, the characteristics of this invasive species could lead to a biased interpretation of the environmental quality status, particularly when based on trace element bioaccumulation only, reinforcing the need to adopt a multi-level/-species approach on environmental assessment studies.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem services (ES) has facilitated the identification, mapping and communication about the many non-marketable benefits of green infrastructure. These benefits are important to consider during a spatial planning process. For spatial prioritisation of sites, with a high societal importance, there is need to filter this information to insightful spatial indicators. The mapping of ES-hotspots and identification of ES-bundles have been put forward as promising methods for spatial prioritisation and the assessment of multifunctionality. While "hotspot mapping" and "ES-bundles" speak to the imagination of many, it is open to many different interpretations. In addition, there is a risk that the commonly applied hotspot mapping of single services and subsequent overlay analysis does not capture true hotspots of multifunctionality, where we expect multiple services to co-occur, but at lower intensities. Therefore, hotspot mapping should be applied on ES-bundles, rather than single ES. Yet, there are few methods to objectively identify and map such bundles of co-occurring services. In this research we propose dimension reduction principal component analysis (PCA), as a solution to identify and map bundles of ES. This technique is an established technique in remote sensing, where it is used to reduce unnecessary clutter in a data set. This research shows that if the methods for quantification and mapping of ES are sufficiently independent and biophysically sound, the PCA method can reveal multifunctionality between services and lead to (new) insights that can be used for better informed decisions on management and planning. The PCA graphs, ES-bundle maps and the integrated RGB-visualisation are objective and factual outputs of a statistical analysis that can be used for communication and discussion with stakeholders. It gives insight in co-occurrence of services and challenges to look for answers to why things are the way they are. Although scale effects did not play an important role in the results of this study, we advise to use this method on relatively small scales and repeat analysis rather than generalizing large scale results to the local scale or transfer findings between study sites as land-use patterns (and its interplay with abiotic conditions) are the result of many different socio-ecological developments throughout history, which can obviously differ from region to region.

AB  - The Marica "restinga", located on the eastern part of Rio de Janeiro State (Brazil), corresponds to one of the few remaining preserved areas of the state's coastal plain. This coastline presents two sand barriers separated by a depression where there is a freshwater swamp and different plant communities distributed in areas of high ecological diversity accompanying the local topography and the range of marine spray. This paper is a study of the soil phytolith assemblages in the Marica restinga, with the intent of establishing reference collections for paleoenvironmental studies of this coastal area during the Quaternary. Phytoliths were chosen as proxies, but their use for reconstruction of this type of vegetation is pioneer research, so it was essential to characterize the phytolith assemblages for each plant community through the identification of the main morphotypes and whether or not they are preserved in coastal depositional environments under the effect of geomorphology and salinity. Eight plant communities, distributed almost parallel to the coastline over sandy barriers, lagoonal plain, lagoon margin and weathered basement were identified: Halophile-psamophile, near the beach; two Scrub communities, one over the Holocene barrier and the other over the Pleistocene barrier; two Herbaceous swamps, one between the two sand barriers, the other behind the Pleistocene barrier; Slack, in front of the Pleistocene barrier; Shrubby vegetation on the shore of Marica lagoon and Dry forest, over the weathered Pre-Cambrian basement. In general, it was found that this type of environment is not very favorable for the formation and accumulation of phytoliths. Restinga plants did not prove to be large producers of phytoliths, except those known as such, as in the case of Poaceae and Cyperaceae. It was also observed that the permanence of phytoliths in sediments is strongly influenced by its particle size and organic matter content. The largest stocks of phytoliths were found in swamp communities, due to the presence of organic matter and low energy dynamics, and in dry forests, where a process of pedogenesis already occurs. Despite the low phytolith stocks present in modern assemblages, they show a high degree of conservation, which enabled significant results for the study of this type of vegetation. The calculated phytolith indices (tree density and water stress) consistently expressed, in detail, the environment of each community analyzed from the point of view of the type of vegetation cover and the conditions of water availability to plants.

AB  - The drinking water treatment plant (WTP) of the city of Turin (NW Italy), with a treatment capacity of 40x10(6) m(3)/year, has a basin that is employed as a lagooning pretreatment facility. This study aims to assess the effect of the basin on several environmental parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, pH, chloride, nitrite, and total chlorophyll) of the river water before entering the WTP and monitor the changes inside the basin caused by the seasonal hydrological and biological cycles. Sampling was carried out on 16 dates over 3 years at the inlet and outlet channel of the basin and in five locations along three depth values (1, 6, and 12 m, i.e., at the bottom). The results of the 3-year monitoring campaign demonstrated that the basin had an effect on pH (p=6.6x10(-9)), DO (p=0.000072), turbidity (p=0.011), and chlorophyll (p=0.033). No significant changes regarding nitrite (p=0.11), chloride (p=0.94), and temperature (p=0.66) were detected. The results gathered from the sampling campaign inside the basin demonstrated that, during the year, the basin experienced the following: two states of complete mixing in early spring and fall, when the differences in temperature between the surface and the bottom of the basin were less than 1 degrees C; a condition of late spring/summer stratification with a temperature difference between the surface and the bottom of 4-5 degrees C and a difference in DO, pH, and total chlorophyll concentration that increased throughout the spring season; and one or more states of summer circulation due to the weak stability of the warm season stratification. During the states of circulation, the persistent algae photosynthetic activity tended to cause a quick change in the concentration of DO, total chlorophyll, and pH value in the most superficial layer of the basin. The results of the principal component analysis (PCA) showed a strong direct relationship between the weight of the first component and the hydrodynamic states of the basin (stratification/circulation) and an inverse relationship between the weight of the second component and the intensity of photosynthetic activity of algae species.

AB  - Some countries, including Taiwan, have adopted strategic environmental assessment (SEA) to assess and modify proposed policies, plans, and programs (PPPs) in the planning phase for pursuing sustainable development. However, there were only some sketchy steps focusing on policy assessment in the system of Taiwan. This study aims to develop a methodology for SEA in Taiwan to enhance the effectiveness associated with PPPs. The proposed methodology comprises an SEA procedure involving PPP management and assessment in various phases, a sustainable assessment framework, and an SEA management system. The SEA procedure is devised based on the theoretical considerations by systems thinking and the regulative requirements in Taiwan. The positive and negative impacts on ecology, society, and economy are simultaneously considered in the planning (including policy generation and evaluation), implementation, and control phases of the procedure. This study used the analytic hierarchy process, Delphi technique, and systems analysis to develop a sustainable assessment framework. An SEA management system was built based on geographic information system software to process spatial, attribute, and satellite image data during the assessment procedure. The proposed methodology was applied in the SEA of golf course installation policy in 2001 as a case study, which was the first SEA in Taiwan. Most of the 82 existing golf courses in 2001 were installed on slope lands and caused a serious ecological impact. Assessment results indicated that 15 future golf courses installed on marginal lands (including buffer zones, remedied lands, and wastelands) were acceptable because the comprehensive environmental (ecological, social, and economic) assessment value was better based on environmental characteristics and management regulations of Taiwan. The SEA procedure in the planning phase for this policy was completed but the implementation phase of this policy was not begun because the related legislation procedure could not be arranged due to a few senators' resistance. A self-review of the control phase was carried out in 2006 using this methodology. Installation permits for 12 courses on slope lands were terminated after 2001 and then 27 future courses could be installed on marginal lands. The assessment value of this policy using the data on ecological, social, and economic conditions from 2006 was higher than that using the data from 2001. The analytical results illustrate that the proposed methodology can be used to effectively and efficiently assist the related authorities for SEA.

AB  - We analyzed flowering of white snakeroot (Eupatorium rugosum) as an indicator of edge effect from recent silvicultural clearcutting in mixed-mesophytic forest in northcentral West Virginia. Edge effect estimated by a common, widespread, easily identified perennial herb could permit an estimate of the spatial extent of edge habitat for other understory plant species, an important consideration in forest ecosystem management. The study had two objectives: (1) to analyze flower production and reproductive stein density across existing south- and west-facing edges of similar age and forest type; and (2) to analyze flower production under controlled shading conditions designed to simulate the light environment across the forest edge. The effect of distance from clearcuts and edge aspect on flower production was examined using a two-way factorial model I analysis of variance. Flower biomass did not differ between aspects but decreased Significantly with distance, indicating an effect of clearcutting on flower production in adjacent edges. Using regression, independent analyses of the number of flower heads per stein and reproductive stein density were found to decline significantly over distance from clearcuts. Slopes and y-intercepts were similar within and between south- and west-facing edges, indicating a consistent flowering response to adjacent clearcuts. In a greenhouse experiment analyzed as a Latin Square analysis of variance. flower biomass per individual did not differ between no shade 'clearcut' and intermediate shade 'intermediate edge', but flower biomass in heavy shade 'far edge' was significantly different from both of these treatments and in general support of the dramatic decline in flower production beyond 30 in from clearcuts. Consistency in flower production under controlled shading and consistency in flower production as a function of distance from clearcuts demonstrates that white snakeroot is a sensitive, consistent indicator of edge effect. These characteristics, in combination with the species' widespread distribution, suggest that white snakeroot flowering might prove useful as a phytometer to assay edge effects in mixed-mesophytic forests from even-aged timber harvests, forest road corridors, wildlife openings, or other activities that create large openings in the forest canopy, This idea should be tested in these and similar types of edge environments, as well as in other eastern deciduous forest types where white snakeroot is an abundant component of the herbaceous flora.

AB  - Advanced old age has been characterized as a biologically highly vulnerable life phase. Biological, morbidity-, and cognitive impairment-related factors play an important role as mortality predictors among very old adults. However, it is largely unknown whether previous findings confirming the role of different wellbeing domains for mortality translate to survival among the oldest-old individuals. Moreover, the distinction established in the wellbeing literature between hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing as well as the consideration of within-person variability of potentially relevant mortality predictors has not sufficiently been addressed in prior mortality research. In this study, we examined a broad set of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing indicators, including their levels, their changes, as well as their within-person variability, as predictors of all-cause mortality in a sample of very old individuals. We used data from the LateLine study, a 7-year longitudinal study based on a sample of n = 124 individuals who were living alone and who were aged 87-97 years (M = 90.6, SD = 2.9) at baseline. Study participants provided up to 16 measurement occasions (mean number of measurement occasions per individual = 5.50, SD = 4.79) between 2009 and 2016. Dates of death were available for 118 individuals (95.2%) who had deceased between 2009 and 2021. We ran longitudinal multilevel structural equation models and specified between-person level differences, within-person long-term linear change trends, as well as the "detrended" within-person variability in three indicators of hedonic (i.e., life satisfaction and positive and negative affect) and four indicators of eudaimonic wellbeing (i.e., purpose in life, autonomy, environmental mastery, and self-acceptance) as all-cause mortality predictors. Controlling for age, gender, education, and physical condition and testing our sets of hedonic and eudaimonic indictors separately in terms of their mortality impact, solely one eudaimonic wellbeing indicator, namely, autonomy, showed significant effects on survival. Surprisingly, autonomy appeared "paradoxically" related with mortality, with high individual levels and intraindividual highly stable perceptions of autonomy being associated with a shorter residual lifetime. Thus, it seems plausible that accepting dependency and changing perceptions of autonomy over time in accordance with objectively remaining capabilities might become adaptive for survival in very old age.

AB  - The first part of the article describes the stylistic features of poetic epitaphs recorded during field surveys of provincial cemeteries in Perm Krai in 2019. These texts have not only historical and source-study, but also cultural value. The establishment of the features of the broad epitaph heritage in a particular historical period leads to an understanding of the worldview of representatives of everyday life of the given time. When classifying the material, the author took into account the nature of authorship and the genre function. On these grounds, the collected texts are divided into four groups. Group 1 is folklore texts for which the epitaph function is initial. These are epitaphs generated in the folk environment, they are characterized by anonymity, a characteristic set of topics, variability, a high degree of formulaicity and a typified subject. They are broadcast not only in real conditions, but also on the Internet. Group 2 is folklore texts for which the epitaph function is secondary. Such texts are a rare occurrence in cemetery poetry associated with subcultural folklore. Group 3 is authorial texts for which the epitaph function is initial. This group is organized by anonymous works of amateur nature. Fixed in a single copy, they do not find variants either in cemeteries or on the Internet. The stylistic differences between naive epitaphs and folk epitaphs are reduced to the individualization of the dead through their lifetime qualities, as well as the manifestation of the author's poetic talent. Group 4 is authorial texts for which the epitaph function is secondary. According to the genre of the source, these works belong to poems, novels, dramas, literary epitaphs, aphorisms, and songs. Poetic quotations in the function of epitaphs can be transmitted verbatim or be reworked in accordance with new content and stylistic tasks. In addition to these categories, the studied material also reveals as a transitional phenomenon, when a popular text loses its connection with the author and functions as a folk text. The basis for identifying transient phenomena is provided by Internet statistics. In the final section of the first part, conclusions are drawn about 1) the prevalence of epitaph texts in the cemetery space of the province; 2) the correlation of the author's classification with previous works on the style of epitaphs; 3) the thematic features of cemetery poetry; 4) the presence of regional specificity in the presented set of texts.

AB  - The use of sedimentary structures as indicators of flow and sediment morphodynamics in ancient sediments lies at the very heart of sedimentology, and allows reconstruction of formative flow conditions generated in a wide range of grain sizes and sedimentary environments. However, the vast majority of past research has documented and detailed the range of bedforms generated in essentially cohesionless sediments that lack the presence of mud within the flow and within the sediment bed itself. Yet most sedimentary environments possess fine-grained sediments and recent work has shown how the presence of this fine sediment may substantially modify the fluid dynamics of such flows. It is increasingly evident that understanding the influence of mud, and the presence of cohesive forces, is essential to permit a fuller interpretation of many modern and ancient sedimentary successions. In this paper, the present state of knowledge on the stability of current-and wave-generated bedforms and their primary current stratification is reviewed, and a new extended bedform phase diagram is presented that summarizes the bedforms generated in mixtures of sand and mud under rapidly decelerated flows. This diagram provides a phase space using the variables of yield strength and grain mobility as the abscissa and ordinate axes, respectively, and defines the stability fields of a range of bedforms generated under flows that have modified fluid dynamics owing to the presence of suspended sediment within the flow. Our results also present unique data on a range of bedforms generated in such flows, whose recognition is essential to help interpret such deposits in the ancient sedimentary record, including the following: (1) heterolithic stratification, comprising alternating laminae or layers of sand and mud; (2) the preservation of low-amplitude bed-waves, large current ripples and bed scours with intrascour composite bedforms; (3) low-angle cross-lamination and long lenses and streaks of sand and mud formed by bed-waves; (4) complex stacking of reverse bedforms, mud layers and low-angle cross-lamination on the upstream face of bed scours; (5) planar bedding comprising stacked mud-sand couplets. Furthermore, the results shown herein demonstrate that flow variability is not required to produce deposits consisting of interbedded sand and muds, and that the nature of flaser, wavy and lenticular bedding (sensu Reineck & Wunderlich 1968) may also need reconsideration in the deposits of such sediment-laden flows.

AB  - Proposed European policy in the agricultural sector will place higher emphasis on soil organic carbon (SOC), both as an indicator of soil quality and as a means to offset CO2 emissions through soil carbon (C) sequestration. Despite detailed national SOC data sets in several European Union (EU) Member States, a consistent C stock estimation at EU scale remains problematic. Data are often not directly comparable, different methods have been used to obtain values (e.g. sampling, laboratory analysis) and access may be restricted. Therefore, any evolution of EU policies on C accounting and sequestration may be constrained by a lack of an accurate SOC estimation and the availability of tools to carry out scenario analysis, especially for agricultural soils. In this context, a comprehensive model platform was established at a pan-European scale (EU+Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Norway) using the agro-ecosystem SOC model CENTURY. Almost 164000 combinations of soil-climate-land use were computed, including the main arable crops, orchards and pasture. The model was implemented with the main management practices (e.g. irrigation, mineral and organic fertilization, tillage) derived from official statistics. The model results were tested against inventories from the European Environment and Observation Network (EIONET) and approximately 20000 soil samples from the 2009 LUCAS survey, a monitoring project aiming at producing the first coherent, comprehensive and harmonized top-soil data set of the EU based on harmonized sampling and analytical methods. The CENTURY model estimation of the current 0-30cm SOC stock of agricultural soils was 17.63Gt; the model uncertainty estimation was below 36% in half of the NUTS2 regions considered. The model predicted an overall increase of this pool according to different climate-emission scenarios up to 2100, with C loss in the south and east of the area (involving 30% of the whole simulated agricultural land) compensated by a gain in central and northern regions. Generally, higher soil respiration was offset by higher C input as a consequence of increased CO2 atmospheric concentration and favourable crop growing conditions, especially in northern Europe. Considering the importance of SOC in future EU policies, this platform of simulation appears to be a very promising tool to orient future policymaking decisions.

AB  - The phytosociological researches which intent for studying the performance of weeds and the structure of weed assemblages associated with different crops derives their importance mainly from the adverse effect of weeds on crop productivity. Consequently, it is worth questioning about the ecological preferences of the weed growth in response to three main drivers for weed community structure associated with agronomic, and horticultural crops: crop diversification, crop seasonality, and soil type. A study area was selected comprising farmland of Nile Delta and its adjoining east and west territories, Egypt. A total of 555 species were recorded in 30 agroecosystems monitored and depending on species frequency/ abundance values, 150 species were designated as the most influential weeds in weed community structure associated with agronomic and horticultural crops. The ecological preference of species for crop seasonality was evident through the results of Agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Three weed assemblage groups (WAG) identified: WAG A associated with winter agronomic crops, WAG B associated with summer agronomic crops, and WAG C associated with perennial agronomic crops and horticultural crops (orchards). Their diversity evaluated at different levels. The growth preference of the 150 species which were assigned as most influential weeds was gauged in response to the three environmental variables. 61 species were faithful to WAG A, 45 to WAG B, and 44 to WAG C. Concerning crop diversification, 34-species were significantly affected and scored coefficient of variation > 100%. As for soil type, indicator species analysis revealed that 66-species show growth preference in fine grained soil while 84-species prefer coarse grained soil. In the three vegetation units (WAG A - C), 12 within-group associations (alliances) were specified of less-common (differential) species. The record of these alliances match to a specific environmental condition (ecological niche) and in them 29 strong indicators are identified. Redundancy analysis was used to extract and summarize the variation in species records in the response matrix (species vs. sites) that can be explained by the three different types of growth preference (explanatory variables), and the partial linear effect of them was evaluated by variation partitioning.

AB  - At the past 30 years were recorded an intensive practice in the use of fertilizers and pesticides, mainly in the European Mediterranean region, that, in particular cases, exceeded the limits of regular legislations established by the European Union. The widespread use of these chemicals compounds and the pressure over agricultural fields near valuable ecologically coastal areas conducted to the implementation of monitoring plans to the recovering of aquatic ecosystems. Since the 80's Mondego estuary (Figueira da Foz, Portugal) has been harassed by anthropogenic pressures, which triggered the implementation of mitigation monitoring programs at the last 18 years, allowing its recovery. Copper sulphate is used in industrial activities, but also it is much used in pesticides formulations, with application in agricultural activities, namely in rice farms to control pests. Studies reported that copper may affect biochemical processes, such lipid metabolism of some organisms, although specific changes in fatty acid (FA) profiles are still unknown. Nowadays, bivalve species are used in ecotoxicological bioassays due some particular characteristics, such as the wide distribution, ecological relevance, the capacity to filter and ingest large volumes of sediment particles and water and ease handling in the field and in the laboratory. Therefore, this work aims to determine toxic effects and changes in fatty acids profile composition of the two marine bivalve species Cerastoderma edule and Scrobicularia piano when exposed to copper sulphate, considering small (medium body size = 1.97 cm and 3.47 cm, respectively) and big (medium body size = 2.45 cm and 4.20 cm, respectively) size classes. In a first phase organisms were exposed under laboratorial conditions to copper sulphate to determine lethal concentration; at a second phase, it was compared the FA profile and the nutritive quality of both species and size classes at the field and in the lab. Our results state C. edule is more sensitive to copper sulphate (LC50 = 0.818 (0.595-0.987) mg/L; 1.129 (0.968-1.289) mg/L, to big and small organisms, respectively) than S. plana (LC50 = 2.563 (2.229-2.903) mg/L; 4.705 (3.540-12.292) mg/L, to big and small organisms, respectively). Furthermore the last one presents greater abundance and variety of FA and essential fatty acids (EFA), namely DHA and EPA, rates than C. edule. Still, big size class of both bivalve species is the most affected by the contaminant.

AB  - Some modified ribonucleosides in biological fluids have been evaluated as cancer-related metabolites. Detection of endogenous modified ribonucleosides in biological fluids may serve as a noninvasive cancers diagnostic method: However, determination of modified ribonucleosides is still challenging because of their low abundance and serious Matrix interferences in biological fluids. Here) we developed a novel strategy for comprehensive, profiling of ribose conjugates from biological fluids using metal oxide-based dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) followed With in vitro stable isotope labeling and double neutral loss scan-mass spectrometry analysis (DSPE-SIL-LC-DNLS-MS). Cerium dioxide (CeO2) was used to selectively recognize and capture ribose conjugates from complex biological samples under basic environment. The enriched ribose conjugates were subsequently labeled with a pair of isotope labeling reagents (acetone and acetone-d(6)); The glucosidic bond of acetone labeled ribose conjugates is readily ruptured, and the generated ribose that carries an isotope tag can be lost as a neutral fragment under collision induced dissociation (CID). Since the light (acetone) and heavy (acetone-d6) labeled compounds have the same chemical structures and can generate different neutral loss fragments (NL 172 and 178 Da), it is therefore highly convenient to profile ribose conjugates by double neutral loss scan mode in mass spectrometry analysis. In this respect, the light and heavy labeled compounds were ionized at the same condition but recorded separately on MS Spectra, which can significantly improve the detection specificity and facilitate the identification of ribose conjugates. Using the developed DSPE-SIL-LC-DNLS-MS strategy, we profiled the ribose conjugates in human urine, and 49 ribose conjugates were readily identified, among which 7 ribose conjugates exhibited Significant contents,change between healthy controls and lymphoma patients. The DSPE-SIL-LC-DNLS-MS strategy combines the selective enrichment, stable isotope labeling, and double neutral loss scan - MS analysis, which therefore can efficiently minimize false positive results, facilitate the relative quantification, and notably increase the numbers of identified ribose conjugates in biological fluids samples. Taken together, this study established a promising strategy for the effective profiling of urinary Modified ribonucleosides, and simultaneous evaluation of the contents change of multiple modified ribonucleosides should provide more accurate and conclusive results for the use of urinary modified ribonucleosides as indicators of cancers.

AB  - The macrobenthic community was compared at four sites characterized by varying degrees of freshwater input, organic enrichment and confinement in the Cabras lagoon (Sardinia, Italy). Three sites, riverine (Cl), confined (C2) and seaward (C3), were studied on two dates of summer 2010 and on two dates of winter 2011. A fourth site (C12), representative of the central sector of the Cabras lagoon, was included in this study using the extensive historical datasets at our disposal from previously published work. We aimed to test the hypothesis that (1) the benthos is distributed according to the recently proposed concept of habitat saprobity for coastal lagoons that unifies the Pearson Rosenberg (sensu organic enrichment) and Guelorget-Perthuisot (sensu confinement) models, and (2) indicator species of different saprobic levels can be identified among dominant species occurring along the saprobity gradient. Salinity was also considered as an additional agent of selection in brackish environments. Irrespective of significant seasonal changes within each site, our results highlighted major environmental and biotic differences between sites. At the northward riverine site (Cl), most affected by freshwater input and with limited organic matter (OM) enrichment, Corophium orientate was the single dominant species. The most confined site (C2) was characterized by the highest levels of sedimentary OM and benthic Chlorophyll-a and by mesohaline conditions; the site was inhabited mainly by the halolimnobic Hediste diversicolor and Hydrobia spp. Site C12, characterized by a high OM load and high residence time, was dominated by the opportunistic detritivorous Alitta succinea and Polydora ciliata. At the southern-most seaward site (C3) the considerable seawater renewal, resulting in high salinity (only in summer) and limited OM load, favored a much more diverse macrobenthic assemblage, essentially composed of both marine species, such as Corophium insidiosum, Gammarus aequicauda, and brackish-water species, such as Lekanesphaera hookeri and Idotea chelipes. We conclude that the biotic and abiotic characteristics of the Cabras lagoon can be represented by a succession of spatial zones along two main gradients determined by salinity and saprobity. The salinity gradient proved to be the main structural feature in the oligohaline pole, while in the range of variable salinity, saprobity appeared to be the main selection factor. To illustrate our findings, we provide a graphical representation summarizing the changes in environmental parameters and indicator species along the salinity and saprobity gradients.

AB  - Drought is one of the costliest weather related natural hazards in the world. Traditionally, drought has been monitored using drought indices such as the "percent of normal precipitation" to provide policy makers with information on drought extent and severity so that timely intervention measures can be taken. This study was conducted to identify drought indices that strongly correlated with spring wheat yield and quality. Detailed crop and weather data were collected from a series of wheat experiments across Saskatchewan and Manitoba, providing a diverse range of wheat growing environments. The data collected from 2003 to 2006 provided 15 site-years of data, which were used to derive drought indices in four categories: (i) water supply, (ii) water demand, (iii) water balance and (iv) water use. The drought indices were accumulated either over selected periods of the crop growing season including 1-month, 2-month, 3-month and 4-month (May-August) and/or specific wheat growth periods i.e., from planting to anthesis, anthesis to maturity and planting to maturity. Drought indices explained from 27% to 74% (P < 0.05) of the variation in wheat grain yield and four different wheat bread-making quality parameters for two different wheat genotypes (AC Barrie and Superb). The drought index category most highly correlated to the greatest number of wheat characteristics was water demand, followed by water balance, water use and water supply. These results imply that water demand (evapotranspiration, ET) and water balance provide the most accurate assessment of drought impacts on spring wheat yield and quality on the Canadian prairies. Consequently, water demand and water balance indices would be more useful in assessing agricultural drought than the water supply indices frequently used for meteorological drought. The Hargreaves et al. method of estimating ET produced indices with correlation coefficients similar to those of the more complex modified Penman-Monteith method. Drought indices accumulated from planting to anthesis were slightly superior to those accumulated over the entire growing season, but highly superior to those accumulated from anthesis to maturity. Based on these results it would be possible to generate preliminary estimates of drought impacts on spring wheat yield and quality by mid-season with some confidence. This could be very useful in regards to providing policy makers and grain merchants with early warning information to plan and prepare for potential drought conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We estimated the historical range of variability (HRV) of forest landscape structure under natural disturbance regimes at the scale of a physiographic province (Oregon Coast Range, 2 million ha) and evaluated the similarity to HRV of current and future landscapes under alternative management scenarios. We used a stochastic fire simulation model to simulate presettlement landscapes and quantified the HRV of landscape structure using multivariate analysis of landscape metrics. We examined two alternative policy scenarios simulated by two spatially explicit simulation models: (1) current management policies for 100 years into the future and (2) the wildfire scenario with no active management until it reached the HRV.
   The simulation results indicated that historical landscapes of the province were dynamic, composed of patches of various sizes and age classes ranging from 0 to >800 years including numerous, small, unburned forest islands. The current landscape was outside the HRV. The landscape did not return to the HRV in the 100 years under either scenario, largely because of lack of old-growth forests and the abundance of young forests. Under the current policy scenario, development of landscape structure was limited by the spatial arrangement of different ownerships and the highly contrasting management regimes among ownerships. As a result, the vegetation pattern after 100 years reflected the ownership pattern. Surprisingly, the wildfire scenario initially moved the landscape away from the HRV during the first 100 years, after which it moved toward the HRV, but it required many more centuries to reach it. Extensive forest management and human-caused fires in the 20th century have left legacies on the landscape that could take centuries to be obliterated by wildfire.
   Departure from the HRV can serve as an indicator of landscape conditions, but results depend on scale and quantification of landscape heterogeneity. The direct application of the concept of HRV to forest policy and management in large landscapes is often limited since not all ownerships may have ecological goals and future climate change is anticipated. Natural disturbance-based management at large scales would not show the projected effects on landscape structure within a typical policy time frame in highly managed landscapes.

AB  - Nutrient over-enrichment in many areas around the world is having pervasive ecological effects on coastal ecosystems. These effects include reduced dissolved oxygen in aquatic systems and subsequent impacts on living resources. The largest zone of oxygen-depleted coastal waters in the United States, and the entire western Atlantic Ocean, is found in the northern Gulf of Mexico on the Louisiana/Texas continental shelf influenced by the freshwater discharge and nutrient load of the Mississippi River system. The mid-summer bottom areal extent of hypoxic waters (<2 mgl(-1) O-2) in 1985-1992 averaged 8000 to 9000 km(2) but increased to up to 16 000 to 20 700 km(2) in 1993-2001. The Mississippi River system is the dominant source of fresh water and nutrients to the northern Gulf of Mexico. Mississippi River nutrient concentrations and loading to the adjacent continental shelf have changed in the last half of the 20th century. The average annual nitrate concentration doubled, and the mean silicate concentration was reduced by 50%. There is no doubt that the average concentration and flux of nitrogen (per unit volume discharge) increased from the 1950s to 1980s, especially in the spring. There is considerable evidence that nutrient-enhanced primary production in the northern Gulf of Mexico is causally related to the oxygen depletion in the lower water column. Evidence from long-term data sets and the sedimentary record demonstrate that historic increases in riverine dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration and loads over the last 50 years are highly correlated with indicators of increased productivity in the overlying water column, i.e. eutrophication of the continental shelf waters, and subsequent worsening of oxygen stress in the bottom waters. Evidence associates increased coastal ocean productivity and worsening oxygen depletion with changes in landscape use and nutrient management that resulted in nutrient enrichment of receiving waters. A steady-state model, calibrated to different observed summer conditions, was used to assess the response of the system to reductions in nutrient inputs. A reduction in surface layer chlorophyll and an increase in lower layer dissolved oxygen resulted from a reduction of either nitrogen or phosphorus loading, with the response being greater for nitrogen reductions.

AB  - Crop-monitoring by farmer groups has been established to identify agronomic and soil factors limiting crop yields and to promote the adoption of sustainable farming practises in South Australia. The use of earthworms as a potential indicator of sustainability has been investigated with a survey of 95 paddocks sown to wheat, barley or peas, within an area of about 3500 km(2). Mean annual rainfall ranged from less than 350 mm to more than 500 mm, and soils varied from coarse sands through lighter loams to heavy clays.
   The dryland cropping soils in South Australia have been colonized by four immigrant earthworm species, Aporrectodea rosea (Savigny), Aporrectodea trapezoides (Duges), Microscolex dubius (Fletcher) and Micloscolex phosphoreus (Duges); populations are generally dominated by A. rosea. Population differences, such as the higher numbers of A. rosea recorded under barley than peas and more juveniles under peas than wheat, and the occasional abundance of other species in some paddocks may be used to indicate changes in soil conditions associated with management.
   Conservation tillage, retaining plant-residues and reducing cultivation, is being promoted as desirable in developing sustainable farming systems and the inverse relationship between earthworm abundance and intensity of tillage (r= -0.69***) provides support for earthworms as a potential indicator of sustainability. Earthworm abundance showed a small but significant correlation between earthworm activity and grain yields (r = 0.44***) and grain protein content (r = 0.52***). A positive correlation between nitrogen fertilizer levels and earthworm numbers (r = 0.48***) and biomass (r = 0.43***) may be related to increased soil organic matter, derived from increased plant growth.
   The distribution and abundance of earthworms is dependent not only on management related to crop production, but also on local soil and climatic factors. Density and biomass were significantly higher in paddocks with higher annual rainfall and inversely correlated with levels of coarse sand.
   The soils, crops, climate, management and history of a region of the geographic scale surveyed here is probably too diverse to provide simple relationships between earthworms and plant productivity. It is important to distinguish the broad concept of sustainable productivity on a regional basis from the reality of productivity and sustainability on the spatial and temporal scales of activity of the organisms studied and the production and management processes involved. At an appropriate scale, ecological data on both the species composition and on functional groups within earthworm communities, may be useful indicators of crop production and its sustainability.

AB  - Regional Operational Programmes (ROPs) provide an opportunity to achieve the goals of EU policy in 16 voivodships in Poland in terms of economic development, including environmental protection, adjusted to the specificity of particular regions and their local needs. The main aim of the study is to determine whether the municipalities take full advantage of available EU funds for environmental measures, taking into account fields related to water and sewage management, and thus to show a level of effectiveness of the funds management. Another aim is to find out to what extent the pro-environmental measures carried out by municipalities in the current period of EU budgeting, that is, 2014-2020, have influenced a general condition of the natural environment and quality of life of their inhabitants, with special attention given to measures implemented in the Slaskie Voivodeship. Quantitative methods, including classic descriptive statistics and taxonomic methods based on a linear ordering of objects, were used for the research. The effectiveness of EU funds management was examined in a general way as well as within an environmental dimension through the result and product indicators for the European Regional Development Fund, broken down into categories by regions. The obtained values of the indicators at the current stage of the conducted analysis are not satisfactory, and that indicates a low level of effectiveness of management and illustrates the fact that much more remains to be done to improve the state-of-art. The next period of EU budgeting is focused primarily on supporting the transition of the Polish economy to a green and low-carbon model. Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources will be more important areas in this respect. That is why it is so important to observe how many municipalities are already active and carries out environmental activities, including investments in the area of water and sewage management, and how many and which ones are not, thus showing their effectiveness or ineffectiveness in the process. From the point of view of a foreign reader, the publication gives a picture of mechanisms introduced in the field of water and sewage management and effects of the EU financial contributions in municipalities of one of the new EU member states that until then had a leadership position in implementation of the cohesion policy.

AB  - Coliform detection in finished products, including cheese, has traditionally been used to indicate whether a given product has been manufactured under unsanitary conditions. As our understanding of the diversity of coliforms has improved, it is necessary to assess whether coliforms are a good indicator organism and whether coliform detection in cheese is associated with the presence of pathogens. The objective of this study was (1) to evaluate cheese available on the market for presence of coliforms and key pathogens, and (2) to characterize the coliforms present to assess their likely sources and public health relevance. A total of 273 cheese samples were tested for presence of coliforms and for Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and other Listeria species. Among all tested cheese samples, 27% (75/273) tested positive for coliforms in concentrations > 10 cfu/g. Pasteurization, pH, water activity, milk type, and rind type were factors significantly associated with detection of coliforms in cheese; for example, a higher coliform prevalence was detected in raw milk cheeses (42% with > 10 cfu/g) compared with pasteurized milk cheese (21%). For cheese samples contaminated with coliforms, only water activity was significantly associated with coliform concentration. Coliforms isolated from cheese samples were classified into 13 different genera, including the environmental coliform genera Hafnia, Raoultella, and Serratia, which represent the 3 genera most frequently isolated across all cheeses. Escherichia, Hafnia, and Enterobacter were significantly more common among raw milk cheeses. Based on sequencing of the housekeeping gene clpX, most Escherichia isolates were confirmed as members of fecal commensal clades of E. coli. All cheese samples tested negative for Salmonella, Staph. aureus, and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Listeria spp. were found in 12 cheese samples, including 5 samples positive for L. monocytogenes. Although no association was found between coliform and Listeria spp. detection, Listeria spp. were significantly more likely to be detected in cheese with the washed type of rind. Our data provide information on specific risk factors for pathogen detection in cheese, which will facilitate development of risk-based strategies to control microbial food safety hazards in cheese, and suggest that generic coliform testing cannot be used to assess the safety of natural cheese.

AB  - Photoperiodic manipulation has dramatic physiological and production effects in dairy cows. During lactation, exposure to long day photoperiod (LDPP) increases milk yield and circulating IGF-I and prolactin (PRL) concentrations. Conversely, cows housed under a short day photoperiod (SDPP) during the dry period produce more milk in the subsequent lactation than cows exposed to LDPP or natural photoperiod. Exposure to SDPP depresses PRL secretion but increases PRL receptor mRNA levels in mammary, immune, and hepatic tissues. In dry cows under SDPP, PRL signaling is a potential mechanism to drive more extensive mammary cell differentiation and growth relative to LDPP. In mammary biopsies taken during the dry period and into lactation, the amount of IGF-II mRNA was greater in SDPP vs. LDPP cows during the dry period, whereas IGFBP-5 mRNA increased in both groups during lactation even though photoperiodic treatments ended at parturition and all cows were on an ambient lighting schedule when lactating. Levels of IGF-I mRNA did not differ over time or between treatments; however, during the dry period, lower IGFBP-5 and increased IGF-II expression in SDPP cows may enhance mammary cell growth and survival. Key among the potential modulators of PRL signaling is the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family. Mammary transcription of mRNA for SOCS proteins was low during the dry period but increased in lactation. During the dry period, SOCS mRNA level in the mammary gland of cows on SDPP was reduced compared with cows on LDPP, which may enhance PRL-induced proliferation and subsequent milk production. However, improved mammary capacity and immune function alone are likely insufficient to support increased milk yield. Using improved milk yield as a functional indicator of greater animal well-being during the transition, it is clear that some metabolic accommodation is necessary for expression of that capacity. Emerging evidence supports a link between PRL signaling and hepatic lipid metabolism, with decreases in PRL being beneficial to lipid metabolism. Extending that concept to broad environmental responses, it can be speculated that altered PRL signaling impairs lipid metabolism, mammary growth, and immune function under conditions of stress (e. g., heat stress) also. Thus, shifts in gene expression related to PRL signaling may provide an environmentally mediated mechanism to alter production and health in cows as they transition into lactation.

AB  - In this study, energy, exergy, and sustainability analyses are performed for the PW4056 engine to observe the different fuel effects on the thermodynamic performance of a turbofan engine. For this purpose, energy and exergy analyses are performed at the same dead state conditions, and then sustainability analyses are conducted for kerosene and hydrogen-powered engine and its main components. Also, nineteen thermodynamic performance metrics are adapted for the purpose of the study and used to compare the fuel performances. It is found that the fuel mass flow of the hydrogen fuel (1.03 kg/s) is lower than the kerosene fuel (2.85 kg/s), the exhaust gases mass flow of the hydrogen fuel (117.14 kg/s) is lower than the kerosene fuel (118.96 kg/s). The minimum exergy efficient component is determined as the combustion chamber in both cases, which are 64.24 % for kerosene case and 58.20 % for hydrogen case. The lowest relative exergy loss ratio is calculated to be 28.28 % for Fan outlet loss for hydrogen case, while the maximum relative exergy consumption ratio is calculated to be 51.93 % for combustion chamber for hydrogen case. The maximum productivity lack ratio is computed as 161.65 % for combustion chamber for hydrogen case, whereas the minimum relative fuel exergy waste ratio is computed as 0.02 % for high pressure turbine for hydrogen case, The highest exergetic improvement potential rate is obtained to be 24231.48 kW for combustion chamber for hydrogen case, while the lowest product ratio indicator is found to be 17.03 % for low pressure compressor for kerosene case. Furthermore, the minimum exergetic sustainability index is obtained to be 1.39 for the combustion chamber for the hydrogen case, whereas the maximum environmental effect factor is obtained to be 0.72 for combustion chamber for hydrogen case. On the other hand, with the usage of hydrogen fuel; it is observed that the exergy efficiency of the overall engine decreases from 26.9 % to 24.3 %, the ecological effect factor of the overall engine goes up from 3.712 to 4.113, the exergetic sustainability index of the overall engine rises from 0.321 to 0.369, and the waste exergy cost flow of the overall engine increases from 17.41 x 10-3 US$/kW to 19.09 x 10-3 US$/kW.

AB  - Background: Commercial shipping is identified as a major source of anthropogenic underwater noise in several ecologically sensitive areas. Any development project likely to increase marine traffic can thus be required to assess environmental impacts of underwater noise. Therefore, project holders are increasingly engaging in underwater noise modeling relying on ships' underwater noise source levels published in the literature. However, a lack of apparent consensus emerges from the scientific literature as discrepancies up to 30 dB are reported for ships' broadband source levels belonging to the same vessel class and operating under similar conditions. We present a statistical meta-analysis of individual ships' broadband source levels available in the literature so far to identify which factors likely explain these discrepancies.
   Methods: We collated ships' source levels from the published literature to construct our dataset. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model was applied to the dataset to statistically assess the contribution of intrinsic (i.e., related to ships' static and dynamic attributes) and extrinsic factors (i.e., related to both the protocol for hydroacoustic data acquisition and the noise data reduction procedure) to the reported broadband source levels.
   Results: Amongst intrinsic factors, ships' speed-over-ground (15.39 dB x log(10) [v/1 knot], p-value < 0.001), ships' width (12.03 dB x log(10) [b/1 m]; p-value < 0.001), and ships' class (-6.07 to 2.08 dB; p-value is an element of [< 0.001 to 0.036]) have shown the strongest correlations with broadband source levels. The hydrophone-to-source closest point of approach (-4.83 dB x [CPA/1 nmi]; p-value < 0.001) and the correction for surface-image reflections (21.73 dB; p-value = 0.002) contribute the most to explain the reported ships' broadband source levels' variability amongst extrinsic factors.
   Conclusions: Our meta-analysis confirms a consensus that speed regulation can effectively reduce instantaneous ships' source levels. Neglecting Lloyd's mirror effects through the abuse of non-corrected spreading laws for propagation loss directly leads to a generalized under-estimation of the ships' source levels retrieved from the literature. This could eventually be addressed by a wider adoption of standardized methods of hydrophone-based sound recordings and of data processing to homogenize results and facilitate their interpretation to conduct environmental impact assessment.

AB  - Soil beneath a stormwater infiltration basin receiving runoff from a 23 ha predominantly residential watershed in north-central Florida, USA, was amended using biosorption activated media (BAM) to study the effectiveness of this technology in reducing inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus to groundwater. The functionalized soil amendment BAM consists of a 1.0:1.9:4.1 mixture (by volume) of tire crumb (to increase sorption capacity), silt and clay (to increase soil moisture retention), and sand (to promote sufficient infiltration), which was applied to develop an innovative stormwater infiltration basin utilizing nutrient reduction and flood control sub-basins. Comparison of nitrate/chloride (NO3-/Cl-) ratios for the shallow groundwater indicates that prior to using BAM, NO3- concentrations were substantially influenced by nitrification or variations in NO3- input. In contrast, for the new basin utilizing BAM, NO3-/Cl- ratios indicate minor nitrification and NO3- losses with the exception of one summer sample that indicated a 45% loss. Biogeochemical indicators (denitrifier activity derived from real-time polymerase chain reaction and variations in major ions, nutrients, dissolved and soil gases, and stable isotopes) suggest that NO3- losses are primarily attributable to denitrification, whereas dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium is a minor process. Denitrification was likely occurring intermittently in anoxic microsites in the unsaturated zone, which was enhanced by the increased soil moisture within the BAM layer and resultant reductions in surface/subsurface oxygen exchange that produced conditions conducive to increased denitrifier activity. Concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus and orthophosphate (PO43-) were reduced by more than 70% in unsaturated zone soil water, with the largest decreases in the BAM layer where sorption was the most likely mechanism for removal. Post-BAM PO43-/Cl- ratios for shallow groundwater indicate predominantly minor increases and decreases in PO43- with the exception of one summer sample that indicated a 50% loss. Differences in nutrient variations between the unsaturated zone and shallow groundwater may be the result of the intensity and duration of nutrient removal processes and mixing ratios with water that had undergone little biogeochemical transformation. Observed nitrogen and phosphorus losses demonstrate the potential, as well as the future research needs to improve performance, of the innovative stormwater infiltration basin using BAM for providing passive, economical, stormwater nutrient-treatment technology to support green infrastructure.

AB  - Utilization of marginal land for growing dedicated bioenergy crops for second-generation biofuels is appealing to avoid conflicts with food production. This study develops a novel framework to quantify marginal land for the Contiguous United States (CONUS) based on a history of satellite-observed land use change (LUC) over the 2008-2015 period. Frequent LUC between crop and noncrop is assumed to be an indicator of economically marginal land; this land is also likely to have a lower opportunity cost of conversion from food crop to bioenergy crop production. We first present an approach to identify cropland in transition using the time series of Cropland Data Layer (CDL) land cover product and determine the amount of land that can be considered marginal with a high degree of confidence vs with uncertainty across the CONUS. We find that the biophysical characteristics of this land and its productivity and environmental vulnerability vary across the land and lie in between that of permanent cropland and permanent natural vegetation/bare areas; this land also has relatively low intrinsic value and agricultural profit but a high financial burden and economic risk. We find that the total area of marginal land with confidence vs with uncertainty is 10.2 and 58.4 million hectares, respectively, and mainly located along the 100th meridian. Only a portion of this marginal land (1.4-2.2 million hectares with confidence and 14.8-19.4 million hectares with uncertainty) is in the rainfed region and not in crop production and, thus, suitable for producing energy crops without diverting land from food crops in 2016. These estimates are much smaller than the estimates obtained by previous studies, which consider all biophysically low-quality land to be marginal without considering economical marginality. The estimate of marginal land for bioenergy crops obtained in this study is an indicator of the availability of economically marginal land that is suitable for bioenergy crop production; whether this land is actually converted to bioenergy crops will depend on the market conditions. We note the inability to conduct field-level validation of cropland in transition and leave it to future advances in technology to ground-truth land use change and its relationship to economically marginal land.

AB  - The use of energy is a precondition for global economic and civilisational development. However, the growing demand for energy is depleting traditional energy resources and, most importantly, causing environmental pollution, mainly through the emission of greenhouse gases. As energy is necessary for the functioning of all sectors of the economy, such as industry, services, transport as well as households, these sectors are the largest contributors to energy consumption. Renewable energy sources are an alternative to generating energy from conventional fossil fuels. The main objective of this paper was to determine and compare the level, trends and variation in energy consumption by different economic sectors in countries of the European Union in 2010-2019. An analysis of the share of renewable energy consumption in different economic sectors was also carried out, as well as an assessment of the relationship of these indicators with the level of economic development of the countries and environmental impacts in the form of greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption. To explore the topics under discussion, a dozen of indicators have been considered in the article. The source of empirical data collected was the European Statistical Office. The researched period covered the years 2010-2019. The empirical data was statistically analysed. The article considers changes in the values of the studied indicators, differentiation between countries and the results of correlation and regression analysis. As shown by the data from 2010-2019, the countries of the European Union vary significantly in respect of primary and final energy consumption. The highest final energy consumption occurs in the transport sector, followed by slightly lower consumption in the industrial sector and households sector and the lowest but also significant consumption in the commercial and public services sector. Since 2010, total primary and final energy consumption has decreased in the EU (27) countries. Total energy consumption and consumption by individual sectors in modern economies of the EU (27) countries are reflected on the one hand in economic development and on the other-in exacerbation of adverse climate changes. Therefore, all EU Member States, aware of their energy consumption and their own contribution to environmental pollution, should take effective and sustainable corrective action in this area as soon as possible.

AB  - 1. For rocky intertidal species that experience changes in a number of potential stressors seasonally and during the tidal cycle, sensing cellular energy status and modulating it adaptively may be crucial for responding to stressor effects. However, the responses of energy metabolism of intertidal species to multiple sublethal stressors are still unclear.
   2. Here, we examined gene expression profiles of biomarkers related to sensing of cellular energy status and regulation of catabolism and energy expenditure in a mid-intertidal limpet Cellana toreuma for elucidating the species' cellular energy responses stresses from high temperature, desiccation and rainfall.
   3. Expression levels of genes encoding metabolic regulators [two subunits of AMP-activated protein kinase, ampk alpha, ampk beta; Fu gene inhibition axis formation, axin; two sirtuins, NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (sirt1); NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-5 (sirt5)], metabolic enzymes (hexokinase, hk; pyruvate kinase, pk; isocitrate dehydrogenase, idh) and heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) were quantified in specimens exposed to different temperatures and aerial/freshwater spray conditions.
   4. Based on the gene expression patterns, all individuals could be divided into three groups with divergent cellular energy status, indicating that the selected target genes are appropriate indicators of cellular metabolism. The divergent gene expression patterns indicated a sequence in which individuals from group 1, group 2 and group 3 were faced with increasing energy stress.
   5. The frequency distributions of individuals in the three groups were different among different time points and treatments, indicating that high temperature, desiccation, and rainfall, singly or in combination, could cause energy stress.
   6. Compared to the high percentage (100%) of individuals placed in the highest-stress group (group 3), after 2 h of freshwater spray at 18 degrees C, the lower percentage (77.8%) of individuals in group 3 after 2 h of freshwater spray at 30 degrees C indicated the existence of interactive effects of high temperature and rain; high temperature resulted in a lower response of cellular energy metabolism to rainfall.
   7. Sublethal environmental stresses from single stressors such as temperature or osmotic challenges can lead to cellular energy stress. Interactions among stressors may lead to a complex overall effect on cellular energy status in intertidal species.

AB  - 103 surface sediment samples in 71 water bodies, such as lakes with different salinity, swamps, shallow puddles and rivers on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), were collected to study the ecological distribution of living ostracods and their environmental implications. Total of 12 genus and 45 species living ostracods are identified. According to the frequencies and abundance of ostracods occurrence, Limnocythere dubiosa, Limnocytherellina kunlunensis, Ilyocypris bradyi, Condona candida, Eucypris rischtanica and Leucocythere dilatata are the common species on the QTP, with occurrence frequency of more than 8 and abundance of more than 570 in the 71 water bodies. Among them, L. dubiosa, occurring in 28 water bodies with 2177 shells, is the most widely distributed ostracod in this research. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicates high correlation between species and environmental variables, suggesting that the occurrence of species is strongly related to the changes in ecological conditions of habitats. Among eight environmental factors, salinity and pH value are the most affective variables that influence the species occurrence. L. kunlunensis is positively correlated with salinity while E. rischtanica is negatively correlated with salinity. C. candida has a positive correlation with salinity, as does I. bradyi although there is not such a strong correlation. L. dubiosa displays a positive correlation with pH value. Consequently, we discuss the environmental implications of the common living ostracods on the QTP based on the CCA as well as the distribution of ostracod species in different salinity and pH values water. L. dubiosa, L. kunlunensis and E. rischtanica are euryhaline species, among which, L. dubiosa is the most adaptable species on the QTP with large occurrence in sundry salinity water and the most widely adaptive range for pH values. L. kunlunensis prefers to saline water while E. rischtanica prefers to fresh water. Both L. kunlunensis and E. rischtanica can live in water from faintly acid to alkaline, in contrast, L. dubiosa only appears in neutral and alkaline water bodies. I. bradyi only occurs in fresh water and oligohaline water with a large pH tolerance range tolerance range from weakly acidic water to alkaline water weakly acidic water to alkaline water. C. Candida lives in freshwater, with pH value above eight. The six common species reach maximum abundance in alkaline water (pH 8-10) except for Ilyocypris bradyi.

AB  - The disposal at sea of liquid waste from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at La Hague (CEA/Cogema) causes modifications to the radioactivity of marine waters in both space and time. Fluctuations in this radioactivity are controlled by many different parameters; to study these parameters, samples were taken, in particular, from a coastal site situated 5 km from the outlet pipe.
   The overall impact of these releases on the radioactivity of sea-water depends on various factors, including the amount and frequency of discharges, the hydrodynamic regime of water masses in the region and local meteorological conditions. In order to assess this impact, use is made of numerous samples collected over the period 1985-1989. The radioactivity of these waters is expressed in terms of the activity level (in Bq.1-1) normalized to a standard release rate of 1 Bq per day.
   This overall value may be considered as a satisfactory indicator of the degree of effluent dispersal as well as the general quality of the environment. However, it is not always strictly applicable to the radioecological interpretation of phenomena which occur at a given moment in time.
   The present study shows that the effect of discharges on sea-water radioactivity may manifest itself on several time-scales. Two different stages are identified here; the first is short-term in nature (of the order of two weeks after release into the environment), whereas the second is clearly delayed and associated with movements of water masses occurring over an extended period.
   The impact observed on the short term (< 10(-13) Bq.1-1 per Bq day-1 discharges) is in close agreement with the forecasts made on the basis of tracer-dye studies before the construction of the plant. By contrast, the long-term impact may tum out to be greater than predicted; this effect is even more pronounced when the radionuclide under consideration has a long half-life (e. g. 4 x 10(-13) Bq.1-1 per Bq day-1 of Cs-137 discharged; half-life: thirty years).
   In order better to understand the mechanisms controlling the delayed environmental impact, it is necessary to establish the role of the different parameters involved, particularly the long-term recycling of water masses. An approach is proposed here with the object of drawing up a plan to conduct the required research.

AB  - Context. According to the current trend of biodiversity loss, information on population trends at large temporal and spatial scales is necessary. However, well documented animal population dynamics are generally based on intensive protocols requiring animal manipulation, which can be impossible to conduct in species for which conservation is a concern.
   Aims. For many bat species, an alternative approach entails performing an appropriate analysis of counts in roost cavities. Because of managers' perception of chaotic variations through time, relatively few count monitoring surveys are regularly analysed. Here, we present the analysis of a twenty-two-year survey of a large hibernaculum of pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) located in a railway tunnel in Paris, France.
   Methods. We propose that using combinations of population-dynamics modelling using demographic parameters from the literature and statistical analyses helps with identifying the biological and methodological effects underlying the dynamics observed in census analyses.
   Key results. We determined that some of the observed year-to-year variations of population size cannot be explained only by the intrinsic dynamics of the population. In particular, in 1993-94, the population size increased by >40%, which should have implied a massive immigration. This change coincided with the end of the operation of the railway line. After consideration of a drastic trend of population decline (7% year(-1)), we were able to detect this event and several environmental effects. Specifically, the winter conditions and the temperature in July affected the colony size, presumably because of aggregative behaviour and reproduction success, respectively.
   Conclusions. Emigration-immigration processes might have preponderant effects on population dynamics. In addition, our analysis demonstrated that (1) the study population suffered a large decline, (2) a combination of human disturbance and meteorological variation explains these dynamics and (3) emigration-immigration processes have preponderant effects on the population dynamics.
   Implications. To conduct a meaningful analysis of non-standard time series and provide a source of data for implementing biodiversity indicators, it is necessary to include (1) the local knowledge of the people involved in the field surveys in these analyses (the existence of disturbances and site protections) and (2) meteorological information for the appropriate seasons of the year.

AB  - Monitoring changes in land cover and the subsequent environmental responses are essential for water quality assessment, natural resource planning, management, and policies. Over the last 75 years, the Lake Issaqueena watershed has experienced a drastic shift in land use. This study was conducted to examine the changes in land cover and the implied changes in land use that have occurred and their environmental, water quality impacts. Aerial photography of the watershed (1951, 1956, 1968, 1977, 1989, 1999, 2005, 2006, and 2009) was analyzed and classified using the geographic information system (GIS) software. Seven land cover classes were defined: evergreen, deciduous, bare ground, pasture/grassland, cultivated, and residential/other development. Water quality data, including sampling depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, fecal coliform levels, inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and turbidity, were obtained from the South Carolina (SC) Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) for two stations and analyzed for trends as they relate to land cover change. From 1951 to 2009, the watershed experienced an increase of tree cover and bare ground (+17.4 % evergreen, +62.3 % deciduous, +9.8 % bare ground) and a decrease of pasture/grassland and cultivated land (-42.6 % pasture/grassland and -57.1 % cultivated). From 2005 to 2009, there was an increase of 21.5 % in residential/other development. Sampling depth ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 m. Water temperature fluctuated corresponding to changing air temperatures, and dissolved oxygen content fluctuated as a factor of water temperature. Inorganic nitrogen content was higher from December to April possibly due to application of fertilizers prior to the growing season. Turbidity and fecal coliform bacteria levels remained relatively the same from 1962 to 2005, but a slight decline in pH can be observed at both stations. Prior to 1938, the area consisted of single-crop cotton farms; after 1938, the farms were abandoned, leaving large bare areas with highly eroded soil. Starting in 1938, Clemson reforested almost 30 % of the watershed. Currently, three fourths of the watershed is forestland, with a limited coverage of small farms and residential developments. Monitoring water quality is essential in maintaining adequate freshwater supply. Water quality monitoring focuses mainly on the collection of field data, but current water quality conditions depend on the cumulative impacts of land cover change over time.

AB  - The aim of this work is to compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from producing tissue paper from virgin pulp (VP) or recycled waste paper (RWP). In doing so, the study aims to inform decision makers at both company and national levels which are the main causes of emissions and to suggest the actions required to reduce pollution.
   An attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed in order to estimate and compare the GHG emissions of the two processes. LCA allows us to assess how the choice of raw material for VP and RWP processes influences total GHG emissions of tissue paper production, what are the main drivers behind these emissions and how do the direct materials; energy requirements and transportation contribute to the generation of emissions. The cradle-to-gate approach is carried out.
   The results show that demands for both thermal energy and electricity are higher for the RWP than for the VP if only the manufacturing stages are considered. However, a different picture emerges when the analysis looks at the entire life cycle of the production. GHG from the VP are about 30 % higher than the RWP, over the life cycle emitting 568 kg CO2 eq more per kilogram of tissue paper. GHG emissions from the wood pulping alone were 559 g CO2 eq per kilogram of tissue paper, three times higher than waste paper collection and transportation.
   In terms of GHG emissions from cradle to gate, the recycled process less intensive than the virgin one for two reasons. First, as shown in the results the total GHG emissions from RWP are lower than those from VP due to relatively lower energy and material requirements. Second is the non-recyclability nature of tissue paper. Because the tissue paper is the last use of fibre, using RWP as an input would be preferable over using VP. The environmental profile of the tissue products both from RWP and VP can be improved if the following conditions are considered by the company. First, the company should consider implementing a cogeneration unit to simultaneously generate both useful heat and electricity. Second, it may consider changing the VP mix, in order to avoid the emissions associated with long distance transpiration effort. Third, there is the option of using sludge as fuel, which would reduce the total fossil fuel requirement.

AB  - We Propose using future vascular plant abundances as indicators of future climate in away analogous to the reconstruction of past environments by many palaeoccologists. To begin monitoring future short-term climate changes in the forests of Oregon and Washington, USA, we developed a set of transfer functions for a present-day calibration set consisting of climate parameters estimated, and species abundances Measured, at 107 USDA Forest Service FIA (Forest Inventory and Analysis) Phase 3 plots. For each plot, we derived climate estimates from the Daymet model database, and We Computed species abundance as quadrat frequency and subplot frequency. We Submitted three climate variables (mean January temperature, MJAT; mean July temperature, MJUT; and mean annual precipitation transformed to natural logarithms, MANPt) to canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), and verified their importances in structuring the species frequency data. Weighted averaging-partial least squares regression (WA-PLS) provided the means for calculating six transfer functions. In all cases, based oil performance statistics generated by leave-one-out cross-validation, we identified two-component WA-PLS models as the most desirable. The predictive abilities of our transfer functions are comparable to, or better than, those reported in the literature, probably due both data quality and statistical considerations. However, model overfitting as a result of spatial autocorrelation remains a possibility, The large errors associated With Our MJAT transfer functions connote that even the highest amount of change in mean January temperature predicted for Oregon and Washington for 2010-2039 would be indistinguishable from Current conditions. The higher predictions indicate that our MJAT transfer functions may be able to track climate changes by the 2040s. Our MJUT transfer functions can detect change in mean July temperature under the highest projection for 2010-2039. Our MANPt transfer functions will be of limited use until the 2070s, given the predictions of only slight changes in mean annual precipitation during the early part of the twenty-first century. Our MJAT and MANPt transfer functions may prove useful at the present time to verify relative climatic stability. Because the predicted climate values sometimes deviate Substantially from the observed values for individual Plots, our transfer functions are appropriate for monitoring climatic trends over the entire Pacific Northwest or large regions within it, not for assessing climate change at individual plots, (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities and greater demands for marine natural resources has led to increases in the spatial extent and duration of pressures onmarine ecosystems. Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) offer a robust survey tool for quantifying these pressures and tracking the success of management intervention while at a range of depths, including those inaccessible to most SCUBA diver-based survey methods (similar to>30 m). As the strengths, limitations, and biases of ROVs for visually monitoring fish assemblages remain unclear, this review aims to evaluate ROVs as a survey technique and to suggest optimal sampling strategies for use in typical ROV-based studies. Using the search engines Scopus (TM) and Google Scholar (TM), 119 publications were identified that used ROVs for visual surveys of fish assemblages. While the sampling strategies and sampling metrics used to annotate the imagery in these publications varied considerably, the total abundance of fish recorded over strip transects of varying dimensions was the most common sampling design. The choice of ROV system appears to be a strong indicator of both the types of surveys available to studies and the success of ROV deployments. For instance, larger, more powerful working-class systems can complete longer and more complex designs (e.g., swath, cloverleaf, and polygonal transects) at greater depths, whereas observation-class systems are less expensive and easier to deploy, but are more susceptible to delays or cancelations of deployments. In more severe sea state conditions, radial transects, or strip transects that employ live-boating or a weight to anchor the tether to the seafloor, can be used to improve the performance of observation-class systems. As these systems often employ shorter tethers, radial transects can also be used to maximize sampling area at greater depths and on large vessels that may rotate substantially while anchored. For highly mobile species, and in survey designs where individuals are likely to be recounted (e.g., transects along oil and gas pipelines), relative abundance (MaxN) may be a more robust sampling metric. By identifying subtle, yet important, differences in the application of ROVs as a tool for visually surveying deep-water marine ecosystems, we identified key areas for improvement for best practice for future studies.

AB  - In the European context, energy and climate have been prioritized by policies related to retrofitting, but social concerns such as unemployment or poverty need to be tackled. Policy makers need supporting assessment methods to comprehensively address complex processes as retrofitting, and the methodology of life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) seems an appropriate tool. However, LCSA needs further adaptation for the intended application. The objective of this work is to define socioeconomic models that, added to environmental life cycle assessment, enable LCSA. The intended application is guiding policy making related to retrofitting from a life cycle perspective.
   This study defines models to assess social and socioeconomic impacts similarly to environmental life cycle assessment. These models address social and socioeconomic concerns, relevant in housing retrofitting processes, for which a cause-effect relationship can be established. Characterization models result from the identification, combination, and adaptation of available methods, developed within various research fields. These methods analyze damages to the health of workers involved in the life cycle and to the health of the household living in the retrofitted dwelling. Impacts on human well-being and dignity are addressed by analyzing prosperity, in terms of fair employment, alleviation of fuel poverty of households, and economic growth.
   With the proposed LCSA methods, we have compared impacts associated to the retrofitting of a house in Brussels in two scenarios, considering a remaining life cycle of 30 years and taking into account the reference situation. Environmental damages significantly decrease in one of the scenarios, but slightly increase for households that commonly under-heat. Retrofitting prevents indoor mold and associated damages on health but implies damages on the health of workers. Fair working hours involved in the life cycle have been quantified as well as the effects on the households regarding fuel poverty. The effects on the economic growth have also been studied to provide insights for the optimization of encouraging measures.
   This LCSA proposal consists of a set of socioeconomic characterization models coupled with selected environmental ones. The models have been defined adapted to the particular application, given the context-specific nature of some of the social concerns, indicators, and characterization factors. This LCSA proposal helps adapting policies to housing typologies, household and dwelling conditions, as well as identifying potential improvements in the life cycle.

AB  - The Larval Amphibian Growth and Development Assay (LAGDA) is a globally harmonized chemical testing guideline developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in collaboration with Japan's Ministry of Environment to support risk assessment. The assay is employed as a higher tiered approach to evaluate effects of chronic chemical exposure throughout multiple life stages in a model amphibian species, Xenopus laevis. To evaluate the utility of the initial LAGDA design, the assay was performed using a mixed mode of action endocrine disrupting chemical, benzophenone-2 (BP-2). X. laevis embryos were exposed in flow-through conditions to 0, 1.5, 3.0 or 6.0 mg l(-1) BP-2 until 2 months post-metamorphosis. Overt toxicity was evident throughout the exposure period in the 6.0 mg l(-1) treatment due to elevated mortality rates and observed liver and kidney pathologies. Concentration-dependent increases in severity of thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia occurred in larval tadpoles indicating BP-2-induced impacts on the thyroid axis. Additionally, gonads were impacted in all treatments with some genetic males showing both testis and ovary tissues (1.5 mg l(-1)) and 100% of the genetic males in the 3.0 and 6.0 mg l(-1) treatments experiencing complete male-to-female sex reversal. Concentration-dependent vitellogenin induction occurred in both genders with associated accumulations of protein in the livers, kidneys and gonads, which was likely vitellogenin and other estrogen-responsive yolk proteins. This is the first study that demonstrates the endocrine effects of this mixed mode of action chemical in an amphibian species and demonstrates the utility of the LAGDA design for supporting chemical risk assessment.

   The Larval Amphibian Growth and Development Assay (LAGDA) is a globally harmonized chemical testing guideline used to generate apical effect data for ecological risk assessment. Benzophenone-2 (BP-2) was tested using the LAGDA by exposing Xenopus laevis embryos until two months post-metamorphosis. BP-2 caused thyroid gland pathology in larvae. Liver and kidney pathologies were present in exposed juveniles, likely due to accumulations of estrogen-responsive yolk proteins. All genetic males int the 3.0 and 6.0 mg l(-1) treatments were sex-reversed phenotypic females.

AB  - An integral understanding of forest biodiversity requires the exploration of the many aspects it comprises and of the numerous potential determinants of their distribution. The landscape ecological approach provides a necessary complement to conventional local studies that focus on individual plots or forest ownerships. However, most previous landscape studies used equally-sized cells as units of analysis to identify the factors affecting forest biodiversity distribution. Stratification of the analysis by habitats with a relatively homogeneous forest composition might be more adequate to capture the underlying patterns associated to the formation and development of a particular ensemble of interacting forest species. Here we used a landscape perspective in order to improve our understanding on the influence of large-scale explanatory factors on forest biodiversity indicators in Spanish habitats, covering a wide latitudinal and altitudinal range. We considered six forest biodiversity indicators estimated from more than 30,000 field plots in the Spanish national forest inventory, distributed in 213 forest habitats over 16 Spanish provinces. We explored biodiversity response to various environmental (climate and topography) and land;cape configuration (fragmentation and shape complexity) variables through multiple linear regression models (built and assessed through the Akaike Information. Criterion). In particular, we took into account the inherent model uncertainty when dealing with a complex and large set of variables, and considered different plausible models and their probability of being the best candidate for the observed data. Our results showed that compositional indicators (species richness and diversity) were mostly explained by environmental factors. Models for structural indicators (standing deadwood and stand complexity) had the worst fits and selection uncertainties, but did show significant associations with some configuration metrics. In general, biodiversity increased in habitats covering wider topographic ranges and comprising forest patches with more complex shapes. Patterns in other relationships varied between indicators (e.g. species richness vs. diversity), or even were opposed (trees vs. shrubs). Our study (1) allowed deepening the understanding of biodiversity patterns in a large set of Spanish forest habitats. and (2) highlighted the increasing complexity of identifying common landscape conditions favouring forest biodiversity as the range of analysed biodiversity aspects is widened beyond the more commonly assessed species richness indicators.

AB  - The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter are requiring urban nonattainment areas to implement pollution-reduction strategies for anthropogenic source emissions. A type of fuel shown to decrease combustion emissions components versus traditional diesel fuels is the diesel-water emulsion. The Lubrizol Corporation in conjunction with Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute and several subcontracting laboratories recently conducted a rodent health assessment of inhaled combustion emissions of PuriNO(x) diesel fuel emulsion. Combustion emissions from either of two 2001 model Cummins 5.9-L ISB engines were diluted with charcoal-filtered air to exposure concentrations of 100, 200, and 400 mu g total particulate matter/m(3). The engines were operated on a continuously repeating, heavy-duty certification cycle (U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Chapter I) using Rotella-T 15W-40 engine oil. Nitrogen oxide and particulate matter were reduced when engines were operated on PuriNOx versus California Air Resources Board diesel fuel under these conditions. Male and female F344 rats were housed in Hazleton H2000 exposure chambers and exposed to exhaust atmospheres 6 h/day, 5 days/wk for the first 11 wk and 7 days/wk thereafter. Exposures ranged from 58 to 70 days, depending on the treatment group. Indicators of general toxicity (body weight, organ weight, clinical pathology, and histopathology), neurotoxicity (glial fibrillary acidic protein assay), genotoxicity (Ames assay, micronucleus, sister chromatid exchange), and reproduction and development were measured. Overall, effects observed were mild. Emulsion combustion emissions were not associated with neurotoxicity, reproductive/developmental toxicity, or in vivo genotoxicity. Small decreases in serum cholesterol and small increases in platelet values in some groups of exposed animals were observed. Particulate matter accumulation within alveolar macrophages was evident in all exposure groups. These findings are consistent with normal physiological responses to particle inhalation. Other statistically significant effects were present in some measured parameters of other exposed groups but were not clearly attributed to emissions exposure. Positive mutagenic responses in several strains of Salmonella typhimurium were observed subsequent to treatment with emulsion emissions subfractions. Based on the cholesterol and platelet results, it can be concluded that the 100-mu g/m(3) exposure level was the no-observed-effect level. In general, biological findings in diesel emulsion emission-exposed animals and bacteria were consistent with exposure to petroleum diesel exhaust in the F344 rat and Ames assays.

AB  - AIM: To compare the effects of four stocking densities (5, 10, 15 or 20 birds per m(2)) on the performance, carcass characteristics and selected welfare indicators of broiler chickens.
   METHODS: A total of 756 day-old male broiler chicks were assigned as six replicates of 13, 25, 38 and 50 birds per pen, to stocking densities of 2,000, 1,000, 667 and 500 cm 2 floor space per bird, respectively. The birds were housed in floor pens in an environmentally controlled room. Normal commercial diets were fed ad libitum and fresh water was freely available throughout the 5-week study period. Liveweights of birds and feed intake were recorded at weekly intervals. Data on carcass parameters and welfare indicators (moisture, gait scores, feather scores, breast and hip lesions, and foot pad and hock burns) were obtained on Day 35. Adrenal glands were removed at slaughter, weighed and examined histologically to determine the total proportion of cortical and medullary tissues.
   RESULTS: During the study, the birds at the lowest density grew faster (p<0.001-0.01) and consumed more (p<0.0010.01) feed than those at the other three stocking densities. The liveweight gains and feed intake of birds reared at densities of 10, 15 and 20 birds per m(2) were similar (p=0.11-0.83 and p=0.17-0.57, respectively). Stocking density had no influence on the feed/weight gain, mortality or carcass characteristics. No breast or hip lesions were observed in carcasses from any of the groups. The weight and structure of the adrenal glands were similar across all groups although the staining of medullary tissue of birds was most intense in the highest stocking density group. As stocking density increased, so did moisture and gait score, hock and foot pad burn scores, and the feather score was adversely affected.
   CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that the relationship between stocking density and productivity traits was not linear in nature, in accordance with other studies. Under the conditions of the current study, the performance, mortality and carcass characteristics of broilers grown at densities of 10, 15 and 20 birds per in 2 were similar. There were some welfare implications at high population densities as indicated by adverse effects on litter quality, gait scores and the incidence of hock and foot pad burns.

AB  - The most recent global "icehouse-hothouse" climate transition in earth history began during the Permian. Warmer polar conditions, relative to today, then persisted through the Mesozoic and into the Cenozoic. We focus here on two Permian stages, the Sakmarian (285-280 Ma) and the Wordian (267-264 Ma; also known as the Kazanian), integrating floral with lithological data to determine their climates globally. These stages postdate the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation but retain a moderately steep equator-to-pole gradient, judging by the level of floral and faunal differentiation. Floral data provide a particularly useful means of interpreting terrestrial paleoclimates, often revealing information about climate gradations between "dry" and "wet" end-member lithological indicators such as evaporites and coals. We applied multivariate statistical analyses to the Permian floral data to calibrate the nature of floral and geographical transitions as an aid to climate interpretation. We then classified Sakmarian and Wordian terrestrial environments in a series of regional biomes ("climate zones") by integrating information on leaf morphologies and phytogeography with patterns of eolian sand, evaporite, and coal distributions. The data-derived biomes are compared here with modeled biomes resulting from new Sakmarian and Wordian climate model simulations for a range of CO2 levels (one, four, and eight times the present levels), presented in our companion article. We provide a detailed grid cell comparison of the biome data and model results by geographic region, introducing a more rigorous approach to global paleoclimate studies. The simulations with four times the present CO2 levels (4 x CO2) match the observations better than the simulations with 1 x CO2, and, at least in some areas, the simulations with 8 x CO2 match slightly better than those for 4 x CO2. Overall, the 4 x CO2 and 8 x CO2 biome simulations match the data reasonably well in the equatorial and midlatitudes as well as the northern high latitudes. However, even these highest CO2 levels fail to produce the temperate climates in high southern latitudes indicated by the data. The lack of sufficient ocean heat transport into polar latitudes may be one of the factors responsible for this cold bias of the climate model. Another factor could be the treatment of land surface processes and the lack of an interactive vegetation module. We discuss strengths and limitations of the data and model approaches and indicate future research directions.

AB  - Vegetation growth and physiological functioning, including carbon uptake and transpiration, can be strongly affected by drought. During water-limited conditions, urban vegetation may be limited in its ability to provide ecosystem services, such as shading and evaporative cooling. While there has been extensive research on drought response in natural vegetation and agricultural systems using remote sensing, drought impacts on urban vegetation have remained understudied. With > 50% of people worldwide living in cities and the increased potential for future droughts, it is important to understand how urban vegetation will respond and to evaluate potential impacts. Here, we used repeat flights of NASA airborne imaging spectroscopy (AVIRIS and AVIRIS-NG) to quantify the responses of common urban tree species and turfgrass in downtown Santa Barbara, California, USA to the 2012-2016 California drought. The effects of the drought on vegetation were quantified using several spectral indicators: fractional cover from multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), vegetation indices, and continuum removed absorption features. We used existing tree crown object polygons that were classified to species and had associated estimates of pre-drought leaf area index and biomass. We also included polygons of turfgrass parks and recreational fields. All tree species and turfgrass had four or more spectral indicators with significantly lower mean values (p < 0.05) during the drought in 2014, and evidence of recovery was observed for some species in 2017, which was after the drought had ended. In general, needleleaf and native trees were more affected than broadleaf and non-native trees, respectively, but with considerable interspecific variability. Based on the spectral indicators, turfgrass cover senesced in the middle of the drought but recovered soon after the drought ended, whereas the majority of tree species had not fully recovered. Mean green vegetation cover declined in most tree canopies during the drought, primarily exposing paved surfaces and/or non-photosynthetic vegetation, depending on the site type and tree patch size. Drought impacts as expressed in spectral indicators were generally more severe in tree patches with high pre-drought leaf area index, suggesting that denser, leafier canopies were more difficult for trees to maintain during the drought. Most spectral indicators were correlated with one another (R > 0.4), suggesting co-occuring adjustments of greenness, water content, and plant pigments.

AB  - A variety of human enteropathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, have been shown to bioaccumulate in suspension-feeding bivalve shellfish. Cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic protozoan parasite that has been detected in many shellfish species within both fecally contaminated and clean oyster growing areas across the globe. For this study, C. parvum oocysts (1000 and 10,000) were spiked into 10 L of water in static tank systems housing Crassostrea virginica. Oysters were either held in the contaminated aquaria for 7 days of exposure or were exposed for 24 h and subsequently placed in a clean static tank system for the remainder of the trial. Individual oysters, fecal material, and tank water were analyzed for oocysts up to 7 days post-exposure via direct immunofluorescence. Oysters held under chronic exposure conditions gradually accumulated oocysts (1.5 or 34.4 oocysts/oyster/day for low or high dose exposure groups, respectively) between days 1 and 7, with an exponential uptake in oocysts observed within the first 24 h post-exposure (mean uptake of 29.6 or 241.9 oocysts/oyster, respectively). Oysters that were transferred to clean water after 24 h were capable of slowly depurating oocysts, following a linear trend. During chronic exposure trials 48-49% of the total spiked inoculum was recovered from oyster tissue, whereas 4.8-5.9% and 38-40% was recovered from tank water and from fecal material at day 7, respectively. In acute exposure trials, 30-31% of the total tank inoculum was found in oysters, suggesting that chronically exposed oysters were likely re-filtering some oocysts. Examinations of oyster fecal material from acute exposures revealed that 72-82% of oocysts recovered were already excreted at the time of oyster transfer (day 1), with only 18-28% being excreted during the static depuration phase. These data support that although most C. parvum oocysts are removed by C. virginica oysters within 24 h, elimination after this point occurs slowly. Additionally, chronic exposures demonstrate that wild or cultured oysters in saline environments that are frequently exposed to sources of Cryptosporidium may be unable to eliminate the parasites at a rate that balances initial uptake.

AB  - The imposition of agricultural systems changes the natural equilibrium of the soil to an extent that it becomes dependant on management practices and soil resilience. Agroforestry systems (AFs) mimic characteristics of natural ecosystems such as multistrata canopy and deep rooting and may minimize the consequences of these changes by providing soil protection and maintenance of conditions similar to those under natural vegetation. This study evaluates the physical properties of a Luvisol at a site where since 1997 alternative agro-forestry systems (AFs) (agrosilvipasture-AGP and silvipasture-SILV), conventional crop management (CCM) and natural vegetation (NV) have been maintained. Undisturbed soil cores were collected in 2005 and submitted to a range of matric suction for which soil bulk density (BD), soil penetration resistance (Q) and soil water content (theta) were determined. Water retention and penetration resistance were used to determine the least limiting water range (LLWR) and the slope of the soil water retention curve at its inflection point (S-value). Particle size, total organic carbon (TOC) and particle density were determined using the disturbed soil samples. Water retention and porosity followed the sequence NV>SILV>CCM>AGP. The AFs studied (AGP and SILV) improved or maintained soil physical quality when compared to NV with no significant differences between the S-values of 0.044, 0.042 and 0.050, respectively. However, the S-value of 0.035 for CCM indicates that this management was unable to maintain soil physical quality on the same levels as AFs and NV. The decrease of LLWR with BD occurred for all treatments, and the BD at a maximum effect (LLWR=0) which is called the critical BD (BDc), was, respectively, 1.69, 1.62, 1.56 and 1.56 Mg m(-3) for AGP, SILV, NV and CCM. The larger values of LLWR for AFs (AGP and SILV) are similar to the value for NV, with associated superior aeration, matric suction and reduced resistance to penetration by roots. Indices such as LLWR and S-value were suitably sensitive and could be used in future research, but it is important to identify other potential indices for these situations that can show how quickly changes in soil quality may occur.

AB  - The Bolivar Channel Ecosystem (BCE) is among the most productive zones in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR). It is exposed to relatively cool, nutrient-rich waters of the Cromwell current, which are brought to the photic zone through topographic upwelling. The BCE is characterized by a heterogeneous rocky reef habitat covered by dense algae beds and inhabited by numerous invertebrate and fish species, which represent the food for higher predators including seals and sharks and exploited fish species. In addition, plankton and detritus based food chains channel large amounts of energy through the complex food web. Important emblematic species of the Galapagos archipelagos reside in this area such as the flightless cormorant, the Galapagos penguin and the marine iguanas. A trophic model of BCE was constructed for the habitats <30 m depth that fringe the west coast of Isabela and east coast of Fernandina islands covering 14% of the total BCE area (44 km(2)). The model integrates data sets from sub tidal ecological monitoring and marine vertebrate population monitoring (2004 to 2008) programs of the Charles Darwin Foundation and consists of 30 compartments, which are trophically linked through a diet matrix. Results reveal that the BCE is a large system in terms of flows (38695 t km(-2) yr(-1)) comparable to Peruvian Bay Systems of the Humboldt upwelling system. A very large proportion of energy flows from the primary producers (phytoplankton and macro-algae) to the second level and to the detritus pool. Catches are high (54.3 t km(-2) yr(-1)) and are mainly derived from the second and third trophic levels (mean TL of catch = 2.45) making the fisheries gross efficiency high (0.3%). The system's degree of development seems rather low as indicated by a P/R ratio of 4.19, a low ascendency (37.4%) and a very low Finn's cycling index (1.29%). This is explained by the system's exposure to irregular changes in oceanographic conditions as related to the EL Nino Southern Oscillation. Most important keystone groups of large relative impact over other system compartments are sharks and marine mammals. In addition, the important role of macro-algae, sea stars and urchins, phytoplankton and barracudas should be emphasized for their great contribution to the trophic flows and biomass of the system.

AB  - More and more studies, including in Brazil, have suggested the use of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) as a bioindicator of soil quality. Most studies employ two methods: the pioneer of fumigation-incubation (FI), in which the MBC is estimated based oil. CO:,, emission from fumigated and non-fumigated soil samples after 10 days of incubation and fumigation extraction (FE), in which MBC is estimated based oil. C extraction from fumigated and non fumigated soil samples after 12 h. However, in Brazil the correlation between both methods has been evaluated in three ecosystems only: in the Amazon, the Cerrado and three soils of the State of Rio de Janeiro. In this paper the methods FE and FI were compared in a typical Dark Red Oxisol in the North of Parana State. The analyses were performed in a 12 year-field trial ill. Londrina with six treatments, including three soil managements (no-tillage, NT; conventional tillage with traditional ploughing and disking, CT and NT using a field cultivator every three years, FC) and two crop management types (crop rotation, CR; or multiple cropping, MC) systems. Four soil samples (0-10 cm) were taken: after winter harvest (wheat in CR and lupin in MC), after summer ploughing (for CT and FC treatments), after summer solving (soybean in CR and maize in MC) and in the summer crop flowering stage. In general the variability was low by both methods and the coefficient of variation was higher, the lower the MBC values. No differences between the FE and FI methods were detected when the four samplings at different stages as well as when all treatments were considered together. When all treatments were analyzed together, the correlation between FE and FI was positive and statistically significant. However, when. each. treatment was considered separately significance was observed for the treatments NT and. CT in CR and MC, but not for FC. Results indicate that both methods may be used to evaluate MBC under similar conditions in Northern Parana, however, they also indicate that more studies should be performed in Brazilian soils comparing both methods as a function of qualitative and quantitative changes in the organic matter contents as well as in the incorporation of crop residues.

AB  - Simple Summary Soil ingestion has been well documented for the majority of outside reared animals but not in horses. As soil can be a vector of environmental pollutants, such studies generally aim at controlling exposure to pollutant uptake in food producing animals. In horses, ingestion of soil may cause gastrointestinal disorders such as sand colic or intestinal damage. Therefore, soil ingestion has been studied in Irish sport horses grazing at three levels of herbage offer: 2, 3 or 4% of their body weight. Their soil intake was around 4% of the totally ingested dry matter corresponding to 543 to 648 g of dry soil per animal per day, which is quite similar to cattle in normal grazing conditions. Such amounts would clearly be an issue for food safety in areas with contaminated soil but also an animal welfare issue due to gastrointestinal damage. The height of the pastured grass sward seems to be a reliable criterion to indicate the level of risk of soil intake when horses graze short herbage in close proximity to the ground surface and should be moved to a new paddock. Data on soil ingestion in horses are lacking in contrast to other free-range animals. The importance of soil as a vector for environmental pollutants to food is less relevant in horses but several disorders secondary to soil ingestion, such as sand colic or enteritis have been reported. Therefore, soil ingestion has been studied on Irish sport horses grazing at three offered levels of daily herbage: 2, 3 and 4% of their body weight. Soil ingestion was estimated by the faecal recovery of a soil natural marker. Horses had 4.5, 4.1 and 3.7% of soil in their total intake respectively for the 2, 3 and 4% herbage offers. The 4% offer presented significantly less intake (543 g/d) compared to the more restricted offers (624 and 648 g respectively for 3 and 2%). The post-grazing sward height was significantly lower on the 2% offer (3.1 cm) compared to the higher offers (4.1 and 4.4 cm respectively for 3 and 4%). Thus, restricted herbage allowance made grazing closer to the ground and increased soil ingestion. The sward height appeared to be a reliable indicator to manage animal withdrawal from a pasture to limit soil ingestion and the risk of gastrointestinal pathologies caused by it.

AB  - Habitat has changed unfavorably during the past 150 y for the desert tortoise Gopherus agassizii, a federally threatened species with declining populations in the Mojave Desert and western Sonoran Desert. To support recovery efforts, we synthesized published information on relationships of desert tortoises with three habitat features (cover sites, forage, and soil) and candidate management practices for improving these features for tortoises. In addition to their role in soil health and facilitating recruitment of annual forage plants, shrubs are used by desert tortoises for cover and as sites for burrows. Outplanting greenhouse-grown seedlings, protected from herbivory, has successfully restored (>50% survival) a variety of shrubs on disturbed desert soils. Additionally, salvaging and reapplying topsoil using effective techniques is among the more ecologically beneficial ways to initiate plant recovery after severe disturbance. Through differences in biochemical composition and digestibility, some plant species provide better-quality forage than others. Desert tortoises selectively forage on particular annual and herbaceous perennial species (e.g., legumes), and forage selection shifts during the year as different plants grow or mature. Nonnative grasses provide low-quality forage and contribute fuel to spreading wildfires, which damage or kill shrubs that tortoises use for cover. Maintaining a diverse "menu" of native annual forbs and decreasing nonnative grasses are priorities for restoring most desert tortoise habitats. Reducing herbivory by nonnative animals, carefully timing herbicide applications, and strategically augmenting annual forage plants via seeding show promise for improving tortoise forage quality. Roads, another disturbance, negatively affect habitat in numerous ways (e.g., compacting soil, altering hydrology). Techniques such as recontouring road berms to reestablish drainage patterns, vertical mulching ("planting" dead plant material), and creating barriers to prevent trespasses can assist natural recovery on decommissioned backcountry roads. Most habitat enhancement efforts to date have focused on only one factor at a time (e.g., providing fencing) and have not included proactive restoration activities (e.g., planting native species on disturbed soils). A research and management priority in recovering desert tortoise habitats is implementing an integrated set of restorative habitat enhancements (e.g., reducing nonnative plants, improving forage quality, augmenting native perennial plants, and ameliorating altered hydrology) and monitoring short-and long-term indicators of habitat condition and the responses of desert tortoises to habitat restoration.

AB  - The laser methane detector (LMD) has been proposed as a method to characterize enteric methane (CH4) emissions from animals in a natural environment. To validate LMD use, its CH4 outputs (LMD-CH4), were compared against CH4 measured with respiration chambers (chamber-CH4). The LMD was used to measure CH4 concentration (mu L/L) in the exhaled air of 24 lactating ewes and 72 finishing steers. In ewes, LMD was used on 1 d for each ewe, for 2-min periods at 5 hourly observation periods (P1 to P5, respectively) after feeding. In steers fed either low-or high-concentrate diets, LMD was used once daily for a 4-min period for 3 d. The week after LMD-CH4 measurement, ewes or steers entered respiration chambers to quantify daily CH4 output (g/d). The LMD outputs consisted of periodic events of high CH4 concentrations superimposed on a background of oscillating lower CH4 concentrations. The high CH4 events were attributed to eructation and the lower background CH4 to respiration. After fitting a double normal distribution to the data set, a threshold of 99% of probability of the lower distribution was used to separate respiration from eructation events. The correlation between mean LMD-CH4 and chamber-CH4 was not high, and only improved correlations were observed after data were separated in 2 levels. In ewes, a model with LMD and DMI (adjusted R-2 = 0.92) improved the relationship between DMI and chamber-CH4 alone (adjusted R-2 = 0.79) and between LMD and chamber-CH4 alone (adjusted R-2 = 0.86). In both experiments, chamber-CH4 was best explained by models with length of eructation events (time) and maximum values of CH4 concentration during respiration events (mu L/L; P < 0.01). Correlation between methods differed between observation periods, indicating the best results of the LMD were observed from 3 to 5 h after feeding. Given the short time and ease of use of LMD, there is potential for its commercial application and field-based studies. Although good indicators of quantity of CH4 were obtained with respiration and eructation CH4, the method needed to separate the data into high and low levels of CH4 was not simple to apply in practice. Further assessment of the LMD should be performed in relation to animal feeding behavior and physiology to validate assumptions of eructation and respiration levels, and other sources of variation should be tested (i.e., micrometeorology) to better investigate its potential application for CH4 testing in outdoor conditions.

AB  - To improve the silvicultural targets for ecologically sustainable forestry, we quantified functionally important structural features for the first time in a representative set of old-growth forests in hemiboreal Europe. Altogether, 23 old-growth stands of four site-type groups were compared with mature commercial stands nearby in the Estonian state forests that hold the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certificate of sustainable forestry. These two treatments did not differ significantly in terms of tree-species diversity, volumes of woody debris of <20 cm diameter (including fine woody debris) and its decay-stage composition. However, mature stands had many more early-successional trees and lacked late-successional deciduous species; they also had a higher overall density and volume of live trees, due to abundant individuals of 10-39 cm diameter at breast height. Old-growth stands had at least twice as many live trees >= 40 cm, standing dead trees >= 30 cm and lying wood >= 20 cm in diameter, any freshly fallen debris, and regeneration. For lying wood >= 20 cm in diameter, the treatment effect depended on site type: both treatments of Vaccinium-type dry boreal forests were remarkably deadwood-poor (indicating historical management of the old-growth stands), while mature eutrophic stands of Aegopodium-type were most impoverished relative to old-growth levels. We conclude that many functional characteristics of old growth were present in the FSC-certified, mostly naturally regenerated, commercial stands. The main problem is the lack of very large trees, particularly of late-successional deciduous species, which should be addressed by their well-planned retention in cut areas and reconsideration of salvage logging strategies. A dense regeneration in old-growth stands also indicated the potential of selection cuttings. The study highlighted the need for region- and site-type specific numerical targets for sustainable forest management, which in the hemiboreal region should address the characteristic occurrence of late-successional deciduous trees on fertile soils and higher natural deadwood volumes than in typical boreal forests. For certification, the issues of structural impoverishment revealed both the inadequacy of some silvicultural practices and some indicators set by the national FSC-standard in Estonia.

AB  - This study characterizes the grazed vegetation of the eastern Hindu Kush Mountains, located at a transition zone between the winter-rain-influenced Irano-Turanian regions in the West, the arid Central-Asian regions in the North, and the monsoon-influenced Sino-Himalayan regions in the Southeast. We used two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) for hierarchical classification of community data, and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for examining relationships between the vegetation and selected environmental parameters. In relation to locality, altitude, soil conditions and grazing pressure, eleven plant communities, linked to four vegetation types were identified in the study area: (1) the desert steppe, comprising the Artemisia fragrans-Haloxylon thomsonii community, the Stipa orientalis-Kraschenninikovia pungens community, the Eremurus stenophyllus-Scutellaria multicaulis community, and the Koelpinia linearis-Matthiola chorassanica community; (2) the Artemisia brevifolia steppe, comprising the Bromus danthoniae-Artemisia brevifolia community, the Acantholimon kokandense-Artemisia brevifolia community, and the Cerastium cerastioides-Aconitum rotundifolium community; (3) the alpine scree vegetation, composed of the Acantholimon kokandense-Psychrogeton andryaloides community and the Androsace baltistanica-Elymus schugnanicus community, and (4) the alpine mats, with the Oxytropis humifusa-Crepis multicaulis community and the Leontopodium ochroleucum-Festuca alaica community. However, no syntaxonomical classification could be achieved yet due to insufficient samples, lack of particular character species, and taxonomic problems. The above vegetation types and plant communities differ floristically and phytogeographically, with plants showing characteristic Patterns of adaptive trait variation. Whereas the steppes in the West exhibit high species diversity, with a notable shift towards Irano-Turanian, Pamirean and Himalayan elements, the northern regions, including the Central Karakorum, are species-poor, with Central-Asian and Tibetan elements being more prominent. As the occurrence of ephemerophytes is tightly linked to sufficient soil humidity in spring, they are a typical feature of plant communities influenced by winter rain. In general, the most important ecological factors influencing the above vegetation types and plant communities are altitude, geographical position (longitude more than latitude), grazing intensity and organic matter content. The results are discussed in relation to the floristic relationships of the phytocoenoses within the geographical and altitudinal range of the study area, and also with respect to those occurring in the adjacent mountains of Karakorum and Ladakh.

AB  - Although weather variables are known to influence quail abundance in some habitats, most studies have addressed only limited geographic areas and indices to weather conditions. The few replicated studies addressed relatively similar climate zones. We used 21 years (1978-98) of quail abundance data collected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) biologists to address the relationship between both simple precipitation and Palmer drought indices and Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and Scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) abundance in 6 ecological regions of Texas. Three 12-month Palmer indices were more highly correlated with changes in Northern Bobwhite abundance in the South Texas Plains ecological region than was raw precipitation alone. The 12-month Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (PMDI) was correlated (r(s) greater than or equal to 0.78, P less than or equal to 0.001) with the mean number of Northern Bobwhites visually observed per sun ey route in the Rolling and South Texas Plains ecological regions, while a le-month, raw precipitation index was correlated (r(s) = 0.64, P = 0.002) with Northern Bobwhite abundance in only the South Texas Plains. The PMDI and raw precipitation were correlated (r(s) greater than or equal to 0.67, P less than or equal to 0.001and r(s) greater than or equal to 0.57, P less than or equal to 0.007, respectively) with the mean number Scaled Quail observed per survey route in the Edwards Plateau, South Texas Plains, and Trans-Pecos Mountains and Basins ecological regions. There was no relationship (P greater than or equal to 0.437) between changes in quail abundance and the PMDI or raw precipitation in the Gulf Prairies and Marshes physiographic region, where precipitation was relatively high. The monthly PMDI was a better indicator of changes in both northern bobwhite and Scaled Quail abundance among years than was monthly precipitation alone. Both monthly and 12-month precipitation-based weather indices were more correlated with changes in Northern Bobwhite and scaled quail abundance among years in relatively dry as opposed to wet ecological regions. Our approach should help wildlife biologists and managers better account for annual variability in quail productivity in semi-arid environments so that long-term populations trends can be better elucidated.

AB  - A fundamental problem of sustainability is how to reduce the double complexity of ecological and social systems into simple operational terms. We highlight that the conservation concept of focal species (selected species sensitive to a set of anthropogenic threats to their habitat) links multiple issues of ecological sustainability, and their habitat models can provide a practical tool for solving these issues. A review of the literature shows that most spatial modeling of focal species focuses on vertebrates, lacks the aspect of aquatic and soil habitats, and has been slow in the uptake by actual management planning. We elaborate on a deductive modeling approach that first generalizes the main influential dimensions of habitat change (threats), which are then parameterized as habitat quality estimates for focal species. If built on theoretical understanding and properly scaled, the maps produced with such models can cost-effectively describe the dynamics of ecological qualities across forest landscapes, help set conservation priorities, and reflect on management plans and practices. The models also serve as ecological hypotheses on biodiversity and landscape function. We illustrate this approach based on recent additions to the forest reserve network in Estonia, which addressed the insufficient protection of productive forest types. For this purpose, mostly former production forests that may require restoration were set aside. We distinguished seven major habitat dimensions and their representative taxa in these forests and depicted each dimension as a practical stand-scale decision tree of habitat quality. The model outcomes implied that popular stand-structural targets of active forest restoration would recover passively in reasonable time in these areas, while a critically degraded condition (loss of old trees of characteristic species) required management beyond reserve borders. Another hidden issue revealed was that only a few stands of consistently low habitat quality concentrated in the landscape to allow cost-efficient restoration planning. We conclude that useful habitat models for sustainable forest management have to balance single-species realism with stakeholder expectations of meaningful targets and scales. Addressing such social aspects through the focal species concept could accelerate the adoption of biodiversity distribution modeling in forestry.

AB  - In the current context of climate change and global energy demand, the use of energy from waste has become one strategy for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the replacement of fossil fuels by other non-conventional energy sources through the use of biogas produced in landfills. Although there have been some improvements in solid waste management practices in Colombia, current levels of recycling and materials recovery are still poor as only about 10% of the waste produced is recovered, so it is expected that, as for most developing countries, final disposal in landfills will continue to be the main form of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the coming decades. The optimization of waste degradation and stabilization processes is an essential key aspect for the environmental performance and economic sustainability of waste management systems in developing countries like Colombia. However, assessing the feasibility of biogas production in landfills requires a reasonable level of accuracy for the generation of methane, a sufficient understanding of the underlying generation processes and their relation with the physicochemical characteristics of the waste and landfill disposal conditions. Source segregation of MSW is either poor or non-existing in Colombia, as in most developing countries, which makes difficult to predict landfill gas generation even with the aid of current landfill emissions models. Only a few studies have been conducted to characterize biogas and methane production potential of mixed MSW landfilled in Latin-American countries, with few studies reported in Brazil and in Colombia. In this study, we show the results of biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests with 4-5 years old samples of municipal solid waste (MSW) excavated from a landfill site located in Colombia. Collected samples were characterized and the easy and medium biodegradable fractions used in the experiments. The results show an average total production of 34.8 - 37.9 L CH4 kg-1 DM added which is comparable with similar studies using excavated landfilled waste of similar characteristics. These results suggest that considering the potential of methane production from landfilled waste in developing countries, it is an alternative that could be considered to enhance the environmental performance of landfill sites by reduction of the emissions of uncontrolled CH4 and promote the use of non-conventional energy sources.

AB  - Spatial and temporal changes in physical depositional processes of shallow-marine deltas affect facies distributions, which are critical for reconstructing paleogeography and predicting reservoir heterogeneities. The updated interpretation of the classical ancient 'river-dominated' Lower Wilcox delta in the Gulf of Mexico suggests more significant process variations than previously suggested. The dominance of the storm-wave process is indicated by wave-ripple laminae and combined-flow ripple laminae in the fair-weather intervals, and hummocky/swaley cross-stratification and low-angle laminae in the storm beds. However, the relatively simple alternation of fair-weather beds and storm beds is complicated by the presence of: 1) normal and inversely graded siltstone to very fine-grained sandstone beds, suggesting hyperpycnites generated during the river flooding season; 2) mud-dominated heterolithics with delicate mud rhythmites, suggesting tidal modulation between the storm events. The storm-wave generated succession, with preservation of both river flood and tidal signals during fair-weather condition, represents regressive shoreline to-shelf outbuilding. The wave-dominated delta or shoreface deposits are commonly truncated by fluvial-dominated, tide-influenced distributary channels, then overlain by tidal heterolithics and gradually open-shelf deposits, suggesting the development of small estuaries during transgressive phases of the Wilcox shoreline. The interpreted mixed process delta is linked to the last growth stage of the Lower Wilcox Group, prior to inundation of the Texas shelf by thick marine mudstones. Its depositional setting was characterized by the widest Lower Wilcox shelf (>50 km) and a weakening sediment supply, resulting in a stronger wave and tide influence, relative to a weak fluvial influence. This work thus provides a well-constrained example of the complex interplay of fluvial, wave, and tidal currents in a process stratigraphy where decreasing river flux and relative sea level rise allowed wave reworking to become the dominant theme, even though the same system has been previously interpreted as a classic river-dominated delta. Many existing interpretations of ancient deltas thought to have mainly been controlled by a single process may need to be revisited and revised to take into account the natural spatial and temporal variability inherent to the shallow marine realm.

AB  - Stand-replacing natural disturbances in mature forests are traditionally seen as events that cause forests to revert to early stages of succession and maintain species diversity. In some cases, however, such transitions could be an artifact of salvage logging and may increase biotic homogenization. We present initial (two-year) results of a study of the effects of tornado damage and the combined effects of tornado damage and salvage logging on environmental conditions and ground cover plant communities in mixed oak pine forests in north central Mississippi. Plots were established in salvage-logged areas, adjacent to plots established before the storm in unlogged areas, spanning a gradient of storm damage intensity. Vegetation change directly attributable to tornado damage was driven primarily by a reduction in canopy cover but was not consistent with a transition to an early stage of, succession. Although we observed post-storm increases of several disturbance indicators (ruderals), we also observed significant increases in the abundance of a few species indicative of upland forests. Increases in flowering were just as likely to occur in species indicative of forests as in species indicative of open woodlands. Few species declined as a result of the tornado, resulting in a net increase in species richness. Ruderals were very abundant in salvage-logged areas, which contained significantly higher amounts of bare ground and greater variance in soil penetrability than did damaged areas that were not logged. In contrast to unlogged areas severely damaged by the tornado, most upland forest indicators were not abundant in logged areas. Several of the forest and open-woodland indicators that showed increased flowering in damaged areas were absent or sparse in logged areas. Species richness was lower in salvage-logged areas than in adjacent damaged areas but similar to that in undamaged areas. These results suggest that salvage logging prevented, positive responses of several forest and open-woodland species to tornado damage. Anthropogenic disturbances such as salvage logging appear to differ fundamentally from stand-level canopy-reducing disturbances in their effects on ground cover vegetation in the forests studied here and are perhaps more appropriately viewed as contributing to biotic homogenization than as events that maintain diversity.

AB  - Earlier studies demonstrate that blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) from the Baltic population are more sensitive, in terms of physiological response and survival when exposed to toxic substances, compared to mussels from a more marine environment. The question whether this can be explained by environmental factors or genetic differences in the ability to synthesise a common stress-inducible protein (HSP 70) was addressed in two experiments. In the first experiment mussels from the North and Baltic Seas were acclimatised to an intermediate salinity of 15 parts per thousand S in the laboratory. The physiological performance was studied when the heavy metal cadmium was added and accumulated by the animals during a one week exposure. Tissue concentration was measured and related to physiological response. The level of expression of HSP 70 was analysed by densitometry on Western blots. North Sea mussels rapidly induced high levels and multiple forms of HSP 70, reached a comparatively low tissue concentration of cadmium, and showed only a minor physiological response and low mortality rates. Baltic Sea mussels had low levels of HSP 70, induced at slow rate, reached higher tissue concentrations of cadmium, and showed a more pronounced physiological response and higher mortality rates. High levels of stress proteins and a rapid induction corresponded well with physiological fitness, and the mussels from the North Sea thus seem to have a more efficient detoxification system, probably including stress-inducible proteins. In the second experiment, juvenile mussels from the Baltic population were acclimatised for a month to North Sea conditions in a field transplant. The mussels were then exposed to low-dose copper in the laboratory and the accumulation, physiological response and synthesis of stress inducible proteins were assessed. The results indicate that the physiological differences described between the populations are to a large extent explained by environmental factors. However, some differences can still be observed between the populations, e.g., a lower rate of induction of a major stress protein in Baltic than in North Sea mussels. It can thus be suggested that a reduced ability to stress protein induction, in their natural low saline habitat, might be a contributing factor to the higher pollution sensitivity earlier demonstrated for Baltic blue mussels.

AB  - Fish embryos are excellent models for studies aimed at understanding toxic mechanisms and indications of possible acute and chronic effects. For the past 3 yr, an Arabian killifish (Aphanius dispar) fish embryo test has been developed in the authors' laboratory as a routine ecotoxicological test that can be used to support risk assessment of potential contaminants in Arabian Gulf coastal waters. Tests were conducted with 3 reference toxicants (3,4-dichloroaniline [DCA], sodium dodecyl sulfate, and zinc sulfate [Zn]) and chlorine, a disinfectant used widely in industrial cooling systems around the Arabian Gulf region. The 50% effect concentration (EC50) for DCA was 0.47mg/L and 1.89mg/L for embryos exposed before 6 hpf and after 168 hpf, respectively. Sublethal effects were mainly observed at concentrations above 2.5mg/L, the effects included severe pericardial edema and tail shortage. The sodium dodecyl sulfate ionic surfactant caused mortality at both early and late stages of embryo development; it caused coagulation, severe deformity, and hemolysis. Both the EC50 and the 50% lethal concentration (LC50) for sodium dodecyl sulfate were 9.37mg/L. Salinity influenced the toxicity of Zn to killifish embryos: at 40 psu Zn was found not to be toxic, whereas at 20 psu toxicity had increased significantly (p < 0.05). Values of EC50 and LC50 were 2.5mg/L and 4mg/L, respectively. Concentrations above 15mg/L in embryos were often accompanied by upper abdominal edema and inhibition of growth, especially evident in the tail. Chlorine caused mortality at a lower concentration; for example, at 0.05mg/L 33% of embryos were found dead at the end of the experiment. The LC50 for chlorine was determined to be 0.08mg/L. Examination of the existing literature showed similar results to the present study's findings. The results suggest a more comparable sensitivity of killifish embryos to that of other fish embryo test recommended species. The present study's findings support the ability of killifish to be an indicator organism for environmental risk assessments of Arabian Gulf waters. Benefits include sensitivity to a wide range of substances and conditions, animal alternative, ease of fish breeding, and clarity of the embryos. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:2898-2905.

AB  - We studied lower food webs in streams of two mercury-sensitive regions to determine whether variations in consumer foraging strategy and resultant dietary carbon signatures accounted for observed within-site and among-site variations in consumer mercury concentration. We collected macroinvertebrates (primary consumers and predators) and selected forage fishes from three sites in the Adirondack Mountains of New York, and three sites in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina, for analysis of mercury (Hg) and stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15). Among primary consumers, scrapers and filterers had higher MeHg and more depleted delta C-13 than shredders from the same site. Variation in delta C-13 accounted for up to 34 % of within-site variation in MeHg among primary consumers, beyond that explained by delta N-15, an indicator of trophic position. Consumer delta C-13 accounted for 10 % of the variation in Hg among predatory macroinvertebrates and forage fishes across these six sites, after accounting for environmental aqueous methylmercury (MeHg, 5 % of variation) and base-N adjusted consumer trophic position (Delta delta N-15, 22 % of variation). The delta C-13 spatial pattern within consumer taxa groups corresponded to differences in benthic habitat shading among sites. Consumers from relatively more-shaded sites had more enriched delta C-13 that was more similar to typical detrital delta C-13, while those from the relatively more-open sites had more depleted delta C-13. Although we could not clearly attribute these differences strictly to differences in assimilation of carbon from terrestrial or in-channel sources, greater potential for benthic primary production at more open sites might play a role. We found significant variation among consumers within and among sites in carbon source; this may be related to within-site differences in diet and foraging habitat, and to among-site differences in environmental conditions that influence primary production. These observations suggest that different foraging strategies and habitats influence MeHg bioaccumulation in streams, even at relatively small spatial scales. Such influence must be considered when selecting lower trophic level consumers as sentinels of MeHg bioaccumulation for comparison within and among sites.

AB  - Background: Baetis harrisoni Barnard is a mayfly frequently encountered in river studies across Africa, but the external morphological features used for identifying nymphs have been observed to vary subtly between different geographic locations. It has been associated with a wide range of ecological conditions, including pH extremes of pH 2.9-10.0 in polluted waters. We present a molecular study of the genetic variation within B. harrisoni across 21 rivers in its distribution range in southern Africa.
   Results: Four gene regions were examined, two mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I [COI] and small subunit ribosomal 16S rDNA [16S]) and two nuclear (elongation factor 1 alpha [EF1 alpha] and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [PEPCK]). Bayesian and parsimony approaches to phylogeny reconstruction resulted in five well-supported major lineages, which were confirmed using a general mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) model. Results from the EF1 alpha gene were significantly incongruent with both mitochondrial and nuclear (PEPCK) results, possibly due to incomplete lineage sorting of the EF1 alpha gene. Mean between-clade distance estimated using the COI and PEPCK data was found to be an order of magnitude greater than the within-clade distance and comparable to that previously reported for other recognised Baetis species. Analysis of the Isolation by Distance (IBD) between all samples showed a small but significant effect of IBD. Within each lineage the contribution of IBD was minimal. Tentative dating analyses using an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock and two published estimates of COI mutation rates suggest that diversification within the group occurred throughout the Pliocene and mid-Miocene (similar to 2.4-11.5 mya).
   Conclusions: The distinct lineages of B. harrisoni correspond to categorical environmental variation, with two lineages comprising samples from streams that flow through acidic Table Mountain Sandstone and three lineages with samples from neutral-to-alkaline streams found within eastern South Africa, Malawi and Zambia. The results of this study suggest that B. harrisoni as it is currently recognised is not a single species with a wide geographic range and pH-tolerance, but may comprise up to five species under the phylogenetic species concept, each with limited pH-tolerances, and that the B. harrisoni species group is thus in need of taxonomic review.

AB  - Analyses of 203 samples of benthic foraminifera in six cores from four sites in Florida Bay indicate habitat change over the last similar to 4000 years. Sample ages were determined for the last similar to 120 years with Pb-210, and for up to similar to 4000 years at two sites with C-14. The largest habitat changes upcore were identified with stratigraphically constrained cluster analysis (CONISS), which evaluates the similarity of vertically adjacent samples. Paleoenvironmental interpretations of habitat changes were mostly based on varying proportions of two defined associations of environmental indicator taxa and changes in diversity. The timing of the interpreted environmental changes was compared to known natural and anthropogenic events to examine their correspondence and possible relationship.
   The bay's initial flooding similar to 4000 YBP was indicated at the offshore Ninemile Bank by a very high proportion of an Ammonia association and very low proportion of a Quinqueloculina association, similar to modern nearshore assemblages in Trout Cove, the core site closest to the mainland. Construction of the Florida Keys railroad in 1907-1910 led to restricted exchange with the open ocean; foraminifera indicate a salinity decrease at that time, probably from the increased influence of runoff. Faunal changes since the 1920s in central Florida Bay signify increasingly saline (>32 psu) waters. Between 1928-1938, concurrent peaks in the Ammonia association at all sites suggest widespread freshening of the bay, which corresponds to an unusual succession of three powerful, wet hurricanes between 1926-1938. After flushing of the bay by hurricanes, a long-term result of decreased circulation caused by railroad construction was the increased retention of organic materials in the bay; more organic-rich conditions after 1932 are indicated at Ninemile Bank by a shift in infaunal Bolivina species to their highest abundance. In the central bay after 1962, the amplitude of changes in the Ammonia association and diversity was greater, probably related to larger salinity shifts caused by increases in water management in addition to natural events such as droughts. In the central bay in 1987, decreases in diversity, increases in infaunal taxa and decreases in epiphytic species clearly reflect a severe, bay-wide seagrass die-off and drought. Thus, changes in Florida Bay habitats can be related to both anthropogenic and, natural causes. Despite any degradation of water quality in the past 50 years, foraminiferal diversity has increased at most sites.

AB  - Changes in leaf carbon and nitrogen isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15 values) and the accumulation of epicuticular lipids have been associated with plant responses to water stress. We investigated their potential use as indicators of early plant water deficit in two grapevine (Vitis vinifera L) cultivars, Chasselas and Pinot noir, that were field-grown under well-watered and water-deficient conditions. We tested the hypothesis that the bulk delta C-13 and delta N-15 values and the concentrations of epicuticular fatty acids may change in leaves of similar age with the soil water availability. For this purpose, leaves were sampled at the same position in the canopy at different times (phenological stages) during the 2014 growing season. Bulk dry matter of young leaves from flowering to veraison had higher delta C-13 values, higher total nitrogen content, and lower delta N-15 values than old leaves. In both cultivars, delta N-15 values were strongly correlated with plant water deficiency, demonstrating their integration of the plant water stress response. delta C-13 values recorded the water deficiency only in those plants that had not received foliar organic fertilization. The soil water deficiency triggered the accumulation of C-26 fatty acids in the cuticular waxes. The compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of fatty acids from old leaves showed an increase in delta C-13 among the C-16-C-22 chains, including stress signaling linoleic and linolenic adds. Our results provide evidence for leaf C-13-enrichment, N-15-depletion, and enhanced FA-chain elongation and epicuticular accumulation in the grapevine response to water stress. The leaf delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, and the concentration of epicuticular fatty acids can be used as reliable and sensitive indicators of plant water deficit even when the level of water stress is low to moderate. They could also be used, particularly the more cost-efficient delta C-13 and delta N-15 measurements, for periodic biogeochemical mapping of the plant water availability at the vineyard and regional scale.

AB  - Currently, there are more and more requirements not only to the quality of food, but also to the raw materials it is made from. This leads to the search for new, non-traditional products. One of these is chia seeds (Salvia hispanica). The article provides data on their useful properties. The high demand for chia seeds is due to their unique chemical composition. The main feature of the seeds of this crop is that they contain many chemical substances of high calorific and biological value, as compared with cereals and oilseeds traditionally grown in Ukraine. In chia seeds, there are 30-35% of fat, 25-41% of carbohydrates, and 20-22% of protein. Chia seeds are a valuable source of vitamin B, calcium, potassium, iron, zinc, and copper. The fatty acid composition of this crop indicates a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. 63.3% of them is linolenic fatty acid, which belongs to w-3 acids and is important for the brain function, growth, and development of a living organism. That is why it is so important to find optimal ways of preparing freshly harvested chia seeds so as to extend their shelf life. These ways must take into account the biological and chemical characteristics of this crop, and make it possible to preserve its consumer properties for further targeted processing. The article presents the results of studying the quality indicators and microbiological condition of chia seeds to establish how long they can be safely stored and to assess the sanitary safety of this crop. It has been shown that within the period of 6 months, the greatest changes in the quality of chia seed oil are observed at 25 degrees C: there is a significant increase in the acid and peroxide values and a decrease in the iodine value (the latter indicates spoilage of chia seeds). Lowering the air temperature to 5 degrees C slows down the enzymatic processes that take place in chia seeds, and inhibits the increase of the acid and peroxide values of fat, which ensures retention of the consumer properties of seeds. It has been established that the seeds of the crop under study can be stored, without any loss of their quality, for 6 months at 5-15 degrees C and the relative humidity 60-70%. All the beneficial properties of chia seeds are due to their unique composition, so they are supposed to be widely used for specialised and functional nutrition.

AB  - The complex topography of floodplains provides conditions for high diversity and density of transitional areas between different grassland plant communities. Nevertheless, transitions have been almost completely neglected in previous studies of diversity patterns in semi-natural floodplain grasslands.
   We analyzed alpha-, beta- and gamma-components of plant species diversity in transitional areas between neighbouring wet and dry grassland communities in two landscapes of the Gauja River floodplain (Latvia) differing in landscape heterogeneity created by land use history and current management type (grazing versus mowing). In total 9 transition areas and their adjacent vegetation were sampled in 1 m wide and 8 to 28 m long belt transects gridded into 0.5 m x 1 m plots. Cluster analysis was used to analyze variation in species composition of transitional areas and adjacent vegetation. Indicator species analysis was used to determine species specific to transitional areas (ecotonal species).
   Transitional areas of the homogeneous site had a more distinct species composition (clear division in clusters by cluster analysis) and significantly lower beta-diversity than those of the heterogeneous site. alpha-Diversity was significantly higher in transitions than in wet grasslands and lower than in dry grasslands in both sites. Comparing the two sites, alpha-diversity was significantly higher in wet grasslands of the heterogeneous site, but no differences were found between transitions and dry grasslands in the two sites. Higher beta-diversity of transitional areas in the heterogeneous site could be attributed to a higher density of different habitats per unit area in combination with grazing. No species were restricted to transitions, and no differences were apparent in the number of generalist species (indifferent species sensu Ellenberg indicator values for edaphic factors) between transitions and adjacent grasslands. Nevertheless, the total number of generalist species was considerably higher in the investigated floodplain grasslands than usually reported for respective vegetation types in Latvia.
   It was concluded that transitions of neighboring floodplain grassland plant communities were more important in shaping beta-diversity compared to alpha- and gamma-diversity. Our results suggest that destroying transitional areas between dry and wet grasslands by leveling the ground or by abandonment of the management practices will decrease habitat heterogeneity and lead to less pronounced ecotonal processes in the whole riverine landscape. Thus further studies about the role of fine-scale transitional areas for biodiversity of floodplains are important for ecological restoration of floodplain grasslands.

AB  - There is a close connection between modern-day biosynthesis of particular triterpenoid biomarkers and presence of molecular oxygen in the environment. Thus, the detection of steroid and triterpenoid hydrocarbons far back in Earth history has been used to infer the antiquity of oxygenic photosynthesis. This prompts the question: were these compounds produced similarly in the past? In this paper, we address this question with a review of the current state of knowledge surrounding the oxygen requirement for steroid biosynthesis and phylogenetic patterns in the distribution of steroid and triterpenoid biosynthetic pathways.
   The hopanoid and steroid biosynthetic pathways are very highly conserved within the bacterial and eukaryotic domains, respectively. Bacteriohopanepolyols are produced by a wide range of bacteria, and are methylated in significant abundance at the C2 position by oxygen-producing cyanobacteria. On the other hand, sterol biosynthesis is sparsely distributed in distantly related bacterial taxa and the pathways do not produce the wide range of products that characterize eukaryotes. In particular, evidence for sterol biosynthesis by cyanobacteria appears flawed. Our experiments show that cyanobacterial cultures are easily contaminated by sterol-producing rust fungi, which can be eliminated by treatment with cycloheximide affording sterol-free samples.
   Sterols are ubiquitous features of eukaryotic membranes, and it appears likely that the initial steps in sterol biosynthesis were present in their modern form in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes. Eleven molecules of O-2 are required by four enzymes to produce one molecule of cholesterol. Thermodynamic arguments, optimization of function and parsimony all indicate that an ancestral anaerobic pathway is highly unlikely.
   The known geological record of molecular fossils, especially steranes and triterpanes, is notable for the limited number of structural motifs that have been observed. With a few exceptions, the carbon skeletons are the same as those found in the lipids of extant organisms and no demonstrably extinct structures have been reported. Furthermore, their patterns of occurrence over billion year time-scales correlate strongly with environments of deposition. Accordingly, biomarkers are excellent indicators of environmental conditions even though the taxonomic affinities of all biomarkers cannot be precisely specified. Biomarkers are ultimately tied to biochemicals with very specific functional properties, and interpretations of the biomarker record will benefit from increased understanding of the biological roles of geologically durable molecules.

AB  - It is of importance to integrate the biological control of hawthorn spider mite, Tetranychus viennensis, by predatory thrips in commercial orchards in north China. In this study, a leaf disc bioassay was employed to investigate the effects of two insecticides, i.e. abamectin and fenpropathrin, and two fungicides, i.e. mancozeb and carbendazim, on the functional response of an acarophagous thrips, Scolothrips takahashii Priesner, to eggs of the mite at the conditions of 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% relative humidity, and a 16 : 8 h (L : D) photoperiod. Results indicated that the type of functional response in predatory thrips differed depending on the types and doses of the pesticides exposed. Holling-II type responses were exhibited by all predatory thrips but females that were exposed to labelled dose of abamectin and half-labelled dose of fenpropathrin exhibited the Holling-III type responses. Parameters of random predator equation for both exposed and unexposed predators were estimated and compared with an equation with indicator variables. Both doses of both fungicide treatments did not have any impact on the attack rates of the thrips. Handling time (T-h) estimates for males exposed to both doses of both fungicides were similar to that of the control, but there seemed to be a trend towards prolonged handling times for females in these exposures with a significantly prolonged T-h found in labelled dose of mancozeb. Exposures of both doses of fenpropathrin and labelled dose of abamectin produced significantly lower attack rates and significantly prolonged handling times in both males and females, whereas an exposure of half-labelled dose of abamectin had no obvious influence on the attack rates of the predator, but the handling time in females prolonged significantly. The theoretical maximum number of prey attacked by the thrips were 59.81 eggs per day per female and 23.21 eggs per day per male in the control, but it reduced by 57.03-71.41% and 6.03-36.75% for females and males in the insecticide exposures and 23.91-44.26% and -5.13-11.55% in the fungicide exposures, respectively. The finding implies that the natural control effects of S. takahashii would be weakened by the application of the pesticides such as fenpropathrin, abamectin and mancozeb, which are often used to control insect pests and fungal diseases in apple orchards.

AB  - The development of held sampling designs that employ multiple reference and polluted sites has been proposed as an alternative to the traditional upstream vs, downstream approach used in most biomonitoring studies. Spatially extensive monitoring programs can characterize ecological conditions within an ecoregion and provide the necessary background information to evaluate future changes in water quality. We measured physicochemical characteristics, heavy-metal concentrations, and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure at 95 sites in the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion in Colorado, USA. Most sites (82%) were selected using a systematic, randomized sampling design. Each site was placed into one of four metal categories (background, low, medium, and high metals), based on the cumulative criterion unit (CCU), which we defined as the ratio of the instream metal concentration to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency criterion concentration, summed for all metals measured. A CCU of 1.0 represents a conservative estimate of: the total metal concentration that, when exceeded, is likely td cause harm to aquatic organisms. Although the CCU was less than 2.0 at most (66.3%) of the sites, values exceeded 10.0 at 13 highly polluted stations. Differences among metal categories were highly significant for most measures of macroinvertebrate abundance and all measures of species richness. We observed the greatest effects on several species of heptageniid mayflies (Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae), which were highly sensitive to heavy metals and were reduced by >75% at moderately polluted stations. The influence of taxonomic aggregation on responses to metals was also greatest for mayflies. In general, total abundance of mayflies and abundance of heptageniids were better indicators of metal pollution than abundance of dominant mayfly taxa. We used stepwise multiple-regression analyses to investigate the relationship between benthic community measures and physicochemical characteristics at the 78 randomly selected sites. Heavy-metal concentration was the most important predictor of benthic community structure at these sites. Because of the ubiquitous distribution of heavy-metal pollution in the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion, we conclude that potential effects of heavy metals should be considered when investigating large-scale spatial patterns of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in Colorado's mountain streams.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Studies investigating whether a captive environment is meeting the needs of the species housed are relatively common among captive mammals. However, studies exploring fish behaviour in captive display enclosures are far less common in the scientific literature. Focusing on a small group of sharks, rays and smaller fish within a single display, our objectives were to; assess whether the behaviours of a select number of individual fishes within a single display are altered after the environment is enriched to enhance environmental complexity and visitor exposure is reduced, and also to increase our understanding of captive fish behaviour to improve capacity for evidence-based management decisions. In summary, increased environmental complexity and reduced visitor interaction showed correlations with increased expression of natural behaviours in all fish studied, including increased space use and decreased abnormal repetitive behaviours in some species. These results reflect a change toward more natural wild behavioural time budgets. Studying behaviour change in fish in different environmental conditions provides a good basis for evidence-based decision making.</p>
   <br></p>
   This study investigated the behaviour of two Elasmobranch species; Southern fiddler ray (Trygonorrhina dumerilii, n = 1) and Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni, n = 4) and two teleost species; moonlighter (Tilodon sexfasciatus, n = 1) and banded morwong (Cheilodactylus spectabilis, n = 1) living within a single enclosure. For this study, two treatments were compared, the original enclosure design, and then after the enclosure had been renovated to more closely represent the species natural habitats, with a raised front viewing glass to prevent visitor interaction. Behaviours such as resting, swimming and abnormal behaviours such as surface and perimeter swimming (elasmobranchs only) were recorded as well as location within the enclosure, for 10 days pre and 10 days post renovation. The Port Jackson sharks significantly reduced the performance of abnormal behaviours after renovation, and significantly increased the time spent near the exhibit front. The Southern fiddler ray increased resting post renovation, while the teleost species also spent more time near the exhibit front. Although a small sample size was used, the results suggest that a more naturalistic environment with multiple micro-habitats and effective visitor barriers allows for a greater proportion of the day spent exhibiting natural behaviours, greater space use and reduced stereotypes.</p>

AB  - The relevance of the research lies in tackling an important problem: mitigating anthropogenic environmental impacts. This is achieved by using the biomass of energy crops. The article investigates the impact of sole, strip and mixed crops of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) with red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) on soil organic matter (SOM) content and biomass yield. This enables reduction of the anthropogenic load on agrophytocenoses, improves ecological production as well as increases the yield of the main component switchgrass. The objectives of this experiment were to evaluate the dynamics of the SOM content in energy crops of switchgrass and to determine the impact of SOM content on switchgrass yield. The experiment involved field trials with the introduced switchgrass cultivar 'Cave-in-Rock' during the period of 2011-2018. The experiment was aimed at determining the dynamics of SOM content, the yield level of switchgrass biomass depending on the type of sowing under the conditions of the forest-steppe. The studied factors are experimental years (2011-2018) and three switchgrass sowing methods: sole crop, strip switchgrass with red clover (strip crop) and mixed switchgrass with red clover (mixed crop). In the experiment, general and special methods were used: method of scientific research in agronomy; laboratory methods to determine SOM content and dry matter content in biomass; quantitative-weight method to establish switchgrass yield. The results of the study show that red clover in strip crops survived for 3-4 years and acting as bioherbicides in the row-spacing of switchgrass had a protective function, preventing from weeds germinating. Subsequently, legume aftereffect is observed for 2-3 years after sowing. In general, switchgrass growing in strip crop, in comparison with sole crop, provides the increase (by 0.02-0.045%) of SOM content, which results in the increase (by 0.10-0.13 kg m-2) of dry biomass yield. This is confirmed by a strong correlation between the indicators: the correlation coefficient in strip crop was r = 0.93, in mixed crop - r = 0.92 and in sole crop - r = 0.91 (p < 0.05).
   Thus, the cultivation of switchgrass by the proposed methods will improve the environment and produce sustainable biomass for the production of biofuels. In the long run, this can reduce the energy dependence of the developing countries, including Ukraine.

AB  - An Ecological Niche model was developed for skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis, SKJ) in the Eastern Central Atlantic Ocean (AO) and Western Indian Ocean (10) using an extensive set of presence data collected by the European purse seine fleet (1998-2014). Chlorophyll-a fronts were used as proxy for food availability while mixed layer depth, sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, current intensity, and height anomaly variables were selected to describe SKJ's abiotic environmental preferences. The resultant ecological niche included both mesoscale eddy-type productive features that displayed latitudinal range in the 10 to large scale upwelling systems that shrink and swell seasonally in the AO. Overall, 83% of all free swimming school sets (FSC) and 75% of drifting fish aggregating device sets (dFAD) that contained SKJ occurred within 25 km of favorable feeding habitat. In the AO, 34% of dFAD sets were made more than 100 km away from this habitat, mostly in the surface chlorophyll-a poor environment of the Guinea Current. These distant sets represent 10% of dFAD sets in the 10 and 8% of all FSC sets. Our results suggest that the Mozambique Channel in the 10, with its simultaneously favorable feeding and spawning conditions, may seasonally offer a better SKJ nursery habitat than the Guinea Current which shows a substantially poorer feeding capacity. With the exception of this latter area, our results also suggest that fishing accessibility will be higher in months where the size of the favorable feeding habitats are reduced, likely because this reduction drives a geographical contraction in SKJ populations. The observed relationship between the annual size of favorable feeding habitat and both annual catch rates and total catches in the 10 is consistent with the near-full exploitation of this stock that has occurred since the 2000s. Moreover, it suggests that annual habitat size could be used as an indicator of growth capacity for this highly productive stock. Habitat monitoring, as part of a dynamic fisheries management approach, should contribute to the sustainable exploitation of SKJ by providing information on the climate-dependent aspects of stock variability and the effects of dFAD deployment in food richhabitats.

AB  - The purse seine fishery for sardine is the most important fishery in Portugal. The aim of the present study is to assess the environmental impacts of sardine fished by the Portuguese fleet and to analyse a number of variables such as vessel size and time scale. An additional goal was to incorporate fishery-specific impact categories in the case study.
   Life Cycle Assessment methodology was applied, and data were collected from nine vessels, which represented around 10 % of the landings. Vessels were divided into two length categories, above and below 12 m, and data were obtained for the years 2005 to 2010. The study was limited to the fishing phase only. The standard impact categories included were energy use, global warming potential, eutrophication potential, acidification potential and ozone depletion potential. The fishery-specific impact categories were overfishing, overfishedness, lost potential yield, mean trophic level and the primary production required, and were quantified as much as possible.
   The landings from the data set were constituted mainly by sardine (91 %), and the remainders were other small pelagic species (e.g. horse mackerel). The most important input was the fuel, and both vessel categories had the same fuel consumption per catch 0.11 l/kg. Average greenhouse gas emissions (carbon footprint) were 0.36 kg CO2 eq. per kilo sardine landed. The fuel use varied between years, and variability between months can be even higher.
   Fishing mortality has increased, and the spawning stock biomass has decreased resulting in consequential overfishing for 2010. A correlation between fuel use and stock biomass was not found, and the stock condition does not seem to directly influence the global warming potential in this fishery. Discards were primarily non-target small pelagic species, and there was also mortality of target species resulting from slipping. The seafloor impact was considered to be insignificant due to the fishing method.
   The assessment of the Portuguese purse seine fishery resulted in no difference regarding fuel use between large and small vessels, but differences were found between years. The stock has declined, and it has produced below maximum sustainable yield. By-catch and discard data were missing but may be substantial. Even being difficult to quantify, fishery impact categories complement the environmental results with biological information and precaution is need in relation to the stock management. The sardine carbon footprint from Portuguese purse seine was lower than that of other commercial species reported in.

AB  - Phytoplankton and bacteria are sensitive indicators of environmental change. The temporal development of these key organisms was monitored from 1988 to the end of 2007 at the time series station Boknis Eck in the western Baltic Sea. This period was characterized by the adaption of the Baltic Sea ecosystem to changes in the environmental conditions caused by the conversion of the political system in the southern and eastern border states, accompanied by the general effects of global climate change. Measured variables were chlorophyll, primary production, bacteria number, -biomass and -production, glucose turnover rate, macro-nutrients, pH, temperature and salinity. Negative trends with time were recorded for chlorophyll, bacteria number, bacterial biomass and bacterial production, nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, silicate, oxygen and salinity while temperature, pH, and the ratio between bacteria numbers and chlorophyll increased. Strongest reductions with time occurred for the annual maximum values, e. g. for chlorophyll during the spring bloom or for nitrate during winter, while the annual minimum values remained more stable. In deep water above sediment the negative trends of oxygen, nitrate, phosphate and bacterial variables as well as the positive trend of temperature were similar to those in the surface while the trends of salinity, ammonia and silicate were opposite to those in the surface. Decreasing oxygen, even in the surface layer, was of particular interest because it suggested enhanced recycling of nutrients from the deep hypoxic zones to the surface by vertical mixing. The long-term seasonal patterns of all variables correlated positively with temperature, except chlorophyll and salinity. Salinity correlated negatively with all bacterial variables (as well as precipitation) and positively with chlorophyll. Surprisingly, bacterial variables did not correlate with chlorophyll, which may be inherent with the time lag between the peaks of phytoplankton and bacteria during spring. Compared to the 20-yr averages of the environmental and microbial variables, the strongest negative deviations of corresponding annual averages were measured about ten years after political change for nitrate and bacterial secondary production (similar to -60%), followed by chlorophyll (-50 %) and bacterial biomass (-40 %). Considering the circulation of surface currents in the Baltic Sea we interpret the observed patterns of the microbial variables at the Boknis Eck time series station as a consequence of the improved management of water resources after 1989 and - to a minor extent - the trends of the climate variables salinity and temperature.

AB  - This work describes short-term responses of sandy-bottom infaunal macrobenthic communities to environmental disturbances, such as episodic storms and the intertidal sewage discharge of the Mar del Plata City (38 degrees S, 57 degrees W, Argentina). Sewage discharge increases by up to 60% every summer due to tourism pressure. Episodic storms affect the area during autumn-winter and arguably have a cleaning effect on the water and sediment quality. Quantitative data on benthic communities (based on Van Veen grab samples), water and sediment variables were obtained in November 1999 and March 2000. During March the sampling was carried out before and after a storm. Parametric and non- parametric tests showed highly significant differences in both environmental (pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature, grain size and total organic carbon of sediments) and biological data (species distribution and abundances, density, species number, diversity and evenness), reflecting changes that might be related to increasing sewage discharge between November and March, and to storm effects of March. High values of pH and dissolved oxygen, including a slight stratification in the water column, as well as high values of mean grain size and total organic carbon were observed in March with the increasing sewage volume. Nevertheless, diversity and evenness showed low values, but higher density. The ratio crustacean/polychaetes + molluscs also showed low values compared to November data. Maldanid polychaetes (indicator of low content of organic matter in sediments) dominated in November, but they were replaced by the polychaete Prionospio spp. (indicator of organic enrichment in subtidal areas) and the tanaidacean Kalliapseudes schubarti in March. Before the storm event, values of both environmental and biological data returned to relatively normal conditions, but without reaching the November values, reflecting the disturbance produced by a moderate northern storm. In spite of an inappropriate replication in time, the present results strongly suggest that these changes were related to both sewage disturbance and storm effects. These data are in agreement with and explain the pattern observed in shallow-shelf benthic communities of the SW Atlantic. Implications for environmental management and decision making are discussed, because a pulse disturbance (storms) becomes a press disturbance, keeping the environment healthy in spite of strong pressure and pulse sewage-disturbances.

AB  - We investigated the ability of an assemblage of animals and plants on rocky shores in southeastern Australia to resist and/or recover from repeated pulse disturbances in the form of trampling. Disturbances of four different intensities were applied experimentally over six summers, with no human access at other times of the year. The dominant intertidal plant, the brown alga Hormosira banksii, was affected by trampling, but the effects were heterogeneous between sites. At two sites, a series of pulse disturbances produced a series of pulse responses, although the effect of a given pulse varied among years, possibly related to the severity of summer desiccating conditions each year. At the third site, pulse disturbances produced a press response; at high levels of trampling, Hormosira was almost eliminated within 2 yr, and at two intermediate levels of trampling, cover was reduced from >90 to 60-70%, where it remained for 4 yr. Effects of trampling showed little small-scale spatial variation. Untrampled areas did fluctuate through time, often as a result of summer burnoff of algae. Natural disturbances occurred irregularly through the study, and their effects varied on very small spatial scales (among plots <30 m apart).
   Trampling enhanced the densities of a range of herbivorous mollusks, especially limpets, and reduced the abundance of articulated coralline algae, which were abundant in the understory of Hormosira mats. These effects varied among sites but showed much less variation on smaller spatial scales. The reductions in coralline algae may be a direct effect of trampling, but increases in mollusk abundance occurred some time after changes to Hormosira cover, and those changes may be an indirect effect of trampling.
   We compared the effects of trampling on areas of the shore that had been trampled for two and four summers, to test whether a past history of disturbance influenced the effect of a new disturbance. No significant effects were found on algae or mobile animals, although a mild summer may have made our test of history relatively weak.
   Hormosira banksii fits the definition of a keystone species or engineer and, as such, is an appropriate focus for management and as an indicator. Spatially heterogeneous effects of a constant physical perturbation, however, mean that management of these rocky shores requires more complex models and indicate that caution should be used in adopting this species as a uniform indicator of environmental change.

AB  - Reforestation has long been the best practice to restore degraded forests due to human interventions. In this paper we investigated the effect of forest degradation (DNF) along with reforestation using 4 endemic species (Alnus subcordata, ASP; Acer velutinum, AVP; Cupressus sempervirens, CSP; Quercus castaneifolia Mey, QCP) on forest's soil chemical and biological indicators com-pared to a close-to-virgin natural forest (VNF). For this study, a total of 24 physico-chemical and 25 biological and microbial indicators were measured in soils of all 6 forest stands along with the litter properties. Results showed that the lowest soil quality was observed under DNF, CSP, and QCP which was the result of forest cover degradation in DNF and low litter quality, especially low pH and high C:N, in CSP and QCP. Soil fauna communities were significantly af-fected by tree species. We found two times higher density of earthworms in VNF compared to ASP, but in DNF the density was 5 times lower than VNF. We found no epigeic earthworms in QCP, CSP and DNF and no endogeic earth-worms in DNF. Acarina and Collembola density was high in VNF and ASP, but they showed significant differences (VNF>ASP), and their density sharply de-creased in other stands, especially in CSP (3 times lower than VNF) and DNF (8 to 10 times lower than VNF). Nematode density was statistically equal in VNF, ASP, and AVP, but significantly lower in other stands. Protozoa, bacteria and fungi densities were significantly higher in VNF and ASP (VNF>ASP) compared to each other and other forest stands. Basal respiration, substrate induced res-piration, microbial biomass N and P, and carbon availability index was also higher in VNF and ASP compared to other stands. Although VNF has the best condition because of old forest cover and high diversity, ASP soil showed sig-nificant improvements, demonstrating the importance of litter quality in soil restoration. Restoration effectiveness ranking of the four tested species on soil improvement are therefore ASP>AVP>QCP>CSP. The significant improvement of soil quality under ASP compared to other reforestated stands, only after 3 decades, emphasizes the importance of tree species selection and litter qual-ity on soil chemical and biological restoration.

AB  - Simple Summary To mitigate the adverse impacts of stressful environmental conditions on poultry and to promote the animal's health and growth performance, antibiotics at sub-therapeutic doses have been added to poultry diets as growth promoters. Nevertheless, the improper and overuse of antibiotics as feed additives have played a major role in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and increased levels of antibiotic residues in animal products, which have disastrous effects on the health of both animals and humans. Postbiotics, used as dietary additives for livestock, could be potential alternatives to antibiotics. Postbiotics produced from the probioticLactobacillus plantarumhave been the subject of several recent kinds of research. However, the researchers have very rarely considered the effect of postbiotics on the broilers under heat stress. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the impacts of feeding different postbiotics on oxidative stress markers, physiological stress indicators, lipid profile and meat quality in heat-stressed broilers. A total of 252 male Cobb 500 (22-day-old) were fed with 1 of 6 diets: A basal diet without any supplementation as negative control (NC); basal diet + 0.02% oxytetracycline served as positive control (PC); basal diet + 0.02% ascorbic acid (AA); or the basal diet diet + 0.3% of RI11, RS5 or UL4 postbiotics. Postbiotics supplementation, especially RI11 increased plasma activity of total-antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH), and decreased alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) and ceruloplasmin (CPN) compared to NC and PC groups. Meat malondialdehyde (MDA) was lower in the postbiotic groups than the NC, PC and AA groups. Plasma corticosterone, heat shock protein70 (HSP70) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were not affected by dietary treatments. Postbiotics decreased plasma cholesterol concentration compared to other groups, and plasma triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) compared to the NC group. Postbiotics increased breast meat pH, and decreased shear force and lightness (L*) compared to NC and PC groups. The drip loss, cooking loss and yellowness (b*) were lower in postbiotics groups compared to other groups. In conclusion, postbiotics particularly RI11 could be used as an alternative to antibiotics and natural sources of antioxidants for heat-stressed broilers.

AB  - Simple Summary Animals are kept in captivity for various reasons worldwide. Throughout its range countries, the Asian elephant is used for various purposes, with a significant proportion of the remaining population working as draft and transport animals in the timber industry. However, captivity can also lead to compromises in welfare that need to be quantified for successful intervention. A key way of assessing an animal's well-being in wildlife and zoo biology is to measure its stress. Previous studies have found positive, negative, or no relationship between two commonly used measures of stress: stress hormones and the ratio of two types of white blood cells-heterophils to lymphocytes. Our study is one of the first to show a positive and consistent link between these two measures in semi-captive Asian elephants from Myanmar, irrespective of sex, age, or environmental context. Our results show that using the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio from blood smears on-site may offer a potentially cheaper and faster way to determine stress than measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in the laboratory.
   Abstract Animals are kept in captivity for various reasons, but species with a slower pace of life may adapt to captive environments less easily, leading to welfare concerns and the need to assess stress reliably in order to develop effective interventions. Our aim was to assess welfare of semi-captive timber elephants from Myanmar by investigating the relationship between two physiological markers of stress commonly used as proxies for welfare, faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (FGM) and heterophil/lymphocyte ratios (H/L), and link these measures to changes in body condition (determined by body weight). We further assessed how robustly these two markers of stress performed in animals of different age or sex, or in different ecological contexts. We measured FGM concentrations and H/L ratios between 2016 and 2018 from 316 samples of 75 females and 49 males ranging in age from 4 to 68. We found a positive and consistent link between FGMs and H/L ratios in Asian elephants, irrespective of their sex, age, or ecological context. Our results will help to inform managers of (semi-) captive elephants about using heterophil/lymphocyte ratio data from blood smears on site as a potentially cheaper and faster alternative to determining stress than measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations in the laboratory.

AB  - Soil moisture is a major component of the hydrologic cycle, being highly variable and nonlinear in space and time. Knowledge of soil moisture regime, especially at the root zone, is critical to the management of water resources and restoration of vegetation. As such, techniques that allow identifying and reducing the number of samples for soil moisture analysis are required. In this study, a spatial variability and temporal stability analysis were used to analyze the volumetric soil moisture content of root zone collected by neutron probe at 36 days during three years in Shapotou, China. The specific concern was to investigate the temporal stability of soil moisture at different depths in the soil profile, determine the effects of soil and vegetation characteristics on temporal stability, and to conduct such a study in an area larger than 1 km(2). Additionally, we aimed to determine whether temporally stable sites are invariable at different depths, and compare with temporally stable shallow layer (0-6, 0-15, 0-30 cm) sites that are previously identified by Wang et al. (2013b) in the same study area. Results showed that the mean soil profile moisture demonstrated a moderate spatial variability which decreased with increasing soil moisture content at 0-60 cm depth; however, the variability of soil moisture and CV were both low and no significant correlations were found at 0-300 cm depth. A high temporal stability existed at two deeper soil layers compared with the soil surface observed by Wang et al. (2013b). The sampling locations, representative of the dry conditions in the field, were always more temporally stable. Identified representative locations at two depths well-represented the mean soil moisture content in our study area larger than 1 km2. Furthermore, strong correlations at two soil layers revealed that spatial patterns of sampling points were preserved for all depths and that time stability of shallow measurements was a good indicator of deep soil layer time stability. Soil texture was the primary influence factor on soil profile moisture temporal stability and the dependence of soil moisture temporal stability on soil texture was consistent among different soil depths. Knowledge of the underlying stable soil moisture distribution could provide a useful basis for precise water management in arid areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Morant wetlands bays (Foul and Folly Bays) are contiguous with the Great Morass, a large wetland located at the extreme eastern end of the island of Jamaica. A multidisciplinary ecological assessment of the bays was conducted from April 2007-May 2008 aimed at generating a baseline of conditions to confirm the trophic status and importance of the area thus providing support for its designation as a protected area. Water column assessment included zooplankton and phytoplankton collections for 12 months at 11 stations. Zooplankton tows were conducted using a 200 pm net (0.5 m hoop diameter) contemporaneous with 5 1 Niskin bottle casts for phytoplankton. Zooplankton abundances were determined for nine functional groups (calanoids, cyclopoids, harpacticoids, nauplii, copepodites, carnivores: medusa and chaetognaths, larvaceans and larvae) for which equivalent biomass was generated using conversion factors based on previous studies in Jamaica. Total phytoplankton biomass (mg Chl a m(-3)) was determined directly using filtration (onto a 0.7 mu m filter) and fluorometry while detritus was estimated using the model. Ecopath with Ecosim 5.1 was then used to model the trophic interactions of the planktonic community in the Morant wetlands bays. 116 different taxa of zooplankton were identified with a mean total abundance ranging from 282 +/- 56 to 3459 +/- 752 animals m(-3) across the annual cycle. Total phytoplankton biomass (Chlorophyll a) ranged from 0.14.+/- 0.04 to 0.34 +/- 0.2 mg m(-3) across the annual cycle. A similar study in a pristine bay (Discovery Bay) on the north coast of Jamaica indicated mean zooplankton abundances between 1077 +/- 191 and 3794 +/- 4-87 animals m(-3) and phytoplankton biomass between 0.4 and 0.8 mg m(-3). The plankton parameters suggest that Foul and Folly Bays are even more pristine than Discovery Bay and the Ecopath model indicated that unlike Discovery Bay, these Morant wetlands bays were far more resilient and therefore able to recover from stresses (e.g. eutrophication). However, there is still need for protection of this pristine area as the high abundance of larvae coupled with fast flowing currents through the bays provides evidence that this area could be an important source of larvae to other areas of Jamaica's south coast.

AB  - Over the last decade, the fishing industry in Ukraine has a negative trend, while in the other CEE countries (Belarus, Poland, and The Czech Republic) there is an increase in production. The study highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the industry in Ukraine and its international trade capacity in comparison with some other CEE countries. It is stated that the economic efficiency of growing domestic fishery products is determined by the level of its costs and market price impacted by producers to a much higher extent than in any other type of agricultural product.
   We determine that the main problem with regard to accounting and analytical support of biological transformations in fisheries is the lack of theoretical substantiation and the imperfection of the methodology of accounting management of the costs of biological transformations in the field. It is emphasized that the basic condition for effective management of costs for the production of fishery products and providing accounting information about them is the existence of sound accounting methodology for managing the costs of biological transformation.
   Controlled (relevant) segments in the fisheries sector are identified to solve the problem with their simultaneous division into separate production processes (repartitions). The application of the proposed classification of production redistribution will improve the system of synthetic and analytical accounting of biological assets and biological transformations and will provide information needed for managers.
   The influence of organizational and technological peculiarities of the aquaculture production process on the developing of the accounting system of fishery enterprises has been investigated which gives the opportunity to develop and implement an adequate accounting system of cost management at the enterprises of the branch. It is stated that the main prerequisite for effective cost management is the objective display of cost information in space and time.
   We propose to appoint the cost of production of fishery products at the end of each production redistribution. At the end of the calendar year, the costs of each redistribution the cycle of which has not been completed should be considered as an unfinished production of the fisheries industry. The expediency of accepting the total volume of production in natural meters as the basis for the distribution of indirect fisheries costs is substantiated. The examples of calculations and accounting approaches are given to support the authors' statements and conclusions.

AB  - Estuarine eutrophication as a result of agricultural land use, including the use of chemical fertilizers, is increasing worldwide. Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada has very high agricultural intensity by international standards with approximately 44% of the land area under production, and some watersheds in excess of 75% agricultural land-use. The type of agriculture is also intensive with primarily row crops that have high chemical fertilizer and pesticide usage. In light of these stressors, the hypothesis of this study was that mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) population parameters would change with point and nonpoint source pollution, and that multivariate statistics could be used to draw associations with specific stressors. Fish were sampled on a monthly basis from May through August at 7 estuaries spanning a range of land use, nutrient, and contaminant loadings. A suite of environmental variables were simplified into 3 principal components: PC1 representing agricultural land use, N loading, and plant habitat, PC2 being dominated by sediment sand and silt distribution, and PC3 largely reflecting P loading and sediment organic matter. There were significant differences in abundance of both adult and young-of-the-year mummichog, and these changes associated most strongly with PC1, the largely N-driven agricultural influences. In contrast, somatic variables such as liver and gonad size did not show strong association with the environmental quality principal component scores. The sand and silt PC2 appeared to have the opposite association with the biological data, with siltier environments correlating to older, larger, less dense populations of mummichog. Although pesticide residues were detected in estuarine sediment, there was no clear relationship between these and watershed agricultural intensity or biochemical indicators. There was, however, a strong relationship between agricultural environmental variables (PC1) and in vitro steroid production that is suggestive of a potential chemical effect. Eutrophication appeared to be a primary stressor affecting mummichog populations, as nutrient enrichment was associated with changes in habitat variables and these in turn were associated with high mummichog density. Thus, mummichog population demographics appear to have use as an indicator of adverse or worsening conditions in estuaries. We concluded that, based on the subset of environmental factors evaluated, the nonpoint-source inputs of sediments and nutrients exerted the greatest influence on mummichog populations in PEI estuaries.

AB  - Soil quality (SQ) evaluation is an essential tool for the enhancement of agricultural soil management and use. An array of soil attributes, termed soil quality indicators, are used in soil quality estimation due to their sensitivity to disturbance from management practices. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the soil quality (using multivariate ordination technique) of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis, Jacq.) plantations amended with on-farm biomass. The experimental sites were three oil palm plantations located in the southernmost Pattani province of Thailand namely, Ban Chamao (BC), Ban Lipasango (BL) and Ban Bothong (BB) fertilised with fish effluent (FE), empty fruit bunch (EFB) compost and NPK (plus EFB mulch), respectively with completely randomised block design. A minimum dataset (MDS) of soil indicators were defined using multivariate principal component analysis (PCA). The selected MDS comprised mainly geometric mean of microbial enzyme activity (GME), available phosphorus (AP) and moisture content (MC) with per cent contribution towards soil quality index (SQI) (assessed based on PCA after scoring by normalised linear function) in the order: GME (77.3%) > AP (13.6%) > MC (9.1%). Essentially, the activity of enzymes is a crucial ecosystem function (nutrient cycling), further indicating that decreases in soil enzyme activities can be signal for a decline in SQ. GME, AP, and MC effectively differentiated the oil palm plantations and could be important not only in monitoring soil quality enhancement in the present study locations but also in a similar tropical environment with similar edaphic conditions. SQI was not significantly different between the BB (0.81) and BL (0.79) plantations (p = 0.46). However, both BB and BL were higher than in BC (0.65). BB and BL showed low geometric mean of microbial biomass GMB, high soil pH, C, N, GME and qCO(2) (metabolic quotient, i.e., the amount of CO2 respired per unit microbial biomass), while the fish effluent amended BC plantation showed the opposite. EFB contains a substantial quantity of nutrients and organic matter (OM) capable of reducing soil acidity, stimulating enzyme activity, and enriching the soil with nutrients with the resultant improvement in SQ. Therefore, a regular practice of returning EFB (either as compost or mulch, with or without mineral NPK) to the soil should be encouraged for smallholder oil palm plantations to improve soil quality and serves as an alternative channel for on-farm biomass disposal.

AB  - Background Prescribed fire is increasingly used to accomplish management goals in fire-adapted systems, yet our understanding of effects on non-target organisms remains underdeveloped. Terricolous lichens in the genus Cladonia P. Browne, particularly cushion-forming reindeer lichens belonging to Cladonia subgenus Cladina Nyl., fit into this category, being characteristic of fire-adapted ecosystems, yet highly vulnerable to damage or consumption during burns. Moreover, inherently slow dispersal and growth rates raise questions about how to conserve these taxa in the context of fire-mediated restoration management. This research was undertaken to identify factors that contribute to Cladonia persistence within areas subject to repeated burning and involved tracking the fate of 228 spatially isolated individuals distributed across seven sites previously burned zero to two times. Site selection was determined by edaphic factors associated with a rare inland dune woodland community type known to support relatively high densities of Cladonia. Results Evaluated across all sites, the post-burn condition of Cladonia subtenuis (Abbayes) Mattick samples, categorized as intact (32%), fragmented (33%), or consumed (36%) individuals, approximated a uniform distribution. However, their status was highly variable at the different sites, where from 0 to 70% were assessed as intact and 11 to 60% consumed. Machine-learning statistical techniques were used to identify the factors most strongly associated with fire damage, drawing from variables describing the proximate fuel bed, growth substrate, and fire weather. The final descriptive model was dominated by variables characterizing the understory fuel matrix. Conclusions Areas with highly contiguous fuels dominated by pyrogenic pine needles were most likely to result in consumption of individual Cladonia, whereas those growing in areas with low fuel continuity or in areas dominated by hardwood litter were more likely to persist (intact or as fragments). Further, substrates including bare soil and moss mats afforded more protection than coarse woody debris or leaf litter in settings where fuels were both contiguous and highly flammable. Our findings describe the characteristics of within-site fire refugia, the abundance of which may be enhanced over time through restoration and maintenance treatments including thinning, promotion of mixed-species overstory composition, and periodic burning. Because lichens contribute to, and are considered reliable indicators of forest health, fire-based restoration management efforts will benefit from improved understanding of how these vulnerable organisms are able to persist.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in leaf-litter breakdown rates due to flow regulation, through weirs and water diversions, in headwater mountain streams. In order to find common patterns and reveal singularities that might occur in different regions, we studied 17 streams located in 4 different climatic regions of the peninsular Spain (Cornisa Cantabrica, Cordillera Litoral Catalana, Sierra de Guadarrama, and Sierra Nevada). Regions showed a continentality gradient (assessed using the Gorczynski continentality index) from 7.7% (Cornisa Cantabrica) to 32% (Sierra Nevada). We hypothesized that stream regulation would impair habitat conditions and guilds associated with leaf litter breakdown, leading to a slowdown of litter breakdown rates. We further hypothesized that the extent to which breakdown rates changed downstream of fluvial regulation would depend on the combination of the nature and scale of the fluvial regulation and the environmental setting of each region. In all cases we found that leaf litter breakdown rates were lower downstream of the regulation. This change was most pronounced in the Sierra Nevada region, where the breakdown rate decreased by 50.7%, and least pronounced in the streams of Cornisa Cantabrica, where breakdown rates decreased by 20.8% downstream of regulation. In terms of the Gorczynski index, the extent to which fluvial regulation led to slow down litter breakdown decreased from continental to oceanic regions. Richness and sporulation rates of aquatic hyphomycetes did not show significant differences either between upstream and downstream sites, or between regions. In all regions we detected a consistent trend of lower abundance and biomass of shredders colonizing litter bags in sites downstream of flow regulation. Also, there were significant differences in the composition of macroinvertebrate communities between regions, which could be the cause of the differences in the leaf litter breakdown rates observed from one region to another. We conclude that changes of stream flow rates in headwaters slow down leaf litter breakdown rates downstream of the disturbance, but the magnitude of this slowdown is substantially influenced by the continentality of the region in which the stream is located. The differences in breakdown rates between upstream and downstream sites can be mainly ascribed to a reduction in shredder abundance in the latter, which is likely to be caused by altered in-stream habitat and riparian vegetation downstream of the point of flow regulation.

AB  - In organic agriculture, weeds and nitrogen deficiency are the main factors that limit crop production. The use of relay-intercropped forage legumes may be a way of providing ecological services such as weed control, increasing N availability in the cropping system thanks to N fixation, reducing N leaching and supplying nitrogen to the following crop. However, these ecological services can vary considerably depending on the growing conditions. The aim of this study was to identify early indicators to assess these two ecological services, thereby giving farmers time to adjust the management of both the cover crop and of the following crop.
   Nine field experiments were conducted over a period of three years. In each experiment, winter wheat was grown as sole crop or intercropped with one of two species of forage legumes; Trifolium repens L. or Trifolium pratense L Two levels of fertilization were also tested (0 and 100 kg N ha(-1)). After the intercropping stage, the cover crop was maintained until the end of winter and then destroyed by plowing before maize was sown. Legume and weed biomass, nitrogen content and accumulation were monitored from legume sowing to cover destruction.
   Our results showed that a minimum threshold of about 2 t ha(-1) biomass in the aboveground parts of the cover crop was needed to decrease weed infestation by 90% in early September and to ensure weed control up to December. The increase in nitrogen in the following maize crop was also correlated with the legume biomass in early September. The gain in nitrogen in maize (the following crop) was correlated with legume biomass in early September, with a minimum gain of 60 kg N ha(-1) as soon as legume biomass reached more than 2 t ha(-1).
   Legume biomass in early September thus appears to be a good indicator to predict weed control in December as well as the nitrogen released to the following crop. The indicator can be used by farmers as a management tool for both the cover crop and following cash crop. Early estimation of available nitrogen after the destruction of the forage legume can be used to adjust the supply of nitrogen fertilizer to the following crop. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Solid reservoir bitumens collected from Xujiahe (Upper Triassic, T(3)x), Feixianguan (Lower Triassic T(i)f) and Changxing Formation (Upper Permian, P(2)c) in Puguang and Yuanba gas fields and from Huanglong Formation (Middle Carboniferous, C(2)h) in western Hubei-eastern Chongqing region, the northeast of Sichuan basin, were systematically analyzed for bulk and molecular compositions, to investigate their genesis, character and origin. These bitumens are primarily characterized by poor solubility (ratios of chloroform extract over TOC < 8% mostly), high reflectance (equivalent Ro > 1.4%) and low H/C atomic ratios ( < 0.6), suggesting that they are derived from their original reservoired oil or migrated hydrocarbon by thermal degradation into gas, belonging to a pyrobiturnen. Most bitumens in carbonate reservoir of Feixianguan and Changing formations exhibit relatively high atomic ratios of S/C (mostly in 0.025 to 0.085), with delta(34) S values ranging mainly from 12 parts per thousand to 24 parts per thousand, indicating a proportion of them possibly resulted from TSR. Unusual biomarker composition and distribution, such as bimodal distribution in n-alkanes, reduced Pr/Ph value, undifferentiated distribution in steranes and terpanes and reversal isomerization in sterane, are observed in these over-mature bitumens, and thus their conventional geochernical significances appear lost. However, the ratios of 2,6-/2,10-DMP, I,7-/1,9-DMP and 4-/I-MDBT in aromatic fraction are considered to be useful indicators for biological organic source and sedimentary environment of the source rocks from which the initial oils for the bitumens are derived. The aromatic ratios are relatively high in the bitumens of Xujiahe terrestrial reservoir, indicating a dominant terrigenous source input and oxic depositional environment for their source rocks. In contrast, they are significantly lower in the bitumens of Feixianguan, Changing and Huanglong marine reaservoirs, suggesting an organic source predominated by aquatic organisms and a reducing condition. According to correlation between bitumens and source rocks by carbon isotopes and relative composition of dibenzothiophene series, the reservoir bitumens in Xujiahe Formation are believed to originate from adjacent source rock within this sequence, and those in Feixianguan and Changing formations both from Permian source rock. Since Huanglong solid reservoir bitumen studied is isotopically heavier (delta(13) C values from - 23.2 parts per thousand to - 26.4 parts per thousand), the original hydrocarbon could be primarily sourced from Mid-Lower Silurian Hanjiadian and Xiaoheba source rocks, rather than Longmaxi Formation.

AB  - Background and Aims Calotropis procera and Calotropis gigantea, originally from warm parts of Africa and Asia, are now pan-tropical and in ecological terms considered an indicator of overgrazed, disturbed lands; they grow successfully in dry areas. Variations in water relations, morphology and photosynthesis of the two species growing in the same habitat were studied to assess possible mechanisms of tolerance to drought and how these relate to their ecophysiological success. Also the hypothesis that their photosynthetic rate (A) under drought would be affected by stomatal and non-stomatal limitations was tested.
   Methods Water relations, gas exchange, water use efficiency (WUE), fluorescence parameters, pubescence and specific leaf area (SLA) of Calotropis procera and C. gigantea plants growing in the field were evaluated during the wet (WS) and dry (DS) seasons.
   Results The xylem water potential (psi) was similar in both species during the WS and DS; drought caused a 28 % decrease of psi. In C. procera, A, stomatal conductance (g(s)) and carboxylation efficiency (CE) were higher in the WS with half the values of those during the DS, this species being more affected by drought than C. gigantea. A high delta C-13 of C. gigantea (-26.2 parts per thousand) in the WS indicated a higher integrated WUE, in agreement with its lower g(s). Leaves of C. gigantea were more pubescent than C. procera. Relative stomatal and non-stomatal limitation of A increased with drought in both species; no changes in maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII; F-v/F-m) were observed. The decrease in the relative quantum yield of PSII (phi(PSII)) and in the photochemical quenching coefficient (q(P)) was more pronounced in C. procera than in C. gigantea.
   Conclusions The photosynthetic capacity of C. procera was higher than that of C. gigantea. During the DS, A was regulated by stomatal and non-stomatal factors in a coordinated manner and drought did not cause chronic photoinhibition. A higher density of trichomes and leaf angle in C. gigantea may contribute to the maintenance of A and confer more efficient protection of photochemical activity in the DS. Ecophysiological traits such as high photosynthetic rate throughout the year even during the DS, and high WUE, highly pubescent leaves and low SLA observed in both species contribute to the establishment and growth of Calotropis in dry conditions.

AB  - Whole oil GC-MS was used to characterize selected polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in a suite of marine crude oils derived from source rocks deposited under different conditions. The selected PAH consist primarily of 2- and 3-ring aromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalenes (to C-4), fluorenes (to C-3), phenanthrenes (to C-4) and dibenzothiophenes (to C-3), as well as several 4- and 5-ring compounds. Concentrations of the selected PAH range from 2294 to 129,170 ppm and typically comprise between 1% and 20% of the total C-12+ aromatic fraction. PAH compositions in all source types are dominated by naphthalenes. These compounds comprise between 41.9% and 88.9% of the total PAH measured. The greatest difference between oils lies in the relative abundance of dibenzothiophenes. Their abundance rivals that of naphthalenes in the carbonate oils (up to 41.7% of total PAH) but is exceedingly low in the paralic oils (< 2.1% of total PAH). These differences, which reflect differences in elastic content, Eh-pH, and availability of reduced sulfur in the source rock depositional environment, are captured in the ratio DBT/P, calculated as the sum of all dibenzothiophenes relative to phenanthrenes. DBT/P is greater than 1.0 in most carbonate-sourced oils but ranges between 0.08 and 0.18 in the paralic-sourced oils. Siliciclastic-sourced oils are intermediate, with values ranging from 0.14 to 0.87 (average 0.40). All oils show a predominance of alkylated PAH homologues over the unsubstituted parent, however, the maximum degree of alkylation (the most abundant alkylated homologues within any given PAH series) varies. Carbonate-sourced oils show a high degree of alkylation, often maximizing at C-3 or C-4, while paralic-sourced oils generally exhibit a lower degree of alkylation in which the C-1 or C-2 isomers predominate. Siliciclastic-sourced oils are intermediate, with alkylation maximizing between the C-2 and C-3 isomers. We propose that these alkylation trends reflect differences in the PAH precursor moieties in source kerogens and/or variations in the thermal history of the source types, i.e., milder thermal history for the carbonate oils relative to paralic and siliciclastic oils.

AB  - A regional survey of the forests in north-eastern New South Wales recorded eight species of nocturnal forest birds and nine species of arboreal marsupials from 291 sites. These forests are an important source of diversity for nocturnal bird and mammal species compared with the two other regions in south-eastern Australia (south-eastern New South Wales and the Central Highlands of Victoria) where similar studies have been undertaken.
   Three major environmental gradients accounting for the distribution of these species in north-eastern New South Wales were identified. The dominant gradient contrasted higher-elevation forests in the western half of the region with lower-elevation forests nearer the coast. The second gradient contrasted wet forest types having a dense mesic understorey with dry forest types having an open or sparse understorey. The third gradient represented logging intensity. Characteristic assemblages of species were associated with each end of these three gradients. A core group of species occurred across a wide range of environmental conditions, including logged and unlogged forest.
   Most species occurred with similar frequency in logged and unlogged forest. However, limitations in the design of this study, which reflect regional land-use patterns, restrict the untangling of interactions between forest type, elevation and management history. The more disturbed, lower-elevation forests appeared to be the most species-rich environments but the greatest numbers of animals were recorded in the highland forests of the region. The greater glider (Petauroides volans), whose stronghold is the higher-elevation forests, was identified as the species most sensitive to heavy logging, although numbers of this species were similar in selectively logged and unlogged forests.
   Many of the species recorded in this study are known to use hollows in large old trees for breeding and diurnal shelter. Management attention needs to be directed towards establishing the threshold levels of retention for hollow-bearing trees and for patches of undisturbed vegetation. The establishment of a comprehensive network of retained undisturbed vegetation along most gully systems in the region would seem to be a prudent course of action to maintain biological diversity. As more of the landscape in the region becomes altered by intensive logging or clearing for agricultural and urban land uses, it will be necessary to carefully plan and refine management prescriptions to maintain wildlife habitat components.

AB  - This article reviews the nano-effects and applications of different crystalline nano-titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2), iden-tifies their discharge, distribution, behavior, and toxicity to aquatic organisms (focusing on microbial aggregates) in sewage and surface-water, summarizes related toxicity mechanisms, and critically proposes future perspectives. The results show that: 1) based on crystal type, application boundaries of nano-TiO2 have become clear, extending from traditional manufacturing to high-tech fields; 2) concentration of nano-TiO2 in water is as high as hundreds of thou-sands of mu g/L (sewage) or several to dozens of mu g/L (surface-water) due to direct application or indirect release; 3) water environmental behaviors of nano-TiO2 are mainly controlled by hydration conditions and particle character-istics; 4) aquatic toxicities of nano-TiO2 are closely related to their water environmental behavior, in which crystal type and tested species (such as single species and microbial aggregates) also play the key role. Going forward, the explo-ration of the toxicity mechanism will surely become a hot topic in the aquatic-toxicology of nano-TiO2, because most of the research so far has focused on the responses of biological indicators (such as metabolism and damage), while little is known about the stress imprint caused by the crystal structures of nano-TiO2 in water environments. Additionally, the aging of nano-TiO2 in a water environment should be heeded to because the continuously changing surface structure is bound to have a significant impact on its behavior and toxicity. Moreover, for microbial aggregates, comprehensive response analysis should be conducted in terms of the functional activity, surface features, composition structure, internal microenvironment, cellular and molecular level changes, etc., to find the key point of the interaction between nano-TiO2 and microbial aggregates, and to take mitigation or beneficial measures to deal with the aquatic-toxicity of nano-TiO2. In short, this article contributes by 1) reviewing the research status of nano-TiO2 in all aspects: application and discharge, distribution and behavior, and its aquatic toxicity; 2) suggesting the response mechanism of microbial aggregates and putting forward the toxigenic mechanism of nanomaterial structure; 3) pointing out the fu-ture research direction of nano-TiO2 in water environment.

AB  - Escherichia coli is used as an indicator of fecal pollution at beaches despite evidence of long-term survival in sand. This work investigated the basis for the survival of E. coli through field microcosm experiments and phylotypic characterization of >1,400 E. coli isolates recovered from sand, sewage, and gulls, enabling the identification of long-surviving populations and environmental drivers of their persistence. Microcosms containing populations of E. coli from each source (n =176) were buried in the backshore of Lake Michigan for 45 and 96 days under several different nutrient treatments, including unaltered native sand, sterile autoclaved sand, and baked nutrient-depleted sand. The availabilities of carbon and nitrogen, as well as competition with the indigenous community, were major factors that influenced E. coli survival. E. coli Clermont phylotypes B1 and A were the dominant phylotypes surviving seasonally (>6 weeks), regardless of source and nutrient treatment, whereas cryptic Glade and D/E phylotypes survived over the winter (>300 days). Autoclaved sand, presumably supplying nutrients through increased availability, promoted growth, and the presence of the indigenous microbial community reduced this effect. Screening of 849 sand E. coli isolates from four freshwater beaches demonstrated that B1 and D/E were the most common phylotypes recovered. Analysis by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the Gull2, Lachno3, and HB human markers demonstrated that only 25% of the samples had evidence of gull waste and none of the samples had evidence of human waste. These findings suggest that the prevalence of E. coli in sand could be attributed more to long-term-surviving populations than to new fecal pollution.
   IMPORTANCE Fecal pollution monitoring still relies on E. coli enumeration, despite the fact that this organism can survive for prolonged periods and has been shown to be easily transported from sand into surrounding waters through waves and runoff, thus no longer representing recent fecal pollution events. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that regardless of the host source, certain genetically distinct subgroups, or phylotypes, survive longer than others under conditions typical of Great Lakes beach sites. We found that nutrients were a major driver of survival and could actually promote growth and that the presence of native microorganisms modulated these effects. These insights into the dynamics and drivers of survival will improve the interpretation of E. coli measurements at beaches and inform strategies that could focus on reducing nutrient inputs to beaches or maintaining a robust natural microbiome in beach sand.

AB  - Filtration calculations of drainage are a fundamental task of reclamation hydrogeology. They are necessary both during irrigation of lands (prevention of salinization) and during their drainage. The most important parameters of closed drainage, as the main means of regulating the level of groundwater and their runoff to water intakes, are the distance between the drains and the depth of drainage. These parameters depend on a combination of hydrogeological, climatic and relief-forming factors. Drainage degree of the territory is characterized by a drainage module. The value of the drainage module provides the water removing from the soil to the required drainage rate for a specified period and is one of the factors of the hydrological effect of the drainage. Existing equations for the calculation of distances between the drains are analyzed. Two methods of calculating agricultural drainage parameters are presented: a hydromechanical method based on theoretical principles of water movement in natural and technical systems and an empirical method based on the statistical data processing of field researches. These methods have both advantages and disadvantages. They include many factors of drainage parameters that represent the technical, economic and environmental effect of drainage. On the basis of the research results, a structural and logical scheme is presented. This scheme describes the influence of hydrological conditions (climatic, soil, relief) and the hydrological effect of drainage on drainage parameters of drained territories. To investigate the influence of variability of the main factors on the distance between the drains, we used the equation with DBN B.2.4-1-99. Also, we took into account the results of the researches of O.J. Oliynyk and Ai Murashko. Methods of statistical modeling and methods of probability theory were also used. Based on these methods, mathematical models have been developed to determine the standard deviation of the function factor. The drainage module, which characterizes the intensity of soil and territory drainage, is formed by the value of drainage rate, filtration rate, and excess water drainage time. Also, the drainage module has a great influence on the distance between the drains (86 % ... 98 %). Based on the probabilistic method of estimating the drainage module, it is calculated that the distance between the drains can be increased by 1.10 ...1.23 times (probability of non-exceeding Pu = 0.95...0.99) without reducing their efficiency.

As the discourse of popular science is a stage in the formation of the average meaning of terminological lexis and the most sustained and long-lasting area of functioning after a special discourse, in order to obtain vocabulary for neological dictionaries, the author recommends tracking terminology units in popular science publications and articles on scientific and technical achievements in the resources targeted to the average addressee. Second, the main criterion for the selection of neologisms-the "time of first fixation"-is insufficient in relation to terminological innovation. Due to the diffusion of the boundary between common and special areas, during the work on the vocabulary for neological dictionaries, it is necessary to exclude from consideration accidental occurrences of terminological lexis in mass sources as special cases of terminological "noise". This is why the frequency of occurrences of terminological lexis should be monitored when compiling dictionaries that record long-term changes (ten, thirty years) in lexis and dictionaries that cover one-year periods, and low-frequency cases should not be included in the vocabulary. Therefore, the main condition for the inclusion of terminological lexis in a dictionary of neologisms should be the moment of the activation of its uses in popular science discourse in texts of mass publications. Special lexis introduced into a new functional environment, common language, is regularly accompanied by discourse indicators: the neoterm is surrounded with words denoting novelty; translation, definition, synonymous substitution, explanation, reference to analogy, comparison, list of properties, decoding of new abbreviations, enclosing the neoterm in quotation marks, its accompanying with the collocation tak nazyvaemyy (so-called). Such markers draw attention to the novelty of the notion and offer its proper interpretation. From the moment of its introduction into non-special texts, the term functions both in professional or scientific discourse as a precise term and in common language as a general idea of the term, which indicates that the term's determinologisation begins. The research has also shown a significant heterogeneity of the terms. Terms of the beginning of the 21st century are discrete in composition: but for Russian-language terms (hoverbayk [hoverbike], gorod-gubka [sponge-city]), nominations in the source language (Big Data, NISQ) and word-formation components in foreign language (Bitcoin-koshelek [Bitcoinwallet]) function in texts.

AB  - Grazing is widely regarded as a critical factor affecting the vegetation community structure, productivity and nutritional value of natural grasslands. To protect and restore degraded grasslands, fencing is considered as a valuable tool. However, it is not clear whether long term fencing of grazers can improve the condition and nutritional values of vegetation community and soil properties. We have compared the impact of long term fencing and continuous grazing on vegetation community structure, nutritional values and soil properties of alpine meadow of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by field investigation (11-13 years) and indoor analysis during 2015-2017. Our results showed that long-term fencing clearly increased the above ground biomass and coverage of plant functional types. Long-term fencing improved the development of four plant functional types (GG, grass species group; SG, sedge species group; LG, leguminous species group and FG, forbs species group), but inhibited the growth of noxious species (NG). Long-term fencing significantly improved soil TN, TP, TK, AN, AP and AK in 0-10 cm soil layer, considerable effect on the improvement of soil TN, TP, AN, AP and AK in 10-20 cm soil layer and soil TP, AN, AP and AK in 20-30 cm soil layer were observed. However, long-term fencing significantly decreased biodiversity indicators i.e., Richness index, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Evenness index of vegetation community. A substantial decrease in the density, biodiversity and nutritional values (CP, IVTD and NDF) of four edible plants functional types (GG, SG, LG and FG) were recorded. While a downward trend in the TN, AN, AP and AK of above ground biomass and soil were observed during 2015-2017 in alpine meadows due to long term grazing. The density, diversity and nutritional value (CP and IVTD) of long-term fencing alpine meadows showed a downward trend over time (2015-2017). By considering the biodiversity conservation and grassland livestock production, long-term fencing is not beneficial for the improvement of density, biodiversity and nutritional values of plant functional types. Thus, our study suggests that rotational fencing and grazing would be a good management strategy to restore and improve the biodiversity and nutritional values of plant functional types in natural grassland ecosystem.

AB  - Kuroshio, the strongest west boundary current of the Pacific Ocean, has significant impacts on the oceanographic conditions and ecological processes of the Pacific-Asian marginal seas through exchange of water, heat, and materials. In two cruises organized in the East China Sea (ECS) and the Yellow Sea in the spring 2014, observations of picosized and nanosized phytoplankton assemblages using flow cytometry reflected potential impacts of Kuroshio intrusion on phytoplankton communities, particularly in the ECS. The distribution pattern of Prochlorococcus in the ECS clearly depicts the intrusion route of Nearshore Kuroshio Branch Current from the main stream of Kuroshio northeast to Taiwan Island to the coastal waters adjacent to the Changjiang River estuary, an important red tide zone in the coastal waters of China. High abundance of photosynthetic nanoeukaryotes in the coastal waters adjacent to the Changjiang River estuary reflects the occurrence of diatom and dinoflagellate blooms during the investigation. The presence of Prochlorococcus in the coastal waters adjacent to the Changjiang River estuary offers a strong evidence that waters and materials associated with Nearshore Kuroshio Branch Current could be transported into the red tide zone adjacent to the Changjiang River estuary and will affect dynamics of harmful algal blooms in this region.
   Plain Language Summary Kuroshio is the strongest west Pacific boundary current. The oceanographic and ecological processes of Pacific Asian marginal seas are strongly affected by Kuroshio and its branches. During spring 2014, two cruises were conducted in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea to find out how Kuroshio intrusion influence the environment and phytoplankton there. Four phytoplankton assemblages with different distribution patterns were detected by flow-cytometry. The assemblage with larger cell size (nanoeukaryotes) preferred to live in the coastal waters and reflected harmful algal blooms in the sea area adjacent to Changjiang River estuary. The abundance of the smallest photosynthetic organism Prochlorococcus was the highest where Kuroshio main stream flows by. The distribution pattern of Prochlorococcus in the East China Sea well depicted the route of a branch stretched from Kuroshio to the coastal waters adjacent to Changjiang River estuary (Nearshore Kuroshio Branch Current), and Prochlorococcus could be an indicator to reflect the influence Kuroshio intrusion has on phytoplankton. The results provide important aspect that open ocean could affect coastal ecological problems related to phytoplankton, such as harmful algal blooms.

AB  - The carbon isotope composition (delta C-13 values) of long chain n-alkanes in lake sediments has been considered a reliable means of tracking changes in the terrigenous contribution of plants with C-3 and C-4 photosynthetic pathways. A key premise is that long chain leaf wax components used for isotope analysis are derived primarily from terrigenous higher plants. The role of aquatic plants in affecting delta C-13 values of long chain n-alkanes in lacustrine sediments may, however, have long been underestimated. In this study, we found that a large portion of long chain n-alkanes (C-27 and C-29) in nearshore sediments of the Lake Qinghai catchment was contributed by submerged aquatic plants, which displayed a relatively positive carbon isotope composition (e.g. -26.7% to -15.7% for C-29) similar to that of terrestrial C-4 plants. Thus, the use of delta C-13 values of sedimentary C-27 and C-29 n-alkanes for tracing terrigenous vegetation composition may create a bias toward significant overestimation/underestimation of the proportion of terrestrial C-4 plants. For sedimentary C-31, however, the contribution from submerged plants was minor, so that the delta C-13 values for C-31 n-alkane in surface sediments were in accord with those of the modern terrestrial vegetation in the Lake Qinghai region. Moreover, we found that changes in the delta C-13 values of sedimentary C-27 and C-29 n-alkanes were closely related to water depth variation. Downcore analysis further demonstrated the significant influence of endogenous lipids in lake sediments for the interpretation of terrestrial C-4 vegetation and associated environment/climate reconstruction. In conclusion, our results suggest that the delta C-13 values of sedimentary long chain n-alkanes (C-27, C-29 and C-31) may carry different environmental signals. While the delta C-13 values of C-31 were a reliable proxy for C-4/C-3 terrestrial vegetation composition, the delta C-13 values of C-27 and C-29 n-alkanes may have recorded lake ecological conditions and sources of organic carbon, which might be affected by lake water depth.

AB  - Submarine volcanic vents are being used as natural laboratories to assess the effects of increased ocean acidity and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration on marine organisms and communities. However, in the vicinity of volcanic vents other factors in addition to CO2, which is the main gaseous component of the emissions, may directly or indirectly confound the biota responses to high CO2. Here we used for the first time the expression of antioxidant and stress-related genes of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica to assess the stress levels of the species. Our hypothesis is that unknown factors are causing metabolic stress that may confound the putative effects attributed to CO2 enrichment only. We analyzed the expression of 35 antioxidant and stress-related genes of P. oceanica in the vicinity of submerged volcanic vents located in the islands of Ischia and Panarea, Italy, and compared them with those from control sites away from the influence of vents. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to characterize gene expression patterns.
   Fifty-one percent of genes analyzed showed significant expression changes. Metal detoxification genes were mostly down-regulated in relation to controls at both Ischia and Panarea, indicating that P. oceanica does not increase the synthesis of heavy metal detoxification proteins in response to the environmental conditions present at the two vents. The up-regulation of genes involved in the free radical detoxification response (e.g., CAPX, SODCP and GR) indicates that, in contrast with Ischia, P. oceanica at the Panarea site faces stressors that result in the production of reactive oxygen species, triggering antioxidant responses. In addition, heat shock proteins were also activated at Panarea and not at Ischia. These proteins are activated to adjust stress-accumulated misfolded proteins and prevent their aggregation as a response to some stressors, not necessarily high temperature.
   This is the first study analyzing the expression of target genes in marine plants living near natural CO2 vents. Our results call for contention to the general claim of seagrasses as "winners" in a high-CO2 world, based on observations near volcanic vents. Careful consideration of factors that are at play in natural vents sites other than CO2 and acidification is required. This study also constitutes a first step for using stress-related genes as indicators of environmental pressures in a changing ocean.

AB  - Tropical montane cloud forest is a priority ecosystem for restoration due to the diversity and ecosystem services it provides and because it is under severe threat. Forest restoration can be achieved by active interventions and/or natural regeneration (passive restoration). However, there has been little comparison of the effectiveness of active versus passive restoration strategies and even fewer studies have monitored the long-term success of forest restoration practices. We assessed the effectiveness of active (mixed plantation with native species) and passive (areas adjacent and non-adjacent to mature cloud forest) restoration strategies implemented in pastures with 21 years of exclosure, and compared these to a mature cloud forest (reference system), in eastern Mexico. In the mature forest and in the areas represented by each restoration strategy, similar to 15 plots (200 m(2)) were established in order to assess forest structure, tree diversity and soil properties as indicators of restoration success. Active restoration proved more effective than passive restoration at recovering forest structure (e.g. higher basal area, tree density and height). Adult tree diversity was similar across all restoration sites and the mature forest, while composition differed greatly between the mature forest and each of the restoration sites, from which the characteristic mature cloud forest tree species were mostly absent. The restoration sites presented very low tree seedling density (0.39 individuals/m(2)) relative to the mature forest (1.68 seedlings/m(2)), probably due to the higher cover of climbers, ferns, grasses and shrubs found in the understory of the restoration sites (similar to 78%), compared to that of the mature forest (8%). In all of the restoration sites, soil pH was higher, and carbon content in both the soil and litter was lower, than in the mature forest. This denotes a slow recovery of soil properties after use of the land as cattle pasture. In general, the passive restoration site non-adjacent to the forest presented the lowest recovery (lower canopy cover, composition similarity and seedling density), indicating the importance of proximity to seed sources. Our results highlight the need, in both actively and passively restored areas, for management practices such as enrichment planting, in order to assist tree seedling recruitment of key species and recovery of forest attributes. Active and passive restoration strategies could be implemented as complementary strategies for the restoration of cloud forest landscapes.

AB  - The Micronucleus test (MN) and Comet assay (CA) are currently the most widely used methods that allow the characterization of DNA damage induced by physical and chemical agents in wild species. The continuous expansion of the cultivated areas in Argentina, since the introduction of transgenic crops, mainly soy, in association with the increased use of pesticides, transformed deeply the natural environments where the lizard Tupinambis merianae (tegu lizard) occurs. Despite the fact that reptiles have shown to be excellent bioindicators of environmental contaminants, there is no record of genotoxicity studies in T. merianae. The aim of the present study was to adjust the MN test and CA protocols to be applied in erythrocytes of T. merianae, and determine the baseline values of DNA damage in this species. We used 20 adult lizards (10 males: 10 females) from Estacion Zoologica Experimental "Granja La Esmeralda" (Santa Fe, Argentina). Peripheral blood samples were collected from all animals and the MN test and CA applied according to the protocols established for other reptilian species. We test critical parameters of CA protocol (cell density, unwinding and electrophoresis times) using increasing concentrations of H2O2 (10, 25 and 50 mu M) as a known genotoxic agent to induce DNA damage. Based on this, we determined the most suitable conditions for the CA in this species: a cell density of 4 X 10(3) erythrocytes per slide, 10 min of unwinding and 15 min of electrophoresis at 0.90 V/cm approximately. The baseline frequency of micronuclei (BFMN=MN/1000 erythrocytes counted) determined for this species was 0.95 +/- 0.27 and the basal damage index (BDI: calculated from 100 comet images classified in arbitrary units)=103.85 +/- 0.97. No differences were observed between sexes in the BFMN or BDI (p > 0.05), and no relation was found between baseline values and length or weight of the analyzed animals (p > 0.05).
   These results demonstrated the sensitivity of both biomarkers of genotoxicity to be applied in erythrocytes of this species, with baseline values comparable to those reported in other reptilian species. These results allow us to propose the tegu lizard for future in vivo studies to assess the genotoxicity of different agents, including those possibly affecting it in its natural geographic distribution.

AB  - Most genetically modified (GM) crop plants are designed to be grown on large areas. However, empirical investigations for risk assessment are limited in their temporal and spatial extent. In the case of GM crop plants it is difficult to test the relevance of anticipated risks on the same spatial scale as the intended use. Processes which are difficult to assess experimentally include combinatory effects, interactions between different integration levels, persistence, long distance dispersal and occurrence of rare events. To a limited extent, it is possible to combine results of investigations on small spatial scales in a way that large-scale and long-term implications on the regional scale can be analysed by using modelling and extrapolation approaches. It is thus possible to indicate some of the involved risks which are not accessible otherwise.
   In this paper we present the results of an extrapolation methodology comprising several scales from the field size up to the landscape level. This methodology aimed at analysing the implications of a large-scale release of genetically modified oilseed rape (GM OSR). The approach consisted of an extrapolation scheme beginning with a landscape analysis which generated representative scenarios considering climate and OSR cultivation characteristics. For the spatial extent of several fields this information was applied in an individual-based model representing ontogeny, dispersal and persistence of cultivated, volunteers and feral oilseed rape. In a final step, simulation results were extrapolated to the region of Northern Germany.
   Here we focus on the model results which were extrapolated to the regional level by applying a set of ecological indicators which allowed to assess potential implications on this level. These indicators included the number and distribution of flowering GM plants and the dynamics of GM OSR seeds in the soil seedbank. Specific results related to the long-term dynamics in the seedbank and volunteer development. Model results emphasise the long-term consequences of GM OSR cultivation and the explicit necessity to regard high variability in potential GMO admixture. This has to be considered when developing landscape management schemes for co-existence.
   The extrapolation approach presented here, integrates different traits to assess effects of GMOs on large spatial scales with respect to persistence and dispersal. The developed methodology is equally applicable for other crops, regions and different agricultural conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Salinization and alkalinization are the most common land degradation processes, particularly occurring in and and semi-arid regions, where precipitation is too low to maintain a regular percolation of rainwater through the soil. Under such a climatic condition, soluble salts are accumulated in the soil, influencing soil properties and environment which cause lessening of the soil productivity. The consistent identification of the processes is essential for sustainable soil management.
   Identification, large scale mapping and monitoring of the salt-affected areas have been done using three different data and techniques. Remote sensing has been widely used to detect and map salt-affected areas, since thousands of medium to high-resolution imageries from the earth surface are available. In practice, most of these studies have focused oil severely saline areas and have given less attention to the detection and monitoring of slightly or moderately affected areas. The major constrain is related to the nature of the satellite images, which do not allow extracting information from the third dimension of the 3-D soil body e.g., where salts concentrate in subsoil. Solute transport modelling is another technique which is used to predict the salt distribution in the subsoil. It has the advantage of providing subsoil information on dynamics of the salt movement regimes. This technique provides complementary data on salt movement in the soil profile which can be used in combination with remote sensing data. Since a few years, near-surface geophysics sensors, particularly airborne, are widely used to map and monitor salt-affected areas. This technology has the advantage of effectiveness for cropped land and can efficiently be used to highlight conductive areas where no surface expression of salt is evident.
   The paper outlines the conceptual framework of a method where the data obtained from optical remote sensing sensors should be integrated with the results of simulation models and geophysical survey in order to predict different levels (low, moderate, severe) of salinization/alkalinization in a cost-attractive and efficient way. In the proposed integrated method, data are combined not only to demarcate the existing salt-affected soils, but also to track down the salinization as a pedogenic process. Such an approach focuses on the integration of the data with different natures and scales, meaning that data fusion and upscaling are strongly involved. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We compared contamination levels in fish from contaminated and uncontaminated floodplain swamps of the lower Mississippi River to assess differences in contamination risks between swamps, across different taxonomic and ecological groupings of fishes within and between swamps, and with seasonality in river stage. Fish tissue levels of inorganic contaminants were substantially lower than environmental levels in both swamps, suggesting either that fish were not uptaking these contaminants, or they were effectively eliminating the contaminants from their bodies. Tissue levels of organic contaminants were high relative to environmental levels, suggesting that these contaminants were bioaccumulating. Organic contaminants were significantly higher in fish from the contaminated swamp (Devil's Swamp) than in fish from a reference swamp up river (Tunica Swamp). Because the organic contaminants were largely confined to sediments, we expected bottom-oriented fishes to have higher concentrations than pelagic fishes. Assuming that uptake was primarily through the food chain, we expected top predators to exhibit higher concentrations than low-level consumers. We also expected year-round swamp residents to exhibit higher accumulations than more transitory users of backswamp habitat. However, organic contaminant levels did not differ in the directions expected for any of these groupings. We did observe differences in organic contaminant levels within and between swamps for different taxonomic groupings of fishes (species and genera). Some taxa occupying low to middle positions in the food web (e.g., gizzard shad Lepomis spp.) exhibited higher concentrations than taxa near the top of the food web. Within Devil's Swamp, organic contaminant levels were significantly higher at low river stage, when fish were confined to the swamp, than at high river stage, when fish were free to move between the river and the swamp. We caught more species and more fish per unit effort in Devil's Swamp than in Tunica Swamp, contrary to expectations if contaminants in the former were negatively impacting population and community structure. Species richness differences between swamps were a consequence of catch differences, with higher catch corresponding to inclusion of more rare species. The lower catch in Tunica Swamp may have resulted from physical modifications of its waterways to support agriculture and hunting. The results of this study underscore the importance in factoring information on the taxonomy and ecology of organisms, and seasonal changes in environmental conditions, into assessments of contamination risks.

AB  - The wetland cultivation of rice is subjected to anaerobic and aerobic soil conditions causing substantial changes in the soil system. However, how long-term supplementation of organics with reduced chemical fertilizers affects microbial composition, their activities, and enzymatic activities in acid soil has not been sufficiently investigated. This research is focused on a rice-rice system after an ongoing field experiment set-up in 1977-78 at Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat, India, where 7 alternative nutrient management have been investigated to: (1) assess the effects on soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon, and enzymatic activity in acid soil; (2) identify and discuss the most suitable treatment combinations of organic and chemical fertilizers to enhance soil ecosystem services (SES). Accordingly, we analysed the soil microbiological properties as affected by the 32 years of continuous integrated nutrient management (INM) practices and also evaluated the INM treatments in terms of SES. Results revealed that the soil microbial biomass carbon significantly varied across the treatments from 129.4 to 412.1 mu g g(-1) which comprises 2.4 to 4.4% of the SOC. The highest bacterial count (8.95 log cfu g(-1) soil) was recorded in RDF + Azolla treatment, whereas fungal count was the maximum (7.47 log cfu g(-1) soil) in RDF + FYM treatment. All the enzymatic activities responded significantly to the INM practices, but the trend of response was different for different enzymes. The highest dehydrogenase (223.6 mu g TTF g(-1) soil 24 h(-1)) and urease (4.1 mu g NH4-N g(-1) soil 2 h(-1)) activities were recorded in RDF + Azolla, while phosphomonoeaterase (337.4 mu g p-nitrophenol g(-1) soil h(-1)) and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (10.0 mu g fluorescein g(-1) soil h(-1)) activities were found to be the maximum in RDF + FYM. The microbial and enzymatic activities decreased significantly in the control after 32 cycles of rice-rice cropping. In this study, a significant positive statistical correlation of all the microbiological properties with soil pH, soil organic carbon and grain yield of crops were recorded. Finally, the different soil properties under the different nutrient treatments have been discussed in terms of SES provision, highlighting that the most sustainable treatments have resulted in RDF + FYM, RDF + RS and RDF + Azolla.

AB  - Arctic freshwaters support biota adapted to the harsh conditions at these latitudes, but the climate is changing rapidly and so are the underlying environmental filters. Currently, we have limited understanding of broad-scale patterns of Arctic riverine biodiversity and the correlates of alpha- and beta-diversity. Using information from a database set up within the scope of the Arctic Council's Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Plan, we analysed patterns and correlates of alpha- and beta-diversity in benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate communities across northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland. We analysed variation in total beta-diversity and its replacement and richness difference components in relation to location of the river reach and its drainage basin (Baltic Sea in the south, the Barents Sea in the east and the north, and the Norwegian Sea in the west), in addition to climate and environmental variables. In both macroinvertebrates and diatoms, the replacement and richness difference components showed wide variation. For macroinvertebrates, the richness difference component was the more important, whereas for diatoms, the replacement component was the more important in contributing to variation in beta-diversity. There was no significant difference in beta-diversity between the three main drainage basins, but species composition differed among the drainage basins. Based on the richness difference component of beta-diversity, climate variables were most strongly associated with community variation in macroinvertebrates. In diatoms, both environmental and climate variables were strongly correlated with community compositional variation. In both groups, there were also significant differences in alpha-diversity among the three main drainage basins, and several taxa were significant indicators of one of these drainage basins. Alpha diversity was greater in areas with a continental climate, while the oceanic areas in the west harboured greatly reduced flora and fauna. The correlates of biodiversity were relatively similar in macroinvertebrates and diatoms. Climate variables, in particular temperature, were the most strongly associated with biodiversity patterns in the Arctic rivers of Fennoscandia. Sedimentary geology may be associated with increased productivity and, to a lesser extent, with sensitivity to acidification. There was considerable variation in community composition across Arctic Fennoscandia, indicating the necessity of protecting several stream reaches or even whole catchments within each region to conserve total riverine biodiversity. Furthermore, it is likely that the predicted changes in temperature in Arctic areas will influence riverine diversity patterns across Fennoscandia.

AB  - In this paper, we present results of a palynological analysis of the phosphate succession from the northern flank of the Bou Angueur syncline in the Middle Atlas (central Morocco). The studied interval yielded a well-preserved and diverse palynological content, dominated by dinoflagellate cysts (dino-cysts), allowing a detailed taxonomic study of dinocyst and a new biostratigraphic dating of the section. The studied section is assigned to the upper Maastrichtian-Danian interval. A new, relatively complete K/Pg boundary transition was recognized. The succession at the Bou Angueur syncline was compared to Tethyan K/Pg boundary sections, such as the K/Pg boundary Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) at El Kef (NW Tunisia) and Ouled Hadou section (NE Morocco). The dinocyst marker events used for the identification of the late Maastrichtian include the first occurrences of Cordosphaeridium Modes subsp. Modes, Deflandrea galeata and Glaphyrocysta perforata and those used for the early Danian include the first occurrences of Carpatella cornuta, Cassidium fragile, Danea californica, Lanternosphaeridium reinhardtii and Senoniasphaera inornata.
   The organic-walled dinocyst-producing dinoflagellates did not undergo the K/Pg mass extinction resulting from a large meteoritic impact. They enable us to interpret the environmental and climatic changes in the earliest Danian, while calcareous microfossils could not, since they are partially or completely extinct. We thus describe seven palynological assemblages, reflecting paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes, inferred from changes in relevant ecological parameters, including changes in the relative abundance of selected dinocyst groups, often used as paleoenvironmental indicators. An inner to middle neritic marine environments alternated with several short phases of more offshore conditions is deduced for the late Maastrichtian and earliest Danian and an open outer neritic marine environment during a transgressive regime in the latest Danian. Several dinocyst events were recognized in the studied interval, among which remarkable blooms of tropical warm-water and high-latitude cold water dinocyst taxa are interpreted herein as ecological responses, related to global climatic changes, including a global warming episode during the late Maastrichtian and the well-known brief global cooling following the K/Pg boundary Chicxulub impact.

AB  - Zooplankton is an important component to understand oceanographic dynamics, they are considered good indicators of environmental variability, since most species are short-lived they can be tight coupling of climate and population dynamics, and some taxa are sensitive to variables such as temperature, quality and quantity of food, oxygenation and stratification. In the Colombian Caribbean two oceanographic cruises were carried out, in order to characterize and analyze the biodiversity of the continental margin, for the periods May-June 2008 and November-December 2009. The objective of this study was to determine which oceanographic variable was the most important in the distribution of zooplankton in the oceanic waters, and how the variables structure the community. In each cruise, zooplankton samples were obtained by vertical hauls with a 1 m 2 diameter conical net (200 tun mesh size). The zooplankton community structure was studied by automated image analysis (Zoolmage), which combined with abundance data, allowed to calculate the slope of size spectrum, and diversity indexes of taxa and sizes. The environmental variables included temperature, salinity, oxygen and chlorophyll a of the water column, and were used to calculate the stratification with the Brunt-Vaiisala frequency; this information was complemented by satellite images of temperature, surface chlorophyll, geostrophic currents and sea level, obtained from MODIS and AQUA products. The association between environmental variables and the zooplankton community structure was determined using Spearman's correlation ranges with the Bioenv routine and a stepwise regression model, and Principal component analysis (PCA). Our results showed spatial and temporal patterns in the oceanographic conditions of the study area, such as upwelling in the Northeast region, strong stratification in the Southwest, and mesoscale activity. The abundance of zooplankton exhibited differences between the two climatic seasons and zones. Temporal differences were also evident in the size and diversity of taxa (ANOVA 2-way p <0.05). These changes were related to the moderate upwelling and the activity of mesoscale eddies. Cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies of variable size can either transport or retain zooplankton over cross-shelf and oceanic areas, thus modifying the taxonomic structure of the community. According to the Bioenv analysis, the main variables that explained the abundance and composition of zooplankton were sea level and chlorophyll a (Spearman correlation= 0.49). The stepwise regression showed that stratification, oxygen and chlorophyll a were the most important predictors of zooplankton abundance and size.

AB  - In tropical forest, landscape fragmentation and the consequent degradation of disturbed forests increase the incidence of light and dry hot winds, causing a disturbance on natural regeneration. Under these conditions, lianas (woody vines) development is stimulated instead of other species, which are more suited to mature forest and under less influence of the edge effect. For this, lianas colonization is an important variable for assessing the disturbance level of a forest. In this context, it becomes important to understand the nature of the competitive relationships between hyper-abundant lianas and ring growth of the host trees. Here, we selected trees with occupation or absence of lianas from two tropical species Pinus caribaea var. hondurensis (Caribbean pine) and Tectona grandis (teak) -localized in a semideciduous forest fragment in southeastern Brazil, aiming to compare growth, climatic response, anatomy (vessels and intra-annual density fluctuations), wood density and carbon, by tree-ring analysis. The results showed that the lianas caused a change in tree-ring anatomy of host trees in last 10 years, mainly. We observed that trees occupied by lianas had a decrease the radial growth and carbon in the two species, an increase of the vessels size in teak and a decrease of the IADF frequency in Caribbean pine. In teak, the climatetree relationship indicated that trees with lianas had lower response to rainfall and higher response to temperature in the summer (rainy and hottest period); in Caribbean pine, we observed that trees with lianas had a 2-month delay in the radial growth response to rainfall in the dry season. In the teak group, we observed that host trees had higher wood density values than liana-free tree in the outer rings, and the opposite was showed for pine. These findings show that tree-ring growth of host trees are a strong bioindicator of forest disturbance caused by aggressive colonization of lianas. We believe that these methods are applicable to future studies relating to the effects of habitat fragmentation and forest degradation on biodiversity and ecosystem services, particularly in the context of global climate change.

AB  - Over the last fifty years, research on freshwater macroinvertebrates has been driven largely by the state of the taxonomy of these animals. In the great majority of studies conducted during the 2000s macroinvertebrates have been operationally defined by investigators as invertebrates retained by a 250 mu mesh in field sampling devices. Significant advances have been and continue to be made in developing ever more refined keys to macroinvertebrate groups. The analysis by function is a viable alternative when advances in macroinvertebrate ecological research is restricted by the level of detail in identifications. Focus on function, namely adaptations of macroinvertebrates to habitats and the utilization of food resources, has facilitated ecological evaluation of freshwater ecosystems (Functional feeding groups; FFG). As the great stream ecologist Noel Hynes observed, aquatic insects around the world exhibit similar morphologies and behaviors, even though they are in very different taxonomic groups. This is the basis for the FFG analysis that was initially developed in the early 1970s. FFG analysis applies taxonomy only to the level of detail that allows assignment to one of six FFG categories: scrapers adapted to feed on periphyton, detrital shredders adapted to feed on coarse (CPOM) riparian-derived plant litter that has been colonized by microbes, herbivore shredders that feed on live, rooted aquatic vascular plants, filtering collectors adapted to remove fine particle detritus (FPOM) from the water column, gathering collectors adapted to feed on FPOM where it is deposited on surfaces or in crevices in the sediments, and predators that capture live prey. The interacting roles of these FFGs in stream ecosystems were originally depicted in a conceptual model. Thus, there are a limited number of adaptations exhibited by stream macroinvertebrates that exploit these habitats and food resources. This accounts for the wide range of macroinvertebrate taxa in freshwater ecosystems found in different geographical settings that are represented by a much smaller number of FFGs. An example of the generality of the functional group concept is the presence of detrital shredders that are dependent upon riparian plant litter inputs being found in essentially all forested streams world-wide (e.g., across the USA and Canada, Chile, Brazil, West Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Thailand; Cummins, unpublished). Freshwater macroinvertebrate taxonomic determinations, especially at the species level, may be the best basis for developing specific indices of pollution (tolerance values in ecological tables). However, the FFG method appears to provide better indicators of overall freshwater ecosystem condition.

AB  - Solid waste management is a significant issue for sustainable development that involves the technical, socioeconomic, legal, ecological, political, and even cultural components. For this reason, systems analysis has been uniquely providing interdisciplinary support for policy analysis and decision making in solid waste management for the last few decades. Considering these challenges and accomplishments retrospectively, this paper presents a thorough literature review and in-depth discussions of systems analysis models that are promising for providing forward-looking, cost-effective, risk informed, and environmentally benign decisions for sustainable solid waste management. To simplify the discussion, the spectrum of these systems analysis models was divided into three broadly based domains associated with fourteen categories, although some of them may be intertwined with each other. The first domain comprises systems engineering models including cost-benefit analysis, forecasting analysis, simulation analysis, optimization analysis, and integrated modeling system; the second domain introduces systems analysis platforms, such as management information systems/decision support systems/expert systems; and the third domain introduces system assessment tools including scenario development, material flow analysis, life-cycle assessment, risk assessment, environmental impact assessment, strategic environmental assessment, socioeconomic assessment, and sustainable assessment. While some models or tools may be elucidated with respect to multiple managerial purposes, such as integrated modeling system and sustainable assessment, others may cover extended foci of market-based instruments and regulatory requirements, such as socioeconomic assessment and environmental impact assessment. The authors use the term systems analysis as a placeholder for the disparate strands of research and practice at this intersection between environmental systems engineering and sustainability science. Given that the sustainable management is necessary at all phases of impact from the interactions among several prescribed paradigms, current and future solid waste management strategies in relation to systems analysis were particularly discussed. Such a critical review paper may aid the prediction of the possible challenges and the preparation of the appropriate tactics in dealing with large-scale complex solid waste management systems under normal operation and special conditions. It should lead the authors to echo some of their real world observational evidence in terms of cost-benefit-risk trade-off in decision analysis for solid waste management.

AB  - Aim To identify the factors determining the relationship between habitat breadth and range size in the Mediterranean alien flora. Strong relationships have previously been uncovered between the two variables, which raises the possibility that habitat breadth could be used as a powerful predictor of invasiveness. However, previous investigations have yet to explain the phenomenon adequately, and greater understanding is required to establish its importance.
   Location Ninety-one islands in the Mediterranean basin.
   Methods I examined a data base of Mediterranean naturalized plant species created for the EU project EPIDEMIE, and containing information on island distributions, habitat occupancy and other descriptive parameters compiled from published floras. As a null hypothesis, I assumed that the relationship between habitat breadth and range size was a spatial scale artefact: if species colonize habitats at random, with the likelihood determined by a weighted probability in each habitat, then perceived habitat breadth will increase with the number of populations examined. I modelled this effect, and also considered circumstantial evidence (via indirect indicator variables) for six hypotheses to determine whether both habitat breadth and range size may be jointly driven by a major third factor (introduction frequency, residence time, dispersal ability, generation time, dependence on mutualisms, release from herbivory). The explanatory power of the hypotheses was compared using correlative statistics.
   Results When habitat breadth was modelled according to the null hypothesis, the form of its relationship with range size was very similar to that from the observed data, and the predicted range size estimates explained almost half the observed variance. The unexplained component may have been due to the same mechanism operating at finer spatial scales. From the direction of the residual effect, increases in habitat breadth were probably driven by range size rather than vice versa. None of the alternative hypotheses were found to be significant predictors of habitat breadth and range size in invasive species.
   Main conclusions Although a number of minor explanations cannot be ruled out (e.g. that widespread species have greater regional genetic diversity enabling them to adapt to local conditions), it seems likely that the habitat breadth effect is largely artefactual and does not have particularly great value as a predictor of invasiveness.

AB  - Background and Purpose: The focus of this paper is the population and level of human habitation in Velebit Nature Tar. The objective is to show the causes underlying demographic development, including population figures from 1857 to 2001 and overall population trends from 1961 to 2001 (population dynamics, natural trends and migrations) and their consequences in the contemporary habitation structure (settlements based on size and age composition of their populations).
   Research methodology, periodization and spatial scheme: The research approach was based on application of demographic models (demographic transition, general population trends and percentage evalvation of the population's age structure), methods (spatial analysis and synthesis) and techniques (tabular and cartographic analysis of relevant indicators). Periodization encompasses the intercensal periods from 1857 to 2001, wherein emphasis is placed on analysis of demographic development during the 1961-2001 period and the 1991-2001 period. The special scheme for research constitutes Velebit Nature Tar as a whole, its four population zones (sub-montane settlements, coastal settlements, peripheral Lika settlements and Zrmanja area settlements), and settlements in the wider Par zone (a total of 75 settlements).
   Results and Conclusions: From the time of its first settlement in the late seventeenth century until the beginning of the twentieth century, the population in the Park's territory grew, whereafter continual depopulation ensued. At its peak in 1910, the population in the wide territory of the Park was 52,202, which is approximately 22 persons/km(2), while in 2001 the population was only 9,219, or less than 4 persons/km(2). Main causes for this drastic depopulation were emigration (under conditions of agrarian overpopulation and lagging regional development) and destructive impact of wars (World War II and Croatia's 'Homeland War' in the 1990s). Given the over riding population trends, the result was that by the 1960s this became an exodus area marked by explicit eimgratory trends, while by the 1970s this became a dying-off trend. This fact is reflected in the modern habitation structure, characterized by predominance of small settlements with populations marked by extremely advanced age. Enervation of the social energy to mace use of the Park's resources and threats to habitats by natural succession of vegetation - with the ensuing negative impact on biological diversity and landscapes - dictate the need to revitalize the population within the framework of sustainable development in the protected area.

AB  - Baleen whales typically migrate to high-latitudes to feed during summer in regions of predictably high concentrations of their zooplankton or fish prey. Therefore, their presence in shelf systems is a good indicator of productive food webs. Line-transect surveys of cetaceans conducted during the late 1990s in the SE Bering Sea (160.32 to 171.08degreesW) indicate that the middle shelf (50 m < z < 100 m) now supports the highest whale biomass in this region. In recent decades, whales were rare and hence their ecological role on the shelf was limited. During July 1997, the density and abundance (N) of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and fin whales Balaenoptera physalus were highest on the middle shelf between 163.7 and 168.1degreesW: 0.0236 humpback whales km(-2), N = 1308 (coefficient of variation, CV = 0.65), and 0.00924 fin whales km(-2), N = 513 (CV = 0.61), respectively. Similarly, during June 1999, fin whales were the most numerically dominant species of large whale in the SE Bering Sea, with highest densities and abundance in the 'central' middle shelf (163.7 to 168.1degreesW): 0.0169 fin whales km(-2), N = 938 (CV = 0.54). During the summers of 1997 and 1999, 65 and 79% of the prey consumption by fin whales in the SE Bering Sea occurred on the central middle shelf. Prey biomass consumed by fin and humpback whales on the SE Bering Sea shelf and slope in 1997 (264474 to 723504 metric tons, mt) is equivalent to 34-94% of the 1997 echo-integration trawl estimate of walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma biomass (age 1+) for the shelf east of 170degreesW (0.77 x 10(6) mt). Large whales were much more abundant on the middle shelf during the late 1990s than during preceding decades and, therefore, their foraging may have impacted trophic dynamics, carbon pathways and nutrient cycling. The partitioning of available carbon and energy in the pelagic and benthic systems of the shelf, as determined previously during the 1970s, when whales were rare, should now be reexamined relative to the increased ecological impact of these top-level predators. Fluxes of carbon that involve pathways through whales should be incorporated in shelf and oceanic carbon budgets.

AB  - CONTEXT: Improving nitrogen (N) fertilizer recommendations for maize (Zea mays L.) in the US Midwest has been the focus of much research, yet there is no agreement for which methodology is the best to balance trade-offs between production and environmental outcomes. This study investigated the strengths and limitations of two broad approaches: dynamic and static recommendation tools. Dynamic tools use advanced technology to predict the Economically Optimum N Rate (EONR) using year-specific soil, weather, and crop growth charac-teristics to detect conditions that need lower or higher N rates. Static tools provide regional N recommendations that are static over time, maximizing long-term profits rather than predicting the best EONR for each field and season. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to explain the interactions between the accuracy, profitability, and environmental losses for different N recommendation tools under a wide range of production scenarios. METHODS: For this, we used a calibrated synthetic dataset of 4200 fields over 30 years. In the first part, we compared multiple N recommendations tools belonging to the static and dynamic groups. In the second part, we selected each group's best tools and compared them in detail. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: From an economic view, results indicate that increasing profitability by increasing the accuracy in EONR predictions with dynamic tools is challenging. The reason is that these more accurate tools are not perfect, and around half of the time, they under predict. In that situation, the yield penalty is higher, and the economic loss is usually not compensated by savings in N fertilizer costs associated with other more accurate recommendations. The static recommendations avoid this penalty by recommending slightly higher N rates, providing similar profits. From an environmental view, both tools can reduce N leaching by 15%, dynamic tool by being more accurate overall, but the static tool could achieve it by recommending on the lower end of their current recommended N profitable range. SIGNIFICANCE: Our analysis suggests that we need to re-think the goals of N management tools. Higher complexity in N management may not necessarily increase profits and reduce N leaching. In fact, there is current potential to reduce N leaching by simply reducing static recommendations without hurting profits. For either approach, this study highlights the need to develop other ways (education, environmental awareness, policies) to account for environmental benefits and provide clear incentives for farmers to adopt these tools and increase the eco-efficiency of agriculture.

AB  - The following biological and pharmaceutical factors influence the therapeutic efficacy and bioequivalence of drugs: physicochemical properties of a pharmaceutical substance, bioavailability, type of dosage form, route of administration, nature of excipients, their compatibility, as well as technological conditions of production, including the preparation of drugs forms. Before mass production of a drug, the technological parameters and characteristics of the pharmaceutical substance must be carefully studied and scientifically substantiated. This work is devoted to the study of the technological properties of an original pharmaceutical substance based on the derivative of 3.7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane with the chemical name IUPAC 6-[4methoxy-3- (1H-pyrazol-1-ylmethyl) benzyl] -1,11dimethyl-3,6,9-triazatricyclo[7.3.1.1]tetradecane-4,8,12-trion, used as an active substance for the development of the composition and technology for the preparation of oral dosage forms in capsule form. The article presents the results of the development and testing of a drug in the form of capsules of the original pharmaceutical substance of the nootropic action of 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonanane, which is practically insoluble in water. The study identified and evaluated the technological and biological properties of a pharmaceutical substance that can affect the pharmacological activity in the production of a dosage form. The study examined the key indicators: solubility, particle size, flowability, bulk density. The technological characteristics of the pharmaceutical substance are studied not only by certain values of the indicated characteristics but also by the values of the Hausner and Carr indices. The data obtained suggest the content and progress of further stages of pharmaceutical development. The presence of the lag phase when dissolving hypromellose capsules in a medium with a pH of 1,2 and relatively low disintegration rates in media with a pH of 1,2, pH 4,5, and pH 6,8 served as the basis for the choice of gelatin capsules. The developed dosage form meets modern pharmacopoeial requirements, including the dissolution kinetics: according to the results obtained, in 45 minutes (77,6 +/- 2,5)% of the substance passes into the dissolution medium with a pH of 4,5. The results of the study are used to develop a technological scheme for obtaining the dosage form of 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, its indicators, and quality standards.

AB  - Biomass production helps address the worldwide energy demand. However, some controversial issues have been identified such as the possible conflict between the goal of increasing vegetable biomass and food production and the need to limit environmental impacts. In Mediterranean region, where the supply of some natural resources appears significantly limited (e.g., water) and the competition for land is higher than it was in the past, the objective of evaluating environmental burdens at a regional scale represents an important issue, especially if the assessment considers the farmer scope of increasing productivity. Using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) "from cradle to field gate" approach, this paper aims to evaluate land-based environmental sustainability related to four energy crop options. We carried out a LCA differentiating between annual and perennial species and between irrigated (giant reed and sorghum) and rainfed crops (cardoon and milk thistle) to determine their performances and impacts within the same context. The findings suggest that irrigated crops generate larger impacts on the environment than rainfed species and that annual crops (both irrigated and rainfed) are more damaging than the respective perennial crops. The damages were expressed in Ecopoints, where one Ecopoint corresponds to one thousandth of the annual overall environmental burden of an average European inhabitant. Ecopoints for sorghum, giant reed, milk thistle and cardoon are equal to 361, 288, 146, and 138, respectively. Except for irrigation, fertilizers were found to be the input with the largest effect, accounting for 37% (giant reed) to 75% (cardoon) of the environmental burden on the system. The results do not suggest the presence of a winning crop option - i.e., a crop that shows the best environmental performances everywhere and in all categories since regional environmental burdens are simultaneously related to different factors (e.g., land allocation, crop productivity, and degree of practice intensification) that drive farmer choice. Finally, following a dynamic and innovative perspective, we evaluated the trade-off between productivity and environmental burden for each crop simulating an increasing product variation. We found that environmental burdens would increase more proportionally than crop yields done. Especially the latter finding provides interesting suggestions on energy cropping system integration within agricultural planning under stressed natural resource conditions.

AB  - The tropical forage grass Brachiaria humidicola (Bh) suppresses the activity of soil nitrifiers through biological nitrification inhibition (BNI). As a result, nitrate (NO3-) formation and leaching are reduced which is also expected to tighten the soil nitrogen (N) cycle. However, the beneficial relationship between reduced NO3- losses and enhanced N uptake due to BNI has not been experimentally demonstrated yet. Nitrification discriminates against the N-15 isotope and leads to N-15 depleted NO3-, but N-15 enriched NH4+ in soils. Leaching of N-15 depleted NO3- enriches the residual N pool in the soil with N-15. We hypothesized that altered nitrification and NO3- leaching due to diverging BNI magnitudes in contrasting Bh genotypes influence soil N-15 natural abundance (delta N-15), which in turn is reflected in distinct delta N-15 in Bh shoot biomass. Consequently, high BNI was expected to be reflected in low plant delta N-15 of Bh. It was our objective to investigate under controlled conditions the link between shoot value of delta N-15 in several Bh genotypes and leached NO3- amounts and shoot N uptake. Additionally, plant N-15 and N% was monitored among a wide range of Bh genotypes with contrasting BNI potentials in field plots for 3 years. We measured leaf delta N-15 of young leaves (regrown after cutback) of Bh and combined it with nitrification rates (NRs) of incubated soil to test whether there is a direct relationship between plant delta N-15 and BNI. Increased leached NO3- was positively correlated with higher delta N-15 in Bh, whereas the correlation between shoot N uptake and shoot delta N-15 was inverse. Field cultivation of a wide range of Bh genotypes over 3 years decreased NRs in incubated soil, while shoot delta N-15 declined and shoot N% increased over time. Leaf delta N-15 of Bh genotypes correlated positively with NRs of incubated soil. It was concluded that decreasing plant delta N-15 of Bh genotypes over time reflects the long-term effect of BNI as linked to lower NO3- formation and reduced NO3- leaching. Accordingly, a low delta N-15 in Bh shoot tissue verified its potential as indicator of high BNI activity of Bh genotypes.

AB  - The paper considers the issue of establishing and sustaining the double identity among young generation of German immigrants coming from ethnically blended Russian-German families who arrived in Germany from the CIS countries in the 1990-s during the fourth migration wave. Micro-historical approach is used in the study. The experience of successful integration of German immigrants into German society is studied. The work is centered on the data of field studies by means of in-depth interview methods and overt observations in 2014 in Baden-Wurttemberg (Germany).
   It was revealed that respondents have the conception of inhomogeneity of German migrant community (according to the time of immigration - they differ from representatives of earlier immigration waves) and by acculturation strategies (assimilation, separation, integration), as well as they have understanding of specific nature of their paradigms compared to native Germans and their distinctiveness from Russians.
   The factors of establishing positive Russian-German identity can be defined as: cultural-historical migrants' origins (memories of historical motherland, its culture and traditions), internal structures of immigrant community (Russian shops, restaurants, discos, Russian-language media and websites, etc.), as well as modern cultural reality of accepting German society.
   Adherence of young generation of German immigrants to Russian culture can be defined by essential level (saving native language and culture of ancestors) and instrumentalist level (Russian language skills as a condition for increased competitiveness on the German labor market). Regarding the German component of young immigrants' identity both levels can be also defined: perception of adhesion to German people "by blood" and understanding that German language skills, adoption of norms and values of German society contributes to successful integration into accepting community.
   It was defined that the important mechanisms of sustaining Russian component of double identity are keeping strong family connections, marriage with representatives from German immigrants families, inclusion of children into traditions of Russian culture and orthodox church; keeping close relations with friends and relatives in Russia, etc. Formation of German component of identity occurs under the influence of socio-cultural environment of modern German society.
   The work reveals that immigrants under study live with the perception of their adherence to two different worlds, two cultures. Among young people there is strong belief that they have two motherlands - Russia and Germany (USSR).

AB  - Purpose Following the boom of shale gas production in the USA and the decrease in the US gas prices, increasing interest in shale gas is developing in many countries holding shale reserves and exploration is already taking place in some EU countries, including the UK. Any commercial development of shale gas in Europe requires a broad environmental assessment, recognizing the different European conditions and legislations.
   Methods This study focuses on the UK situation and estimates the environmental impacts of shale gas using life-cycle assessment (LCA); the burdens of shale gas production in the UK are compared with the burdens of the current UK natural gas mix. The main focus is on the analysis of water impacts, but a broad range of other impact categories are also considered. A sensitivity analysis is performed on the most environmentally criticized operations in shale gas production, including flowback disposal and emission control, by considering a range of possible process options.
   Results and discussion Improper waste water management and direct disposal or spills of waste water to river can lead to high water and human ecotoxicity. Mining of the sand and withdrawal of the water used in fracking fluids determine the main impacts on water use and degradation. However, the water degradation of the conventional natural gas supply to the UK is shown to be even higher than that of shale gas. For the global warming potential (GWP), the handling methods of the emissions associated with the hydraulic fracturing influence the results only when emissions are vented. Finally, the estimated ultimate recovery of the well has the greatest impact on the results as well as the flowback ratio and flowback disposal method.
   Conclusions This paper provides insights to better understand the future development of shale gas in the UK. Adequate waste water management and emission handling significantly reduce the environmental impacts of shale gas production. Policy makers should consider that shale gas at the same time increases the water consumption and decreases the water degradation when compared with the gas mix supply. Furthermore, the environmental impacts of shale gas should be considered according to the low productivity that force the drilling and exploitation of a high number of wells.

AB  - Purpose Dissolving pulp production is mostly reliant on wood, which drastically depletes forest resources. To prevent the over-exploitation, the efforts were required by considering waste materials utilization. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment to account for environmental impacts was needed. The purpose of this research was to determine the environmental impact of empty fruit bunches (EFB) utilization from oil palms as a promising raw material substitute for wood in the production of dissolving pulp and furfural as co-product. Methods The consequential life cycle assessment (cLCA) was performed by following the methodology in ISO 14040. Inventory for the input-output materials and energies for the proposed integrated dissolving pulp and furfural co-production process was evaluated based on laboratory-scale experiments. Meanwhile, the field survey as a reference for the existing practice in the conventional dissolving pulp industry was conducted. The SimaPro v8.0.5 (R) software was used for the LCA calculation with the Centrum voor Milieuwetenschappen Leiden (CML) environmental impact assessment method. Several environmental impact categories, such as acidification, global warming, eutrophication, and human toxicity potential, were quantified. Results and discussion This study examined three proposed scenarios for dissolving pulp and furfural co-production compared with the conventional dissolving pulp production. In the Scenario 1, 50% of the wood consumption was replaced by EFB and applied to acid prehydrolysis/soda cooking followed by ECF bleaching, with an additional process to co-produce furfural. In the Scenario 2, 100% of wood consumption was replaced by EFB, with the same cooking and bleaching parameters as those in Scenario 1. In the Scenario 3, 100% of wood consumption was replaced by EFB, and the acid was replaced by water in the prehydrolysis process to improve the total environmental performance with the same conditions as the previous scenarios. The Scenario 3 was the most promising scenario and had the lowest environmental impact. Conclusions This research was conducted to propose EFB, which is environmentally sustainable and economically profitable, as a wood substitute in the co-production of dissolving pulp and furfural. The scenarios were proposed and compared with the existing practices. Based on the cLCA approach, this study recommended the EFB as a promising raw material and referred to Scenario 3 for the environmentally friendly system production.

AB  - Erosion is a major threat to soil resources in Europe, and may impair their ability to deliver a range of ecosystem goods and services. This is reflected by the European Commission's Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection, which recommends an indicator-based approach for monitoring soil erosion. Defined baseline and threshold values are essential for the evaluation of soil monitoring data. Therefore, accurate spatial data on both soil loss and soil genesis are required, especially in the light of predicted changes in climate patterns, notably frequency, seasonal distribution and intensity of precipitation. Rates of soil loss are reported that have been measured, modelled or inferred for most types of soil erosion in a variety of landscapes, by studies across the spectrum of the Earth sciences. Natural rates of soil formation can be used as a basis for setting tolerable soil erosion rates, with soil formation consisting of mineral weathering as well as dust deposition. This paper reviews the concept of tolerable soil erosion and summarises current knowledge on rates of soil formation, which are then compared to rates of soil erosion by known erosion types, for assessment of soil erosion monitoring at the European scale.
   A modified definition of tolerable soil erosion is proposed as 'any actual soil erosion rate at which a deterioration or loss of one or more soil functions does not occur,' actual soil erosion being 'the total amount of soil lost by all recognised erosion types.' Even when including dust deposition in soil formation rates, the upper limit of tolerable soil erosion, as equal to soil formation, is ca. 1.4 t ha(-1) yr(-1) while the lower limit is ca. 0.3 t ha(-1) yr(-1), for conditions prevalent in Europe. Scope for spatio-temporal differentiation of tolerable soil erosion rates below this upper limit is suggested by considering (components of) relevant soil functions. Reported rates of actual soil erosion vary much more than those for soil formation. Actual soil erosion rates for tilled, arable land in Europe are, on average, 3 to 40 times greater than the upper limit of tolerable soil erosion, accepting substantial spatio-temporal variation. This paper comprehensively reviews tolerable and actual soil erosion in Europe and highlights the scientific areas where more research is needed for successful implementation of an effective European soil monitoring system.

AB  - Microbial community structure (expressed as phospholipid fatty acids) and function (expressed as enzyme activities) were studied in an industrial barren resulting from smelting activities, and three revegetated sites dominated by native plant Paulownia fortunei under the subtropical conditions of Southern China in order to determine whether microbial community structure and function can be used as indicators of changes in abiotic environment during the revegetation process. An adjacent area under natural vegetative cover was used as a control. The revegetation did not lead to consistent shifts of individual phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and enzyme profiles with time. However, the levels of some signature PLFAs, such as Gram negative bacteria (16: 1 omega 9c), arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (16: 1 omega 5c), fungi (18:2 omega 6c), actinomycetes (10Me16:0+10Me17:0+10Me18:0), saturated fatty acid (18:0), monounsaturated fatty acids (16:19c+16:1 omega 7c+16:1 omega 5c+17:1 omega 8c+18:1 omega 7c+18:1 omega 9c), algae (20:5 omega 3c), protozoa (20:2 omega 6c+20:3 omega 6c), PLFA ratios including fung/bact and monounsat/sat fatty acids, and enzyme activities including protease, CM-cellulase and p-glucosidase consistently increased with time after revegetation, corresponding to the increase in total N, pH and porosity in the revegetated soils. Moreover, cyclopropyl fatty acids/monoenoic precursors (cy17:0/16:1 omega 7c and cy19:0/18:1 omega 7c) significantly decreased during time after revegetation and was inversely correlated with the above soil physico-chemical parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the three revegetated sites were separated from the control sites with time after revegetation based on either the PLFA or enzyme activity data. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) confirmed that the microbial community structure was closely linked to its function during the revegetation. Our data showed that the revegetative cover dominated by P. fortunei had considerably improved the structure and function of the soil microbial community, and was thus effective for remediation of industrial barrens contaminated with heavy metals. Of the biotic and abiotic factors determined-in the present study, soil physico-chemical parameters (except for available P and WHC) may be more important factors in determining the structure and function of soil microbial community than heavy metal contents during the revegetation.

AB  - A thorough understanding of the plant drought response mechanism and the relationships between plant functional traits and drought will help to improve the key biophysical process parameterization scheme in ecological and crop growth models. In this study, a drought level evaluation indicator, named water stress degree (D-ws), was established by synthetically considering soil water content (WC), evapotranspiration, and drought duration to obtain a quantitative description of drought level. The maize physiological and functional traits responses to drought and subsequent rewatering were also investigated. Drought-rewatering field experiments with no water addition for 40 days during the vegetative period (VP) and reproductive period (RP) were respectively conducted at Jinzhou Agrometerological Experimental Station, northeast China in 2014 and 2016. The D-ws values indicated that there were significant differences between growth stages and between years because the environmental conditions in 2014 and 2016 were different during the maize growth periods. Furthermore, D-ws was larger in 2016 than in 2014 during the VP and RP. Leaf photosynthesis had a certain adaptability to drought, and the transpiration rate (E) drought response (DR) was quicker than the photosynthetic rate (Pn) response, and P-n recovery was greater than E recovery when the plants were rewatered during the VP. However, leaf photosynthesis is more sensitive to drought and less available to recover as normal in subsequent rewatering during the RP than the VP, which was intensified as D-ws rose between 2014 and 2016. In addition, the leaf WC drought response was faster than the photosynthetic DR during the VP and RP, and leaf and stalk WCs responded more rapidly to drought during the VP than the RP. The decrease in ear WC during the earlier grouting period was larger in the VP than in the RP treatment. However, the drought-induced decrease in daily sap flow rate (DSF) during the RP was larger than during the VP, while the differences in DSF drought response and DSF recovery during rewatering were attributed to the inter-annual variation in Dws. Furthermore, the drought-caused reductions in leaf, stalk, and plant total dry matters and in leaf and stalk WCs had positively exponential or linear relationships with D-ws. The results can help to understand the disaster-causing mechanism of drought-stricken maize.

AB  - Medical waste is generated in various units of health care: inpatient and outpatient hospitals, rehabilitation sanatoria, nursing care facilities, hospitals, clinics, research and analytical laboratories and pharmaceutical facilities.
   Medical wastes belong to a cumbersome and dangerous waste group due to their infectious nature and origin. Incorrect classification, and thus the collection and segregation of medical pose a common problem in our country. The method and the conditions for their disposal are on numerous occasions incorrect.
   Medical waste management is a major challenge for healthcare facilities, but also for the companies involved in the logistics systems for the collection, storage, treatment and disposal of medical waste. Actions to improve the functioning of medical waste management system should be implemented in an attempt to minimize the generation of waste, introduce proper segregation, minimize consumption of raw materials and energy, and reduce costs associated with export and disposal. Medical waste management system in the Podlaskie Region requires increased efforts and system solutions, such as technical and organizational measures for the sources of waste generation, collection methods, identification and control of transport processes and waste treatment technology that will ensure disposal while meeting the standards of environmental and health safety.
   The analysis of the waste management system solutions as well as the optimization of unit processes and consideration of the mutual relations of all system components, processes and correlation makes it possible to organize and rationalize medical waste on the designated area.
   This paper presents the possibility of using the optimization model of the export and disposal of medical waste in the dynamic version, which enables designing the most favourable, in terms of economy, management systems for this type of waste. This paper also describes the optimization study aimed to analyze the impact of\the parameter describing the change in the duration of model tests on the value of the indicator of economic efficiency (E). The study was conducted on the example of the analysis of medical waste management system in the Podlaskie Region.
   The scope of operational research carried out in the framework of the optimization study was divided into two stages of optimization calculations with the assumed technical and economic parameters of the system. In the first stage the lowest cost of operation of the scheme was generated, while in the second one, the impact of input parameter of the system, i.e. the duration of the first and second period of model tests on the indicator of economic efficiency and spatial structure of the system was established.

AB  - Topography is recognized as an important factor in controlling plant distribution and diversity patterns, but its scale dependence and the underlying mechanisms by which it operates are not well understood. Here, we used novel high-resolution (2-m scale) topographic data from more than 30500 vegetation plots to assess the importance of topography for local plant diversity and distribution patterns across Denmark, a 43000 km(2) lowland region. The vegetation data came from 901 nature conservation sites (mean size = 0.16 km(2)) distributed throughout Denmark, each having an average of 34 plots (five-meter radius) per site. We employed a variety of statistical measures and techniques to investigate scale dependence and mechanistic drivers operating within the study region. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression modeling scaled at different spatial resolutions (2x2, 10x10, 50x50, 100x100 and 250x250 m) was used to identify the horizontal resolution yielding the strongest vegetation-topography relationships. Using data scaled at this resolution, we quantified local (within-site) and regional (among sites) relationships between elevation, mechanistic topographic factors (slope, heat index, potential solar radiation, wind exposure, wetness index) and 10 vegetation measures representing species composition, richness and functional composition (average plant preferences along key environmental niche axes). We also investigated how overall site-level environmental characteristics affect the strength of these local relationships. Topography exerted the strongest effects at the 10x10 m horizontal resolution scale. Elevation exerted the strongest influence on vegetation, followed by slope and wetness. Topography generally affected all vegetation measures and exhibited the strongest local relationships with the main species-compositional gradient, the main functional gradient and the plant's average soil moisture preference. The strength of these relationships was strongly influenced by habitat and site-level average moisture conditions, with the strongest relationships found in wet habitats. Our findings show that fine-scale topography can strongly influence local vegetation patterns across a wide range of habitat types even in low-relief lowland regions. Notably, topography exhibited a consistently strong relationship with the main local floristic and functional compositional gradients. While a plurality of underlying mechanisms may contribute to the relationship between topography and vegetation patterns, topographically controlled soil moisture exerts primary control on the relationship.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;High alpine meadows are home to numerous endemic butterfly species. A combination of climate change and changes in agricultural practices has led to a severe decline in many species. A seemingly unaffected representative of this habitat is Erebia pronoe. We studied the behaviour, resource use and population structure of this species to explain its resilience and estimate its future survival potential. This species shows pronounced protandry in combination with serial eclosion. Males were significantly more active and mobile and were also caught significantly more often than females, resulting in a pronounced shift in sex ratio in the predicted population structure. The adults use a wide range of nectar plants and establish homeranges in areas of high habitat quality. Thus, Erebia pronoe adults use a wide array of resources combined with a slight specialisation to avoid niche overlap with closely related species. The resulting ecological flexibility seems to be an adaptation to unpredictable environmental conditions, which should be the result of a long-lasting adaptation process. Moreover, the combination of opportunism and modest specialisation should also be a good basis for coping with future changes caused by climate and land-use change.</p>
   <br></p>
   A mark-recapture study of the nominotypical Erebia pronoe in the Alps was conducted to survey its ecological demands and characteristics. Population structure analysis revealed a combination of protandry (one-week earlier eclosion of males) and serial eclosion. Significant differences between both sexes were found in population density (males: 580/ha & PLUSMN; 37 SE; females: 241/ha & PLUSMN; 66 SE), sex-ratio (2.4) and behaviour (57.7 vs. 11.9% flying). Both sexes used a wide range of nectar plants (Asteraceae, 77.3%; Dipsacaceae, 12.3%; Gentianaceae, 9.7%). The use of nectar plants shows a non-specific spectrum, which, however, completely avoids overlap with the locally co-occurring species Erebia nivalis. Movement patterns show the establishment of homeranges, which significantly limits the migration potential. Due to its broad ecological niche, E. pronoe will probably be able to react plastically to the consequences of climate change. The formation of high population densities, the unconcerned endangerment status, the unspecific resource spectrum and the sedentary character of the species make E. pronoe a potential indicator of the quality and general resource occurrence of alpine rupicolous grasslands.</p>

AB  - Termites are social insects of economic importance that have a worldwide distribution. Identifying termite species has traditionally relied on morphometric characters. Recently, several mitochondrial genes have been used as genetic markers to determine the correlation between different species. Heavy metal accumulation causes serious health problems in humans and animals. Being involved in the food chain, insects are used as bioindicators of heavy metals. In the present study, 100 termite individuals of Anacanthotermes ochraceus were collected from two Saudi Arabian localities with different geoclimatic conditions (Riyadh and Taif). These individuals were subjected to morphological identification followed by molecular analysis using mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene sequence, thus confirming the morphological identification of A. ochraceus. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to determine the genetic relationship between the acquired species and other termite species with sequences previously submitted in the GenBank database. Several heavy metals including Ca, Al, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Ba, Cr, Co, Be, Ni, V, Pb, Cd, and Mo were measured in both collected termites and soil samples from both study sites. All examined samples (termite and soil) showed high concentrations of metals with different concentrations and ratios. Generally, most measured metals had a significantly high concentration in soil and termites at Taif, except for Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mg, and Ni showing significantly high concentrations at Riyadh. Furthermore, termites accumulated higher amounts of heavy metals than the soil at both locations. The mean concentrations of the measured metals in soil samples were found to be in the descending order Ca ? Al ? Mg ? Zn ? Fe ? Cu ? Mn ? Ba ? Cr ? Co ? Be ? Ni ? V ? Pb ? Cd ? Mo, while it was Ca ? Mg ? Al ? Fe ? Zn ? Cu ? Mn ? Be ? Ba ? Pb ? Cr ? V ? Ni ? Cd ? Mo ? Co in termite specimens. The mean concentrations of the studied metals were determined in the soil and termite specimens at both locations. In addition, the contamination factor, pollution load index (PLI) and degree of contamination were calculated for all studied metals in different samples, indicating that both studied sites were polluted. However, Taif showed a significantly higher degree of pollution. Thus, the accurate identification of economically important insects, such as termites, is of crucial importance to plan for appropriate control strategies. In addition, termites are a good bioindicator to study land pollution.

AB  - Over the last decades more and more households have had to face significant human and material losses due to extreme weather conditions and natural disasters. This issue has gradually underlined the need for determining and measuring social vulnerability, both from a local, as well as from a global perspective. Although a vast amount of scientific material has been produced on the topic, there is still a strong need to develop an in-depth and holistic approach for measuring social vulnerability which can later be adapted to different scales (individual, communities) and social categories. The purpose of the paper is twofold: first it strives to contribute to the ongoing research on vulnerability by quantifying the social vulnerability of Romanian settlements in the face of natural hazards. It represents a novel contribution to the advancements in this field since up to now there have been no attempts to delimit the most vulnerable areas in the country from this point of view. Second, it aims to facilitate decision-making processes and planning efforts looking to increase the resilience of local communities. Quantifying social vulnerability can not only help identify places which are most vulnerable, but also the pillars which are its key drivers. Within this study, by using data from the 2011 Census and applying the principal component analysis (PCA), the number of the initially selected indicators has been reduced to a total of 38. By summing up and resealing the created factor scores, a Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) has been obtained for all settlements in Romania. Based on Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) I have managed to reveal the spatial pattern of settlements characterized by higher or lower levels of vulnerability. In general, high levels of vulnerability associated with low levels of resilience characterize peripheral rural areas, places which are further affected by natural hazards, especially by earthquakes and floods (rural areas found in the eastern and south-eastern parts of Romania). As the results of the study have confirmed, even the most developed urban areas can show signs of vulnerability (generally due to the high concentration of population and economic activities), indicating that highly developed urban centres do not necessarily have low levels of social vulnerability. Thus, the analysis is able to provide a more comprehensive overview on communities in desperate need of financial resources in order to diminish the negative impacts of natural hazards.

AB  - A case study was conducted to mountainous ecosystems in the east side of Helan Mountain, located in the transitional zone between steppe and desert regions of China, aiming to reveal the influences of four environmental factors on features of plant biodiversitythe spatial pattern of vegetation types, and the variation of alpha- and beta-diversities in vegetation and flora. Field surveys on vegetation and flora and on environmental factors were conducted, and those field data were analyzed through CCA (Canonical Correspondence Analysis), and through Shannon-Weiner index for alpha-diversity and Sorensen index for beta-diversity. The preliminary results are: (1) Ranked in terms of their impacts on spatial patterns of plant biodiversity, the four selected environmental factors would be: elevation > location > slope > exposure. (2) The variation of Shannon-Weiner index along the altitudinal gradient is similar to that of species amount within altitudinal belts spanning 200 rn each, which suggests a unimodal relationship between the species richness and the environmental condition with regards to altitudinal factors. Both the Shannon-Weiner index and the species richness within each altitudinal belt reach their maximum at elevation range from about 1700 to 2000 m a.s.l. (3) The altitudinal extent with the highest Shannon-Weiner index is identical to the range, where both the deciduous broad-leaved forest, and the temperate evergreen coniferous and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest distribute. The altitudinal range from 1700 to 2200 m a.s.l. is the sector with both high level of species richness and diversified vegetation types. (4) The variation of beta-diversity along the altitude is consistent with the vegetation vertical zones. According to the Sorensen index between each pair of altitudinal belts, the transition of vegetation spectrum from one zone to another, as from the base horizontal zone, the desert steppe, to the first vertical zone, the mountain open forest and steppe zone, to the mountain coniferous forest zone, and last to the alpine shrub and meadow zone, could be recognized through floristic evidence. (5) The diversity of vegetation patterns and the spatial variation of Shannon-Weiner index of plant communities might be the simple but effective indicators for predicting the species richness level and beta-biodiversity pattern, especially in the regions that lack a complete list of flora with information of species distribution pattern.

AB  - 1. Timber harvesting exemplifies many aspects of experimental manipulation in applied ecology. Evaluation of the research approaches used to assess ecological effects of harvesting thus has relevance to a diverse range of ecological questions that address large-scale and human impacts on the environment.
   2. We measured the frequency of approaches, and also design and statistical issues, in assessments of harvesting effects on three response variables (tree regeneration, vertebrates and water) in two major native forests of south-east Australia. Our evaluation was based on 124 documents that contain unique, field-based research and that represent the complete written record (published and unpublished) of relevant research prior to mid-2002.
   3. The dominant approach was contrasts between manipulated stands, nearly always involving mature and old-growth stands as the reference or control. In studies of tree regeneration, focus on wood-production objectives was apparent in the relatively frequent use of stocking standards, and in the use of between- and within-stand contrasts without a control condition. Comparatively greater use of models in vertebrate and water studies suggested more frequent integration of generic principles and, in water studies, reflected strong collective knowledge based on the repeated use of BACI-type designs (i.e. before-after, control-impact) or long-term data sets.
   4. Statistical issues such as poor reporting of experimental designs and of sample statistics were common. Explicit hypotheses were rare, and there was no evidence of definition of critical effect sizes, use of power analysis or use of non-classical statistical approaches (e.g. Bayesian inference).
   5. Lack of treatment replication was widespread in between-stand contrasts and less frequent in within-stand contrasts. Inappropriate interpretation of results from non-replicated experimental designs remains an ongoing issue.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The amount of information obtainable from stand-level manipulations of forest would substantially increase through greater attention to data quality and experimental protocols. Studies require broader experimental contexts, including their potential place in meta-replication frameworks. Increasingly, constraints of large-scale manipulations necessitate the integration of data and the acknowledgement of uncertainty in formalized systems (e.g. Bayesian methods and adaptive management frameworks). Our evaluation suggests the alternative is a perpetuation of short-term, isolated studies that repeat errors and have limited potential to refine knowledge on the ecological effects of timber harvesting and other similarly scaled disturbances.

AB  - The North Central Education and Research Activity Committee (NCERA-59) was formed in 1952 to address how soil organic matter formation and management practices affect soil structure and productivity. It is in this capacity that we comment on the science supporting soil quality and associated soil health assessment for agricultural lands with the goal of hastening progress in this important field. Even though the suite of soil quality indicators being applied by U.S. soil health efforts closely mirrors the "minimum data set" we developed and recommended in the mid-1990s, we question whether the methods or means for their selection and development are sufficient to meet current and emerging soil health challenges. The rush to enshrine a standard suite of dated measures may be incompatible with longer-term goals. Legitimate study of soil health considers soil change accrued over years to decades that influence on- and off-site function. Tailoring of methods to local conditions is needed to effectively apply and interpret indicators for different soil resource regions and land uses. Adherence to a set suite of methods selected by subjective criteria should be avoided, particularly when we do not yet have adequate data or agreed upon interpretive frameworks for many so-called "Tier 1" biological indicators used in soil health assessment. While pooling data collected by producer-groups is one of the most exciting new trends in soil health, standardizing methods to meet broad inventory goals could compromise indicator use for site or application-specific problem solving. Changes in our nation's research landscape are shifting responsibility for soil stewardship from national and state government backed entities to public-private partnerships. As a result, it is critical to ensure that the data needed to assess soil health are generated by reproducible methods selected through a transparent process, and that data are readily available for public and private sector use. Appropriate methods for engagement need to be applied by public-private research partnerships as they establish and expand coordinated research enterprises that can deliver fact-based interpretation of soil quality indicators within the type of normative soil health framework conceived by USDA over 20 years ago. We look to existing examples as we consider how to put soil health information into the hands of practitioners in a manner that protects soils' services.

AB  - Lacustrine organic-rich source rocks (shales and mudstones) were examined to assess the depositional environment and organic input sources of the third and fourth members of the Eocene Shahejie Formation, Bohai Bay Basin, China. Major organic contributions to the Shahejie Formation from dinoflagellates, diatoms, Botryococcus and marine pelagophyte/chrysophyte algae were determined using n-alkane distributions, gammacerane index and diagnostic steranes. Traces of higher plant biomarkers suggest that terrigenous organic inputs were limited. The pervasive presence of beta-carotane, aryl isoprenoids, paleorenieratane, renieratane, isorenieratane, 2 alpha-methylhopanes and crocetane indicate significant organic contributions from bacterial communities including cyanobacteria, purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatiaceae), green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae), and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The extent of H2S content, bacterial sulfate reduction, and photic zone euxinia (PZE) were evaluated by determining the aryl isoprenoids ratio (AIR: 0.7-9.0), the presence of isorenieratene derivatives, and the fate of sulfur in the water column. There was a decrease of PZE extent and duration from the northeast to the south-west of the palaeo-lake, and there was a decrease of water body salinity and bottom water anoxia from the fourth to the third member of the Shahejie Formation. Abrupt environmental perturbations in the third member of the Shahejie Formation are indicated not only by significant changes in parameters such as the pristane/phytane and beta-carotane/n-C-20 alkane ratios, the gammacerane index, the isorenieratane/C-18 aryl isoprenoid, and the AIR, but also by the time lag in the expansion of cyanobacterial lineages after the expansion of purple/green sulfur bacteria, as well as seawater incursions. The unexpected occurrence of intact C-30 4-desmethylsteranes (24-n-propylcholestanes) in the Shahejie Formation is first reported here, after very careful checking, and provides unambiguous biological evidence for at least two marine transgression events reaching the Eocene Dongying palaeo-lake. The organic enrichment of the petroleum source rocks in the Shahejie Formation is a consequence of combined indigenous lacustrine algal production, the constrained and favourable preservation conditions, and significant bacterial contributions and marine organic matter inputs to the lake.

AB  - The organic farming of sea bass and sea bream was investigated in a commercial farm by assessing environmental impact, growth performance, fish welfare and product quality in a multidisciplinary approach. Organic and conventional juveniles were reared in four circular 3.800 m(3) floating sea cages at a maximum final stocking density of 15 kg/m(3) and fed on organic or conventional commercial feeds. Conventional farming was started simultaneously and monitored as the reference condition. Environmental and biological samplings were performed after 16 months at the first fish harvesting. No environmental impact was observed in the organic farming area, whereas a significant increase in total phosphorus concentration in the sediment and some changes in the structure and species composition of benthic assemblages were detected just beneath the conventional sea cages with no impact 25 m from the cages. Organic fish showed a better growth performance consistent with the lower feed conversion ratio and higher metabolic status, as evidenced from the protein and energy profiles, compared with conventional fish. No dietary influence on stress and immune response was observed. A higher incidence of fin splitting occurred, probably due to nutritional factors and/or to the larger size of organic fish. Similar good morphological, physical and sensory traits between organic and conventional fish were observed, as denoted by the high fillet yield, low flesh lipid content, long freshness and shelf life both in sea bream and in sea bass. Conversely, the fillet fatty acid composition was different, being poorer in n-3 PUFA and richer in linoleic acid (C18: 2 n-6) in organic versus conventional fish, mirroring the fatty acid profile of the diet. The organic farming of sea bass and sea bream exhibited an overall good performance. Husbandry and feeding practices did not produce any evident environmental impact although long-period investigations covering several full production cycles are needed. Organic fish grew well, displayed an overall state of well-being and had good quality features despite a lower EPA and DHA content. Improvement of organic feed formulation and quality of feed ingredients emerge as important issues to be addressed to optimize the nutritional quality of organic sea bass and sea bream.

AB  - P>1. The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the frequency of facilitative and competitive interactions will vary inversely across abiotic stress gradients, with facilitation being more common when abiotic stress is high. The effect of competition intensity on species richness is generally thought to be negative, but tests along true stress gradients are lacking. This body of research has primarily focused on vascular plants and could be well informed by broadening to other communities.
   2. We report the first regional-scale test of the SGH using biological soil crusts dominated by mosses and lichens, a key multi-functional community of arid and semi-arid ecosystems worldwide. We examined the intensity of facilitative or competitive interactions at the level of the community and among species pairs along an aridity gradient. Along this gradient we also examined the relationship between competition intensity and species richness.
   3. All evidence strongly suggested that negative species interactions are prevalent in this study system and much more common than expected by chance. At the community scale, we found that abiotic stress associated with aridity was positively related to and explained 6-56% of the variance in indicators of facilitation or competition, dependent on the index and algorithm used. Despite this intriguing contradiction of the SGH at the whole community scale, we found scant dependency of species-level interactions upon abiotic stress. However, the sign and intensity of these interactions proved to be species-specific. We also found that the relationship between competition and species richness, usually negatively affected by competition, was positively related to richness at low abiotic stress, and negatively related to richness at high abiotic stress.
   4. Synthesis. We propose that the response of species interactions to stress gradients may partially depend upon the particular modes of facilitation and competition, in addition to type of stressor and life-history strategies of species involved. We also hypothesize that because stress can act as a filter, a greater number of species interactions are possible under low stress conditions. We believe that this may render intransitivity dominant over niche segregation and expansion, potentially resulting in positive effects of competition on species richness in low stress situations.

AB  - Simple Summary Wild mammals under human care are routinely exposed to management procedures that could be stressful and affect their welfare. Besides, wild animals in captivity are frequently housed under natural climatic conditions, which could also be a year-round challenge that affects how they cope with human intervention. Therefore, stress responses to seasons and management procedures of zoo-housed lesser anteaters (Tamandua tetradactyla) were non-invasively monitored. Behavioural and physiological stress responses differed between seasons. Then, lesser anteaters were studied during winter and summer by exposing them to a routine veterinary check and transportation. Behaviour before and after the procedures was video-recorded and analysed for possible alterations of activity. Faecal glucocorticoid metabolites were measured to evaluate adrenocortical activity. Both procedures altered only behavioural activities, and the response was stronger in summer than winter. We conclude that routine procedures may only slightly compromise the welfare of zoo-housed lesser anteaters, affecting them less in winter than in summer. Management procedures affect behavioural and physiological stress responses of wild mammals under human care. According to the Reactive Scope Model, normal values are presumed to exist within predictive and reactive ranges. First, stress parameters of zoo-housed adult Tamandua tetradactyla were evaluated in winter and summer (29 days each), determining the level of behaviour and/or physiological parameters needed to respond to predictable environmental changes. Secondly, the effects of veterinary procedures and transportation were studied in both seasons. Non-invasive methods were applied, assessing behaviour through videos and adrenocortical activity by faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs). Lesser anteaters exhibited seasonality (summer > winter) in some behavioural parameters, such as nocturnal activities, as well as in the activity cycle (e.g., acrophase) and FGMs. A veterinary check elicited an increase in total activity (TA), natural behaviours and repetitive locomotion and affected the activity cycle, particularly in summer. Transport produced changes in TA, nocturnal and natural activity and some variables of the activity cycle, mostly during summer. Although the effects of routine management procedures were different from each other and presumably stressful, they elicited changes only at the behavioural level, which was greater during summer. The differences observed according to non-invasive methodologies highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in this context and suggest that it is unlikely that individual welfare was affected.

AB  - Unconventional oil and gas development (UOG) generates high volumes of flowback and produced water, byproducts of hydraulic fracturing operations, that are often released or spilled on the soil surface. Soil contamination with these wastewaters, commonly referred to as brine, has the potential to inhibit vegetation growth indefinitely. Natural attenuation of brine is not expedient in arid and semi-arid regions where most United States UOG developments are located, including the Bakken region of North Dakota. In situ (at-site) and ex situ (off-site) soil treatment techniques are commonly employed to remediate brine-contaminated soils in the Bakken. However, little is known regarding each technique's efficacy despite differences in application, cost, and efficiency. We selected 10 sites previously remediated with chemical amendments (in situ) and 11 sites with topsoil excavation (ex situ) in the United States Forest Service Little Missouri National Grasslands. We paired each remediated site with a reference to examine the ability of each strategy to return brine-contaminated sites to conditions reflective of the current state of the surrounding semi-arid rangeland ecosystem. At each site, we quantified soil electrical conductivity (ECe) as an indicator of soil salinity and measured vegetation cover, biomass production, bare ground, and litter. The difference between paired reference and remediated sites was used for analysis. Brine contamination was still evident as soil ECe was similarly increased on chemical amendment and topsoil excavation remediated sites over paired references at all soil depths tested. Due to the nature of the topsoil excavation treatment, elevated ECe in the 0-15 cm depth suggested resalinization of the new topsoil. Remediation techniques also resulted in similar plant community composition marked by an increase in exotic forb biomass, largely due to the invasion of kochia (Bassia scoparia) which was absent from reference sites. However, remediation techniques differed substantially in vegetation establishment. We found 15% more bare ground on sites remediated with chemical amendment treatment than paired references and 55% more with topsoil excavation. Our results indicate that in situ strategies may be more suitable than ex situ strategies for brine-spill remediation in semi-arid rangelands like the Bakken in North Dakota as they cause less disturbance and likely require less post-remediation management to establish adequate vegetation cover to protect the soil from further erosion.

AB  - In agro-ecosystems, environmental monitoring is fundamental to detect and survey changes related to land use change and management practices. Butterflies and moths have often been suggested as suitable indicators for monitoring environmental effects on biodiversity in farmlands. Here, we estimated the required sample size and monitoring effort necessary to run a Lepidoptera survey in European farmland, assessing in particular if monitoring investment would differ between representative bio-geographical regions.
   We operated linear 1-km long transect routes in farmland of Romania, Spain and Sweden from 2013 to 2015, and recorded butterflies and burnet moths (Papilionoidea, Zygaenidae). The transects were walked back and forth four times a season, and replicated yearly. The lepidopteran diversity was high in farmlands of Romania and Spain, but comparatively low in Sweden. The coefficient of variation (CV) of recorded species number differed between countries being lowest in Sweden and highest in Spain. In general, the CV dropped above a transect length of 400-800 m, thus indicating an increase in statistical power. Assuming a non-parametric test for matched samples, power calculations were conducted with the raw count data and with log-transformed count data for comparison. When using log-transformed data, the required sample size to detect an effect was less than 10 transects per country or region (in order to detect a 10% loss of species or a decrease of 30% in total abundance). Specific subgroups of species, e.g. protected species or specific indicator groups, showed a higher variance, thus requiring a higher sample size to detect effects ranging from 12 to 16 transects (equivalent to 21-29 working days per country and year). When using original, untransformed count data a considerably larger sample size would be needed. Actual time to be invested in field work differed between countries due to contrasting regional constraints and conditions. Nevertheless, the final monitoring effort in working days was similar between countries as the factors involved balanced out each other, in particular due to the differing year-to-year variations.
   Our study demonstrated the feasibility of an environmental monitoring programme in arable land using farmland butterflies across Europe. We present a suitable approach and guidelines as well as the necessary effort to be invested in future Europe-wide monitoring programmes of butterflies in agro-ecosystems, based on predictions of statistical power.

AB  - Increasingly mechanized timber harvesting and the repeated use of skid trail networks may affect ground vegetation differently at subsequent stages in the forest rotation. At a fine scale, no studies have yet compared the influence of micro-environmental factors and the effects of skid trail disturbance on ground flora diversity. We investigated understory diversity patterns on skid trails in 30-, 50- and 63-year-old oak forests in the northern half of France. Subplots were placed on skid trail center, wheel track, skid trail edge plus an off-trail control. At each subplot, we measured soil moisture, soil compaction (penetration resistance and bulk density) and photosynthetic active radiation and recorded the abundance of all vascular plants. The richness and abundance of ground flora were calculated based on the classification of their life form, seed bank persistence, light preference and moisture requirements. For each ecological group, we found out its best diversity indicator from subplot location, micro-environmental factors (soil moisture and compaction, light) and stand attributes (stand type, basal area), then assessed the magnitude and negligibility of the effect of the best indicator. (1) Higher soil compaction compared to controls was detected on the tracks of skid trails in the 50- and 63-year-old stands. Neither soil moisture nor light varied with subplot location whatever the stand type. (2) The best diversity indicator that showed non-negligible effects included subplot location, and soil moisture or soil compaction. Compared to controls, skid trails in the 50- and 63-year-old stands were richer in tree and short-term seed bank species, while skid trails in the 30-year-old plots had no effect on ground flora. The abundance of tree and shade-tolerant species was also higher on skid trails. Soil moisture was positively correlated with the richness of low- and high-humidity species, shade-tolerant species and transient seed bank species as well as with the abundance of short-term seed bank species. Bulk density positively affected heliophilous species richness, while penetration resistance was positively related to shrub abundance. Skid trails and soil compaction in our research area had either no impact or a positive impact on ground flora diversity. Longer-term studies of skid trail effects are needed to validate these main findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conservation and management programs use populations of sentinel taxa, such as stream-associated amphibians, as indicator species due to their perceived sensitivity to environmental change. Estimating population size with traditional tools such as mark-recapture estimators may be impractical for forest-dwelling stream-associated amphibians, many of which are cryptic and have low detection probabilities. In addition, sampling techniques can alter habitat conditions, particularly with repeat sampling, and compromise inferences about management impacts. We used simulated and empirical data and N-mixture models to estimate detection probabilities and abundances for two amphibian genera, giant Dicamptodon and torrent Rhyacotriton salamanders, sampled with a less-invasive approach than other methods. We surveyed forested headwater streams located in western Washington, USA, for salamanders 7 July-27 August 2008. We assessed model sensitivity to changes in animal abundance (5 and 15) and detection probability (0.05-0.5), as well as study design alternatives including number of sample plots (50-150) and number of sampling visits (2-4). We also evaluated the effects of stream temperature and stream order on detection probability using data collected from forested streams in Washington, USA. Precision of detection probability estimates improved as the number of plots and sampling occasions increased. Variability of estimated population sizes decreased with higher detection probability, although species abundance had little effect on precision of detection probability estimates. Detection probability estimated from empirical data ranged from 0.07 to 0.65 for giant salamanders and 0.06-0.67 for torrent salamanders. Giant salamander detection probability was positively associated with stream temperature regardless of stream order, and was higher in second- and third-order streams than first-order streams. Detection probability for torrent salamanders varied with stream temperature, order, and the interaction of those covariates, with detection increasing with temperature for second- and third-order streams but showing a flat or decreasing trend for first-order streams. N-mixture models, paired with careful consideration of study design alternatives, can produce robust estimates of abundance and obviate the traditional reliance on indices of relative abundance for many rare and sensitive taxa. Use of a less invasive technique for sampling stream-associated amphibians resulted in sufficient animal captures for suitable model performance. Our simulation results can inform study design and direct efficient allocation of field effort. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - When choosing which environmental attributes to monitor in assessing disturbance, it is important to consider not only which metric will provide the most sensitive indicator of disturbance, but also the spatial considerations of where in the landscape that metric will be most responsive to change. Degradation in landscapes is often unevenly expressed because: (i) disturbance is spatially localised, (ii) landscape elements differ in their sensitivity to disturbance, and (iii) degradation following localised disturbance is spatially contagious. The spatial heterogeneity of degradation has proven to be a key obstacle to rangeland monitoring (e.g. where the initiating processes of broad-scale degradation are concentrated in landscape locations that are not detected by surveys) but can also provide opportunities to focus monitoring efforts. We propose that the effectiveness of monitoring could be enhanced by identifying and selectively monitoring 'indicator patches', i. e. specific landscape locations that provide the most management-relevant and timely information about the consequences of a monitored disturbance. We tested and demonstrated the utility of the 'indicator patch' concept in the rangelands of the Succulent Karoo in southern Africa. We contrasted the grazing response of dominant 'representative' vegetation, with responses of interspersed patches of distinct vegetation associated with zoogenic mounds. Since mound vegetation is more palatable and preferentially grazed by sheep, we tested whether mounds could serve as 'indicator patches' in providing a sensitive measure of grazing disturbance. Percentage canopy cover measurements in dominant off-mound vegetation provided a poor indicator of grazing disturbance (although more intensive plant size measurements did reveal grazing impacts on plant population dynamics). In contrast, vegetation on mounds displayed patterns of changes in species abundances that were easier to detect and useful for interpreting and quantifying the effects of grazing. Mound vegetation could, therefore, be used as 'indicator patches' and targeted for exclusive sampling as a sensitive method for monitoring rangeland condition and detecting early warnings of vegetation change. This approach could be widely employed to better harness the extensive knowledge base regarding the patchy, spatially localised nature of degradation-initiating processes in numerous other landscapes. Routinely incorporating this understanding into the design of monitoring programs could improve the effectiveness of sampling effort, allow detection of more subtle trends (changes), and provide earlier warning of impending degradation so remedial action can be taken before degradation becomes severe and widespread.

AB  - Pitahaya fruit (Hylocereus undatus) is highly perishable, and so commercialization is limited. Refrigeration prolongs shelf life of fruits and vegetables. Nevertheless, some produce may be injured by low temperatures during storage. Studies on chilling injury in pitahaya fruit are scarce and this damage is mostly judged subjectively. This study was conducted to contribute to the knowledge and understanding of chilling injury in pitahaya, to eventually identify indicators that would be useful and consistent in describing degree of injury more objectively for future studies. Pitahaya fruits were stored at 4 +/- 2 degrees C and 8 +/- 20 degrees C for 5, 10, 16, or 21 d. At the end of each low-temperature storage period the fruits were removed-. from cold storage and kept at 26 +/- 2 degrees C and RH 72 +/- 2% for 0, 3, or 6 d. An additional group of fr-uits (used as reference) was kept under environmental conditions (6 d at 26 +/- 2 degrees C). At the end of each treatment period, external color, respiration rate, production of ethanol and acetaldehyde in pulp, and observable damage were assessed. Fruits not stored at low temperatures (reference) showed good color development (hue angle diminished from 45.09 degrees to 17.5 degrees) and good external appearance. However, external damage was exhibited in low-temperature-stored fruits at both low temperatures, although more intensely and sooner in fruits stored at 4 degrees C than in those stored at 8 degrees C. For both temperatures, after 5, 10, or 16 d of cold storage, a moderate reduction of hue angle was registered (around 18.6 degrees to 26.7 degrees) when removed from low-temperature storage, indicating moderate development of color. In fruits stored for 21 d at 4 degrees C and ripening at 26 +/- 2 degrees C, hue angle remained high (37.6 degrees), indicating that the long period of cold storage inhibited natural reduction of hue angle, and so the development of the desirable external pinkish-red color did not occur. A 28% increase in respiration rate was also recorded, while production of ethanol and acetaldehyde increased 37 and 35 times. Also, external and internal appearance of the fruit deteriorated. In general, observable damage increased in fruits stored for longer periods, particularly at the lower temperature. It is suggested that external color (hue angle) and respiration rate are objective, useful, and consistent variables for measuring chilling injury in pitahaya fruits.

AB  - Typically, ecological impact assessments (ETA) are conducted under time constraints, making the collection of baseline data and application of Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) designs difficult. Here we report the results of three "postdevelopment" experiments testing the effects of a small wind park on the abundance, distribution, and behavior of wintering Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima), a large sea duck. Our approach was based on the rationale that the probability of detecting an impact should increase with decreasing distances from the wind park. Because prey abundance is likely to drive the distribution of wintering ciders, we removed that confounding variable by (1) randomizing its effect over the study area, and (2) incorporating the variable into the analysis. In the first experiment, we compared the abundance and distribution of eiders when wind turbines were switched on and off. This was complemented by investigating the escape behavior of flocks when wind turbines were switched on after they had been off for one full day. In a second experiment, we tested for any departure from the habitat-matching rule, which states that the proportion of eiders and the proportion of food should be equal at different distances from the park. In a third experiment, the flying behavior of eiders in relation to the wind park was analyzed by measuring the landing and flying rates for patches of decoys located at 100, 300, and 500 m from the wind park. We found little evidence for negative impacts, because we could not detect any effect in three tests out of four. Only in the decoy experiment did we observe eiders reducing their landing and flying near (100 m from) the wind park. We conclude, for the conditions under which our experiments were performed, that the wind park did not substantially affect wintering Common Eiders. However, many aspects of the potential impacts of offshore wind parks on sea ducks have not been covered by our study and, therefore, cannot be generalized to other species or other phases of the annual cycle. Nevertheless, we argue that the use of multiple postdevelopment experiments based on a gradient approach is a helpful complement to BACI studies.

AB  - There is a wide consensus regarding the importance of social and economic transformations that new technologies, especially Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), have had in the last decades. ICT companies show an extraordinary capacity to offer new solutions to emerging and unsatisfied needs. Their social and economic impact is unquestionable in relation to their contribution to economic growth and they are also essential elements in the transfer of technology from national innovation systems to markets and society in general.
   In this context, we can understand the interest Social Economy firms have in increasing their presence within emerging technology-based activities. This presence will contribute to strengthening the Social Economy (SE) sector in several aspects: increasing its growth rates in the medium and long term; improving its relative contribution to regional and national macro-economic indicators; incorporating new profiles of workers and companies; and improving working conditions in the sector.

   The objective of this paper is to assess the current position of SE companies in technology-based sectors and, more specifically, technology-based entrepreneurship (TBE) in the SE. In addition, it aims to delve into the different elements that condition this position, with the ultimate goal of identifying the areas of progress to improve its position in the TBE sector.
   Methodologic approach
   In order to achieve the goal, we chose to undertake qualitative research of a phenomenological nature (Golafshani, 2003), using in-depth interviews with a sample of actors within the main groups involved in technology-based entrepreneurship and in the SE. The following profiles were selected:
   Business and tecnological entrepreneurship advisory agents (chambers of commerce, business incubators, spin-offs);
   support structures of the SE, as representative entities and specialists, aware of the reality of the sector and its presence and position in technological sectors;
   technology-based companies and entrepreneurs, as the main players and experts with their firsthand experience in these types of business initiatives;
   venture capital funds, as the main investors and financial agents in these types of companies at their growth and expansion stages.
   Finally, twenty-two entities and individuals were selected for the interviews, which were carried out in November and December 2015 and had an approximate average duration of one hour each.
   The selected methodological approach was developed through in-depth interviews Taylor and Bogdan, 1992). This information collection technique is ideal for the proposed objectives as they allow access to information in a direct and structured way and, at the same time, facilitate the creation of analytical processes.
   Results
   The results obtained from the content analysis of the interviews are grouped into three categories:
   1. The importance of technology-based entrepreneurship in the Social Economy
   Emerging technology-based activities have a strategic role for the whole economy and, in particular, for the SE sector. First, these activities allow for a greater sectorial and geographical diversification. Second, technology-based activities are found in sectors with high and continuous growth in addition to high added value, thus strengthening firms. These activities also favor the incorporation of new worker profiles younger and highly qualified), which are associated with stable jobs and high remuneration, that lead to an improvement in the average working conditions of the SE.
   2. Differential elements of technology-based entrepreneurship
   The characterization of technology-based entrepreneurship allows the differential elements of this type of entrepreneurship to be known. As such, it is possible to identifying those characteristics that pose particular difficulties for the SE entities due to their identifying elements.
   For example, TBE are companies in which cooperation, the creation of networks and the generation of synergies with other companies and agents from their own sector or from others) are key elements. They usually have an ongoing relationship with universities, research centers and technology centers. In addition, these firms tend to develop in different activity branches with high technological content and increased tendency to innovate. These companies usually present a very long maturity phase for their products, with high and rapid growth in their consolidation phases. They also have specific financial needs seed capital and public aid during the initial phase, and venture capital in later phases).
   The advice received by these companies is usually focused on the development of the business model and the choice of the legal form for the firm is secondary. Therefore, they do not search for the advantages of the SE legal form.
   3. Strategic areas to improve the situation of the Social Economy in technological -based activities or sectors.
   Strategic initiatives are grouped around four specific points: improving the visibility of the SE, in particular, aimed at potential entrepreneurs and universities, research centers and technology centers, where technology-based initiatives arise; bringing the SE closer to new entrepreneurship and BTE profiles, increasingly similar to the concept of social enterprise (with more democratic and participative models in addition to a concern for a greater " social return"); counselling and support in the initial stages of BTE, in business and legal training; and support in mature and consolidation phases, especially in two areas, financial and network services.
   Conclusions
   Beyond the core ICT activities analysed in this paper, it is worth asking what role the Spanish Social Economy can play in the development of emerging sectors. Most of them are the result of the merger between ICTs and different activities, which of their own elements can offer them an advantage and what challenges they will need to face in order to take advantage of their potential.
   Firstly, the Spanish Social Economy presents a series of characteristics that give it an advantage in the anticipated development of new activities. One of these elements is the strong productive specialization that the SE and non-profit entities have in many of the emerging activities. The SE companies (including associations, foundations and other non-profit entities) represent 8.9% of the total number of Spanish companies (DIRCE, 2017). However, in activities related to care services, their presence is particularly high: 50% of social service companies without accommodation and 37.1% of services in residential establishments. Their presence is also very significant in cultural activities (46.8%), in sports and recreational activities (28.0%) and partly within green economy activities.
   A second element that provides the SE with an advantage is that social and organizational innovation, two of the key processes in the new scenario, are identifying elements of the SE. Social innovation is related to inclusive growth, a cross-cutting element in the development of many SE entities for decades (insertion companies, sheltered employment centers, social initiative cooperatives...). Organizational innovation, based on the Oslo Manual, entails for example, the introduction of new business practices, new methods for a better distribution of responsibilities and decision-making. These are core elements of SE entities.
   In fact, the SE organization models could accommodate the preferences of current workers, who demand more participatory, more horizontal, more inclusive and more flexible work organization models. These environments are also more suitable for the development of social innovation initiatives.
   Finally, another element of the SE is its economic and social contribution recognized at a political, social and empirical level. At a political level, the mission of SE companies is completely aligned with the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the EU Agenda for growth and employment.
   However, their potential advantage as indicated in previous paragraphs may be hindered by not assuming certain challenges. One of these is the progress towards a greater digitization of the sector, which must consider the entire value chain (from the provision of services to the continuous relationship with the user). The risk of not addressing the digitalization process in a decisive way may be to lose the current leadership position that it has in several sectors (education, health services, social services, agri-food, etc.).
   A second challenge focuses on the field of prospecting new products and solutions, also in accordance with social innovation. One of the strategic lines of the sector could be to address prospecting and experimentation systems for new products and solutions using digitization. A strategic foresight center and the development of new tools, such as "living labs", could play a catalytic role in the incorporation of social innovation into the sector.

AB  - Volcano seismicity is an important tool in monitoring and forecasting activity at volcanoes globally. Volcanic earthquakes show diverse spectral characteristics, of which shallow long-period (low-frequency) seismicity and long-duration tremor are generally interpreted as indicators of fluid migration, and as potential eruption precursors. Here we show that a common low-cohesion volcanic sediment from the Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy) produces low-frequency and long-duration seismicity as it undergoes deformation in dry conditions. We employed acoustic-emission rock-deformation experiments at a range of strain rates to produce events that, when normalized for scale, were spectrally indistinguishable from the long-period and tremor seismicity observed in natural volcanic settings. The generation of these signals was enhanced at lower laboratory strain rates. Correlated X-ray tomography of the samples before and after deformation constrained the source as distributed damage.
   Long-period seismicity at volcanoes may be generated by deformation of weak material in the subsurface, not solely by fluid movement, according to rock deformation experiments.

AB  - Seagrass are an important marine ecosystem of the Fiji Islands. We confirm six seagrass species from the archipelago and defined five broad categories of seagrass habitat. We report, with high confidence, seagrass meadows covering 59.19 km(2) of Fiji's shallow water habitats from literature and this study. Long-term monitoring of seagrass abundance, species composition, and seed banks at eight sentinel sites, found no long-term trends. Examination of key attributes that affect seagrass resilience identified meadows as predominately enduring and dominated by opportunistic species which had moderate physiological resistance, and high recovery capacity. We examined threats to Fiji's seagrass meadows from extreme climatic events and anthropogenic activities using a suite of indicators, identifying water quality as a major pressure. Based on these findings, we assessed existing protections in Fiji afforded to seagrass and their services. This understanding will help to better manage for seagrass resilience and focus future seagrass research in Fiji.

AB  - Water quality is one of the most critical indicators of environmental pollution and it affects all of us. Water contamination can be accidental or intentional and the consequences are drastic unless the appropriate measures are adopted on the spot. This review provides a critical assessment of the applicability of various technologies for real-time water quality monitoring, focusing on those that have been reportedly tested in real-life scenarios. Specifically, the performance of sensors based on molecularly imprinted polymers is evaluated in detail, also giving insights into their principle of operation, stability in real on-site applications and mass production options. Such characteristics as sensing range and limit of detection are given for the most promising systems, that were verified outside of laboratory conditions. Then, novel trends of using microwave spectroscopy and chemical materials integration for achieving a higher sensitivity to and selectivity of pollutants in water are described.

AB  - Over the past decades, clean and renewable energy has become a subject of great interest to both science and industry in response to the pollution caused by conventional energy sources. Its useful form should always meet the requirements of high performance and low environmental impact, while remaining within the scope of the expected functionality. The purpose of study presented in this paper was to determine the operational characteristics for a recently developed photovoltaic (PV)-powered thermoelectric (TE) cooling system with heat recovery. The characteristics of operation of the tested system were determined within the use of a specially developed measurement system. The conducted experimental research allowed describing the conditions of power supply for TE module using PV system, calculate the coefficient of performance (COP) for the whole TE cooling system with heat recovery and calculate the environmental impact indicators based on the material and energy balance used for life cycle assessment (LCA).

We determined effectiveness of two biological preparations containing effective microorganisms in elimination of organic and biogenic compounds, indicator bacteria and total suspended solids from the sewage pretreated in a septic tank. After four months of work under a hydraulic loading of 76.4 mm.d(-1) we found the filter with 60 cm foam layer to be the most efficient in the elimination of BOD5, CODCr, NH4+-N and coliform bacteria. An average reduction in these pollutants reached 79.4%, 67.8%, 58.0% and 88.0%, respectively. Vertical filters filled with trims of upholstery foam and supplied with effective microorganisms ensured favorable conditions for development of heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria without any need for additional aeration.

AB  - This work presents the performance of an ultrafiltration membrane bioreactor (UF-MBR) system used as a means of removing pollution from domestic wastewater. Considering the technical performances of the process under different operational conditions, influence of hydraulic retention time (HRT), aeration rate and transmembrane pressure were observed. The evaluation of permeate quality, calculated by the removal efficiencies for various water quality indicators: chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP). The best results obtained on the system (pressure p = 1.27 bar), HRT (15 h) showed removal efficiencies up to 90% in terms of organic compounds removal, 100% in terms of suspended solids presence and up to 80% reduction of TN and TP. The overall results suggest that the performance of the UF-MBR are likely to impact on the operation and maintenance of the system. However, the MBR process might be successfully applied as a treatment for the removal of pollution from domestic wastewater.

Refers to an exploratory research through the application of a questionnaire to 30 rural producers of the municipality. Initially, the agricultural practices used in these activities were identified, as well as the main Laws and Regulations existing in Brazil that condition the activity of Swine Breeding and Milk Bovin. It was soon presented actions that contribute to the improvement of sustainable practices in these activities. It was verified that the municipality is in the situation "in balance" in the two dimensions evaluated. The analysis of each indicator separately pointed to several critical points, which need action and measures to improve its performance.

AB  - Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw. is specially a pollutant-sensitive indicator species in fresh water and Marchantia polymorpha L. is commonly found on moist clay or silty soils, especially on recently burned land throughout the northern hemisphere. F. antipyretica and M. polymorpha were examined to determine the quantity of metal accumulation. Samples were collected from Ayazma Stream (Ida Mountain) with similar exposure conditions in July 2017. Mosses are suitable species for the uptake of heavy metals because of their morphological and physiological properties. Because of this, studies on the use of mosses as an environmental monitoring have increased in last decades. In the present study each sample were irrigated for 72 hours with solutions 0, 02 M CuCl2, ZnCl2 and Pb(NO3)2. At the end of the experimental period, the chlorophyll concentration of F. antipyretica and M. polymorpha was decreased. There was significant reduction of the chlorophyll content for each sample due to the heavy metals accumulation.

AB  - This article analyses the scientific approaches used for the development of a classification system for agricultural lands in Kazakhstan, based on approaches adopted in the Russian Federation and European Union (EU). The study involved the assessment of territories with regard to their economy and social sphere, environmental conditions, quality of life of the rural population, remoteness from major cities, demographics, soil quality, climate, availability of labour and other resources, level of diversification and relevance of legal framework to socio economic development. In determining the criteria for identifying regions unfavourable for agriculture, the approach adopted in the EU is recommended: one of the important indicators showing that an area is not favourable for agriculture is the reluctance of investors to support development. Specific features such as excessive remoteness from marketing outlets, the presence of exposed border areas, rural population abandonment; high unemployment and low incomes; poor infrastructure; and low levels of agricultural development should also be taken into account. This article classifies land unfavourable for agriculture to identify territories that will require additional state subsidy to support development.

AB  - The application of nisin to tangerine wine was investigated in this study. Nisin was found to be active against Leuco-nostoc mesenteroides CICC 9008, Lactobacillus acidophilus CICC 6241, Oenococcus oeni CICC 6066, and Acetobacter pasteurianus CICC 20874. However, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was not sensitive to nisin. The inhibitory activity of nisin against these four strains was tested by adding different concentrations of nisin (25, 50, 75, and 100 mu g/ml) under different pH conditions (pH 3, 3.5, 4, and 4.5). The dynamic models of nisin action against these four strains were constructed. When nisin was added in the juicing process, the growth of indicator strains was not inhibited; indicating that components in tangerine juice might impact the activity of nisin. However, the addition of nisin would decrease the concentration of SO2 added in tangerine wine production. The addition of nisin would increase the final concentration of malic acid and decrease the final concentration of lactic acid. The results indicated that nisin inhibited the natural fermentation of lactic acid.

AB  - Intensive agricultural practices and soil quality concerns have brought increased emphasis on biological strategies of crop production. Co-inoculation of Rhizobium spp. and Bacillus megaterium improved the root biomass of chickpea at flowering (+51%) and grain yield (+12.5%) in a Vertisol. At vegetative stage, the rhizosphere and microbial inoculation effects and their combined effect increased the soil dehydrogenase activity by 1.2x, 1.3x and 1.6x, the associative nitrogen fixers by 13.5x, 64.8x and 875x and acid phosphatase by 6.7x, 4.1x, 27.3x, respectively. The rhizosphere to soil ratios of associative nitrogen fixers and acid phosphatase were 32.8 and 2.1-fold higher in inoculated soils at vegetative stage. At flowering, associative nitrogen fixers and acid phosphatase activity increased significantly by 7.2x and 1.5x due to inoculation. Results reflect the improvement of soil biological condition due to microbial inoculation, and the usefulness of associative nitrogen fixers and acid phosphatase activity as indicators of soil microbial health.

AB  - A sensitive, selective and robust method was developed to quantify low levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils by means of Programmed Temperature Vaporization - Large Volume Injection (PTV-LVI) coupled to gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. Optimal vent pressure and flux at the PTV inlet of the GC system were determined by comparison of peak areas obtained from injection of a standard PAHs mixture at different conditions. Assessment of method performance was carried out with home-made standards prepared by spiking three non-PAH contaminated soils that contained 1.8%, 4.6% and 25% natural organic matter (NOM), with mixtures of six different PAHs at low concentration levels. Detection limits between 9 and 12 ng g(-1) and variation coefficients below 11% were determined from analysis of spiked samples of the soil with lowest NOM content. PAHs recoveries typically ranged from 61% to 96% for the three studied soils.

AB  - Environmental conditions that can support deep moist convection during the cold season are analyzed using a 10-year climatology of narrow cold-frontal rainbands (NCFRs) in Germany. One hundred twenty events were detected. Mid-level processes seem to be an important indicator for the development of deep moist convection: a majority of the detected NCFRs developed at the cyclonically sheared side of strong mid-level jet streaks where also lightning and severe weather occurrence were concentrated. The thermodynamic environment along the NCFRs is analyzed using more than 50 proximity soundings. Very weak instability, strong low-level vertical wind shear, and indications of the presence of moist absolutely unstable layers were found. CAPE was not a good indicator to discriminate between electrified and non-electrified events. A relationship between the occurrence of low-level mixing and severe wind gusts was not found. The high fraction of missed events in the Estofex forecasts indicates that this type of convection is difficult to forecast. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The continuous processing and evaluation of meteorological radar data require significant efforts by scientists, both for data processing, storage, and maintenance, and for data interpretation and visualization. To assist meteorologists and to automate a large part of these tasks, we have designed and developed Abacus, a multi-agent system for managing radar data and providing decision support. Abacus' agents undertake data management and visualization tasks, while they are also responsible for extracting statistical indicators and assessing current weather conditions. Abacus agent system identifies potentially hazardous incidents, disseminates preprocessed information over the web, and enables warning services provided via email notifications. in this paper, Abacus' agent architecture is detailed and agent communication for information diffusion is presented. Focus is also given on the customizable logical rule-bases for agent reasoning required in decision support. The platform has been tested with real-world data from the Meteorological Service of Cyprus. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - VIABILITY
AB  - The suitability of the oxidation-reduction indicator MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2yl)-2,5diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide] to measure viability of marine diatoms is evaluated. This tetrazolium salt is reduced to form bluish violet formazan derivative in living cells while it is not reduced in dead cells. Using a contact time of three hours the formazan is spectrophotometrically quantified. Culture conditions were standardised in 24-multiwell microculture plates using four marine diatom species, some of which are currently grown in aquaculture, to determine the minimal cell concentration for detecting of formazan metabolisation. Our results demonstrate that the absorbance due to the reduction of MTT is strictly related to the diatom cellular activity. This simple colorimetric assay permits rapid cell numeration of a great number of samples in comparison to the classic haematimetric method, notably for in vitro bioassays in ecological and physiological diatom investigations. This method is only applicable to unicellular algal strains (monospecific and axenic culture). For that reason, this method is suitable for algal bioassay (e.g. water fertility tests, allelopathic studies).

T2  - NEW ENGLAND ECONOMIC REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Comparisons among state unemployment insurance systems can be misleading. Frequently quoted Indicators of the generosity of their benefits, competitiveness, and adherence to the experience-rating principle are influenced by states' relative economic conditions, thereby obscuring underlying structural differences. Moreover, because the indicators are statewide averages, they obscure important intrastate differences in tax and benefit treatment across types of firms and workers.
   This article offers alternative indicators based on a simulation approach designed to alleviate these problems. The authors use the simulated experiences of representative workers and firms to compare 28 states and contrast the results with those obtained from more conventional indicators. Given the intricacy of the issues and the harsh trade-offs involved, it is not surprising that debates concerning state UI policy are so contentious. The authors point out that policymakers reviewing the simulations can gain insight into the nature of the trade-offs among policy goals entailed in various UI options. This may even help them to identify "win-win" situations, in which a policy innovation that furthers one goal simultaneously furthers another.

AB  - Micronuclei can be measured through a conventional method after staining with Giemsa or fluorescence dyes for DNA. However, a technique with cell proliferation control should be preferred. This is done by incubation with cytochalasin B and counting the micronuclei in binucleated cells. Satisfactory dose relationships are observed after irradiation of human lymphocytes in vitro. The RBE for fast neutrons is around three. An automatic analysis is possible by image analysis. The dose range in which significant increases can be observed is 0.3 to 5 Gy X-rays. The assay becomes more sensitive when the micronuclei are determined only in B-lymphocytes. Another possibility exists by determination of the number of micronuclei with centromeres. For this purpose the hybridization with pancentromeric DNA probes and fluorescence labelling is of advantage. By this technique a radiation dose of 0.1 Gy X-rays can be detected. It is apparently also possible under these conditions to detect radiation exposures which have taken place decades before the measurements. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The value of the classical blood variables (erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit) and their derivatives (mean erythrocytic volume, mean erythrocytic hemoglobin, mean erythrocytic hemoglobin content) as indicators of fish health is assessed from the viewpoints of measurement precision and the distortion of information content by sampling procedures and storage conditions. So also is the concept of hematological norms and their validity in relation to natural fish populations. Few of the assumptions underlying the use of hematological data for health assessment purposes can be regarded as other than marginally valid. Of the primary indices, erythrocyte numbers and hemoglobin, if corrected for nonviable cells and accompanied by information on isomorph abundances, appear to be the more useful indicators of O-2 carrying capacity. Hematocrit and hematocrit-dependent Wintrobe indices emerge as suspect. Higher-order indices describing red cell anisocytosis and yielding an "erythron profile" provide additional and more sensitive means for assessing blood status.

T2  - PAPUA NEW GUINEA MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Development in the Pacific has largely ignored the importance of health as a pathway and an outcome. This paper reviews the effects of development on health and health services in the region. It aims to highlight the plight of development that happens without considering the sociocultural and physical environments of the small island countries. The review shows that health and social conditions in the Pacific are deteriorating. The process of development has been externally controlled without community participation. Pacific leaders have been preoccupied with economic development and have not been cognisant of health and social consequences. During progress an enjoyable life can be achieved through sustainable development with community participation. However, indicators of economic growth in the Pacific do not correlate with those of health. The increase of rape, suicide, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and crime suggests that Pacific islanders are increasingly disillusioned by the present developmental approach: they have ceased to enjoy life before death. it is suggested that decentralized development planning with community involvement, integrating health and social considerations, would be the way out of this dilemma.

AB  - This paper investigated the effect of task complexity on time estimation in the virtual reality environment (VRE) using behavioral, subjective, and physiological measurements. Virtual reality (VR) is not a perfect copy of the real world, and individuals perceive time duration differently in the VRE than they do in reality. Though many researchers have found a connection between task complexity and time estimation under non-VR conditions, the influence of task complexity on time estimation in the VRE is yet unknown. In this study, twenty-nine participants performed a VR jigsaw puzzle task at two levels of task complexity. We observed that as task complexity increased, participants showed larger time estimation errors, reduced relative beta-band power at Fz and Pz, and higher NASA-Task Load Index scores. Our findings indicate the importance of controlling task complexity in the VRE and demonstrate the potential of using electroencephalography (EEG) as real-time indicators of complexity level.</p>

AB  - Leading etiological theories implicate the family environment in shaping borderline personality disorder (BPD). Although a substantive literature explores familial aggregation of this condition, most studies focus on parent influence(s) on offspring symptoms without examining youth symptom influence on the parent. The current study investigated reciprocal relations between parent and adolescent BPD symptoms over time. Participants were 498 dyads composed of urban-living girls and their parents enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study (Pittsburgh Girls Study). The authors examined BPD severity scores assessed yearly when youth were ages 15-17 years in a series of cross-lagged panel models. After controlling for autoregressive effects, a measure of parent-child conflict, and an indicator of socioeconomic status, evidence of parental influence on adolescent symptoms did not emerge. However, adolescent BPD symptoms at age 16 predicted greater parent BPD symptoms at age 17 above the influence of depression. Results highlight the importance of considering the influence of youth BPD on parental symptoms.

AB  - Drought-induced tree death has become a serious problem in global forest ecosystems. Two nonexclusive hypotheses, hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, have been proposed to explain tree die-offs. To clarify the mechanisms, we investigated the physiological processes of drought-induced tree death in saplings with contrasting Huber values (sapwood area/total leaf area). First, hydraulic failure and reduced respiration were found in the initial process of tree decline, and in the last stage carbon starvation led to tree death. The carbohydrate reserves at the stem bases, low in healthy trees, accumulated at the beginning of the declining process due to phloem transport failure, and then decreased just before dying. The concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates at the stem bases are a good indicator of tree damage. The physiological processes and carbon sink-source dynamics that occur during lethal drought provide important insights into the adaptive measures underlying forest die-offs under global warming conditions.

AB  - Bacterial branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) have been successfully used as quantitative climate proxies for reconstructing annual mean air temperature (MAT) and soil pH from sediments. However, reconstructions derived from brGDGTs in regions with diverse hydrological and atmospheric conditions require further refinement. In this study, we investigated the suitability of brGDGTs as temperature and precipitation proxies from surface soils on opposite slopes of Mount Fanjing in subtropical China. The results show a clear Waltitudinal lapse rate of MBT5ME'-derived MAT and between-slope differences in MAT at given altitude. Moreover, the MBT5ME'-derived MAT values are more strongly related to the MAT from March to November than that of the whole year. A turning point is also observed from the measured pH and CBT'-derived pH gradients at altitude of 1400 m similar to 1500 m, in accordance with the fog horizon, where precipitation reaches the maximum value. The findings prove that brGDGTs from soil transects can be used as indicators for reconstructions of climate parameters from subtropical regions of China.

AB  - Sewage water from Karachi and agricultural runoff from adjacent lands put lots of pollutants and nutrients in coastal waters of Karachi. Appearance of algal blooms in new geographical areas is being frequently reported and is attributed to increased marine pollution and climatic changes. For the current monitoring study, fortnightly phytoplankton samples were collected from polluted as well as cleaner localities along Karachi coast by using a phytoplankton net of 40 mu m mesh size. Standard parameters like Temperature, salinity, pH, rainfall were also recorded. Samples were analyzed qualitatively using phase-contrast microscope. Unusual, non-toxic and irregular blooms of a pollution indicator micro alga, Synedra acus has been frequently observed, suppressing existence of all other phytoplankton. This irregular appearance could not be related with any oceanographic parameters under study. These results reflect the presence of suspect factors (nutrients, environmental pollutants and climatic conditions) that might have governed synedra acus to bloom in this part of the northern Arabian Sea.

TI  - FIELD TESTING OF AN OPTICAL IN SITU NITRATE SENSOR IN THREE IRISH ESTUARIES
T2  - BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY
LA  - English
AB  - In situ measurements of nitrate (NO3) were made using a submersible ultraviolet nitrate sensor (SUNA) in three Irish estuaries (Bandon, Blackwater and Lee) in January and February 2012. Measurements were compared against discrete water samples analysed in the laboratory. There was excellent agreement between the SUNA and laboratory measurements, with the variation in in-situ nitrate measurements explaining nearly 100% of the variation in laboratory measurements (r(2) = 0.99, with a negative bias of similar to 10%). In each estuary there was a conservative mixing relationship between salinity and nitrate, indicating that the main source of nitrate to these estuaries in winter is from the main inflowing river. The highest nitrate concentration of 235.2 mu M at salinity 0.7 was found in the Lee Estuary and the lowest concentration of 7.5 mu M at salinity 34.6 was found in Cork Harbour. The successful demonstration of this technology in Irish estuaries provides a powerful example of how future developments in this field will allow the real-time assessment of environmental conditions in these environments.

AB  - The bulk phase of water and its status in the cells play an important role in the management of metabolic processes. One of the little-known universal phenomenon associated with the state of water is the Hofmeister effect which influences interfacial surfaces, the conformation of macromolecules, enzyme activity, and the growth of microorganisms. We investigated the influence of this effect on the change in the cell's ability to adapt to changing osmotic conditions, since understanding the mechanisms of osmotic behavior of the cells is an important step in the management of their activity (start of endo- and exocytosis, apoptosis). It is shown that specific properties of anions in the medium correlate with the osmotic sensitivity of red blood cells (RBC) and with indicators of free and bound water in suspension. The lyotropic series anion solution effect on the cell is a change of the hydration and structure of the membrane, which determines the osmotic behavior of the cell and the water environment properties.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the soil tillage system on soil enzymatic activity. The performed investigations, employing two soil tillage systems: classical (ploughing) and simplified (no-tillage), were carried out on Luvisols and Arenosols differing typologically, with regard to their kind and species. The activity of the following five enzymes was determined in soil samples: dehydrogenases, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, urease and protease. The applied enzymes tests turned out to be good indicators differentiating the examined soil objects depending on the employed tillage system. The employment of the simplified tillage system stimulated significantly the activity of the analysed enzymes irrespective of the soil type. This effect was particularly apparent in the top layer (0-10 cm) of the soil. An exceptionally wide range of activity was obtained for dehydrogenases indicating the usefulness of this group of enzymes for the evaluation of changes in the soil environment under the influence of the soil tillage system. The observed activity stimulation of the examined enzymes was accompanied by advantageous changes in soil chemical conditions.

AB  - Inter-city relation, though of great importance in the context of an increasingly globalized society, has rarely been addressed quantitatively compared to the structure and function within the city due to the difficulties when acquiring and disposing the relational data between cities. In this study, we presented a conceptual model for quantifying the inter-city relation in ecological and economic contexts based on emergy analysis, which is recognized as a promising approach to evaluating various city flows on a common basis. Emergy diagram of an urban system was constructed explicitly, and the related relational data indices were selected from the ecological and economic aspects, respectively, to form two indicator systems for emergy analysis, incorporating the transfer of labor, material and currency, etc. After that, the inter-city interaction intensity and sustainability were formulated to identify the sustainable conditions between the two cities, and hopefully, it could reveal potential complementarity or competition between the cities over time. With the introduction of emergy analysis, this study may provide a new way to quantify city interaction.

AB  - Switzerland is from the end of World War II an immigration country. After three decades of labour migration, in the early 1980s, family reunification progressively became the most important reason for immigration. At the time of the 2000 Census, there were 1.5 million documented foreigners living in Switzerland. This represented 20% of the resident population, one of the highest proportions of foreigners in any country in Europe. Approximately 39% of children in Switzerland were members of families of foreign origin with at least one foreign-born parent. This paper statistically describes the living conditions and socioeconomic environment of those children, by computing indicators according to the origin. It shows the huge diversity of situations regarding the socioeconomic position of parents and the social background. In particular, children from Western Europe and the United States live in highly skilled families whereas children from Portugal and the Balkans live in families with a very low level of qualification. Such results justify the formulation of integration and school policies that take into account the characteristics of each migration flow.

AB  - Public participation has been one of important problems in the strategic environmental assessment (SEA). In this paper, the origin and the present research-conditions of public participation in SEA were analyzed. And the necessity of public participation was illuminated from following three aspects: 1) the public participation in China's SEA is a key method of gaining the public support; 2) the public participation is one important source of gaining information; 3) the public participation is a good way to overcome the obstruction in the traditional mechanism of making strategy decision. Effective public participation should be involved in the whole process of SEA, and the public participators should include the public representatives of the groups affected by environmental change, the specialists in SEA and relevant fields, persons who are interested in the strategy and media, and so on. Various methods of public participation in SEA, including the methods of obtaining information and information feedback or consultation, were discussed. Further, the function, the advantages and the disadvantages of each method were discussed in detail, too.

AB  - This study investigated four inselberg landscapes in Namibia's arid Nama Karoo. Inselbergs of different size and geology were investigated (a) to determine environmental variables influencing the number of inselberg restricted plant species and (b) to investigate seed dispersal spectra as one parameter describing functional properties of inselberg specialists. With regard to the role of inselbergs in contributing to local and regional species richness, many species restricted to inselberg habitats occurred (up to 79 species recorded in this survey) and so contribute to local and regional species richness. As no species endemic to an inselberg were recorded in this study, inselberg specialists may provide an indicator for conservation value of these mountains. Elevation rather than surface area provided a measure for predicting the number of inselberg specialists. Besides elevation, underlying geology, and resulting landforms and edaphic conditions, as well as distance to potential mainland also influenced the number of inselberg specialists. Functional relationships between inselbergs based on seed dispersal spectra of inselberg specialists were not conclusive.

AB  - Four examples from Mediterranean Spain are used to show that records of non-pollen palynomorplis (algal and fungal spores and cysts, charophytes and other microfossils of unknown biological origin) are worthwhile in addition to pollen analysis for studies of palaeoecological reconstruction. In the lacustrine sequence of Canada de la Cruz, the stratigraphy of palaeolimnological indicators is compatible with climatic control of vegetation stages at the response scales of decades to centuries. The sequence of Navarres provides evidence of millennial-scale change in the trophic conditions of a peat-forming basin, which parallels local and vegetation changes since the last glacial to the Holocene under the influence of fire events, climate change and human activity. The sequence of Villaverde shows out-of-phase relationships of vegetational and limnologicai developments. The sequence of San Rafael offers an example of synchronous variation of xerophytic pollen and microfossils indicative of temporary marsh desiccation, in concordance with regional evidence of aridification since the mid-Holocene.

TI  - Quality indicators of the state of chemical pollution in Israel
T2  - ISRAEL JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
LA  - English
AB  - The state of chemical pollution in Israel is evaluated with the aid Of environmental indicators adapted from a list of indicators compiled by the European Union. The precise definition of the individual indicators was modified to suit the specific environmental conditions in Israel. The environmental topics covered are those that have a strong chemical aspect to them, including groundwater quality, pollution of rivers, air pollution by acidifying substances and particulate matter, CO2 emissions, disposal of hazardous waste and handling of hazardous substances, air pollution originating from transportation, wastewater treatment and reuse, and solid waste disposal, as well as the status of environmental research.
   The environmental indicators chosen reveal that in recent years there has been a steady improvement in the state of chemical pollution, excepting a deterioration in the quality of groundwater and an increase in vehicular emission of pollutants. The overall situation is, however, still unsatisfactory. A comparison of the state of chemical pollution in Israel to that in the EU and other countries demonstrated that the rate of improvement in environmental quality as determined by the examined indicators is slower in Israel than in most developed countries.

AB  - The leaching behaviour of cement-based products-both construction products and cement-stabilized wastes - have been shown to be similar after assessing the leaching characteristics by means of a pH dependence leaching test. This procedure is particularly suited to identifying the chemical speciation of materials. Geochemical modelling has shown a number of solubility controlling phases in this largely inorganic matrix, that can very well explain the observed leaching patterns as a function of pH. Understanding these relationships allows the prediction of leaching behaviour under other exposure conditions and to improve the ultimate quality of products, if so desired. The role of ettringite-type phases for the binding of oxyanions in the pH range above pH 12 has been identified before and confirmed in this work. The order of incorporation follows from the ratio between the maximum leachability at mildly alkaline pH and at high pH. Increased levels of sulfate negatively influence the binding of oxyanions in cement-stabilized waste through site competition. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCTS) with active hydroxyl and amino groups is easily modified for chelating and capturing heavy metal, thus showing great potential for application in heavy metal-contaminated wastewater treatment. In this work, a dual-functional MACA copolymer [CMCTS-graft-P(AM-TGA)] with pH resistant was successfully designed and prepared by grafting acrylamide and thioglycolic acid onto CMCTS through UV-initiated graft polymerization. The spectroscopy characterization of functional groups and apparent morphology confirm the successful preparation of MACA. Flocculation conditions for reaching high removal efficiencies and investigating chelation capacity are optimized. A multiobjective evaluation model and a triangular environmental impact, economic benefit, and energy consumption (3E) evaluation model were established and employed to assess the 3E performance of MACA in heavy metal-contaminated wastewater flocculation. Optimal operation modulus is identified using 8 Key performance indicators by 3E triangle model. This work enriches knowledge about flocculation and provides guidance for flocculation parameter control.

AB  - Although environmental innovation studies have traditionally focused on manufacturing firms, the distinctive features of eco-innovation activities carried out by service firms require special attention. Using the Spanish Commumity Innovation Survey (CIS), this paper determines which are the main drivers of undertaking eco-innovation and investigates the similarities and differences between service and manufacturing firms within the five sub-groups of services (supplier dominated, scale intensive physical networks, scale intensive information networks, science-based, and others). The results confirm that the main eco-innovation triggers are similar-technological push factor orientation (internal R&D and persistence) and firm size-while the impact of market pull factors and public environmental legislation differ within the services sub-groups. In addition, we find a high degree of heterogeneity within service firms. In contrast to traditional service firms, those in the groups involving R&D activities, information networks, and scale-intensive physical networks exhibit intensive eco-innovation performance and show a high level of green indicators.

AB  - Copper (Cu) is an essential metal capable to alter many metabolic and physiological processes in animal species, depending on the environmental concentration and salinity. The present study evaluated the effects of Cu exposure on the metabolism of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus under different osmotic situations. Crabs were acclimated at two different salinities conditions (30 and 2). Subsequently, they were exposed to Cu during 96 h at each salinity and under hypo-osmotic shock. Results demonstrated that Cu exposure increased whole-body oxygen consumption. In addition, the activity of LDH decreased while citrate synthase increased in anterior gills from animals submitted to hypo-osmotic shock. This scenario indicates extra stress caused by sudden environmental osmotic changes, as commonly observed in estuarine environments, when combined with copper exposure. Therefore, the activity of LDH and citrate synthase enzymes might be sensitive indicators for aquatic toxicology studies approaching Cu contamination in estuarine environments.

AB  - A peptide-oligonucleotide conjugate (1) was synthesized by the attachment of FAM, TAMRA, and biotin moieties to a telomere DNA sequence of 5'-TAG GGT TAG GGT TAG GGT TAG GG-3'. This conjugate was induced to be an anti-parallel structure in the presence of sodium ion (Na+), whereas a hybrid one was formed under potassium ion (K+) as a monitoring by circular dichromic spectra. The conformation change of this conjugate gave an effective FRET signal change upon the addition of NaCl, compared with the case of KCl. Under 5 mM KCl as an extracellular condition, a FRET change was observed upon addition of NaCl and quantitative FRET change was observed in 0 - 250 mM NaCl. This conjugate was immobilized on the cell surface through a sugar chain on the cell, biotinyl concanavallin A and streptavidin. This conjugate was utilized for Na+ sensing based on anti-parallel tetraplex formation with Na+.

AB  - Sustainable design of structures includes environmental and economic aspects; social aspects throughout the life cycle of the structure, however, are not always adequately assessed. This study evaluates the social contribution of a concrete bridge deck. The social performance of the different design alternatives is estimated taking into account the impacts derived from both the construction and the maintenance phases of the infrastructure under conditions of uncertainty. Uncertain inputs related to social context are treated through Beta-PERT distributions. Maintenance needs for the different materials are estimated by means of a reliability based durability evaluation. Results show that social impacts resulting from the service life of bridges are not to be neglected in sustainability assessments of such structures. Designs that minimize maintenance operations throughout the service life, such as using stainless steel rebars or silica fume containing concretes, are socially preferable to conventional designs. The results can complement economic and environmental sustainability assessments of bridge structures.

AB  - Sustainable agricultural intensification is needed to tackle food insecurity and global environmental change. Local environmental conditions determine the needs and potentials for increasing sustainability of agricultural practices. However, the potential for implementation also depends on socio-economic factors, as farmers need to adopt innovative farming practices, and consumer demand affects the economic feasibility. This study aims to map opportunities for sustainable intensification in Europe taking into account farmer characteristics, consumer behaviour, environmental pressures, and unexploited agronomic potentials. In areas identified as having high opportunities, we estimate the impacts of specific sustainable intensification measures on both intensification (in terms of calorie gains) and sustainability (in terms of resource savings). The study finds high spatial variation in opportunities for sustainable intensification across Europe. High opportunities for sustainable intensification are found on 34% of the arable area in Europe. In addition, the analysis shows that a combination of different measures can simultaneously improve food security and sustainability.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) and malaria remain leading causes of death in certain areas of the world system and directly contribute to persistent patterns in global inequality. I employ structural equation modeling for a sample of 135 nations to appropriately test for indirect and complex relationships among economic, social, and environmental indicators. The results demonstrate that economic dependency and environmental decline lead to increased urban slum populations in less developed nations, and that nations with larger urban slum populations have higher rates of TB and malaria. Important interrelationships also are evidenced among additional predictors, such as socio-health characteristics, economic development, and location in Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, this research demonstrates that current epidemiological patterns in TB and malaria prevalence have important sociological underpinnings. Public policy should be directed toward addressing the social causes of these diseases, including improved access to schooling, health care, and other basic resources, especially in urban areas characterized by slum conditions.

AB  - The ability of a genotype to control the stable development of a phenotype under different environmental conditions may explain the level of developmental instability. An indicator to developmental instability is Fluctuating Asymmetry. Traits under pressures of sexual selection exhibit greater values of asymmetry that others. These traits have more physiological requirements during morphogenesis and a more complex development. The aims of this work are to analyze asymmetry patterns of genitalic and somatic traits in the scorpion Bothriurus bonariensis (Bothriuridae) and to compare these values between central and peripheral populations of its distribution. We observed that types of asymmetry in genitalic traits differed in both populations. Also, traits of the hemispermatophores (two halves that constitute the spermatophore) showed the highest levels of fluctuating asymmetry, particularly in those characteristics with important role for insemination success. This work offers fundamental baseline knowledge for further works focused on asymmetry of genitalia and mating success in scorpions.

AB  - Aeromonas hydrophila is an aquatic bacterium responsible for several human illnesses. The aim of this work was to investigate the survival ability and virulence expression of two strains from different sources (fish, strain 87 and surface water, strain LS) maintained in a seawater microcosm. The strains were analyzed for the total and viable bacterial counts, adhesion ability to Hep-2 cells and aerA gene expression by qPCR throughout the experiment (35 days). Both strains reached a putative VBNC state and lost adhesive properties but exhibited a different behavior in the expression of aerA. This could be due to the different origin of the two strains; the former adapted to a habitat rich of nutrient and the latter already used to survive in a more hostile environment. Moreover, our results indicate that the quantitative determination of aerA mRNA can be a useful indicator of virulence expression under stress conditions.

AB  - A classical view of neural coding relies on temporal firing synchrony among functional groups of neurons, however, the underlying mechanism remains an enigma. Here we experimentally demonstrate a mechanism where time-lags among neuronal spiking leap from several tens of milliseconds to nearly zero-lag synchrony. It also allows sudden leaps out of synchrony, hence forming short epochs of synchrony. Our results are based on an experimental procedure where conditioned stimulations were enforced on circuits of neurons embedded within a large scale network of cortical cells in vitro and are corroborated by simulations of neuronal populations. The underlying biological mechanisms are the unavoidable increase of the neuronal response latency to ongoing stimulations and temporal or spatial summation required to generate evoked spikes. These sudden leaps in and out of synchrony may be accompanied by multiplications of the neuronal firing frequency, hence offering reliable information-bearing indicators which may bridge between the two principal neuronal coding paradigms.

AB  - Colonies of reef-building stony corals at 57 stations around St. Croix, US Virgin Islands were characterized by species, size and percentage of living tissue. Taxonomic. biological and physical indicators of coral condition were derived from these measurements and assessed for their response to gradients of human disturbance-a requirement for indicators used in regulatory assessments under authority of the Clean Water Act. At the most intensely disturbed location, five of eight primary indicators were highly correlated with distance from the source of disturbance: Coral taxa richness, average colony size, the coefficient of variation of colony size, total topographic coral surface area, and live coral surface area. An additional set of exploratory indicators related to rarity, reproductive and spawning mode and taxonomic identity were also screened. The primary indicators demonstrated sufficient precision to detect levels of change that would be applicable in a regional-scale regulatory program. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains is a growing problem and is an important concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policyrnakers as it results in poorer health and economic outcomes. This has led to an urgent global call for new antimicrobial drugs, particularly from natural resources. We have been studying the antimicrobial properties of the inner leaf gel component of Aloe barbadensis Miller and have used a number of different, simple in vitro assays to establish a scientific basis for the potential use of Aloe vera on a range of clinically relevant bacteria. The bacteria used include Shigella flexneri, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Enlerococcus bovis. In this paper, we compare standard methods recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) with a microtitre assay using a metabolic colour indicator Alamar blue TM. All the techniques described have shown that Aloe vera has an antimicrobial effect, however, the microtitre assay enables high throughput screening, under similar conditions and is less wasteful of plant material.

AB  - We investigated the long-term variability of the salps Thalia democratica and Salpafusiformis during the period 1974-1999 at a coastal site in the Bay of Villefranche-sur-mer. During this period T. democratica varied both interannually and seasonally, whereas S. fusiformis showed only seasonal fluctuations. Weeks in which T. democratica and S. fusiformis populations were developing in situ (i.e., near the sampling station without advection) are defined as the informative periods. Different species-specific optima of temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll a concentration, as well as stability conditions of the water column, were related to informative periods for the two Thalia and Salpa species. Long-term temperature oscillations were significantly related to the interannual maxima of T. democratica. The link between positive anomalies of temperature and outbreaks of T. democratica stress the importance of primary consumers as indicators of changes occurring in the marine system.

AB  - Urban atmospheres contain complex mixtures of air pollutants including mutagenic and carcinogenic Substances such as benzene, diesel soot, heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In the frame of a European network for the assessment of. quality by the use of bioindicator plants, the Tradescantia micronucleus (Trad-MCN) test was applied to examine the genotoxicity of urban air pollution. Cuttings of Tradescantia clone #4430 were exposed to ambient air at 65 monitoring sites in 10 conurbations employing a standardised methodology. The tests revealed an elevated genotoxic potential mainly at those urban sites which were exposed to severe car traffic emissions. This bioassay proved to be a Suitable tool to detect local 'hot spots' of mutagenic air pollution in urban areas. For its Use in routine monitoring programmes, however, further standardisation of cultivation and exposure techniques is recommended in order to reduce the variability of results due to varying environmental conditions.

AB  - Species indicator values, especially those defined by Ellenberg, have been used widely in applied plant ecology, forestry and agriculture. In spite of being criticised by many, there is a growing interest in using them also outside central Europe in order to analyse trends of change in the vegetation and their underlying environmental variables. Various aspects of indicator values are reviewed: their main features, the most important applications (notably the use of weighted site averages), problems and pitfalls of indicator analyses, the relationship between weighted site averages and measurements as well as their extension to other regions. Some aspects are illustrated using data sets of forest plots from S Sweden. Provided that the limitations of indicator values are recognised, these have a high reliability and can complement or, in some cases, replace measurements to determine the values of environmental variables and to monitor their change.

AB  - 1. The Llangorse crannog is an unique example of an Irish monument type constructed in Wales. The combination of artefact dating, dendrochronology and historical sources suggests it was constructed in the late 9th century by the king of Brycheiniog and destroyed in AD 916 by a Mercian army.
   2. Wave erosion, seasonal water level fluctuations, root growth, and tourist activity all pose a serious threat to the site where anaerobic conditions have preserved timbers, artefacts (including unique cloth finds and bone), and environmental indicators which are currently unique in Wales and of international historical importance.
   3. Only a small part of the site has been archaeologically investigated and management strategies to preserve the site without conflicting with other environmental interests are still under consideration.
   4. The archaeological investigation of Llangorse crannog has provided an opportunity to study the early medieval environment of the lake, including rates of erosion and colonization by vegetation of the island.
   5. The vulnerability of the crannog is discussed, and strategies for conservation reviewed. Copyright (C) 1999 National Museums and Galleries of Wales.

AB  - A survey of citrus tristeza virus (CTV) isolates was carried out in most citrus-growing areas in Spain. Twenty-two isolates were selected by geographical origin, cultivar of source tree, and symptoms observed on the host or in preliminary tests, and were biologically characterized.
   A wide range of variation in transmissibility by aphids and symptom intensity on nine different indicator species or scion rootstock combinations was observed among CTV isolates. Mexican lime, Citrus macrophylla, and to a lesser extent citron were the most useful hosts for characterizing these isolates, and leaf symptoms and stem pitting were the most discriminating traits. Positive correlation was observed between symptoms induced on Mexican lime and C. macrophylla, but not between the symptoms induced on these indicators under greenhouse conditions and the homologous symptoms on plants grown in the screenhouse. Some of the traits studied enabled us to establish relatively well-defined groups of isolates, but in most cases a continuous range of variation was obtained and no clear group could be defined.

AB  - To mitigate climate change due to international shipping, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires shipowners and ship technical managers to improve the energy efficiency of ships' operations. This paper studies how voyage planning and execution decisions affect energy efficiency and distinguishes between the commercial and nautical components of energy efficiency. Commercial decisions for voyage planning depend on dynamic market conditions and matter more for energy efficiency than nautical decisions do for voyage execution. The paper identifies the people involved in decision-making processes and advances the energy-efficiency literature by revealing the highly networked nature of agency for energy efficiency. The IMO's current energy efficiency regulations fail to distinguish between the commercial and nautical aspects of energy efficiency, which limits the ability to mitigate climate change through regulatory measures. Policymakers should expand their regulatory focus beyond shipowners and technical managers to cargo owners to improve energy efficiency and reduce maritime transport emissions.

AB  - The environments of poverty, marginalization, overcrowding, lack of resources and opportunities are influential factors in the behavior of individuals. The externalities, evaluated from the context and their influence on criminal behavior, are the object of study of the legal sciences. This research process leads the authors to determine dimensions and indicators in order to assess the effectiveness of the legal system, from sources manifested in material reality. Poverty is a contingent phenomenon, built on social inequality that affects the actions of the individual and that the law cannot ignore given its connotation and conditioning capacity and in particular because the phenomenon of poverty constitutes a fundamental factor in the criminal behavior of citizens. For this reason, the objective of this paper is to analyze the criminal behavior achieved in Quevedo, Ecuador, based on the use of spatial econometric techniques and the use of Neutrosophy, which are useful for the evaluation of the impact of the indicators of greater incidence on the criminal behavior achieved in the aforementioned region.
